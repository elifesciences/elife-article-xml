gamma-globin in sickle cell patients with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) and ameliorate the clinical severity. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, we tiled the highly homologous <italic>HBG</italic> proximal promoters using adenine and cytosine base editors that avoid the generation of large deletions and identified novel regulatory regions including a cluster at the –123 region. Base editing at –123 and –124 bp of <italic>HBG</italic> promoter induced fetal hemoglobin (HbF) to a higher level than disruption of well-known BCL11A binding site in erythroblasts derived from human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). We further demonstrated in vitro that the introduction of –123T &gt; C and –124T &gt; C HPFH-like mutations drives gamma-globin expression by creating a de novo binding site for KLF1. Overall, our findings shed light on so far unknown regulatory elements within the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter and identified additional targets for therapeutic upregulation of fetal hemoglobin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>base editing</kwd><kwd>globin regulation</kwd><kwd>HPFH mutations</kwd><kwd>beta-hemoglobinopathies</kwd><kwd>fetal

alpha-globin chains and two gamma-globin chains, which are highly expressed during the fetal stage of human life. The expression of HbF is silenced progressively after birth until it constitutes only about 1% of total hemoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer and Orkin, 2012</xref>). Naturally occurring mutations in the regulatory regions of the gamma-globin (<italic>HBG</italic>) genes have been shown to reactivate expression and increase HbF levels during adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob and Raper, 1958</xref>). This inherited genetic condition is benign and is known as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Individuals, who inherit HPFH alongside other genetic disorders affecting the adult beta-globin gene, such as sickle cell disease or beta-thalassemia, were shown to have fewer, if any, symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob and Raper, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thein, 2018</xref>).

These mutations either create de novo binding sites for erythroid activators or disrupt the binding sites of repressors, thereby increasing the expression of HbF. For example, the –175T &gt; C, –198T &gt; C and –113A &gt; G HPFH point mutations create de novo binding sites for the erythroid master regulators TAL1, KLF1, and GATA1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer and Nowock, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martyn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stoming et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wienert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wienert et al., 2015</xref>).

We also determined the number of HbF positive cells before and after erythroid differentiation using FACS. As expected, the percentage of HbF positive cells in differentiated erythroid cells was slightly higher than that of the undifferentiated edited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d</xref>). Further, we determined the effect of base editing on erythroid differentiation using flow cytometry analysis with CD235a and CD71 markers. The shift in expression of CD71 positive cells alone to CD71/CD235a double positive cells reflects the erythroid differentiation pattern of HUDEP-2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurita et al., 2013</xref>). The percentage of double positive cells was 83–90% for CBE and above 95% for ABE edited cells compared to the control, which was 77% and 97%, respectively, suggesting that the differentiation ability of the edited cells was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3j</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the level of globin chains was analyzed by using reverse-phase HPLC in differentiated erythroid cells from both ABE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref>) and CBE edited samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3i</xref>). We observed a significant induction of gamma-globin chain expression, which represented 10% to30% of total beta-like globin content in all the ABE edited samples (gRNAs -2, -3, -4, -10, -11, -15, -32, and -34) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). In the case of CBE, the gamma-globin chain levels were around 6% to45% of total beta-like globin content, among which gRNAs -2, -42, -10, and -11 showed significant elevation when compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). In both ABE and CBE edited cells, the increase in gamma-globin chains was consistently associated with a reciprocal reduction in beta-globin chains thereby maintaining the alpha to beta-like globin chain ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3i</xref>). Even though the <italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>HBG2</italic> promoters were base edited with equal efficiency, <italic>HBG1</italic> showed moderately higher expression levels compared to <italic>HBG2</italic> in most of the ABE and CBE edited cells. The decrease in <italic>HBG2</italic> expression in these samples might be due to biased HbF regulation or the 4.9 kb deletion that deletes the <italic>HBG2</italic> gene.</p><p>To find whether decrease in <italic>HBG2</italic> expression is due to the 4.9 kb deletion, gRNAs which showed significant reduction in <italic>HBG2</italic> over <italic>HBG1</italic> expression in ABE (gRNA-4, -10, -11, -15, -32, -34) and CBE (gRNA-2, -10, -11, -32, -34, -42) edited cells were further investigated by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, the frequency of 4.9 kb deletion in ABE ranged from 2% to 32% while in CBE it ranged from 0% to 12% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3k</xref>). To determine the correlation between the reduction in <italic>HBG2</italic> chain expression and the frequency of large deletion, Pearson correlation analysis was performed in the above-mentioned gRNAs in ABE and CBE edited cells. We observed a high correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.71) in the case of ABE, whereas much lower correlation was observed with CBE (<italic>r</italic> = 0.26) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3i</xref>). These data suggest that the reduction in G gamma chain expression is due to higher frequency of deletions in the ABE edited samples, while in the case of CBE, the decrease in the G gamma chain expression is independent of larger deletions and might be due to the biased expression of gamma-globin.</p><p>We observed a substantial difference in deletion rates across gRNAs as well as between base editors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3k</xref>). The difference in the DNA sequence composition which often affects the editing efficiency might also be responsible for varied deletion observed across the gRNAs targeting the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter. On the other hand, processivity of the editors could account for the difference in deletion observed with the same gRNA while editing with CBE and ABE. As the base editors cannot dock on an already edited strand, CBE with a higher rate of editing (~50% editing on day 1) is prevented from interacting again with the DNA, thus reducing the chances of deletion compared to ABE which takes longer to achieve similar editing (~50% editing on day 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>). This observation is further supported by the minimal deletion seen in samples edited with ABE8e which has a higher processivity (~90% editing within 24 hr) compared to both CBE and ABE 7.10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richter et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Next, we analyzed the level of hemoglobin tetramers in the differentiated cells by HPLC to determine whether increase in <italic>HBG</italic> chain expression resulted in functional HbF production. We observed a significant induction of HbF in all the top eight target gRNA transduced cells in ABE (gRNAs- 2, -3, -4, -10, -11, -15, -32, and -34), whereas only gRNA-2, -10, -11, and -42 expressed higher levels of HbF in CBE edited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–f</xref>). Consistent with globin chain analysis, we observed that the increase in HbF variant is associated with compensatory downregulation of adult hemoglobin levels in the edited cells. The relationship between the editing efficiency and HbF expression was analyzed for all the top-scoring gRNAs in ABE and CBE edited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). Among the validated top eight gRNAs in ABE and CBE, gRNA-2, -10, -11 with ABE and gRNA-2 with CBE resulted in a high target editing efficiency with a corresponding increase in HbF expression. In case of gRNA-42 with CBE, only a modest level of HbF elevation was achieved even with higher editing efficiency. On the other hand, gRNAs -3 and -4 with ABE and gRNAs -10 and -11 with CBE showed higher elevation of HbF levels despite lower base conversion efficiency. The higher number of HbF positive cells with minimal base editing might be due to heterogenous editing at target site per cell since there are two copies each of <italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>HBG2</italic>. Further, irrespective of editing at the target region, the binding of CRISPR-Cas9 complex through the gRNAs at the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter might disrupt the binding of major transcriptional repressor that are involved in globin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shariati et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Among the samples which resulted in higher HbF induction with lower editing efficiency, we validated gRNA-03 and -11 with a hyperactive variant of ABE (ABE8e) to determine whether further elevation in HbF level can be attained by increasing the editing efficiency. The HUDEP-2 cells stably expressing ABE8e were transduced with gRNA-03 and -11, with a VCN of 0.28% for the editor and 0.56% for the gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4e</xref>). We observed a high percentage of base substitution at the target site (more than 95%) with the corresponding increase in the HbF positive cells and gamma-globin chains in both the gRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a-c</xref>). The erythroid differentiation capacity of the edited cells was equivalent to that of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4b</xref>). The frequency of larger deletions was also significantly reduced perhaps because of the higher processive rate of ABE8e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4d</xref>). Thus, the ABE8e variant has improved the base editing efficiency at the target region and provided higher level of HbF induction with a reduced frequency of larger deletion.</p><p>Through this screen, we identified multiple novel individual regulatory regions and validated well-known HPFH mutations in the <italic>HBG</italic> proximal promoter that are important for gamma-globin regulation. Interestingly, gRNA-2 (with ABE or CBE) and gRNA-4 (with ABE) disrupt the binding site for the major gamma-globin repressors, BCL11A and LRF/ZBTB7A, and generate the binding motif for the transcriptional activators, GATA1 and KLF1, thus resulting in overall activation of <italic>HBG</italic> expression. Base editing of –114C &gt; T, –115C &gt; T and –116A &gt; G mutations disrupts the binding of BCL11A and the base conversion at –198T &gt; C and –199T &gt; C affect the binding of LRF/ZBTB7A to the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter. Further, the installation of –113A &gt; G and –198T &gt; C mutations by gRNA-2 and gRNA-4, generate a binding site for GATA1 and KLF-1, respectively. Moreover, the base conversion at −175T &gt; C by gRNA-3 (with ABE) creates a TAL1 binding site. The novel gamma-globin regulatory region identified includes the target base substitution mediated by gRNA-10, -11, -15, -21, -32, and -34 with ABE or CBE. With gRNAs -10 and -11, ABE converts nucleotide at –123T &gt; C and –124T &gt; C position, whereas CBE converts nucleotide at –122G &gt; A (on-target editing site) and –117G &gt; A (outside the editing window) positions. Target base substitutions at –123T &gt; C and –124T &gt; C positions result in greater induction of <italic>HBG</italic> expression, equivalent to that of the known HPFH mutations that disrupt the binding of BCL11A. Overall, the potential gRNAs include gRNA-2, 3-, -4, -10, and -11 with ABE and gRNA-2 with CBE that exhibit high induction of HbF expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Base editing of the –123 region of <italic>HBG</italic> promoter in human CD34+ HSPCs</title><p>To further determine the therapeutic potential of novel targets identified from this study on induction of gamma-globin expression, we performed base editing of CD34+ HSPCs from healthy donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Electroporation of the ABE8e mRNA with gRNA targeting the BCL11A binding site (gRNA-2) and –123 novel cluster (gRNA-11) effectively generated highly efficient base editing at the target site. The editing efficiency observed at individual base positions were –110 (31%), –112 (37%), –113 (80%), and –116 (66%) with gRNA-2 and –123 (89%), –124 (91%) with gRNA-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In case of gRNA-11, the base editing events generated a high proportion of –123 and –124 mutations in combination at the target site. We cultured the base edited CD34+ HSPCs under erythroid differentiation conditions and analyzed HbF expression. The relative levels of <italic>HBG</italic> expression were significantly higher in gRNA-11 (&gt;6-fold) and gRNA-2 (&gt;5-fold) edited samples when compared to control (AAVS1 edited sample) by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). In contrast, a significant downregulation of <italic>HBB</italic> and unchanged levels of <italic>HBA</italic> expression were observed in both the tested targets. Similarly, we observed a substantial increase in HbF protein expression in erythroblast derived from base edited CD34+ HSPCs. Flow cytometry and HPLC variant analysis confirmed the robust increase in the proportion of HbF positive cells and their HbF content compared with control samples for all the tested targets, with the higher effect in gRNA-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and g</xref>). The globin chain analysis showed an increase in expression of <italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>HBG2</italic> globin chain levels and a reduction of <italic>HBB</italic> globin chain level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Importantly, base editing of the <italic>HBG</italic> proximal promoter with gRNA-2 or -11 did not alter enucleation potential or the expression of erythroid maturation markers CD235a or CD71 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h–i</xref>). Finally, we determined the frequency of the 4.9 kb deletion in CD34+ HSPCs electroporated with ABE8e and gRNA-2 or -11. We observed a very minimal frequency of the 4.9 kb deletion which might be due to higher processivity and transient expression of the base editor mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The present results suggest that the level of HbF induction mediated by the installation of novel –123 cluster HPFH-like mutations (through gRNA-11) is comparable to the naturally occurring –115 cluster HPFH mutations (through gRNA-2) that disrupt the binding site of BCL11A. Together, our data demonstrate that adenine base editing of the <italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>HBG2</italic> promoters to recreate the novel –123 cluster HPFH-like mutations is a potential approach for the therapeutic induction of fetal globin level and treatment for beta-hemoglobinopathies.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Therapeutic induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in erythroblast derived from healthy donor CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) upon base editing of <italic>HBG</italic> promoter.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of steps involved in based editing of CD34+ HSPCs.

To obtain insights into the regulation of gamma-globin gene expression, we have used two complementary base editing approaches to screen the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter at single nucleotide resolution. This approach allowed us to identify several novel nucleotide substitutions in the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter that elevate HbF levels by altering the binding site for transcriptional activators or repressors.</p><p>Current approaches to studying fetal globin regulation by programmable nucleases often result in the deletion of the <italic>HBG2</italic> gene due to the introduction of DSBs in both <italic>HBG</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Traxler et al., 2016</xref>). The elimination of the 4.9 kb intergenic region (including the <italic>HBG2</italic> gene) appears to allow the locus control region (LCR) to directly interact with the <italic>HBG1</italic> promoter and drive its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Métais et al., 2019</xref>). It can be challenging to determine the exact role of different HPFH mutations on individual gamma-globin expression because mutations can occur in either or both <italic>HBG2</italic> and <italic>HBG1</italic> promoters. Further, the CRISPR-Cas9-based editing produces different combination of indel at the target sites which makes it difficult to pinpoint the precise mutations involved in the gene regulation. A base editing strategy converts target bases in the editing window without the generation of DSBs and hence largely avoids splicing of the <italic>HBG</italic> locus. Using this strategy, we targeted regions in both <italic>HBG1 and HBG2</italic> promoters and were able to efficiently edit sites in the promoters with fewer or no large deletions, which gave us the opportunity to evaluate gamma-globin expression from two active promoters.</p><p>We did observe a small percentage of 4.9 kb deletions even with base editors that use a nickase variant of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in our study. The larger deletions may be mainly a result of simultaneous CRISPR-Cas9-induced DSBs or by paired nickase-mediated two single-strand breaks (SSBs) on opposite DNA strands of the <italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>HBG2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ran et al., 2013a</xref>). Interestingly, recent studies have shown the possibility of adjacent SSB on the same DNA strand leading to the formation of genomic deletions in plants. The deletion frequency depends upon the initial release of the single-stranded fragment between the two SSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schiml et al., 2016</xref>). Further reports suggest the conversion of the persistent nick into DSBs by the replication fork. The R-loop primed replication fork encounters the single-strand nick site in DNA template and collapses to produce a DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuzminov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wimberly et al., 2013</xref>). Based on these findings, we predict the concurrent introduction of SSB by base editors at the editing site of the <italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>HBG2</italic> promoter might generate some 4.9 kb larger deletions, though we observed very few.</p><p>Several different HPFH point mutations have been reported in the <italic>HBG</italic> promoters; and the effect of these mutations on gamma-globin expression in the native cellular environment has been deciphered for this limited set of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer and Orkin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martyn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wienert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wienert et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings are in agreement with previous reports that the point mutations in three different regions of the <italic>HBG</italic> promoters centered around positions −198, –175, and −115 mimic the HPFH-associated point mutations affecting essential regulators of HbF expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martyn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martyn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stoming et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wienert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wienert et al., 2015</xref>). Among the known HPFH point mutations, base conversion within the –115 cluster (from –110 to –116) showed the highest increase in promoter activity, confirming previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fucharoen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zertal-Zidani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Motum et al., 1994</xref>). CBE-mediated base conversion (C- to- T) at positions –114 and –115 resulted in a significantly greater induction of HbF than the multiple A-to-G nucleotide substitutions at −110, –112, −113, and –116 positions made by ABE. Recently, it has been shown that the major HbF repressor BCL11A directly binds to the core TGACC motif located at – 114 to –118 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martyn et al., 2018</xref>). Naturally occurring HPFH mutations at –117G &gt; A, –114C &gt; A, –114C &gt; T, –114C &gt; G, and Δ13bp disrupts binding of BCL11A to the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martyn et al., 2018</xref>). The –113A &gt; G HPFH mutation within the –115 cluster creates a binding site for the master erythroid regulator GATA1 without disrupting the binding of BCL11A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martyn et al., 2019</xref>). Our results are consistent with these previous reports showing that disruption of the core binding region of BCL11A and the creation of a de novo binding sites for GATA1 results in the elevation of fetal globin in wild type HUDEP-2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wienert et al., 2017</xref>). ABE-mediated T-to-C substitution at position –198 of the <italic>HBG</italic> gene promoter has previously been shown to be associated with British HPFH and substantially elevates expression of HbF by creating a de novo binding site for the erythroid gene activator KLF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tate et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wienert et al., 2017</xref>). Another known HPFH mutation (–175T &gt; C) has been shown to promote enhancer looping to the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter through recruitment of the activator TAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wienert et al., 2015</xref>). Further, increased editing efficiency at the –175T &gt; C position with the hyperactive variants of ABE (ABE8e) resulted in the highest induction of HbF synthesis in human erythroid cells.</p><p>In this study, we have identified several new point mutations in the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter associated with high HbF levels. <italic>HBG</italic> promoter base editing by ABE-mediated conversion (A- to-G) revealed multiple potential HbF regulatory regions compared to CBE since the targeted region had more ABE-compatible gRNAs than CBE. In addition to the known mutations, we have identified novel substitutions at –69 (C -to- T), –70 (C- to- T), –122 (G -to -A), –123 (T -to- C), and –124 (T -to -C) of the <italic>HBG</italic> promoters as potential new regulatory mutations that can elevate gamma-globin expression. The levels of gamma-globin expression resulting from these mutations were very similar to those of well-characterized, naturally occurring HPFH mutations. Our study has predicted that nucleotide substitutions at –123T &gt; C and –124T &gt; C positions of the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter might result in reactivation of gamma-globin expression through the creation of a binding site for KLF-1, which was then confirmed by EMSA. This result, together with the observation that a de novo KLF1 site formed by the –198T-to-C mutation can upregulate fetal globin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tate et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wienert et al., 2017</xref>) raises the possibility that introduction of a KLF1 binding site anywhere around the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter could potentially upregulate <italic>HBG</italic> gene expression. In contrast to our finding in EMSA, we observed only a very weak signal for the binding of KLF1 at the edited site of the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter by ChIP. Thus, our hypothesis, primarily on the basis of observing in vitro binding of KLF1 in EMSAs, is that the –123 and –124 mutations create a new KLF1 binding site, that is relatively weak and difficult to detect using ChIP but other hypotheses are possible. For instance, it could create a binding site for another activator. The relative proximity of this site to the BCL11A site, that begins around –117, suggests it may also directly or indirectly affect BCL11A binding. Further work needs to be done to assess these possibilities.</p><p>The current screening approaches that we used to identify the regulatory element in the proximal promoter of <italic>HBG</italic> is limited by several technical issues. The availability of NGG PAM sequences in the target region confines the resolution of the screening approach. The editing efficiency for ABE7.10 RA or BE3RA-FNLS is not uniform across the target regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koblan et al., 2018</xref>). The effect of transverse mutation in the target region on gene regulation is not possible as the current base editors are mainly involved in the installation of transition mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaudelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Komor et al., 2016</xref>). The bystander mutation introduced by the base editors at the target regions makes it difficult to identify functional regulatory single nucleotides responsible for the gamma-globin regulation. These limitations can be overcome by the use of several different strategies including the use of alternative base editor variants that recognize the non-canonical PAM site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richter et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, recently developed hyperactive variant of base editors will improve the increasing editing efficiency at the target site with the broader editing window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richter et al., 2020</xref>). The scope of this study can be further increased by the dual ABE and CBE that can mediate both conversions (A-to-G and C-to-T) simultaneously, and also by prime editing approach which can widen the range of precise conversions in the desired region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anzalone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The translational potential of genome edited HSPCs depends on long-term engraftment and repopulation ability. However, genotoxicity and cytotoxicity that can arise as a result of DSBs generated by programmable nucleases can be a limiting factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cullot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). A previous study in nonhuman primates observed that the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter editing by Cas9 resulted in <italic>HBG2</italic> deletion with up to 27% frequency and that cells with this deletion were under-represented after engraftment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humbert et al., 2019</xref>). Base editing at the target sites of <italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>HBG2</italic> promoter by ABE and CBE does not result in high frequency of large deletions in the intergenic region as seen with Cas9 and only showed low levels of indel formation. ABEs have an inherent advantage over CBEs as they generate desired edits (A:T to G:C) with high fidelity, whereas the latter generate unanticipated edits. In corroboration with existing findings, our results also suggest that ABE is a better base editor than CBE with respect to purity of base conversion and indel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, preliminary results from our study suggest that the base editing of the HSPCs by ABE8e variant with the novel site (by gRNA-11) elevated HbF to therapeutic levels in erythroid progeny. Further, our study did not observe any significant DNA and RNA off-target in the ABE and CBE edited cells. Our proof of principle study validated the various gRNAs that can elevate the HbF levels to therapeutic levels laying the groundwork for potential clinical applications. This approach could address a range of beta-globin disorders avoiding the need to develop specific therapeutic products for each of them.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that CRISPR base editing can be utilized to drive the expression of HbF to therapeutically relevant levels in an erythroid progenitor cell line and in HSPCs. After screening every gRNAs within the 320 bp region of the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter, we identified nine gRNAs that, when paired with the appropriate base editor, can introduce HPFH-like mutations without the generation of indels.

Your article is being evaluated by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The main concerns are the extent and varied nature of the different technical aspects of the paper. Whether these can be addressed in a focused fashion within a reasonable time-period is the question at hand.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Disrupting transcriptional regulation of HBG to induce fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for sickle cell disease (SCD). To identify novel HBG regulatory elements, Ravi et al., utilized cytosine (CBE) and adenine (ABE) base editors to mutagenize the proximal <italic>HBG</italic> promoter region in HUDEP-2 immortalized human erythroid progenitor cells. The authors were able to achieve successful editing across a number of target sites with several inducing functional upregulation of HbF. Notably, for one ABE target the induction of HBG could be explained by the creation of a consensus binding site for KLF1, although the degree of induction was less than that achieved by disruption of a previously identified BCL11A binding site. These data highlight advantages of using base editors as a mutagenesis tool and extend our current understanding of <italic>HBG</italic> gene regulation which may have future therapeutic relevance in SCD.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Genetic mapping of key regulatory elements within the <italic>HGB</italic> promoter region has been conducted using nuclease-based mutagenesis but is limited by the imprecise repair outcomes of NHEJ and by frequent deletion of the region intervening the highly homologous sequences of the duplicated <italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>HBG2</italic> loci. The use of base editors is an elegant strategy to overcome these challenges.</p><p>Although nuclease-based indel induction can be readily used to disrupt regulatory elements, it is less useful for the introduction of novel transcription factor binding sites unless paired with inefficient homology directed repair approaches. The current study demonstrates a key advantage of base editing which is the ability to efficiently create transcription factor binding sites. This broadens the scope of functional alterations that can be introduced within gene regulatory elements.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating that base editors are a useful tool for regulatory element mapping, the current study sheds new light on the regulation of <italic>HBG</italic> expression by resolving five additional regulatory regions located within the <italic>HBG</italic> proximal promoter region that could have therapeutic relevance in SCD.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the paper successfully identifies five novel regulatory regions within the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter that when modified increase HbF expression, none of these edits induce HbF as effectively as disruption of the previously identified BCL11A binding site. Thus, from a translational standpoint the results do not appear to be a significant advance. However, the substantial variation in editing at each site may be limiting the magnitude of HbF induction.</p><p>Variable editing across target sites has been described for both CBE and ABE, so it's not unexpected that it was observed in the current study. However, without data showing the transduction efficiency of the sgRNA vectors (by GFP flow) it is difficult to conclude that the variation is solely a function of the target or target sequence context. At a few of the sites with low genetic editing there is a significant increase in HbF expression, suggesting that if the editing at these sites were improved the functional induction of HbF could be substantial.</p><p>The use of lentivirus delivered gRNAs would appear to be amenable to pooled screening, but in the current study the screen was conducted in an arrayed fashion. The ability to conduct a pooled screen could substantially expand the utility of this approach and it would have been very interesting to see how the results from a pooled and arrayed screen compared to one another.</p><p>Lastly, while the functional readouts in the current study are compelling and largely correlate with the editing, confirmation in a second system would further inspire confidence in the results. In particular, members of this team and others have carried out editing in primary human CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) followed by erythroid differentiation. Confirmation of the identified targets in primary cells with therapeutic relevance would inspire further confidence in the results.</p><p>– GFP flow data for the transduction efficiency of sgRNA vectors should be included. This is critical to confirm that the editing variability is due to target site and not transduction efficiency. It would also be helpful to confirm that none of the gRNA sequences contain premature termination sequences as well.</p><p>– The nature of the replicates are unclear. In figures 2 and 3 there are no error bars and in the figures with error bars it in not clear the definition of the biological replicates. Were these independent transductions of the cells, or repeat measures of the same transduced populations?</p><p>– In the functional validation experiments, were these independent transductions or use of the initial transduced populations? What were the sgRNA transduction rates in the populations used?</p><p>– Several previous editing strategies have been used to increase HbF. It would be informative if prior editing strategies were included in this study for comparison.</p><p>– Quantification of the EMSA in figure 6c should be included.</p><p>– Additional analysis to quantify and more clearly represent the correlation between genome editing and HBG (HbF) induction would be helpful for readers.</p><p>– Follow up validation of promising targets using transient transfection approaches would be informative as well.</p><p>– Despite low indels the frequency of deletion between <italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> by PCR should be measured and the gel included next to a nuclease control.</p><p>– ABE gRNA 03 gave low genetic editing rates but apparently higher HbF induction. it would be very interesting to see how this target behaved if targeted with recently published hyperactive (ABE8e etc) variants. If high editing were achieved it would seem this could be an attractive target for therapy.</p><p>– Additional analysis to quantify and more clearly represent the correlation between genome editing and HBG (HbF) induction would be helpful for readers.</p><p>– For promising targets, confirmation in primary CD34+ HSPC would increase the impact of the current study.</p><p>– The observation of editing outside the spacer window described as novel in line 188 has been previously observed: Webber et al., Nature Comm (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13007-6), Arbab et al., Cell (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867420306322). These studies should be cited and text changed to describe these results as confirmatory.</p><p>– Line 221 describing reduction of double positive cells in CBE treated cells. Since results are not significant this statement should be removed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, the Authors use base editors to generate mutations in the promoters of the genes encoding the γ-globin chains of the fetal hemoglobin in an adult erythroid cell line. Several of these mutations are associated with increased γ-globin gene expression, paving the way for the development of therapeutic strategies for β-hemoglobinopathy patients who have been shown to benefit from persistent expression fetal hemoglobin in adulthood. The major strengths of this work are: (i) the discovery of novel mutations associated with elevated feta hemoglobin levels; (ii) the impact of these discovery in the field of gene therapy for β-hemoglobinopathies.</p><p>The weakness of this study is the technical quality that can be improved to support the Authors' conclusions.</p><p>Remarks to the Authors:</p><p>– While many findings of this study are interesting, in the Results section it is not clear which are the specific questions. The results are a list of data that are partially interpreted only in the Discussion. I would suggest the Authors to better explain their findings in the Results section (e.g., comparison of different strategies disrupting repressor binding sites or recruiting transcriptional activators).</p><p>– It would be interesting to study if any of the mutations that do not increase HbF, down-regulate γ-globin expression (in cells that do express HbF) to identify binding sites for activators.</p><p>– The Authors should better characterize the cell lines expressing base editors. If I understood correctly, these cells are constitutively expressing the base editors (and the gRNAs). Some base editors are known to induce off-targets at DNA and RNA levels. This possibility should be investigated (at least the RNA off-targets) to verify that the major players in HbF regulation are properly expressed by performing a side-by-side comparison of cells expressing the base editors and untransduced cells. In addition, if base editors and gRNA are constitutively expressed, base editing efficiency can change overtime and should be evaluated in the same cells in which the Authors measure HbF expression.</p><p>– Evaluation of HbF+ cells (by flow cytometry) and globin mRNAs (by qRT-PCR) should be performed in differentiated cells, as HbF expression changes upon differentiation.</p><p>– The Authors should specify if control cells express the base editors and a control gRNA.</p><p>– The first screening of gRNAs is performed without replicates (Figure 2 and 3 and related supplementary figures). Furthermore, many of the gRNAs produce very few editing events, thus it is not possible rule out if the target regions are important for γ-globin expression. Therefore, I would exclude from the analysis the gRNAs associated with a low genome editing as these results are confounding and do not give insights in the regulation of γ-globin expression. Maybe Figure 2 and 3 (and related supplementary figures) could be kept as supplementary data.</p><p>– Line 178: the -117 mutation (occurring upstream of the gRNA target site) should be reported in Figure 4.</p><p>– Interestingly, the Authors observed that the -123/-124 mutations create a binding site for KLF1. However, most of the editing events generate only one of the 2 mutations (figure 4 suppl 2), would individual mutations be sufficient to generate a KLF1 binding site? Can this be tested by performing an EMSA assay with oligos harboring individual mutations? If individual mutations are not generating a KLF1 binding site, would the observed HbF reactivation be justified by the recruitment of KLF1 only to a minor fraction of the alleles harboring the concomitant editing of the 2 nucleotides?</p><p>Finally, can the Authors perform ChIP experiments to demonstrate the increase KLF1 recruitment upon editing of the -123/-124 region?</p><p>– Lines 311-314: &quot;CBE mediated base conversion (C to T) at positions – 114 and -115 resulted in significantly greater induction of HbF than the multiple A to G nucleotide substitutions at -110, -112, -113, -116 positions made by ABE.&quot; I believe that this or similar statements should be supported by the analysis of clonal populations harboring the same number of edited promoters.</p><p>– Figure 3-Suppl Figure 1: it would be helpful to plot HbF expression of the negative controls.</p><p>– SEM is missing in Figure 4-suppl Figure 1, panels A and C.</p><p>– Figure 5-Suppl Figure 1, panel d: why α and β chains are reduced in samples gRNA02 and gRNA 42?</p><p>– Figure 5-Suppl Figure 1: Can the Authors comment on the imbalanced Agamma/Ggamma ratio in sample gRNA 42? Could it be due to the potential deletion of the <italic>HBG2</italic> gene? Besides Indels, did the Authors measure the frequency of the 4.9kb deletions in base-edited samples?</p><p>– It would be interesting to perform experiments in primary cells to validate these interesting findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65421.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Disrupting transcriptional regulation of HBG to induce fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for sickle cell disease (SCD).

As the reviewer has rightly pointed out, one of the shortcomings in this study is to obtain equivalent editing efficiency in all the target regions and correlate the extent of editing with HbF levels. To overcome this problem, we have used ABE 8e (a variant with high processivity) to increase the editing efficiency of low editing gRNA with high HbF (Figure 3-Sup figure 4). Finally, we have evaluated a novel target site (gRNA 11) identified from this study with ABE 8e in healthy donor CD34+ HSPCs. As expected, we were able to obtain higher editing efficiency at the target site. Importantly, the corresponding increase in HbF levels was better than the current clinical trial target that disrupts the BCL11A binding site (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Variable editing across target sites has been described for both CBE and ABE, so it's not unexpected that it was observed in the current study.

We have now included the analysis of transduction efficiency for all the gRNAs as suggested by the reviewer. The data indicate that the variation in the HbF levels depends on the target site rather than the transduction efficiency (Figure 2 and Figure 3-Sup figure 1). Also, we have evaluated the low editing gRNA with high HbF using the ABE 8e variant, which significantly increased the editing efficiency and the HbF levels (Figure 3-Sup figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of lentivirus delivered gRNAs would appear to be amenable to pooled screening, but in the current study the screen was conducted in an arrayed fashion.

Previous work published by Kim et al., (Genome Res. 2018 Jun; 28(6): 859-868) showed that arrayed CRISPR based screen can be more sensitive than a pooled screen. Their group has pointed out that subtle phenotypic effects may not be observable in a pooled screen when compared to an array screen, as the samples in arrayed screens exhibit clear phenotypic variation even with minor editing. Another study (Raphaella W L So et al., Mol Neurodegener. 2019 Nov 14;14(1):41.) has reported that cells in a pooled culture can negatively affect other cells particularly when they undergo inflammatory response or senescence after editing, this is not the case in arrayed screen as the individual targets are separated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, while the functional readouts in the current study are compelling and largely correlate with the editing, confirmation in a second system would further inspire confidence in the results.

We also thank the reviewer for bringing the premature termination sequences to our attention.

We performed the first round of screening for the 41 gRNAs in two different base editor expressing HUDEP-2 cell lines (ABE and CBE) without replicates (data in Figure 2c and d).

We have compared the editing of previously identified BCL11A binding site with the Cas9 and two different base editors (CBE and ABE) in parallel to evaluate the fetal globin expression in HUDEP-2 cells. Indeed, we observed the higher frequency of large deletions (encompassing <italic>HBG2</italic> gene) with the lower level of G γ chain expression in Cas9 edited cells in comparison with ABE and CBE. These results further validate the conclusion that ABE and CBE are highly efficient in editing the highly homologous regions like γ globin promoter without causing any major deletions. We have added the new figure (Figure 1) and relevant descriptions based upon these results in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Quantification of the EMSA in figure 6c should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment.

We have now represented the correlation between genome editing and HbF induction more clearly using principal component analysis (PCA) in Figure 3i. Among the validated top eight gRNAs in ABE and CBE, gRNA- 2, 10, 11 with ABE and gRNA-2 with CBE resulted in a high target editing efficiency with a corresponding increase in HbF expression. In case of gRNA 42 with CBE, only a modest level of HbF elevation was achieved even with higher editing efficiency. On the other hand, gRNAs -3 and 4 with ABE and gRNAs -10 and 11 with CBE showed higher elevation of HbF levels despite lower base conversion efficiency. Overall, the potential gRNAs include gRNA-2, 3, 4, 10, and 11 with ABE and gRNA-2 with CBE that exhibit high induction of HbF expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Follow up validation of promising targets using transient transfection approaches would be informative as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. To this end, we have performed base editing of promising target regions in human CD34+ HSPCs by electroporation of ABE8e mRNA with gRNA-2 or gRNA-11 that targets the BCL11A binding motif at position −118 to −114 position and the putative KLF1 consensus motif at -123 and -124 position in the <italic>HBG1</italic>/<italic>HBG2</italic> gene promoters respectively. We cultured the base- edited CD34+ HSPCs under erythroid differentiation conditions and determined the effect of base editing on HbF expression, erythroid differentiation, and enucleation. We have now included the comprehensive analysis of the base editing healthy donor CD34+ HSPCs by transient transfection in the revised manuscript (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Despite low indels the frequency of deletion between <italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> by PCR should be measured and the gel included next to a nuclease control.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the thoughtful comment. As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have performed the 4.9kb deletion analysis in the edited samples by using qRT PCR as previously reported by André Lieber’s group (Chang Li et al., Blood. 2018 Jun 28;131(26): 2915-2928.). We have validated the 4.9kb large deletion frequency (encompassing <italic>HBG2</italic> gene) for ABE, CBE and Cas9 in HUDEP-2 cell lines targeting the BCL11A binding site at the highly homologous <italic>HBG</italic> promoter. The Cas9 edited cells resulted in higher frequency of 4.9 kb deletion as anticipated. Interestingly, we have observed the deletions in the base edited cells but significantly lower when compared to Cas9 (Figure 1c). To extend this finding, we measured the frequency of the larger deletion for the other potential target sites that resulted in lower level of <italic>HBG2</italic> chain expression (Figure 3-Sup figure 3e and k) and also in base edited CD34+ HSPCs cells (Figure 4c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– ABE gRNA 03 gave low genetic editing rates but apparently higher HbF induction. it would be very interesting to see how this target behaved if targeted with recently published hyperactive (ABE8e etc) variants. If high editing were achieved it would seem this could be an attractive target for therapy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have now evaluated the gRNA-3 which resulted in higher induction of HbF with low editing efficiency using the hyperactive variant ABE8e and subsequently analyzed for the further possible increase in HbF expression by increasing the editing efficiency in HUDEP-2 cells. The ABE8e variant has greatly increased the base editing efficiency at the target site and resulted in higher levels of HbF induction with reduced frequency of the larger deletion in comparison with ABE7.10 (Figure 3-Sup figure 4d). This result suggests that adenine base editing of the <italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>HBG2</italic> promoters to create the -175 T&gt;C change with ABE 8e is a potential strategy for the therapeutic induction of fetal globin level and treatment for sickle disease and β thalassemia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Additional analysis to quantify and more clearly represent the correlation between genome editing and HBG (HbF) induction would be helpful for readers.</p><p>– For promising targets, confirmation in primary CD34+ HSPC would increase the impact of the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the great suggestion. As detailed above in Response 1.7, we analyzed the therapeutic potential of novel targets (gRNA-11) identified from this study on induction of γ globin expression by base editing of CD34+ HSPCs from a healthy donor (Figure 4). Base editing of the -123 region of <italic>HBG</italic> promoter resulted in a therapeutic level of induction of HbF in erythroblasts derived from human CD34+ HSPCs, without having any detrimental effects on erythroid differentiation and enucleation. Notably, the level of HbF induction was more pronounced with the installation of novel -123 cluster HPFH like mutations than the creation of -115 cluster HPFH mutation which disrupts the BCL11A binding site. The results indicate that base editing at the -123 region of <italic>HBG</italic> promoter may offer a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of β-hemoglobinopathies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The observation of editing outside the spacer window described as novel in line 188 has been previously observed: Webber et al., Nature Comm (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13007-6), Arbab et al., Cell (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867420306322).

Several of these mutations are associated with increased γ-globin gene expression, paving the way for the development of therapeutic strategies for β-hemoglobinopathy patients who have been shown to benefit from persistent expression fetal hemoglobin in adulthood. The major strengths of this work are: (i) the discovery of novel mutations associated with elevated feta hemoglobin levels; (ii) the impact of these discovery in the field of gene therapy for β-hemoglobinopathies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting the importance of our study, as we also believe that it will advance the field of gene therapy for β-hemoglobinopathies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The weakness of this study is the technical quality that can be improved to support the Authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive comment.

The results are a list of data that are partially interpreted only in the Discussion. I would suggest the Authors to better explain their findings in the Results section (e.g., comparison of different strategies disrupting repressor binding sites or recruiting transcriptional activators).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the great suggestion. We agree entirely with the reviewer and acknowledge that in the first version of the manuscript we did not adequately interpret the results. Prompted by the comment of the reviewers we have reworked the current version of the manuscript in the Results section to include a detailed explanation of the findings and interpreted the results more clearly as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be interesting to study if any of the mutations that do not increase HbF, down-regulate γ-globin expression (in cells that do express HbF) to identify binding sites for activators.</p></disp-quote><p>It is a very interesting perspective that the reviewer has pointed out. To examine this observation, we have selected the gRNAs that have higher editing efficiency at the target site with the decreased expression of γ-globin from our preliminary screen. These gRNAs were screened in K562 cell line (which has higher basal level of HbF) with the base editors to identify the potential activator binding sites in the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter. The percentage of HbF positive cells remains unaltered after editing suggesting that the targeted regions did not have binding sites for transcriptional activators. This new data is now discussed in revised version the manuscript (Figure 2-Sup figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The Authors should better characterize the cell lines expressing base editors. If I understood correctly, these cells are constitutively expressing the base editors (and the gRNAs). Some base editors are known to induce off-targets at DNA and RNA levels. This possibility should be investigated (at least the RNA off-targets) to verify that the major players in HbF regulation are properly expressed by performing a side-by-side comparison of cells expressing the base editors and untransduced cells. In addition, if base editors and gRNA are constitutively expressed, base editing efficiency can change overtime and should be evaluated in the same cells in which the Authors measure HbF expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the excellent suggestion. We used the constitutively expressing base editor along with the gRNA for our experiments. We have now conducted the transcriptome profiling of base editor stable cell line (both ABE7.10 and BE3) and compared with the wild type HUDEP-2 cells. The data presented in the new figure (Figure 1-Sup figure 1 (b)) shows that the gene expression profiles are not altered and exhibit a significant correlation with the wild type HUDEP-2 cells. We have also characterized the base editor stable cell lines for the editing efficiency at different time points (in days) and its effect on HbF expression using the known gRNA-2 (targeting BCL11A binding site). The editing efficiency and HbF levels in both ABE and CBE increases over time with no discernible effect on erythroid differentiation (Figure 1-Sup figure 1 (c-h)). As the reviewers have suggested, we have also investigated the possible DNA and RNA off target effects and analyzed the expression of major molecular targets that are involved in HbF regulation in the base edited samples. Transcriptome wide RNA sequencing on ABE and CBE stables with gRNAs 2 or 11 confirms that the distribution frequency of A-to- I (in ABE) or C-to-U (in CBE) conversion across the base edited samples were very similar to that of the parental stable cell line (Figure 6b-e). The Cas-dependent DNA off target were also validated, we were not able to observe any significant undesired off target effects despite higher on target editing efficiency (Figure 6a). We performed the differential expression analysis for the 34 selected genes that are involved in globin regulation and observed no significant difference in base edited cells compared to the control (Figure 6-Sup figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Evaluation of HbF+ cells (by flow cytometry) and globin mRNAs (by qRT-PCR) should be performed in differentiated cells, as Hb expression changes upon differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We agree with the reviewer that HbF expression will change upon erythroid differentiation. As the reviewer suggested, we have determined the level of globin mRNA by qRT-PCR and HbF positive cells by flow cytometry for the top 8 targets in the ABE and CBE edited cells after erythroid differentiation (Figure 3c and d, Figure 3-Sup figure 3b and h ). The number of HbF positive cells in differentiated erythroid cells was slightly higher than that of the undifferentiated cells. The relative expression of γ globin in the erythroid differentiated samples followed a similar trend to that of the undifferentiated sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The Authors should specify if control cells express the base editors and a control gRNA.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. The control cells used in our study constitutively express the base editors and the control gRNA (with scrambled sequence) in HUDEP2 cells. In case of CD34+ HSPCs, we used the gRNA targeting the AAVS1 site (a safe harbour locus) along with base editor mRNA as a control. We have added the relevant information in the revised manuscript as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The first screening of gRNAs is performed without replicates (Figure 2 and 3 and related supplementary figures). Furthermore, many of the gRNAs produce very few editing events, thus it is not possible rule out if the target regions are important for γ-globin expression. Therefore, I would exclude from the analysis the gRNAs associated with a low genome editing as these results are confounding and do not give insights in the regulation of γ-globin expression. Maybe Figure 2 and 3 (and related supplementary figures) could be kept as supplementary data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We agree entirely with the reviewer that the target region of many of the low editing gRNAs might have a possible role in γ globin regulation. Therefore, we excluded the gRNAs-37,38,7,18,19 and 29 from ABE and gRNAs-1,35,37,6,7,13 and 19 from CBE from the analysis because of the lower editing efficiency (&lt;10%) at the target site. We have moved the figure 2 to the supplementary figures (Figure 2-Sup figure 1a and c) as suggested by the reviewer. Figure 3 was kept in main figure (as Figure 2) as it is to represent the level of HbF induction with the total editing efficiency for all the gRNAs from the primary screening.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 178: the -117 mutation (occurring upstream of the gRNA target site) should be reported in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion on including the base conversion events that occurred upstream of the protospacer target site. We have now represented all these mutations in the new figure (Figure 3-Sup figure1b) as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Interestingly, the Authors observed that the -123/-124 mutations create a binding site for KLF1. However, most of the editing events generate only one of the 2 mutations (figure 4 suppl 2), would individual mutations be sufficient to generate a KLF1 binding site? Can this be tested by performing an EMSA assay with oligos harboring individual mutations? If individual mutations are not generating a KLF1 binding site, would the observed HbF reactivation be justified by the recruitment of KLF1 only to a minor fraction of the alleles harboring the concomitant editing of the 2 nucleotides?</p><p>Finally, can the Authors perform ChIP experiments to demonstrate the increase KLF1 recruitment upon editing of the -123/-124 region?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the excellent suggestion. We have performed a new EMSA to determine the effect on KLF1 binding to a probe containing the individual and combination of -123/ -124 mutations along with the wild type probe. The results indicate that the combination of -123 T&gt;C and -124 T&gt;C mutation (but not with the -123 T&gt;C or -124 T&gt;C individual mutation) is required for the KLF1 binding to the <italic>HBG</italic> promoter in vitro (Figure 5c-d, Figure 5-Sup figure 1a and b). To substantiate this finding, we improved the editing efficiency at the target site with the hyperactive variant of ABE (ABE 8e) and gRNA-11 which results in the higher proportion of -123 T&gt;C and -124 T&gt;C combination mutations with substantial increase in HbF expression in the CD34+ HSPCs (&gt;90% base substitution at 123 T&gt;C and -124 T&gt;C position with &gt;90% HbF+ cells) (Figure 4b and e). The ChIP results were not conclusive. They did not show a significant enrichment of KLF-1 at the 123 T&gt;C and -124 T&gt;C mutated region of <italic>HBG</italic> promoter when compared to an arbitrarily chosen negative control (VEGFA) but did exhibit slightly better enrichment compared to the WT clones (Figure 5-Sup figure 1c). It should be noted that as seen in the EMSA the KLF1 binding is at best weak and may be below the level of detection by ChIP in these experiments. Future investigations would be required to confirm that KLF1 binding to this site is the main in vivo mechanism of -123 T&gt;C and -124 T&gt;C HPFH driven up-regulation of γ globin. We have worded our manuscript carefully to make this point clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 311-314: &quot;CBE mediated base conversion (C to T) at positions – 114 and -115 resulted in significantly greater induction of HbF than the multiple A to G nucleotide substitutions at -110, -112, -113, -116 positions made by ABE.&quot; I believe that this or similar statements should be supported by the analysis of clonal populations harboring the same number of edited promoters.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully suggest that the effect of individual mutations at the -115 clusters of <italic>HBG</italic> promoter on γ globin regulation are extensively characterized by previous publications (Martyn et al., Nature genetics 2018., Liu N et al., Cell 2018). Further, we believe that the change in HbF induction by ABE and CBE are mainly due to the variation in the binding affinity of BCL11A towards the mutated core TGACCA motif. The previous publication by Yang et al., (Cell Research (2019) 29:960– 963) proves that the nucleotides at -114 and -115 positions are very important for BCL11A binding when compared to other nucleotides at the -115 region of <italic>HBG</italic> promoter, which is highly consistent with our observations of CBE mediated base conversion at – 114 and -115 position.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3-Suppl Figure 1: it would be helpful to plot HbF expression of the negative controls.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment.

We believe based on the previous report that the higher induction of γ globin chain is shown to downregulate β globin chain expression thereby maintaining the α to β-like globin chain ratio (Huang P et al., Genes Dev. 2017). They have indicated that in fetal stages/HPFH condition, the LCR directly interacts with γ globin promoter for its regulation. Therefore, the LCR will not be able to access β globin promoter which results in reduced expression of β globin chain. In case of α globin, we are not entirely sure about the mechanism, but previous reports have shown that induction of HbF using inducers have down regulated α globin chain expression (Khamphikham P et al., Br J Haematol 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5-Suppl Figure 1: Can the Authors comment on the imbalanced Agamma/Ggamma ratio in sample gRNA 42? Could it be due to the potential deletion of the HBG2 gene? Besides Indels, did the Authors measure the frequency of the 4.9kb deletions in base-edited samples?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up an excellent point. We are not entirely sure about the reason for variation in A γ and G γ expression in gRNA 42. As reviewers suggested, we have now performed the qRT-PCR analysis on CBE stables cells transduced with gRNA-42 to ensure that the difference in γ chain expression is due to 4.9kb large deletion. We did not observe the large deletion in gRNA 42 edited cells (Figure 3-Sup figure 3k). Thus, the decrease in G γ chain expression is independent of the large deletion and might be due to the biased expression of the γ globin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be interesting to perform experiments in primary cells to validate these interesting findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the great suggestion.
