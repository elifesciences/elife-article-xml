Since puromycin is covalently incorporated into nascent polypeptide chains, anti-puromycin immunofluorescence enables visualization of nascent protein synthesis. A common assumption in studies of local messenger RNA translation is that the anti-puromycin staining of puromycylated nascent polypeptides in fixed cells accurately reports on their original site of translation, particularly when ribosomes are stalled with elongation inhibitors prior to puromycin treatment. However, when we attempted to implement a proximity ligation assay to detect ribosome-puromycin complexes, we found no evidence to support this assumption. We further demonstrated, using biochemical assays and live cell imaging of nascent polypeptides in mammalian cells, that puromycylated nascent polypeptides rapidly dissociate from ribosomes even in the presence of elongation inhibitors. Our results suggest that attempts to define precise subcellular translation sites using anti-puromycin immunostaining may be confounded by release of puromycylated nascent polypeptide chains prior to fixation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>puromycin</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>local translation</kwd><kwd>proximity ligation assay</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R33CA202827</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>Peter A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30 DA047775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hobson</surname><given-names>Benjamin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Although puromycin staining is often used to examine subcellular translation, puromycin-labeled proteins are rapidly released from ribosomes even in the presence of elongation inhibitors, which may confound translation site localization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Subcellular localization of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation enables dynamic, rapid regulation of protein synthesis in a wide range of biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buxbaum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin and Ephrussi, 2009</xref>). The number of localized mRNAs is much greater than originally appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lécuyer et al., 2007</xref>), and the study of subcellular translation sites is now an area of active research across multiple organisms and cell types. A powerful, widely used technique to study protein synthesis involves the incorporation of puromycin into nascent polypeptide chains (NPC) of translating ribosomes. As an amino-acyl transfer RNA (tRNA) analog, puromycin enters the ribosomal aminoacyl-tRNA binding site (A site) and is covalently coupled to the carboxyl-activated NPC at the ribosomal peptidyl-tRNA binding site (P site) that is adjacent to the A site within the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center (PTC), terminating protein synthesis and ejecting a C-terminal puromycylated NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nathans, 1964</xref>). This reaction was first exploited to label nascent polypeptides with fluorescent puromycin analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nemoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Starck et al., 2004</xref>), and became widely used both in vitro and in vivo following the development of anti-puromycin antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>) and ‘click’-chemistry-compatible puromycin analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite technical advances, using puromycin labeling to visualize the subcellular distribution of nascent protein synthesis in specific cell types within complex tissues remains challenging. This is particularly true for polarized cells such as neurons, where levels of protein synthesis in dendrites and axons are relatively low compared to neighboring neuronal and glial cell bodies. Although large nerve terminals may be readily visualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scarnati et al., 2018</xref>) and expansion microscopy can provide higher resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hafner et al., 2019</xref>), diffusion or trafficking of puromycylated NPCs prior to chemical fixation may confound attempts to determine the original translation site. To combat this problem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref> introduced the ribopuromycylation (RPM) assay and used it to argue in favor of active protein synthesis within the nucleus. The premise of the RPM assay is that pretreatment of cells with elongation inhibitors, such as emetine or cycloheximide, prevents release of puromycylated nascent chains from translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastide et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref>). These studies assert that anti-puromycin immunostaining of labeled nascent chains in fixed cells occurs in situ on elongation-stalled ribosomes bound to mRNA.</p><p>We sought to develop a puromycin labeling assay based on RPM that would simultaneously provide cell type-specificity and preserve the ribosomal localization of the anti-puromycin signal. In the course of our studies, we found that elongation inhibitors do not prevent the release of puromycylated NPCs from ribosomes. Furthermore, structural modeling revealed that antibodies are unlikely to be able to directly contact and recognize puromycin within the PTC of intact ribosomes due to steric hindrance. Together, these results suggest that anti-puromycin immunostaining occurs only on puromycylated nascent chains released from ribosomes. Our results have important implications for the study of local translation sites using puromycin labeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Implementation of a cell type-specific ribopuromycylation proximity ligation assay</title><p>To develop a cell type-specific assay for visualization of local translation sites, we envisioned combining the ‘RiboTag’ system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sanz et al., 2009</xref>) of Cre-dependent HA-tagged Rpl22 (eukaryotic ribosomal protein L22, hereafter referred to as eL22-HA) with the RPM assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Such complexes could be visualized by the proximity ligation assay (PLA), which requires two targets to be within &lt;40 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Söderberg et al., 2006</xref>). Because the HA tag on eL22-HA is on the C-terminus, intramolecular eL22-HA/Puro PLA from nascent eL22 peptides is unlikely to contribute significant signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">tom Dieck et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PLA targeting eL22-HA and puromycylated nascent chains produces translation- and antigen-dependent signal, but does not distinguish between emetine-stalled and untreated ribosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting the ribopuromycylation assay as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref>.

After pretreatment with emetine and brief puromycin labeling, we fixed cells and analyzed anti-puromycin immunofluorescence (IF) and eL22-HA/Puro PLA in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> for summary statistics and testing). Similar to anti-puromycin IF, the eL22-HA/Puro PLA produced a robust fluorescent signal in RiboTag glioma cells treated with puromycin, which was blocked by pretreatment with anisomycin, an antibiotic that binds to the A-site ‘cleft’ and competitively inhibits puromycin incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pestka et al., 1972</xref>). We verified that the eL22-HA/Puro PLA signal was specific to the presence of both antibodies by omitting either the anti-puromycin or the anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> for statistics) We further tested the cell-type specificity of the eL22-HA/Puro PLA using human U87 glioma cells, which do not express eL22-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As expected, these cells exhibit minimal eL22-HA/Puro PLA signal despite robust anti-puro IF labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also utilized high-resolution confocal imaging to visualize eL22-HA/Puro PLA puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Quantification of eL22-HA/Puro PLA puncta per cell revealed ~200 puncta per cell, while omission of either puromycin or HA antibodies reduced this to &lt;8 puncta per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, the eL22-HA/Puro PLA accurately reports on the presence of puromycin in labeling controls (omission of puromycin/anisomycin pretreatment) and meets the standard specificity criteria of PLA (lack of signal with omission of either primary antibody or antigen).</p><p>Previous imaging studies have demonstrated that in the absence of elongation inhibitors, puromycylated NPCs dissociate from ribosomes in minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morisaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yan et al., 2016</xref>, see also below). Therefore, we expected that cells receiving no pretreatment would produce significantly less eL22-HA/Puro PLA signal compared to cells pretreated with emetine, which should prevent release of puromycylated nascent chains according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref>. However, emetine pretreatment produced a minor, but statistically significant, <italic>decrease</italic> in the eL22-HA/Puro PLA signal relative to the corresponding anti-puromycin IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and relative to eL22-HA/Puro PLA signal from cells receiving no pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This effect of emetine was specific to eL22-HA/Puro PLA, as emetine pretreatment did not significantly alter anti-puromycin IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Surprised by these results, we conducted the eL22-HA/Puro PLA following puromycin washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We reasoned that after a short pulse of puromycin and an extended washout period, puromycylated NPCs would completely dissociate from ribosomes. After up to 45 min of washout, the eL22-HA/Puro PLA still produced intense signal comparable to anti-puromycin IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We conducted a similar experiment using harringtonine runoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Since the small-molecule drug harringtonine stalls newly initiating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fresno et al., 1977</xref>), extended incubation in harringtonine eliminates the presence of NPCs once elongating ribosomes are runoff. We first confirmed that harringtonine runoff removed NPCs available for puromycylation by conducting the harringtonine runoff <italic>before</italic> puromycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, conducting harringtonine runoff <italic>after</italic> puromycin treatment and washout still produced robust eL22-HA/Puro PLA signal that was only slightly reduced relative the corresponding anti-puromycin IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that while the eL22-HA/Puro PLA is specific for the presence of antigen and antibody, it reports primarily on the cytoplasmic abundance of puromycylated NPCs, regardless of whether they are currently bound to ribosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Instability of puromycylated NPC-ribosome complexes</title><p>The results of our eL22-HA/Puro PLA were somewhat surprising, since PLA is generally assumed to produce signals based only on specific proximity (i.e. antigen-antigen interaction) given the distance requirement of &lt;40 nm. However, recent evidence suggests that PLA signals can be generated by a variety of non-interacting antigen pairs, provided they have overlapping spatial distributions and are present at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsemarz et al., 2018</xref>). Such a model of ‘non-specific proximity’ seemed to fit our PLA data, but was inconsistent with the claims of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref> that puromycylated NPCs remain tethered to ribosomes pretreated with elongation inhibitors. Cycloheximide binds to the ribosomal large, 60S, subunit in the tRNA ‘exit’ site (E site), stalling elongation by preventing exit of the deacylated E-site tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schneider-Poetsch et al., 2010</xref>). Emetine acts similarly to pactamycin, binding the ribosomal small, 40S, subunit in the E site and preventing translocation of the tRNA-mRNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). However, we are unaware of any evidence that translocation is required for puromycin to exit the ribosome after covalently reacting with the NPC. In fact, previous imaging studies demonstrated that puromycylated NPCs are released from ribosomes in the presence of cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). To resolve the discrepancy between these findings and the claims of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref>, we sought biochemical evidence that elongation-inhibited ribosomes and puromycylated NPCs are stable biochemical complexes. We conducted sucrose gradient fractionation of polysomes from RiboTag glioma cells pretreated with emetine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) prior to puromycin treatment.

We pretreated cells with emetine or cycloheximide prior to the onset of imaging, and then added puromycin 60 s into each 8 min imaging trial. We observed complete loss of SunTag puncta in all puromycin-treated cells within this timeframe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), with minimal loss of SunTag puncta in untreated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and negligible photobleaching in all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), we found that cycloheximide pretreatment slowed, but did not prevent, the disappearance of SunTag puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We note that our assay cannot distinguish between the rate of puromycin binding to nascent chains and the rate of their release from ribosomes. A previous report on cycloheximide-pretreated polysome lysates found that 50% of nascent peptides were released in a 30 s exposure to puromycin, while complete release was observed with a 5 min exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colombo et al., 1965</xref>). The same 30 s puromycin exposure caused complete release of nascent chains from untreated polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colombo et al., 1965</xref>), suggesting that cycloheximide slows the rate of puromycin binding to ribosomes and/or to nascent chains. These observations are consistent with our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and with recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016</xref>, who proposed that the conformation of the ribosomal pre-translocation complex that is stabilized by cycloheximide causes crowding of the A site and slows the ability of puromycin to covalently react with the NPC. Although we cannot exclude that cycloheximide also slows the release kinetics of NPCs once they have been transferred to puromycin, we found no evidence that elongation is required for the release process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to cycloheximide, emetine pretreatment enhanced the initial puromycin-induced release kinetics compared to puromycin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Although emetine pretreatment eliminated the apparent lag phase seen in cells treated with puromycin or cycloheximide-puromycin, it slightly slowed the overall decay rate compared to puromycin alone. Emetine pretreated cells lost one-third of SunTag puncta significantly faster than those treated with puromycin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, Welch’s t-test for time at 66.6% remaining: <italic>t</italic>(5) = 3.932, p=0.0271), but the effect was smaller for half-life (Welch’s t-test for time at 50% remaining: <italic>t</italic>(5) = 3.183, p=0.0294) and was no longer significant when two-thirds of puncta were lost (Welch’s t-test for time at 33.3% remaining: <italic>t</italic>(5) = 0.967, p=0.3996). Although the mechanisms underlying these kinetic differences remain unknown, it is possible that emetine-bound ribosomes have either a higher affinity for puromycin and/or an enhanced reaction efficiency upon binding. Such a model is consistent with previous work describing enhanced puromycin incorporation in the presence of emetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref>), particularly at low temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">David et al., 2013</xref>).

For puromycylated NPCs to truly remain ‘tethered’ to ribosomes, the puromycin would have to be localized in either the PTC or in the proximity of the nascent polypeptide exit tunnel. Despite the rapid kinetics of puromycylated NPC release, it is conceivable that a few puromycin-terminated NPCs might become chemically fixed inside ribosomes. We therefore conducted structural modeling to assess whether it is feasible that an anti-puromycin IgG molecule could directly contact and recognize puromycin within an intact 80S ribosomal complex. It is inconceivable that the antigen binding fragment (Fab) of an immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecule could access puromycin within the narrow, constricted geometry of the exit tunnel, so we focused our structural modeling on the PTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

We analyzed the steric clashes resulting from twelve distinct Fab positions within the A site (see Materials and methods) using MolProbity to analyze ribosomal and tRNA residues located within a 12 Å radius of the Fab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Williams et al., 2018</xref>).

All of these MolProbity Clashscores were in the 0<sup>th</sup> percentile of all structures solved by cryo-EM to any resolution in the Protein Data Bank, that is there were no cryo-EM structures solved to any resolution with worse Clashscores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

Next, we attempted to model the Fab fragment so it was positioned as close as possible to puromycin within the A site of the 80S ribosomal complex but in such a manner so as to minimize steric clashes. This model generated a MolProbity score of 22.89, representing the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of all cryo-EM structures solved to any resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Most strikingly, for this ‘best’ fit scenario, the Fab is positioned 29.1 Å away from puromycin, well outside the distance that would be required for the antigen binding site of the Fab to directly contact puromycin via non-covalent interactions. Thus, the numerous steric clashes between the Fab and the A site of the ribosome would preclude positioning of the antigen recognition site close enough to recognize puromycin within the PTC of intact ribosomal complexes.</p><p>It is worth noting that our modeling was conducted using a stalled 80S ribosomal complex in which the ribosomal subunits are in their ‘non-rotated’ conformational state and the P-site tRNA is in its ‘classical’ configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandrasekaran et al., 2019</xref>). Although the non-rotated/classical conformation is likely favored in ribosomal complexes stalled by cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Budkevich et al., 2011</xref>) and emetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiménez et al., 1977</xref>), it is conceivable that a minor sub-population of ribosomal complexes becomes chemically fixed in the so-called ‘rotated’ conformational state in which the tRNAs occupy their ‘hybrid’ configurations. In this case, the relative rotation of the subunits dramatically narrows the aperture of the A site, making it even less likely that the IgG Fab could access the PTC. Overall, these results suggest that anti-puromycin antibodies are unlikely to access the interior of intact ribosomes during immunostaining.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although we successfully visualized puromycin labeling in RiboTag glioma cells, the most appealing applications of the eL22-HA/Puro PLA were based on the premise that each translating ribosome could be visualized with its NPC in situ. Unfortunately, we found no evidence to support the RPM model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref>. Our results have important implications for the study of subcellular translation sites using puromycin labeling, since the RPM model is often cited as evidence that puromycylated NPCs cannot move away from translation sites in the presence of elongation inhibitors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moissoglu et al., 2019</xref>). The first major problem with the RPM model is the kinetics of puromycylated NPC release. We found that the half-life of puromycylated NPC-ribosome complexes is less than 40 s when cells are pretreated with emetine, and extended by only ~2 min with cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Although the precise mechanisms underlying these kinetic differences are unknown, our results strongly suggest that once the carboxyl-activated NPC is coupled with puromycin, no further translocation or dissociation of the 80S complex is required for puromycylated NPC release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We suspect that puromycin is small enough to simply bypass the P site tRNA and proceed directly from the PTC through the exit tunnel. Critically, all SunTag puncta were undetectable at ~5 min after puromycin in all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Even with short incubations at lower puromycin concentrations, labeled NPCs would continue to be released during washing and fixation. Furthermore, complete cytoplasmic fixation can take longer than 15 min at room temperature when using conventional 4% paraformaldehyde to fix monolayer cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huebinger et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the vast majority of puromycylated NPCs are not crosslinked to their ribosomal origin during chemical fixation. The second major problem with the RPM model is that antibodies are unlikely to directly contact and recognize puromycin within the PTC of fixed, intact ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, even if a small sub-population of puromycin molecules are retained in the PTC after chemical fixation, our structural modeling suggests that these puromycin molecules would be inaccessible during immunostaining.</p><p>Based on the kinetics of puromycylated NPC dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and inaccessibility of intra-ribosomal puromycin to antibody binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), there should be no general expectation that anti-puromycin immunostaining accurately reports on the original ribosomal translation site. However, our results do not preclude the possibility that released puromycylated NPCs are bound by neighboring proteins, organelles, and/or ribonucleoprotein complexes immediately adjacent to their translation site. Such nascent polypeptide binding complexes would include canonical targeting motifs such as the signal recognition particle, cytoplasmic chaperones (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hansen et al., 1994</xref>), and neuron-specific RNA granules (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graber et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, puromycin-resistant SunTag puncta have been observed in dendrites, and these puncta are thought to contain stalled polyribosomes and NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Langille et al., 2019</xref>). Given that emetine does not impede puromycylated NPC release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), it is not surprising that the labeling of these complexes by anti-puromycin IF did not require emetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Langille et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, the persistence of puromycin at these sites must require context-specific binding of NPCs within these ribonucleoprotein complexes. Since anti-puromycin IF is unlikely to occur within the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), it is likely that these nascent polypeptide interactions occur outside of the ribosome.</p><p>Given the implausibility of a true ‘RPM-PLA’ as we had envisioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the results of our eL22-HA/Puro PLA also contribute to growing concerns that PLA can produce false positive signals when both antigens are highly abundant and have overlapping subcellular distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsemarz et al., 2018</xref>). This issue of ‘non-specific proximity’ may broadly affect puromycin-based PLAs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">tom Dieck et al., 2015</xref>), as was the case in our study. Ribosomes are the most abundant macromolecular machine in the cell, with typical cultured cells estimated to harbor at least 1 million ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wada et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, even a brief treatment with puromycin will produce an immense number of puromycylated NPCs per cell. Viewed through this lens, it is not surprising that our eL22-HA/Puro PLA could produce ~200 puncta per cell based solely on non-specific proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, it should be noted that our assay is an outlier in this regard, as both antigens are extremely abundant and broadly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The use of direct-conjugated primary antibody PLA probes would be expected to reduce the frequency of false positives. We remain optimistic that development of new technologies for imaging subcellular translation sites in specific cell-types will accelerate studies of local translation in complex tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The murine RiboTag glioma line expressing eL22-HA was a gift from the laboratory of Dr. Peter Canoll and has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Montgomery et al., 2019</xref>).

article, &quot;Elongation Inhibitors do not Prevent the Release of Puromycylated Nascent Polypeptide Chains from Ribosomes&quot;, has been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The manuscript details the reasons and mechanism why detection of puromycin cannot be used as a tracer for translational activity, even in the presence of elongation inhibitors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors of this, and the co-submitted manuscript investigated the assumption that puromycin is a spatial indicator of translating ribosomes. This assumption is based on the puromycylation of nascent chains remaining associated with the ribosome on the mRNA, in effect freezing in its position there. When detected by antibodies to the puromycin derivative, the signal supposedly indicated the sites of translation. In this particular manuscript, the authors attempted to use this in combination with a proximity ligation assay to determine the components at the stalled translation site. Being unable to reproduce the expected result of biotinylated translation components, but only finding labeled nascent chains they reviewed their assumptions and discovered the source of the discrepancy.</p><p>The work presented here convincingly shows that the signal comes from released nascent chains, truncated by the puromycylation. For instance, in a staightforward experiment using the suntag system, the presence of labeled nascent chains did not include the signal when the tagged puromycin was used, but rather only after they were released from the ribosome indicating that they immediately terminated upon incorporating the puromycin, even in the presence of elongation inhibitors. They further modeled the ability of an antibody to access the puromycylated peptide in the ribosome and found it would not have been detectable given the steric clash.</p><p>The work is of significance particularly since a number of high impact publications have relied on the signal indicating the location of ongoing translation. Conclusions that derive from that assumption have to be re-evaluated, since some of them are clearly wrong (eg translation in the nucleus) and other, particularly in neurons, misleading. I feel it is important to publish this work before more erroneous conclusions contaminate the literature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study the authors show convincingly that translation elongation inhibitors do not prevent the release of puromycylated nascent chains. These findings impact the assay to assess the intracellular site of translation based on the localization of puromycin conjugated polypeptides, as previous studies had suggested that such puromycin conjugated polypeptides are still bound to the ribosome on which they were made, and thus represent the site of translation.</p><p>Overall, this study presents a very comprehensive and convincing set of data that show that, in fact, that localization of puromycin-conjugated polypeptides generally does not represent the site of synthesis, but rather, these polypeptides have released from the ribosome and have diffused away from their site of synthesis. I agree with the authors that this is an important point to make that will benefit the field.</p><p>My only issue with this study is that the main point, that translation inhibitors do not prevent release of polypeptides from the ribosome in the presence of translation inhibitors, has already been demonstrated convincingly previously, for example in Wang et al., 2016, which is also cited by the authors. The current studies certainly goes beyond this (and other) previous studies; first, the current study presents many additional types of analysis confirming this point, including elegant structural analysis of the ribosom. But perhaps more importantly, previous studies (e.g. Wang et al., 2016) have not specifically emphasized the relevance of these findings for assays using puromycin localization as a proxy for the site of translation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Hobson et al. provide strong evidence to question conclusions on local translation from experiments done with the ribopuromycylation assay (RPM). Using biochemistry and single-molecule imaging approaches , they demonstrate that translation elongation inhibitors (emetine and cycloheximide) do not prevent the release of puromycylated nascent peptides from ribosomes, which diffuse away from the translating ribosome. Hence, localization of puromycylated peptides in cells using anti-puromycin antibodies do not correspond to the site where they are synthesized. Structural modeling of the ribosome indicates steric impediments for puromycin antibodies to recognize the puromycylated nascent chain in the ribosome. Additionally, the authors point that proximity ligation assays (PLA) of highly abundant proteins might report on their overlapping distribution instead of their specific interaction.</p><p>Conclusions from this work are further supported by a submitted manuscript from Rachel Green's group. Both articles warn caution to conclude on localized translation from RPM assays. Studying localized translation in cells and organisms is a growing field that requires tools able to faithfully report, at the subcellular level, the site of translation. Therefore, their findings should be shared with the scientific community, so previous conclusions can be revisited, and test with biochemistry and imaging approaches detailed in these manuscripts.</p><p>The biochemical, single-molecule imaging and structural modeling experiments are well done, analyzed and described. It will be nice to see the localization of the mRNA in Figure 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
