ribosomal RNA modifications and the enzymes responsible for installing them is constantly expanding. Previously, we reported that NSUN-5 is responsible for depositing m<sup>5</sup>C at position C2381 on the 26S rRNA in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Here, we show that NSUN-1 is writing the second known 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C at position C2982. Depletion of <italic>nsun-1</italic> or <italic>nsun-5</italic> improved thermotolerance and slightly increased locomotion at midlife, however, only soma-specific knockdown of <italic>nsun-1</italic> extended lifespan. Moreover, soma-specific knockdown of <italic>nsun-1</italic> reduced body size and impaired fecundity, suggesting non-cell-autonomous effects. While ribosome biogenesis and global protein synthesis were unaffected by <italic>nsun-1</italic> depletion, translation of specific mRNAs was remodeled leading to reduced production of collagens, loss of structural integrity of the cuticle, and impaired barrier function. We conclude that loss of a single enzyme required for rRNA methylation has profound and highly specific effects on organismal development and physiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>RNA methylation</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>nsun1/nop2/p120</kwd><kwd>nsun5/rcm1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30623</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schosserer</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003494</institution-id><institution>Herzfelder'sche Familienstiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30623</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schosserer</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hochschuljubiläumsstiftung der Stadt Wien</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H- 327123/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schosserer</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I2514</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grillari</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM103423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rollins</surname><given-names>Jarod A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rogers</surname><given-names>Aric N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lafontaine</surname><given-names>Denis L J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012307</institution-id><institution>Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>James L.

According to the ‘disposable soma theory’ of aging, organisms may invest energy either in reproduction or in somatic maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirkwood and Holliday, 1979</xref>). This explains why most lifespan-extending interventions come at the cost of decreased fecundity. De novo protein synthesis by ribosomes, the most energy-demanding process in living cells, affects the balance between aging and reproduction. In fact, reduced overall protein synthesis was shown to extend lifespan in several model organisms, including the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Syntichaki et al., 2007</xref>). Although some evidence indicates that a link between ribosome biogenesis and gonadogenesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> may exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Voutev et al., 2006</xref>), the precise relationship between these pathways in multicellular organisms is still poorly understood. It is conceivable that the optimal function of ribosomes, which requires the presence of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal protein (r-protein) modifications, is monitored by the cell at several stages during development. Thus, introduction of these modifications might participate in the control of cell fate and cell-cell interactions during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hokii et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Voutev et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Eukaryotic ribosomes are composed of about 80 core r-proteins and four different rRNAs, which together are assembled into a highly sophisticated nanomachine carrying the essential functions of mRNA decoding, peptidyl transfer and peptidyl hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ban et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Natchiar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Penzo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma and Lafontaine, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sloan et al., 2017</xref>). Until recently, ribosomes were considered as static homogenous ribonucleoprotein complexes executing the translation of cellular information from mRNA to catalytically active or structural proteins. However, mounting evidence suggests the possibility of ribosomes being heterogeneous in composition with the possibility that some display differential translation with distinct affinity for particular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Genuth and Barna, 2018</xref>). Such heterogeneity in composition may originate from the use of r-protein paralogs, r-protein post-translational modifications, or rRNA post-transcriptional modifications. Indeed, around 2% of all nucleotides of the four rRNAs are decorated with post-transcriptional modifications. These modifications are introduced by specific enzymes such as dyskerin and fibrillarin and guided by specific small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Penzo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sloan et al., 2017</xref>). The most abundant rRNA modifications are snoRNA-guided 2´-O-methylations of nucleotide ribose moieties and isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine (Ψ). However, some base modifications, which occur less frequently than 2’-O-methylations of ribose and pseudouridines, are installed by specific enzymes, which were largely assumed to be stand-alone rRNA methyltransferases. One exception is the acetyltransferase Kre33 (yeast)/NAT10 (human), which is guided by specialized box C/D snoRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sleiman and Dragon, 2019</xref>). Most of these base modifications are introduced at sites close to the decoding site, the peptidyl transferase center, or the subunit interface. Intriguingly, prokaryotes and eukaryotes share the majority of modifications located in the inner core of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Natchiar et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes inspected so far, the large ribosomal subunit contains two m<sup>5</sup>C residues. This is notably the case in budding yeast (on 25S rRNA), in the nematode worm (26S) and in human cells (28S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma and Lafontaine, 2015</xref>). Rcm1/NSUN-5, an enzyme of the NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family, is responsible for introducing m<sup>5</sup>C at residue C2278 and C2381 on 25S/26S rRNA in yeast and worms, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gigova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schosserer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, our group and others identified the conserved target cytosines in humans and mice, C3782, and C3438, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heissenberger et al., 2019</xref>). We also reported that lack of this methylation is sufficient to alter ribosomal structure and ribosome fidelity during translation, while extending the lifespan and stress resistance of worms, flies and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schosserer et al., 2015</xref>). However, the identity of the second worm m<sup>5</sup>C rRNA methyltransferase remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we report that NSUN-1 is responsible for writing the second <italic>C. elegans</italic> 26S m<sup>5</sup>C (position C2982). We then investigate the physiological roles of NSUN-1, comparing them systematically to those of NSUN-5. We show that NSUN-1 and NSUN-5 distinctly modulate fundamental biological processes such as aging and fecundity. In particular, depletion of <italic>nsun-1</italic> impairs fecundity, gonad maturation and remodels translation of specific mRNAs leading to cuticle defects. We conclude that loss of NSUN-1 introducing a single rRNA modification is sufficient to profoundly and specifically alter ribosomal function and, consequently, essential cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NSUN-1 is responsible for writing m<sup>5</sup>C at position C2982 on <italic>C. elegans</italic> 26S rRNA</title><p>Previously, we showed that an m<sup>5</sup>C modification is introduced at position C2381 on the 26S rRNA of <italic>C. elegans</italic> large ribosomal subunit by NSUN-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schosserer et al., 2015</xref>), which is required to modulate animal lifespan and stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schosserer et al., 2015</xref>). On this basis, we were interested to learn if other related rRNA methyltransferases in <italic>C. elegans</italic> might display similar properties.</p><p>Therefore, we investigated the RNA substrate of NSUN-1 (also formerly known as NOL-1, NOL-2, or W07E6.1) and its potential roles in worm development and physiology. NSUN-1 is a member of the NOP2/Sun RNA-methyltransferase family. Since there are only two known m<sup>5</sup>C residues on worm 26S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma and Lafontaine, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trixl and Lusser, 2019</xref>), one of them at C2381, being installed by NSUN-5, we speculated that NSUN-1 might be required for introducing the second m<sup>5</sup>C residue at position C2982. Notably, both 26S m<sup>5</sup>C sites are localized close to the decoding site and peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome, and are highly conserved between yeast, worm and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NSUN-1 is responsible for large ribosomal subunit 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Location of the two eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit m<sup>5</sup>C residues within the 3D structure of the human ribosome. For reference, important functional sites are indicated (DCS = decoding site, PTC = peptidyl transferase center).

As it will become evident below, there are several other advantages of using RNAi in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. One is that it allows to deplete a factor of interest at a particular life stage only (e.g. in adult worms), another is that it allows performing tissue-specific knockdown of gene expression.</p><p>26S rRNA was purified from worms treated with siRNAs specific to NSUN-1-encoding mRNAs on sucrose gradients, digested to single nucleosides, and analyzed by quantitative HPLC. In our HPLC assay, the m<sup>5</sup>C nucleoside eluted at 12 min, as established with a m<sup>5</sup>C calibration control (data not shown). The depletion of NSUN-1 was conducted in two genetic backgrounds: N2 (wildtype), and NL2099 (an RNAi-hypersensitive strain due to mutation in <italic>rrf-3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Treating N2 worms with an empty control vector, not expressing any RNAi, did not significantly reduce the levels of 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, 97% instead of 100%). Interestingly, treating N2 worms with an RNAi construct targeting <italic>nsun-1</italic> led to a reduction of 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation by 35% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the NL2099 strain, <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi treatment also led to a reduction of 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation by 26% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A second independent biological replicate confirmed these findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>As there are only two known modified m<sup>5</sup>C residues on worm 26S rRNA, and since one of them is introduced by NSUN-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schosserer et al., 2015</xref>), a complete loss of NSUN-1 activity was expected to result in a 50% decrease in m<sup>5</sup>C methylation. However, protein depletion achieved with RNAi is usually not complete. It is not clear why the level of m<sup>5</sup>C depletion was not higher in the RNAi-hypersensitive strain in comparison to the N2 strain; nonetheless, RNAi-mediated depletion of <italic>nsun-1</italic> significantly reduced the levels of 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C modification in both worm strains, thus, we conclude that NSUN-1 is responsible for 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation.</p><p>We analyzed the 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C levels in a <italic>nsun-5</italic> deletion strain as control (strain JGG1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

When <italic>nsun-1</italic> was additionally depleted by RNAi in the <italic>nsun-5</italic> knockout animals, the level of 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C was further reduced to 43%, again in agreement with our conclusion that NSUN-1 is responsible for methylating the second position, C2982.</p><p>Since our conclusion is based on depletion of <italic>nsun-1</italic> to ~20% residual expression and not on a full gene knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), we cannot exclude the formal possibility that NSUN-1 might not be the only m<sup>5</sup>C2982 writer in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, we consider this possibility to be highly unlikely because the combination of a knockout of Rcm1 with a catalytic mutation of Nop2 in yeast was sufficient to completely remove m<sup>5</sup>C from 25S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To further prove that NSUN-1 is not involved in C2381 modification, methylation levels at this position were specifically tested by Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) assay in animals depleted of <italic>nsun-1</italic> or <italic>nsun-5</italic>. This method is based on bisulfite conversion of total RNA, followed by PCR amplification and restriction digest, yielding two bands in case of methylation at C2381 and three bands in case of non-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamla et al., 2019</xref>). As expected, only <italic>nsun-5</italic> depletion strongly reduced methylation at C2381, and there was no residual m<sup>5</sup>C2381 in the <italic>nsun-5</italic> knockout strain, while <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi had no effect on modification at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Bisulfite sequencing is well-known to be sensitive to RNA secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Warnecke et al., 2002</xref>), which likely explains why, despite repeated attempts, we could not monitor modification at position C2982 by use of this technique.</p><p>In conclusion, NSUN-1 and NSUN-5 are each responsible for installing one m<sup>5</sup>C onto the worm 26S rRNA, with NSUN-1 being responsible for position C2982 and NSUN-5 for position C2381 under the <italic>bona fide</italic> assumption that indeed only two m<sup>5</sup>C positions are present as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma and Lafontaine, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The soma-specific depletion <italic>of nsun-1</italic> extends lifespan</title><p>Next, we investigated if knockdown of <italic>nsun-1</italic> modulates healthy lifespan in a similar fashion as that described for <italic>nsun-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schosserer et al., 2015</xref>). In order to achieve this aim, we depleted <italic>nsun-1</italic> by RNAi in N2 wild-type animals starting from day 0 of adulthood and, quite surprisingly, we did not observe any extension of mean or maximum lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Next, we evaluated the stress resistance of adult worms upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> or <italic>nsun-5</italic> depletion, as an increased health at an advanced age often improves resilience to adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lithgow et al., 1994</xref>). Indeed, depletion of either <italic>nsun-1</italic> or <italic>nsun-5</italic> increased resistance to heat stress compared to the RNAi control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, we tracked the movement of animals treated with either an empty vector control or two constructs expressing RNAi directed against <italic>nsun-1</italic> or <italic>nsun-5</italic> in a time course analysis, starting at day 1 of adulthood up to day 16.

Worms subjected to <italic>nsun-1</italic> knockdown displayed morphological alterations; specifically, the gonad appeared severely distorted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, RNAi control and <italic>nsun-5</italic> RNAi showed comparable morphology of distal and proximal gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Consequently, we hypothesized that <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi-treated worms might be arrested in early L4 larval stage when the gonad is not yet fully developed and animals still grow, instead of normally reaching adulthood after 3 days like RNAi control or <italic>nsun-5</italic> RNAi-treated nematodes. To test this possibility, we used the TP12 <italic>kaIs12[col-19::GFP]</italic> translational reporter strain, which expresses COL-19::GFP specifically upon reaching adulthood, but not during larval stages. Surprisingly, larval-onset RNAi against <italic>nsun-1</italic> or <italic>nsun-5</italic> did not reveal differences in the expression of COL-19::GFP as compared to RNAi control, suggesting that neither <italic>nsun-1</italic> nor <italic>nsun-5</italic> induce larval arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Together with the reduced brood size upon adult-onset RNAi, these findings imply that loss of <italic>nsun-1</italic> induces phenotypic changes in the reproductive organs of <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Since knockdown of <italic>nsun-1</italic> extended lifespan only when it was applied to somatic tissues, we hypothesized that body length might also be affected when these tissues are specifically targeted for depletion. To test this hypothesis, we depleted <italic>nsun-1</italic> specifically in the germline or in somatic tissues using tissue-specific RNAi strains and measured body size during three consecutive days after adulthood was reached. While germline-specific knockdown of <italic>nsun-1</italic> did not induce any changes in body size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), soma-specific knockdown revealed a decrease in body length by 23% on day 1, 11% on day 2 and 12% on day 3 compared to the RNAi control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), phenocopying <italic>nsun-1</italic> depletion in wild-type animals after whole-animal RNAi. Similarly, no effect of <italic>nsun-1</italic> knockdown was evident in another germline-specific RNAi strain, which was recently developed to enhance germline-specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, <italic>nsun-1</italic> but not <italic>nsun-5</italic> depletion impairs body size and morphology of the gonad and leads to a significant reduction of brood size.

Furthermore, we observed that NSUN-1 is not required for mature rRNA production as shown by the unaffected levels of mature 18S and 26S rRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Following lysis, puromycin incorporation was measured by western blot with an anti-puromycin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

At the transition zone between the pachytene and the diplotene, GLD-1 levels sharply decrease and previously repressed mRNAs are consequently translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Schedl, 2010</xref>). Since the gonads of <italic>nsun-1</italic> knockdown animals appeared defective precisely at this transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and GLD-1 target mRNAs were repressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>), we set out to investigate the effects of <italic>nsun-1</italic> depletion on the spatial distribution of GLD-1 expression during development. For this aim, we used a GLD-1::GFP reporter strain and exposed larvae to RNAi control and <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi. Indeed, GLD-1::GFP protein expression was restricted exclusively to a small portion of the loop region in adult nematodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that <italic>nsun-1</italic> is required for correct gonadal GLD-1 localization during development, which might then directly or indirectly influence the specific translation of mRNAs required for further steps in development based on motifs in their 3’ UTRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>mRNAs encoding cuticle collagens are translationally repressed upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> knockdown</title><p>To further understand the mechanistic link between differential translation and the phenotypes observed upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> knockdown, we performed GO-term enrichment analysis. Among others, GO-terms associated with collagens, structural integrity of the cuticle, and embryo development were significantly enriched amongst the mRNAs which were translationally repressed upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata4">Source data 4</xref>).</p><p>Since three collagens (<italic>col-35</italic>, <italic>col-36,</italic> and <italic>col-37</italic>) were also found among the five most strongly repressed genes upon loss of <italic>nsun-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), we decided to assess whether collagen deposition is indeed altered in the animals. In order to test this possibility, we performed a specific histological staining aimed at distinguishing young collagen, detected in blue, from mature collagen, highlighted in pink/brownish-red (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herovici, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Teuscher et al., 2019</xref>). While young adult worms exposed to RNAi control showed presence of both young and mature collagen, animals subjected to <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi displayed a strikingly overall reduction of collagen deposition compared to the cytoplasmatic counter-stain (yellow) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we repeatedly observed an increased fraction of animals displaying gonad extrusion upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which might be caused by loss of cuticle structural integrity. To quantify this phenotype precisely, we classified mid-aged animals according to the grade of gonad extrusion which we defined to fall in either of three categories: (i) no visible signs of gonad extrusion, (ii) mild extrusion, or (iii) severe extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> depletion, 134 of 220 animals (~60%) showed mild to severe extrusion of the gonad (categories ii and iii), while no extrusion was observed in any of the 50 RNAi control nematodes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). To further evaluate the possible physiological consequences of altered collagen deposition, we tested cuticle barrier integrity. This assay is based on the principle that the Hochst33342 dye is membrane-permeable, but cuticle-impermeable. As previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ewald et al., 2015</xref>, worms were grouped into four categories according to whether they were: (i) not permeable (absence of stained nuclei in the animal tail region), (ii) mildly permeable (&lt;5 stained nuclei), (iii) permeable (5–10 stained nuclei), or (iv) highly permeable (&gt;10 stained nuclei) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). Consistent with the reduced production of several collagens, <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi caused cuticle permeability (categories ii, iii, and iv) in 26 of 46 animals (~56%) compared to only 5 of 51 RNAi control animals (~10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, this indicates that NSUN-1 is partially required for translation of several cuticle collagens, which may explain the loss of gonad integrity and the increased cuticle permeability observed upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> depletion. Moreover, several mRNAs whose translation depends on NSUN-1 are associated with embryogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although ribosomal RNA modifications are highly conserved in evolution and often present at functionally relevant positions on the ribosomal subunits, only limited information is available on their exact biological functions and, in particular, on their possible involvement in developmental processes or disease etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma and Lafontaine, 2015</xref>). In this work we have investigated the molecular and physiological roles of two structurally related Sun-domain-containing RNA methyltransferases, NSUN-1, and NSUN-5 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Each enzyme is responsible for writing one specific m<sup>5</sup>C mark on 26S rRNA. We further describe NSUN-1 as a <italic>bona fide</italic> m<sup>5</sup>C rRNA writer enzyme that, if missing, directly entails physiological and developmental consequences. We conclude that, molecularly, loss of NSUN-1 function leads to translational remodeling with profound consequences on cell homeostasis, exemplified by loss of cuticle barrier function, and highly specific developmental defects, including oocyte maturation failure. We further suggest that extrusion of the gonad and loss of cuticle barrier function are directly caused by reduced expression of collagens, while the developmental defects are associated with altered expression and/or localization of several important developmental regulators such as GLD-1.

Depending on its environment, an organism may direct the available energy either to maintenance of the germline thereby ensuring efficient reproduction, or to the homeostasis of somatic cells including the prevention of DNA damage accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirkwood and Holliday, 1979</xref>). Accordingly, most of the known genetic or nutritional interventions that increase the lifespan of organisms antagonistically reduce growth, fecundity, and body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kapahi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>). Indeed, reduction of overall protein synthesis by genetic, pharmacological, or dietary interventions was reproducibly shown to extend longevity in different aging model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiocchetti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curran and Ruvkun, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaeberlein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masoro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pan et al., 2007</xref>). These reports clearly established protein synthesis as an important regulator of the aging process at the interface between somatic maintenance and reproduction. Thus, we were surprised to find that despite their ability to modulate aging and to methylate rRNA, neither NSUN-1 nor NSUN-5 were required for global protein synthesis in worms under the conditions tested. In the case of NSUN-5 depletion, we previously found overall translation to be decreased in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heissenberger et al., 2019</xref>), but not in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schosserer et al., 2015</xref>). We reasoned that the higher complexity of mammalian ribosomes and associated factors might render them more vulnerable to alterations of rRNA secondary structure, for example caused by loss of a single base modification, than ribosomes from yeast or nematodes.</p><p>As ribosome biogenesis and global translational activity per se were not severely affected by loss of NSUN-1, the principle that specialized ribosomes modified at specific positions may be particularly efficient to translate selectively mRNAs important for worm development and physiology was appealing to us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simsek and Barna, 2017</xref>). Indeed, lack of NSUN-1 and thus of methylation at C2982 resulted in decreased translation of mRNAs containing GLD-1 and ASD-2 binding sites. These two proteins are closely related members of the STAR protein family involved in mRNA-binding, splicing and nuclear export of mRNAs. While the molecular functions of ASD-2 are only poorly understood, the role of GLD-1 in embryonic development is well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Schedl, 2010</xref>). Since the gonads of <italic>nsun-1</italic> knockdown animals appeared defective precisely at the transition between the pachytene and the diplotene and GLD-1 target mRNAs were repressed, we speculate that either ribosomes lacking the methylation at C2982 have generally low affinity for these mRNAs, or that translational repression by GLD-1 is never fully relieved. Although the expression of GLD-1 itself was not differentially regulated between control and <italic>nsun-1</italic> depleted animals at the transcriptional or translational levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>), multiple direct or indirect connections to NSUN-1 which modulates ribosome function are still conceivable and will require further studies.</p><p>Previously, Curran and Ruvkun reported that depletion of <italic>nsun-1</italic> (W07E6.1) by adult-onset RNAi treatment led to extended lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curran and Ruvkun, 2007</xref>). In their high throughput screen the authors used a strain carrying a mutation in the <italic>eri-1</italic> gene, rendering it hypersensitive to RNAi in the whole body, but especially in neurons and in the somatic gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kennedy et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, we conducted a whole-body knockdown in N2 wild-type animals but could not confirm these previously observed effects on lifespan, although the health status of mid-aged nematodes, as assessed by quantifying locomotion behavior, were slightly improved. However, when knocking-down <italic>nsun-1</italic> specifically in somatic tissues, but not in the germline, we observed a clear lifespan extension. The N2 wild-type strain is usually resistant to RNAi in the somatic gonad and neurons. Thus, we hypothesize that depletion of <italic>nsun-1</italic> specifically in the somatic part of the gonad is required for lifespan extension, which is only effectively realized in the <italic>eri-1</italic> and <italic>ppw-1</italic> mutant strains, but not in N2 wild-type animals. Intriguingly, these findings further suggest possible non-cell-autonomous effects of single RNA methylations, since modulation of NSUN-1 levels in somatic cells profoundly affected distinct cells of the germline.</p><p>The developing gonad of L1 larvae consists of two primordial germ cells and two surrounding somatic gonad precursor niche cells. The crosstalk between these two cell types, which form the germline and somatic part of the gonad at later stages of larval development, was already described to modulate aging and stress responses. Laser depletion of both primordial germ cells extends lifespan via insulin/IGF-signaling, while animals with an additional depletion of the two somatic gonad precursor cells have a normal lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsin and Kenyon, 1999</xref>). Of potential relevance to our study is a recent report by Ou and coworkers, who demonstrated that IFE-4 regulates the response to DNA damage in primordial germ cells in a non-cell-autonomous manner via FGF-like signaling. Soma-specific IFE-4 is involved in the specific translation of a subset of mRNA including <italic>egl-15</italic>. Thereby, IFE-4 regulates the activity of CEP-1/p53 in primordial germ cells despite not being present there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ou et al., 2019</xref>). We thus hypothesize that selective translation of mRNAs by specialized ribosomes, either generated by association with translational regulators such as IFE-4, or by RNA modifications as described here, might serve as a general mechanism to tightly control essential cellular processes even in distinct cells and tissues.</p><p>Accumulating data suggests that NSUN-1 has pleiotropic effects independent of its methylation activity. While knockout of <italic>nsun-1</italic> appears to be lethal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), a catalytic mutant strain of <italic>nsun-1</italic> only lacking its methylation activity was still viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navarro et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, deletion of Nop2, the yeast homolog of <italic>nsun-1</italic>, was shown to be lethal, but viability could be restored by re-expression of a catalytic mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Elucidating the precise mechanisms of NSUN1 function is of prime importance, as the human protein (also known as NOP2 or P120) was shown to be required for mammalian preimplantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2016</xref>), which, when considering the effects we report on gonad maturation in worm, highlights evolutionary conservation. Cui and colleagues found that NSUN1 carries an essential role during blastocyst development within their experimental system. Interestingly, NSUN1 appears to be important in other physiological contexts as well, as it was recently shown to restrict HIV-1 replication and promote latency by participating in the methylation of the HIV-1 TAR RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kong et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, other groups reported that low levels of NSUN1 reduce cell growth in leukemia cells, which is in line with the findings that NSUN1 promotes cell proliferation. Moreover, high NSUN1 expression results in increased tumor aggressiveness and augmented 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) resistance in two leukaemia cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bantis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saijo et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, NSUN1 might be considered as an example of ‘antagonistic pleiotropy’. According to this theory, genes can be essential early in life and become dispensable later, for instance after sexual reproduction. While NSUN1 appears to be essential for normal development, it might increase tumor aggressiveness later in life, especially in highly proliferative cells and tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Single nematodes were picked from plates into 5 µL nuclease-free water in PCR tubes, taking care to minimize bacterial contamination. 1 µL Buffer A and 0.5 µL Buffer B were added to each tube and incubated at 75°C for 5 min and for 10 min at 95°C in a thermocycler with heated lid. Then, PCR was performed following the manufacture’s protocol using specific primers spanning the <italic>tm6081</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) in 25 µL reaction volume, 50°C annealing temperature and 35 cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNAi knockdown</title><p>For inactivating <italic>nsun-1</italic> and <italic>nsun-5</italic>, feeding of double-stranded RNA expressed in bacteria was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Timmons et al., 2001</xref> ). Therefore, the HT115 strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>, carrying either the respective RNAi construct or the empty vector (L4440) as RNAi control, was cultured overnight in LB medium with ampicillin and tetracyclin at 37°C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in LB medium and either 100 µL (60 mm plates) or 400 µL (100 mm plates) were plated on NGM containing 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside and 25 µg/mL carbenicillin. The plates were incubated at 37°C overnight and used within one week.</p><p>Larval-onset RNAi was achieved by bleaching adult animals. Released eggs were transferred directly to plates seeded with RNAi bacteria. Adulthood was usually reached after three days and animals were used for experiments when the RNAi control strain started to lay eggs.</p><p>In case of adult-onset RNAi, eggs were transferred to plates seeded with RNAi control bacteria. Animals were raised until egg production commenced and subsequently transferred to the respective RNAi bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Worms were paralyzed using 1 M sodium azide solution and mounted on 2% agar pads. Images were acquired on a Leica DMI6000B microscope with a 10x dry objective (NA 0.3), a 20x dry objective (NA 0.7), or a 63x glycerol objective (NA 1.3) in DIC brightfield or fluorescence mode. Confocal microscopy presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> was performed on a Leica TCS SP5 spot scanning confocal microscope equipped with an HCX PL APO CS 40x/0.85 dry objective, HyD detector and Argon-laser. Cropping, insertion of scale bars and brightness and contrast adjustments were done with Image J (version 2.0.0-rc-65/1.51 w; Java 1.8.0_162 [64-bit]).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mobility</title><p>Animals were either synchronized by timed egg-lay (two replicates) or by hypochlorite treatment (one replicate) on RNAi control plates. When reaching adulthood, nematodes were transferred to RNAi plates. Every few days at regular intervals, plates were rocked in order to induce movement of animals and videos were subsequently recorded for one minute. Worms were transferred to fresh plates whenever necessary. At day 16 the vast majority of worms completely ceased movement, thus we did not include any later timepoints. Notably, we did not notice any obvious aversion behavior or elevated speed at young age upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> or <italic>nsun-5</italic> RNAi, which was previously shown to be present upon depletion of other components of the translational machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Melo and Ruvkun, 2012</xref>). Worm Lab version 4.1.1 was used to track individual animals and calculate the average speed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Lifespan assays</title><p>Lifespan measurement was conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schosserer et al., 2015</xref>). For lifespan assays, 90 adults per condition were transferred to plates seeded with the respective RNAi bacteria (control, <italic>nsun-1</italic>, <italic>nsun-5</italic>). Wildtype worms were pre-synchronized on NGM plates seeded with UV-killed OP50 bacteria. 50 adult worms were transferred to NGM plates and allowed to lay eggs for 15 hr; then the adult worms were removed. Synchronization by timed egg-lay was performed 72 hr after the pre-synchronization by transferring 350 gravid worms from the pre-synchronization to fresh NGM plates seeded with RNAi control bacteria and allowed to lay eggs for four hours. After 68 hr, 90 young adult worms per condition were placed on fresh NGM plates containing 5 mL NGM, 100 µL bacterial suspension and 50 μg FUdR. This day represents day 0 in the lifespan measurement. Worms were scored as ‘censored’ or ‘dead’ every two to four days. Nematodes were scored as ‘censored’ if they had crawled off the plate, were missing or died due to other causes than aging, such as gonad extrusion. Animals were transferred to fresh plates every 3–7 days depending on the availability of the bacterial food source. Lifespans were performed at 20°C. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and log-rank statistics were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Thermotolerance</title><p>Thermotolerance was assessed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vieira et al., 2018</xref>). Animals were synchronized by hypochlorite treatment and released eggs were transferred to NGM plates seeded with RNAi control bacteria and kept at 20°C. After 48 hr, L4 animals were picked on RNAi control, <italic>nsun-1</italic> or <italic>nsun-5</italic> RNAi plates and exposed to RNAi for approximately three days (68 hr). Subsequently, plates were transferred to 35°C and scored every 1–2 hr for survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Body size</title><p>Worms were synchronized by hypochlorite treatment and incubated in liquid S-Basal medium overnight. On the following day, eggs/L1 were transferred to RNAi plates (RNAi control, <italic>nsun-1,</italic> and <italic>nsun-5</italic> RNAi). Three days later, worms were transferred to agar pads and paralyzed using sodium azide and visualized using DIC microscopy (see above).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Brood size analysis</title><p>Worms were synchronized by treatment with hypochlorite solution and incubated in S-Basal at room temperature overnight. L1 larvae were subsequently transferred to NGM plates seeded with RNAi control bacteria. After 48 hr, L4 animals were transferred to individual wells of a 24-well plate seeded with the respective RNAi bacteria (HT115, <italic>nsun-1</italic>, <italic>nsun-5</italic>). Each well contained 1.5 mL of NGM-agar and 3 μL of bacterial suspension (1:2 dilution in S-Basal). Worms were transferred to a new well every day for four consecutive days and total progeny of individual animals was counted. Per condition and experiment, five worms were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Global protein synthesis by puromycin incorporation</title><p>Puromycin incorporation was measured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tiku et al., 2018</xref>) with minor modifications. Heat-inactivated OP-50 (75°C, 40 min) were provided as food source during pulse-labeling. As negative controls, RNAi control treated worms were used either without addition of puromycin or by pulse-labeling at 4°C instead of 20°C. Around 100 animals per condition were harvested for western blot analysis. Lysis was done directly in SDS loading dye (60 µM Tris/HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.0125% bromophenol blue and 1.25% β-mercaptoethanol). Worms in SDS loading dye were homogenized with a pellet pestle for 1 min. Then, the samples were heated to 95°C and loaded on 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (BioRad) in Laemmli-Buffer (25 mM Tris, 250 mM glycine and 0.1% SDS). Protein bands were transferred to PVDF-membranes (Bio Rad) at 25 V and 1.3 A for 3 min. After blocking with 3% milk in PBS, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4°C with a mixture of anti-Histone H3 (Abcam ab1791, 1:4000) and anti-puromycin (Millipore 12D10, 1:10000). After washing and secondary antibody incubation (IRDye680RD and IRDye800CW, 1:10000), the membrane was scanned on the Odyssey Infrared Imager (LI-COR). Quantification of band intensities was performed in Image J (version 2.0.0-rc-65/1.51 w; Java 1.8.0_162 [64-bit]).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Polysome profiling</title><p>Two-day-old adult worms were used to generate polysome profiles as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>). One hundred microliter worm-pellet were homogenized on ice in 300 µL of solubilization buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 200 µg/mL heparin, 400 U/mL RNAsin, 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg/mL cycloheximide, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) using a pellet pestle. 700 µL additional solubilization buffer were added, vortexed briefly, and placed on ice for 10 min before centrifugation at 20.000 g for 15 min at 4°C. Approximately 0.9 mL of the supernatant was applied to the top of a linear 10–50% sucrose gradient in high salt resolving buffer (140 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and centrifuged in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) at 180.000 g for 90 min at 4°C. Gradients were fractionated while continuously monitoring the absorbance at 260 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>Trizol LS (Life Technologies) was immediately added to collected fractions and RNA was isolated following the manufacturer’s protocol. PolyA-selection, generation of a strand-specific cDNA library and sequencing on the HiSeq 4000 platform (Illumina) using the 50 bp SR mode was performed by GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany). At least 30 million reads were generated per sample.</p><p>FASTQ Trimmer by column (Galaxy Version 1.0.0) was used to remove the first 12 bases from the 5’ end of each read due to an obvious base bias in this region, as detected by FastQC (Galaxy Version 0.69). Filter by quality (Galaxy Version 1.0.0) was performed using a cut-off value of 20 and only reads with a maximum number of 8 bases with quality lower than the cut-off value were retained. RNA STAR (Galaxy Version 2.6.0b-1) was used to align reads to the WBcel235 reference genome using the default options. Aligned reads with a minimum alignment quality of 10 were counted using htseq-count (Galaxy Version 0.9.1).</p><p>Differential expression was analyzed using the DEseq2 package in R. The contrast </p><p>~batch + condition (batch = biological replicate, condition = sample description)</p><p>was applied to compare the polysome fraction to the total RNA of either RNAi control or <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi-treated samples. Afterwards, results were filtered in R to contain only protein-coding genes (according to ENSEMBL annotation), genes with detectable expression (base mean &gt;1), a fold-change of &gt;2 (log2FC &gt; 1) and an adjusted p-value of &lt;0.05.

Samples were collected by either transferring worms individually into 1.5 mL tubes, by washing them off NGM plates using S-Basal or from polysome fractions and lysates (see above). After three washing steps with S-Basal, 300 μL TRIzol LS Reagent were added to approximately 100 µL residual S-Basal including worms. Subsequently, worms were homogenized with a pellet pestle for one minute, 600 µL TRIzol LS Reagent were added and the sample was vortexed for five minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo) according to the instructions by the manufacturer. For cDNA synthesis, 500 ng RNA were converted into cDNA using the Applied Biosystems High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA was amplified from total RNA using random primers. RT-qPCR was performed on a Rotor-Gene Q (QIAGEN) using HOT FIREPol EvaGreen qPCR Mix. The absolute amounts of mRNAs were calculated by computing a standard curve and the resulting copy numbers were normalized to the housekeeping genes <italic>act-1</italic> and <italic>tba-1</italic>.</p><p>For measuring mRNA expression during development, worms were synchronized by treatment with hypochlorite solution and the released eggs were subsequently transferred to four separate NGM plates seeded with UV-killed OP50 bacteria.

methylation. Specifically, the gene NSUN-1 can impact nematode health through its effect on rRNA methylation, providing a mechanistic link between a specific RNA modification and systemic health in a multicellular organism. To note, these ribosomal RNA modifications do not affect systemic health by altering global protein translation and have tissue/organ-specific effects, ranging from changes in body size, oocyte maturation and fecundity. Together, these findings enrich our understanding of the organismal consequences of RNA modifications.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The ribosomal RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methyltransferase NSUN-1 modulates healthspan and oogenesis in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Dario Riccardo Valenzano as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Sebastian Denzel (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Heissenberge et al. study how NSUN-1 impacts rRNA methylation and health in nematodes. Eukaryotic ribosomal RNAs undergo several modifications. Among these, there are two known m<sup>5</sup>C, located in highly conserved target sequences. Previous work from the authors characterised the mechanism underlying one of these modifications in worms (C2381), as well as its functional consequences on cellular and organismal homeostasis. The current work focuses on the second m<sup>5</sup>C, at position C2982, and identifies NSUN-1 as the putative rRNA methylase. This is a novel and potentially exciting finding. Using RNAi in two worm strains, the authors show that knocking down NSUN-1 expression, the specific C2982 m<sup>5</sup>C level is in part (not entirely) reduced. This assay proves sufficiency (but not necessity) of NSUN-1 to reduce m<sup>5</sup>C levels at C2982. While it is not clear why the authors do not use a complete knock out for NSUN-1 (is it lethal?), follow-up work using RNAi explores the phenotypic effects of lowered NSUN-1 levels. While somatic and germline reduction of m<sup>5</sup>C levels do not have an impact on worm lifespan, it does increase resistance to heat stress, slight increase in motor activity. Reducing NSUN-1 expression separately in germline and soma showed allegedly lifespan increase. Somatic reduction of NSUN-1 leads to changes in body size, oocyte maturation and fecundity, and has no effect on global protein translation.

The soma-specific RNAi experiment was indeed performed in two completely independent biological replicates, which showed slight differences in the overall survival of the RNAi control. However, in each of the individual replicates an increase in mean lifespan (replicate 1: 16.5 vs. 18 days; replicate 2: 18.6 vs. 20.2 days), as well as in median lifespan (replicate 1: 16 vs. 18 days; replicate 2: 19 vs. 21 days) was clearly evident and statistically significant.</p><p>To improve the presentation of our results, we now show the first replicate as a representative experiment instead of pooled data (see revised Figure 2). This is with the exception of the thermotolerance experiments for which we performed more replicates with smaller sample sizes in order to keep the manipulation times of the animals at room temperature as short as possible. However, this rendered the individual replicates noisier and more variable. For this reason, we prefer to show the thermotolerance assay as pooled instead of a single replicate.</p><p>We now also provide a table summarizing the statistics of each individual lifespan and thermotolerance replicate as Table 1. To further increase transparency and confidence in our data, we provide, as suggested, all raw lifespan scoring data which were used to compute graphs and statistics as Figure 2—source data 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear whether deletion mutants for NSUN-1 (e.g. nsun-1(tm6081)) are viable in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and if yes, what is their phenotype in the context of this study. If the deletion mutant is not available, can the authors generate a CRISPR line?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this suggestion. We have requested the FX30263 strain from the National Bioresource Project in Japan which contains the balanced heterozygous <italic>nsun-1(tm6081)</italic> mutant allele. Our analysis of this strain is included in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and the following paragraph was added in the Results section of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“In order to test if NSUN-1 is involved in large ribosomal subunit m<sup>5</sup>C methylation, we first sought to identify a suitable model to study loss of NSUN-1. […] One is that it allows to deplete a factor of interest at a particular life stage only (e.g. in adult worms), another is that it allows performing tissue-specific knockdown of gene expression.”</p><p>We agree that, in principle, generating additional mutant strains is always interesting. Regretfully, the timeframe involved in generating such CRISPR-Cas9 mutants in worm, and, in particular a knock-in, is simply not compatible with the revision of the present work, and we feel it should thus be left for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is there a relationship between the mRNAs selectively translated in the NSUN-1 RNAi treatment and in the NSUN-5 RNAi/mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we included an additional figure (Figure 6), as well as the following description in the Results section:</p><p>“To test this possibility, we isolated mRNAs contained in the polysomal fraction, systematically sequenced them by RNA-seq and compared their abundance in polysomes between animals subjected to <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi versus RNAi control. […] This suggests that the pattern of translated mRNAs upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> depletion is highly specific and strikingly distinct from that observed upon loss of the other 26S rRNA m<sup>5</sup>C methyltransferase.”</p><p>We would like to add that a recent publication reported that loss of N6-adenosine methylation of 18S rRNA by METL-5 depletion also caused a reprogramming of the translatome in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, the observed changes in translated mRNAs were different from those reported by us for NSUN-1 (Liberman et al., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz4370">https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz4370</ext-link>). This further emphasizes the relevance and timeliness of our study and implicates that modulation of different rRNA methylations clearly promote distinct translational responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The results shown in Figure 1 draw a causal connection between NSUN-1 activity and C2982 based on exclusion: in other words, both NSUN-1 and NSUN-5 depletion lower the m<sup>5</sup>C peak by over 50%. Hence, since there are two m<sup>5</sup>C sites and one is written by NSUN-5, the other one must be written by NSUN-1. Is it possible that NSUN-1 may not be the only C2982 writer? Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>We included the following paragraph in the Results section of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Since our conclusion is based on depletion of <italic>nsun-1</italic> to ~20% residual expression and not on a full gene knockout (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), we cannot exclude the formal possibility that NSUN-1 might not be the only m<sup>5</sup>C2982 writer in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, we consider this possibility to be highly unlikely because the combination of a knockout of Rcm1 with a catalytic mutation of Nop2 in yeast was sufficient to completely remove m<sup>5</sup>C from 25S rRNA (Sharma et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4 analyzes the gonad and oocyte maturation. While the images are very convincing, it would be good to know how penetrant the phenotype is after analysis of a larger number of animals in each group.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we analyzed &gt;50 worms per group (RNAi control vs. <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi) of the SA115 and JJ1473 strains and found that the phenotype is 100% penetrant. We did not find a single worm showing normal gonad morphology after exposure to <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi. We included this information in the Results section, the legend of Figure 4 and the legend of Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is unclear how the observed translational remodeling that affects collagen deposition (demonstrated through the gonad extrusion and cuticle barrier phenotypes) is linked to oocyte maturation, or to heat stress resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this remains elusive at this point and will not be elucidated here.</p><p>We did hypothesize that the altered abundance of transcripts containing 3’ UTR motifs, which are recognized by important translational regulators of development such as GLD-1, are key to the defects in oocyte maturation upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> depletion. We therefore exposed a GDL-1::GFP reporter strain to <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi and made the following observations, which we now included in the Results section:</p><p>“Indeed, GLD-1::GFP protein expression was restricted exclusively to a small portion of the loop region in adult nematodes (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Taken together, these findings suggest that <italic>nsun-1</italic> is required for correct gonadal GLD-1 localization during development, which might then directly or indirectly influence the specific translation of mRNAs required for further steps in development.”</p><p>However, no obvious and direct link between GLD-1 function, collagen deposition and heat stress resistance is evident from our RNA-seq data, since differentially translated collagen genes did not show an enrichment of GLD-1 binding motifs. Since evidence suggests that loss of collagen genes like <italic>col-35</italic> contributes to brood size regulation (Rual JF et al., 2004; and Ceron J et al., 2007), we might speculate that the altered translation of collagens is sensed by a factor upstream of GDL-1, which then inhibits oozyte maturation further downstream. Due to the vast number of differentially regulated collagens, we feel that systematically testing this hypothesis in epistasis experiments is out of scope of the present study.</p><p>A recent publication by Liberman et al. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz4370">https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz4370</ext-link>), together with our data, implies that improved thermotolerance might be a common phenotype upon inhibition of specific rRNA modifications. The underlying mechanisms, however, appear to be distinct. cyp-29A3, which modulates heat stress resistance upon <italic>metl-5</italic> knockdown (Liberman et al., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz4370">https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz4370</ext-link>) , was not differentially expressed in our dataset upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> knockdown (log2 fold-change in the translatome of <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi vs. control RNAi = 0.24, adjusted p-value = 1). We can therefore only speculate that protein maintenance by chaperons or protein degradation by the catabolic arm of proteostasis (autophagy and ubiquitin/proteasome system) might be sensitive to slight alterations in translation, as imposed by loss of a single rRNA methylation. These pathways might then be rendered more responsive to acute stress and thereby mediate enhanced survival by hormesis. This or alternate hypotheses remain to be systematically tested in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should indicate how many times the HPLC experiments were done.</p></disp-quote><p>We independently performed all HPLC experiments twice. Thus, we exposed three different strains two times to <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi and found a clear reduction in m<sup>5</sup>C levels of 26S rRNA in all six cases. Both independent experiments are presented in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 3. We also included this information in the figure legend of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 3 the authors should indicate on each panel the age of the worms and at which stage the RNAi treatment was performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and included the relevant information in Figure 3, as well as in the respective figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The overall claim about behavior should be toned down as the RNAi line has no overall improvement, but only one time point shows a difference among the groups.

Statistical significance at each timepoint was determined using multiple comparison adjusted t-tests by the Holm-Sidak method. We included this information in the legend of Figure 2 and indicated statistical significance in the figure with asterisks. As noticed by the reviewer, <italic>nsun-1</italic> depletion significantly increased locomotion only at day 8, while nsun-5 RNAi increased the average speed at day 12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Although it may be hard to downregulate rRNAs by RNAi since they are so highly expressed, can the authors comment on whether 26S rRNA levels are reduced after RNAi and if yes to what degree?</p></disp-quote><p>Considering Figure 5C where we loaded equal amounts of total RNA on a gel and quantified the 26S and 18S rRNA band, we did not observe a reduction of 26S rRNA relative to 18S rRNA or total RNA upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi in any of the three different genetic backgrounds. However, knockout of nsun-5 (JGG1 strain) reduced 26S and 18S rRNA levels by 50% and 46%, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) While the authors write that rrf-1 is required for amplification of the dsRNA signal specifically in the somatic tissues, this may not be completely accurate, as the Kumsta et al., 2012 paper shows that rrf-1 affects both the soma and the germline. How does this affect the interpretation of the results?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly remarks that Kumsta and coworkers reported in 2012 that <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutations maintain RNAi efficiency in the soma in addition to the germline. However, this does not affect interpretation of our results, since we neither found a change in lifespan or animal size in the <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutant strain NL2098, nor in N2 wild-type animals. The reported changes in lifespan and size were only present in soma-specific NL2550 animals.</p><p>Zou and coworkers introduced recently the novel DCL569 strain (Zou et al.,2019), which shows improved germline-specificity compared to NL2098. To rule out any effect of residual somatic RNAi activity in NL2098, we repeated the length measurement upon <italic>nsun-1</italic> RNAi and nsun-5 RNAi in the DCL569 strain and did not find a difference compared to control RNAi, confirming our previous experiment (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Is there a chance that 26S rRNA expression or differential methylation have a tissue-specific pattern (you use RT-qPCR from whole worms)?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a very interesting question here, which will be fascinating to elucidate in the future. At tissue level in mice and humans, only few RNA modifications are known to show plasticity in response to environmental changes. We would expect that more pronounced alterations might happen at single-cell level, which we are currently unable to investigate due to limited sensitivity of available methods.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> might provide exciting opportunities in this regard, since sufficient amounts of RNA might be easily generated from a genetically homogenous population of animals. If methods to purify ribosomes from individual tissues of nematodes become available, it would be technically feasible and exciting to determine tissue-specific rRNA modification patterns, and their corresponding translatomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) May NSUN-1 have pleiotropic effects independent of C2982 m<sup>5</sup>C?</p></disp-quote><p>We consider it very likely the NSUN-1 carries additional effects independent of its methylation activity. We included the following paragraph in the Discussion:</p><p>“Accumulating data suggests that NSUN-1 has pleiotropic effects independent of its methylation activity. [...] Similarly, deletion of Nop2, the yeast homolog of <italic>nsun-1</italic>, was shown to be lethal, but viability could be restored by re-expression of a catalytic mutant (Sharma et al., 2013).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
