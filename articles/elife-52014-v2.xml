universal, but its neurobiological underpinnings remain unclear. We address this by integrating functional MRI and measurements of endogenous oxytocin in participants who view an ingroup and an outgroup member's suffering that is caused mutually (Revenge group) or by a computer (Control group). We show that intergroup conflict encountered by the Revenge group is associated with an increased level of oxytocin in saliva compared to that in the Control group. Furthermore, the medial prefrontal activity in response to ingroup pain in the Revenge group but not in the Control group mediates the association between endogenous oxytocin and the propensity to give painful electric shocks to outgroup members, regardless of whether they were directly involved in the conflict. Our findings highlight an important neurobiological correlate of revenge propensity, which may be implicated in conflict contagion across individuals in the context of intergroup conflict.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intergroup conflict</kwd><kwd>oxytocin</kwd><kwd>medial prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>revenge</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31661143039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Shihui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31421003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Shihui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31470986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Shihui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intergroup conflict increases human endogenous oxytocin, which predicts the medial prefrontal activity associated with ingroup pain and propensity to seek revenge upon the outgroup.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Revenge, which refers to taking actions of harming someone in retaliation for an injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elshout et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>), is a global phenomenon and a causal factor in many homicides and transgenerational conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kopsaj, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>). Although revenge is an aggressive act, not all aggressive acts represent vengeance. For example, unsolicited acts of aggression, like deviance, incivility, and bullying, would not count as revenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raver and Barling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>). Revenge often occurs between families or clans when an outgroup member brings harm to an ingroup member which, in turn, induces retaliation upon outgroup members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ericksen and Horton, 1992</xref>). According to early social psychological theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allport et al., 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brewer, 1999</xref>), a desire to help the ingroup (‘ingroup love’) and/or an aggressive motivation to hurt the outgroup (‘outgroup hate’) may drive participation in intergroup conflict by taking revenge. Recent behavioral research using economic games suggests that ingroup love plays a key role in driving economic punishment towards the outgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halevy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Dreu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Dreu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halevy et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, despite the severe social consequences of revenge, its neurobiological underpinnings remain unclear. Building upon previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halevy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Dreu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Dreu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halevy et al., 2012</xref>), we suggest that there may be a neurobiological mechanism that links perceived ingroup pain caused by an outgroup and the propensity to seek revenge upon an outgroup during intergroup conflict. The present work specifically examined the hormonal (i.e., oxytocin) and neural responses to ingroup suffering caused by an outgroup that predict revenge propensity against outgroups.</p><p>Previous brain imaging research has revealed neural responses to ingroup/outgroup members' suffering, yet they have been done in contexts that lack the key character of real-life intergroup conflict, that is ingroup and outgroup members causing each other's pain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified increased activity in both the empathy network (e.g., the anterior midcingulate [aMCC] and anterior insula [AI]) and the theory-of-mind network (e.g., the medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC] and the temporoparietal junction [TPJ]) in response to ingroup pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cikara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Han, 2018</xref>). Outgroup pain, on the other hand, is related to enhanced activity in the reward system (e.g., the ventral striatum and nucleus accumbens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cikara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luo et al., 2015</xref>]). In addition, the mPFC activity in response to perceived pain is associated with decisions to help ingroup members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mathur et al., 2010</xref>), and the activity in the nucleus accumbens predicts decisions not to help outgroup members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luo et al., 2015</xref>). These findings highlight ingroup favoritism in brain responses to others' pain as neural underpinnings of ingroup love but leave open a critical question: are brain responses to ingroup pain inflicted by outgroup members during intergroup conflict associated with subsequent revenge? Specifically, it is unclear whether activities in the empathy and/or theory-of-mind networks in response to perceived ingroup pain are associated with revenge motives during intergroup conflict. If revenge aims to bring suffering to an outgroup in order to get reward during intergroup conflict, one may expect the involvement of the reward system in decision making related to outgroup punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cikara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Han, 2018</xref>). However, if the goal of revenge is to help ingroup members who suffer from physical harm caused by an outgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lickel et al., 2006</xref>), the mPFC, which responds to ingroup pain and is associated with ingroup help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mathur et al., 2010</xref>), may be associated with tendencies to punish the outgroup.</p><p>Previous fMRI research has also examined the neurobiological correlates of punishment decision-making pertaining to those who have violated social norms in economic games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seymour et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krueger and Hoffman, 2016</xref>). Punishment decisions to prevent social norm violations have been associated with increased activities in both the empathy and theory-of-mind networks, including the aMCC, AI, and mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krueger and Hoffman, 2016</xref>). Yet these studies focused on brain activities related to punishment decisions rather than neurobiological mechanisms that link perceived ingroup suffering to propensity to seek revenge upon outgroups. During previously studied economic games, punishment decisions were likely motivated by prevention of social norm violations rather than by perceived physical harm to ingroup members caused by outgroup members, which characterizes most revenge behavior in real-life situations.</p><p>Finally, at the hormone level, recent research reported increased levels of urinary oxytocin (OT) — a nine-amino-acid peptide synthesized in hypothalamic cells — in chimpanzees immediately before and during border patrols and intergroup encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Samuni et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, intranasal administration of OT (vs. placebo) in humans enhanced both empathic neural responses to ingroup pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sheng et al., 2013</xref>) and individuals’ contributions to ingroup payoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Dreu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Dreu, 2010</xref>). OT administration also promotes motivation to sacrifice outgroup targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Dreu et al., 2011</xref>) and facilitates within-group coordination for successful outgroup attack during economic games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). These findings shed light on a functional role of the oxytocinergic system in decision making related to outgroup punishment. However, there has been little direct evidence to show that endogenous OT in humans is modulated during intergroup conflict (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levy et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, neural architectures that mediate endogenous OT and revenge propensity during intergroup conflict have been largely unexplored. Among the brain regions in which activities are sensitive to ingroup pain, the mPFC contains OT-sensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ninan, 2011</xref>). The mPFC, cingulate, and insula express OT receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Macdonald and Macdonald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boccia et al., 2013</xref>) and mPFC/aMCC activities are modulated by administered OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sabihi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eckstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). However, to date, whether the neural systems that are involved in empathy or theory-of-mind link endogenous OT to revenge propensity during intergroup conflict has yet to be examined.</p><p>A key challenge to our ability to address these issues empirically is the need for an experimental paradigm of intergroup conflict that can be used in a neuroimaging laboratory setting to measure: (i) neurobiological responses to perceived ingroup physical pain caused by an outgroup and (ii) revenge propensity to bring physical harm to the outgroup. Another challenge for empirical research on the neurobiological association of revenge propensity during intergroup conflict is the need to disentangle the effect of the key component of revenge (i.e., the punishment of outgroup members for harm that they have caused to one's ingroup) from other concomitant but nonessential factors, including perceived group identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kahn et al., 2017</xref>), negative evaluation of the outgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schiller et al., 2014</xref>), and decreased empathy for outgroup pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cikara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Han, 2018</xref>). These factors themselves may lead to negative treatment of outgroup members on the basis of ingroup biases in social behavior that occur even in the absence of intergroup conflict. It is therefore necessary to examine neurobiological responses in two conditions in which ingroup biases in emotions, attitudes, and behavior are matched, but the motive to punish the outgroup is different. That is, in the revenge condition, individuals punish outgroup members because they bring physical harm to the ingroup, whereas in the control condition, all else being equal, individuals punish outgroup members to show their ingroup favoritism in the absence of perceived intergroup conflict.</p><p>Toward these ends, we developed a new neural-behavioral paradigm that simulates real-life revenge during intergroup conflict. In this paradigm, participants viewed an ingroup and an outgroup member who gave each other painful electric shocks (Revenge group) or received electric shocks given by a computer (Control group) during a competitive game. The key difference between the two conditions is whether outgroup members brought physical harm to ingroup members during an intergroup conflict while all other aspects of the experimental manipulations were the same for the two groups. We measured participants' salivary levels of OT, brain responses to perceived ingroup pain, and revenge propensity to bring physical harm to the outgroup. These measures allowed us to investigate the neurobiological correlates of how harm to an ingroup member caused by an outgroup member inspires an uninvolved ingroup member to punish outgroup members.</p><p>On the basis of the findings of increased endogenous OT immediately before and during border patrols and intergroup encounters in chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Samuni et al., 2017</xref>), we hypothesized that endogenous OT in humans is also sensitive to intergroup conflict and that salivary levels of OT would increase in the Revenge compared to Control groups. As brain regions in both the empathy network and the theory-of-mind network express OT receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Macdonald and Macdonald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boccia et al., 2013</xref>), and as activities in both networks are modulated by administered OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sabihi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eckstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), activities in both networks in response to ingroup members' pain may be associated with endogenous OT in the context of intergroup conflict that involves physical harm. We tested this hypothesis by conducting whole-brain analyses of neural responses to perceived ingroup pain. Specifically, we searched for brain regions in which salivary levels of OT predicted activity in response to ingroup pain caused by a member of the outgroup. Our whole-brain analyses revealed that salivary levels of OT were associated with mPFC activity in the Revenge group. Accordingly, we further tested whether the mPFC activity predicted propensity to punish outgroup members and mediated the association between endogenous OT and revenge propensity. The results of these analyses allowed us to test the association between endogenous OT and mPFC responses to ingroup pain as a neurobiological correlate of revenge propensity during intergroup conflict. To provide a broad test of the neurobiological underpinnings of revenge propensity, we also examined whether the tendency to retaliate against outgroup members who are not directly involved in the conflict, which has been termed ‘vicarious retribution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lickel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gelfand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), has the same neurobiological association.</p><p>In the text below, after describing our experimental design, we first present behavioral results that show comparable ingroup biases in emotions and attitudes in the Revenge and Control groups. We then examine whether the Revenge group, when compared to the Control group, showed higher endogenous OT levels after witnessing ingroup members' pain caused by outgroup members. Thereafter, we report the results of whole-brain analyses that identified neural responses to outgroup-inflicted ingroup pain, which were predicted by salivary levels of OT. Finally, we report evidence for the association between revenge propensity and mPFC activity in response to ingroup pain caused by the outgroup, as well as evidence that the mPFC activity mediates the association between endogenous OT and revenge propensity. These results together suggest an association between endogenous OT and mPFC activity in response to ingroup pain as a neurobiological correlate of revenge propensity during intergroup conflict.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral paradigm</title><p>We developed a new behavioral paradigm to examine neurobiological associations of the key component of revenge behavior (i.e., the punishment of the outgroup in response to physical harm to the ingroup caused by the outgroup) while the effects of ingroup biases in emotions and attitudes were controlled. We adopted a between-subjects design by recruiting two independent samples of healthy adults to test our hypotheses.</p><p>The paradigm for the Revenge group (n = 40, all males) had three phases and six players (four participants and two confederates). In <italic>Phase 1</italic>, the six players played a game to form an ingroup and an outgroup. Each group consisted of one confederate and two participants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Phase two</italic> introduced initial conflict by inviting the participants to watch an ingroup member (Involved_Ingroup target) and an outgroup member (Involved_Outgroup target), both played by the confederates, interacting in a competitive game, during which the winner gave painful or non-painful electric shocks to the rival. In <italic>Phase 3</italic>, the participants underwent fMRI scanning. In four scans, they were informed that Involved_Ingroup and Involved_Outgroup targets continued the competitive game and applied shocks to each other. During each trial, the participants first viewed a photo of the Involved_Ingroup or the Involved_Outgroup target to indicate that the loser of one trial and had to judge his group identity (i.e., ingroup or outgroup) by pressing a button. A lightning (or round) symbol was then displayed to inform the participant of the winner’s decision to give a painful (or non-painful) shock, and this was followed by an image of the target’s face with a painful or neutral expression to indicate that the target was experiencing a painful or non-painful shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Because group members during intergroup conflict are often regarded as an entity of interchangeable members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lickel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), we also examined generic neurobiological associations of tendencies to retaliate against outgroup members regardless of their direct involvement in conflict. To this end, in an additional four fMRI scans, the participants were presented with photos of an ingroup and an outgroup member who were not directly involved in the conflict (Uninvolved_Ingroup and Uninvolved_Outgroup targets) and judged their group identity before viewing their painful or neutral expressions. After fMRI scanning, the participants were asked to report how willing they were to punish a target by giving painful shocks (1 = not painful at all, 9 = extremely painful) to estimate their tendencies to punish outgroup members.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental procedure and behavioral results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental procedure.

By comparing the OT results for the Revenge and Control groups, we sought to determine whether endogenous OT increases immediately after initially witnessing an intergroup conflict (Time 1), and whether such effects, if observed, would be enlarged after additional experiences of intergroup conflict (Time 2). We also assessed whether the level of endogenous OT predicted brain responses to perceived ingroup suffering during intergroup conflict. Finally, we examined whether brain responses to ingroup pain mediate the association between endogenous OT and individuals' inclinations to seek revenge by giving painful electric shocks to outgroup members.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Punishment tendencies in Revenge and Control groups</title><p>Revenge and Control groups were matched in age, education, and psychological traits (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for the demographic information and psychological traits of the participants). In order to assess the effect of the key component of revenge (i.e., the punishment of outgroup members for harm that they inflict on ingroup members), we controlled other concomitant but nonessential factors by collecting self-reports of emotions, attitudes, and punishment tendencies. After the group formation in Phase 1, participants in the Revenge and Control groups reported similar ingroup favoritism in feelings of closeness (Ingroup vs. Outgroup: 4.72 ± 0.98 vs. 3.27 ± 0.99; F(1,86) = 136.23, p&lt;0.001, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.613).

Specifically, we conducted a bootstrapping analysis to illustrate a greater increase in OT level from Time-1 to Time-2 and a greater decrease of OT level from Time-2 to Time-3 in the Revenge compared to Control group. To do this, we calculated increased OT levels by subtracting measures at Time-1 and Time-3 from those at Time-2 for each participant. Thereafter, a bootstrapped data set in each group was nonparametrically resampled with replacement (i.e., a participant could be selected more than once). The mean of this bootstrapped sample was then calculated and plotted as one of the points (x, y) in a panel with the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes showing OT increases measured at Time-2 relative to those at Time-1 and Time-3, respectively. The same procedure was repeated 1000 times for each participating group to estimate the population means and variations.

The mean distance between the two samples is 32.29, with a 95% confidence interval of 11.55–54.61. We conducted another modified bootstrapping analysis to assess whether the increased OT level related to experiences of conflict that were measured in half of the participants randomly selected from each group can be replicated in the unselected participants.

Accordingly, we first conducted a whole-brain regression analysis to examine whether OT levels at Time-1 predicts the brain responses to perceived ingroup pain. As discussed below, this analysis revealed an association between the mPFC activity and OT level at Time-1 in the Revenge group. In order to then estimate whether the OT-mPFC association was specific to OT levels at Time-1, we conducted a second whole-brain regression analysis to examine brain responses to ingroup pain that were associated with endogenous OT measured after fMRI scanning at Time-2.

The first mediation analysis examined whether the mPFC activity in response to Involved_Ingroup targets' pain mediates the relationship between the OT level at Time-1 and the tendency to punish Involved_Outgroup targets. In Step 1 of the mediation model, the regression of the OT level on punishment tendency toward an Involved_Outgroup target was not significant (b = 0.16, t(35) = 0.94, p=0.355) when not considering the mediator (e.g., the mPFC activity).

The results of these mediation analyses provide additional evidence for the endogenous-OT/mPFC association as a neurobiological correlate of revenge propensity during intergroup conflict.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Revenge behavior is universal and highly costly. Accordingly, understanding its neurobiological bases is of critical theoretical and practical importance. Revenge behavior during intergroup conflict engages multiple psychological processes from perceiving ingroup suffering to making aggressive decisions toward outgroups. Our research focused on how neurobiological responses to ingroup pain are related to revenge decisions during intergroup conflict. Although multiple motives are involved in vengeful behaviors during intergroup conflict, we compared salivary OT and brain activity in the Revenge and Control groups. This design allowed us to isolate the neurobiological responses to perceived ingroup suffering resulting from physical harm caused by an outgroup member and its association with seeking revenge through physical harm upon outgroup members.</p><p>Previous research has reported endogenous OT reactivity during intergroup conflict in wild chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Samuni et al., 2017</xref>), but we showed the first evidence of increased levels of endogenous OT in humans during intergroup conflict that involves physical harm to ingroups caused by an outgroup. The salivary OT level in humans is affected by affiliative contact and is interrelated with the plasma OT level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feldman et al., 2011</xref>). Our results complement previous research on the effect of intranasal OT administration on ingroup cooperation and outgroup defensive competition in economic games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Dreu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Dreu et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, our findings suggest that endogenous OT is an influential physiological mechanism in humans that is activated in response to intergroup conflicts that involve physical harm between ingroup and outgroup members. It is worth noting that, similar to the finding in chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Samuni et al., 2017</xref>), our results suggest that endogenous OT increases after initially witnessing intergroup conflict (e.g., at Time-1). It appears that, in both humans and chimpanzees, the oxytocinergic system quickly responds to intergroup conflict. In addition, the endogenous OT increased more after further witnessing intergroup conflict (e.g., at Time-2) and dropped when intergroup conflict had ended (e.g., at Time-3). These results illustrate dynamic changes of endogenous OT that occur throughout the entire duration of an intergroup conflict.</p><p>Our results also revealed intermediate brain mechanisms linking endogenous OT reactivity to perceived intergroup conflict and revenge propensity during intergroup conflict. Unlike previous research that focused on increased neural activity following aggressive decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seymour et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krämer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krueger and Hoffman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chester and DeWall, 2016</xref>), our work showed that the mPFC activity in response to ingroup pain predicted the propensity for subsequent revenge behavior during intergroup conflict. The mPFC is well-known for its functional role in representing mental states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amodio and Frith, 2006</xref>), social emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris and Fiske, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mathur et al., 2010</xref>), and group identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Volz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Molenberghs and Morrison, 2014</xref>). Our results further revealed that the neurobiological association between endogenous OT and mPFC activity in response to Involved_Ingroup targets' suffering is related to propensity to punish outgroup members, regardless of whether the outgroup members were directly involved in the conflict. This cross-group brain-propensity association is different from previous findings of a within-group brain-propensity association in an intergroup context without direct conflict. That is, neural responses to ingroup pain predict tendencies to help ingroup members, or neural responses to outgroup pain predict tendencies not to help outgroup members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cikara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mathur et al., 2010</xref>). Our results cast a new perspective on the neural underpinnings that drive decisions to apply physical harm toward outgroups during intergroup conflict. More generally, the cross-group brain-propensity association suggests a potential neural mechanism underlying the <italic>contagion</italic> of revenge behavior, and may help us to understand why disputes between two individuals can escalate across groups and across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gelfand et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our findings make fundamental contributions to the intergroup conflict literature and, in particular, towards understanding the neurobiological associations of ingroup love and outgroup hate. Intergroup conflict plays a substantial role in the evolution of both aggressiveness against outgroup and cooperativeness towards ingroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rusch, 2014</xref>). Although previous studies have demonstrated the role of OT and mPFC activity in altruistic decisions favoring the ingroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Dreu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mathur et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Dreu et al., 2011</xref>), our results suggest that the context of intergroup conflict may shift the key function of the oxytocinergic system from mediating ingroup love (a desire to help the ingroup) to facilitating outgroup hate (an aggressive motivation to hurt the outgroup). Such variation in the social function of OT may assist individuals to adapt to changing social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shamay-Tsoory and Abu-Akel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike previous research that focused on increased activity in the reward system as a consequence of aggressive decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krämer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chester and DeWall, 2016</xref>), our findings highlight a neurobiological association between endogenous OT and the mPFC that occurs prior to but is linked to revenge propensity during intergroup conflicts. Our results open a new avenue toward understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate aggression-related hormones and social decisions related to intergroup hostility, and provide a neuroscientific account of revenge motives during intergroup conflict.</p><p>The revenge propensity shown in the Revenge group cannot simply be explained by OT-induced negative emotions. Increasing evidence suggests that the oxytocinergic system is involved in modulating multiple social emotions that are either positively (e.g., empathy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sheng et al., 2013</xref>) or negatively (e.g., schadenfreude, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009</xref>) related to social behaviors. Our participants from both the Revenge and Control groups reported greater schadenfreude when viewing outgroup suffering rather than ingroup suffering. Schadenfreude has been linked to striatum activation induced by misfortunes happening to envied persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>). Although previous research has shown that viewing outgroup pain can activate the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and greater NAcc activity predicted less motivation to help outgroup members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luo et al., 2015</xref>), neither the Revenge group nor the Control group in our work showed activations in the reward system when viewing outgroup members' suffering. Thus, negative emotion such as schadenfreude may play a minimal role in modulating revenge propensity in our experimental settings.</p><p>Although our measures of endogenous OT and brain activity suggest that the association between endogenous OT and mPFC activity in response to perceived ingroup suffering is related to revenge tendencies, we noted that the latter were estimated by self-reports. It is unclear whether such measures were actually correlated with revengeful behavior. To test this, we conducted an independent behavioral experiment in a new sample (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary files 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">11</xref>). The experimental procedures were the same as those in our fMRI experiment except that Phase three was modified in the following way. While viewing Involved_Ingroup and Involved_Outgroup targets who played the competitive game with each other (Revenge group) or with a computer (Control group), participants were occasionally (in four trials, two on Involved_Ingroup targets and two on Involved_Outgroup targets) asked to make punishment decisions by deciding the intensity on a Likert Scale (1 = not painful at all, 9 = extremely painful) of electric shocks that were believed to be inflicted on the targets. To enhance participants' beliefs about the experimental setting, they only viewed Involved_Ingroup and Involved_Outgroup targets during the game and they made punishment decisions simultaneously but in different rooms. Moreover, after each punishment decision, a feedback face with either painful or neutral expression, depending on a participant's decision, was presented to inform the participant of the consequence of his decision. The results showed evidence that the measures of punishment tendencies were positively correlated with the measures of actual punishment decisions toward Involved_Outgroup target in both Revenge and Control groups (r = 0.75 and 0.70, FDR corrected ps &lt;0.001). These results indicate that our measures of punishment tendencies can, to a certain degree, reflect individuals' punishment decisions with real consequences.</p><p>Our findings also raise new questions about the role of other brain regions in the process of revenge. For example, recent research has shown that, in a scenario in which an observer punishes transgressors due to social norm violation (i.e., third-party punishment), the willingness to punish severely was associated with increased amygdala activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stallen et al., 2018</xref>), possibly reflecting the encoding of affective arousal associated with harm done to someone else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buckholtz and Marois, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krueger and Hoffman, 2016</xref>). The current work, however, did not find evidence of an association between amygdala activity and punishment tendencies during intergroup conflict. It is possible that punishment decisions toward outgroup in the context of intergroup conflict are justified as revenge that reduces ingroup suffering and thus bring less negative arousal. Future research is needed to support this speculation.</p><p>Our work also expands the literature to examine neural responses that are implicated in vicarious revenge, which occurs when a person punishes an outgroup member who is not one of the direct causal agents in the original attack against an ingroup member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lickel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gelfand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Neither the agent of retaliation nor the target of retribution is directly involved in the original conflict during vicarious retribution, similar to the punishment of Uninvolved-Outgroup targets in our work. We showed that the mPFC activity in response to ingroup pain similarly predicted punishment tendencies toward Involved-Outgroup targets and Uninvolved-Outgroup targets. The mPFC activity also mediated the relationship between endogenous OT and tendency to punish Involved_Outgroup targets, as well as the relationship between endogenous OT and tendency to punish Uninvolved_Outgroup targets. Thus, our findings suggest a neurobiological correlate of punishment tendency during intergroup conflict that does not differentiate between direct and indirect vicarious retribution. This is a possible result of the fact that outgroup members are perceived as a unified and coherent entity and share the same blameworthy qualities during intergroup conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McConnell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crawford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, by integrating a neural-behavioral paradigm with fMRI, we provided evidence that intergroup conflict is associated with increased salivary levels of OT in humans, which further predicted stronger mPFC activity in response to ingroup suffering caused by an outgroup member. Moreover, the mPFC activity mediates the association between endogenous OT and propensity to seek revenge by giving painful electric shocks to outgroup members. Our findings highlight the coupling of the OT system and the mPFC as a neurobiological correlate of revenge propensity during intergroup conflict. Our paradigm can be applied to other samples (e.g., females) and cultures (e.g., where individualism is more dominant) to advance our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of revenge propensity and behavior during intergroup conflict.</p><p>Finally, because other motivations also drive revenge behavior in intergroup contexts, including feeling threat to group pride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Turner and Tajfel, 1986</xref>), empathy for the harmed ingroup members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis, 2018</xref>), and normative pressure to avenge the ingroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deutsch and Gerard, 1955</xref>), future research should examine different motivations driving revenge and concomitant emotions that become activated in a host of revenge situations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Our fMRI experiment recruited 44 male Chinese university students for Revenge Group (mean age ± SD = 23.27 ± 2.76 years) and 44 male Chinese university students for Control Group (mean age ± SD = 23.89 ± 2.16 years). Four participants from each group were excluded from fMRI data analyses due to their excessive head movements during scanning, leaving 40 participants in each group being included for data analyses (Revenge Group: mean age ± SD = 23.20 ± 2.78 years; Control Group: mean age ± SD = 23.70 ± 2.03 years). Our behavioral experiment recruited independent samples of 40 male Chinese university students for the Revenge Group (mean age ± SD = 22.50±2.75 years) and 39 male Chinese university students for the Control Group (mean age ± SD = 21.56 ± 2.23 years, one participant from the Control group dropped out and was substituted by an additional confederate). Demographic information and psychological traits of Revenge and Control groups are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. All participants were right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and reported no neurological or psychiatric history. All participants were paid for their participation.

Because we aimed to assess the association between brain activity in response to perceived ingroup members’ suffering and retaliation upon outgroup members, the first power analysis estimated the sample size that allowed the detection of reliable brain activities in response to others’ pain (e.g., the contrast of painful vs. neutral expressions). On the basis of the previous fMRI study of empathy for pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2017</xref>), the effect size of brain activities (including aMCC, bilateral AI and bilateral SII) in response to others' suffering was between 0.39 and 0.84 (a middle effect size). On the basis of G*Power estimation, a sample size of 34 participants for each group was required to obtain a middle effect size of 0.5 with an error probability of 0.05 and power of 0.80 in paired t-tests (two-tails).</p><p>Because there is no previous research allowing us to conduct an experience-based estimation of the effect size of Revenge/Control group difference in salivary OT level, we selected a middle effect size of 0.25 for sample size estimation. To test the difference in endogenous OT levels between the Revenge and Control groups, we planned to conduct an ANOVA with Time (Time-1, -2, -3) as a within-subjects variable and Group (Revenge vs. Control) as a between-subjects variable. To detect a significant main effect of Group required a total sample size of 86 with an error probability of 0.05 and power of 0.8, given the correlation among repeated measures (0.5). To detect a significant interaction between Time and Group required a total sample size of 28 with an error probability of 0.05 and power of 0.8, given the correlation among repeated measures (0.5) and the nonsphericity correction (1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral and imaging procedures</title><p>On each testing day, four participants and two confederates were recruited.

One ID photo with neutral expression was used for estimation of attitudes and judgments of group identity. The ID photo and other two photos with neutral or painful expressions were used during fMRI scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The photos were taken by asking participants to show a neutral expression or a painful expression (asking participants to imagine a painful experience), which was characterized by facial movements including brow lowering, orbit tightening, and raising of the upper lip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prkachin, 1992</xref>). The photos from all participants were modified to the same size (400 × 600 pixels for ID-photos and 400 × 500 pixels for the two photos with neutral or painful expressions).</p><p>All participants including confederates were asked to complete questionnaires to estimate self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>), extroversion-introversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eysenck and Eysenck, 1975</xref>), self-construal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Singelis, 1994</xref>), individualism/collectivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Triandis and Gelfand, 1998</xref>), trait empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis, 1983</xref>), and trait aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buss and Perry, 1992</xref>). Subjective socioeconomic status was assessed using a ladder with 10 rungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kilpatrick and Cantril, 1960</xref>). The participants were informed that they would be divided into two groups on the basis of the results of questionnaire measures, though they were actually randomly assigned to two groups so that there were one confederate and two participants in each group.</p><p>Participants from each group were asked to wear T-shirts of the same color (red or blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Participants introduced their own names, nicknames, majors, and hobbies so that they became familiar with each other. Participants then started to play the <italic>Saboteur</italic> card game (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.annarbor.com/entertainment/saboteur-card-game-review/">http://www.annarbor.com/entertainment/saboteur-card-game-review/</ext-link>). During this game, ingroup members played cards to build a tunnel to a destination where gold is located or to block the tunnel to prevent outgroup members from reaching the goal. This game required ingroup members to cooperate with each other but to interfere with outgroup members so as to reach the destination before the outgroup. The intergroup relationship was built by playing this game for 90 min. To check the effectiveness of the group manipulation, after the game, participants were asked to complete a modified version of the Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aron et al., 1992</xref>) to assess their feelings of closeness between oneself and ingroup members, and between oneself and outgroup members. Phase 1 lasted for 160 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Phase 2: inducing intergroup conflict</title><p>After Phase 1, a participant was led to another test room where the two confederates in representation of each group were supposed to be playing a competitive game. During this game, the two confederates performed the classic Stroop task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stroop, 1935</xref>) by responding to colors of words by button presses. Participants from the Revenge Group were informed that the two confederates (one from the ingroup and one from the outgroup) competed with each other to make the most correct responses. After three trials, the winner who made more correct responses or responded faster then decided whether to give the rival a painful electric shock (as an index of aggression). A pair of foil electrodes connected to an instrument (DS7A Digitimer) for generation of electric shocks and the left hand of each confederate. The participants witnessed that the confederate who won first pressed a button on the instrument to give a non-painful shock to the loser and the confederate who lost showed a neutral expression. Another confederate who won later, however, chose to give a painful shock to the loser by saying ‘I am curious about how painful an electric shock can be’. The confederate who received the electric shock then showed a painful expression to indicate that he was experiencing painful feelings. These confederates' performances provided a cue of how intergroup conflict was initiated. Participants from the Control Group were informed that each confederate performed the Stroop task on his own. After three trials, the confederate who performed worse than a standard (with 30% accuracy and reaction times shorter than 2000 ms or with 100% accuracy and reaction times shorter than 300 ms) would receive a painful or non-painful electric shock randomly given by a computer. One confederate illustrated receiving a painful shock and the other confederate illustrated receiving a non-painful shock. Phase 2 lasted for 15 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Phase 3: viewing intergroup conflict and reporting punishment tendencies</title><p>Before being transported into the MRI scanner, the participant was informed that the two confederates in the test room (one ingroup member and one outgroup member, i.e., the Involved_Ingroup and Involved_Outgroup targets, respectively) would keep playing the game and the winner would decide whether to give the loser a painful or non-painful shock. The participant would be able to see a photo of the loser's face, indicating that he was experiencing painful or non-painful feelings, while inside the scanner. During four fMRI scans, a fixation was first presented with its duration varying among 2 s, 4 s, 6 s and 8 s on each trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). An ID-photo of the Involved_Ingroup or Involved_Outgroup target was then presented for 2 s to indicate the person who lost the game. The participant had to judge whether the ID-photo showed an ingroup or an outgroup member by pressing one of two buttons on a response box (the relationship between left/right buttons and ingroup/outgroup members was counter-balanced across participants). Thereafter, the winner's choice, either a yellow circle to indicate a non-painful shock or a yellow lightning symbol to indicate a painful shock, was presented for 2 s. After a fixation with a duration varying among 2 s, 4 s, 6 s and 8 s, a photo of the loser's face was presented for 2 s to indicate being shocked (a photo with neutral expression indicated receiving a non-painful shock and a photo with painful expression indicated receiving a painful shock). The participant was asked to view the photo without any response. The ID-photos, lightning (and round) symbols and photos with expression, were subtended with a visual angle of 7.58° × 11.35°, 3.79° × 3.79°and 7.58° × 9.47° (width ×height) at a viewing distance of 80 cm. Each scan started with a 6 s fixation, and a task instruction was presented for 10 s followed by 16 trials. The procedure was programmed so that both the Involved_Ingroup and the Involved_Outgroup targets lost the game in half of the trials and, when losing the game, received painful shocks in half of the trials and non-painful shocks in the other trials. The trials in which a target received painful or non-painful shocks were presented in a random order.</p><p>The participant was also informed that, when Involved_Ingroup and Involved_Outgroup targets took a break during the competitive game, the participants had to perform a task to discriminate an ingroup member and an outgroup member who were not involved in the competitive game (Uninvolved_Ingroup and Uninvolved_Outgroup targets, respectively). In each trial, a fixation was first presented with its duration varying among 2 s, 4 s, 6 s and 8 s. An ID-photo of an Uninvolved_Ingroup or an Uninvolved_Outgroup target was then presented for 2 s. The participant had to judge whether the ID-photo showed an ingroup or an outgroup member by pressing one of two buttons on a response box. Thereafter, a photo of the target with neutral or painful expression was presented for 2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The participant was asked to view the photo without any response. Similarly, there were four scans during which participants viewed Uninvolved_Ingroup and Uninvolved_Outgroup targets. Each scan started with a 6 s fixation, and task instruction was presented for 10 s followed by 16 trials. The procedure was programmed so that both Uninvolved_Ingroup and Uninvolved_Outgroup targets showed painful expressions in half of the trials and showed neutral expressions in the other trials.</p><p>The scanning procedure was divided into two sessions. In each session, there were two scans when participants viewed Involved_Ingroup and Involved_Outgroup targets and two scans when participants viewed Uninvolved_Ingroup and Uninvolved_Outgroup targets. The order of the four scans in each session was counterbalanced across participants. After the first session, the participants were presented with photos of painful expressions of the four targets (Involved_Ingroup, Involved_Outgroup, Uninvolved_Ingroup, and Uninvolved_Outgroup) and rated their emotions for each target on a Likert Scale (1 = not at all, 9 = extremely strong) in response to the following questions: 'How painful do you think the target was?', ‘How uncomfortable were you when viewing the target's pain?', ‘How angry were you when viewing the target's pain?', ‘How fearful were you when viewing the target's pain?', and ‘How happy were you when viewing the target's pain?'. After the second session, the participants were presented with ID photos of the four targets and had to rate their attitudes toward the targets on a Likert Scale (1 = not at all, 9 = extremely) in response to the following questions: ‘How much do you trust the target?’ and ‘How much do you like the target?'. The participants were also asked to report their punishment tendencies by selecting the intensity of an electric shock that they would like to apply to the loser on a Likert Scale (1 = not painful at all, 9 = intolerably painful). The order of the rating tasks was counter-balanced across participants. Phase 3 lasted for 60 min for each participant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Measures of endogenous OT</title><p>Participants were asked to not drink alcohol, caffeine, or medication within the 24 hr prior to their participation. Participants were asked to rinse their mouths with water immediately after lunch. Saliva was collected from each participant at three points in time. The first collection was conducted at the end of Phase 2 (e.g., after the introduction of intergroup conflict, Time-1). The second collection was conducted immediately after Phase three outside the scanner (i.e., after viewing intergroup conflict and reporting punishment tendencies during fMRI scanning, Time-3), and the third collection was conducted 15 min later (Time-3). Participants were asked to place a roll of cotton in their mouths and to chew on it for a minute until it became saturated. The roll of cotton was then placed in a Salivette (Sarstedt, Rommelsdorft, Germany). The samples were stored at −20°C until assayed. OT levels were assayed using a 96-plate commercial OT-ELISA kit (ADI-900-153A; Enzo Life Science). Measurements were performed in duplicate according to the kit’s instructions, similar to the procedures used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Ijzendoorn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhandari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsuji et al., 2015</xref>). The optical density of the samples and standards was measured at wavelengths of 405 nm, with correction between 570 nm and 590 nm. A four-parameter logistics curve fitting program was used for the calculation of the concentration of OT in the samples. Owing to the failure of OT measurements on a few participants, 37 and 40 participants were left in the Revenge and Control groups, respectively, for all further analyses related to OT levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>fMRI data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Brain images were acquired using a 3.0T GE Signa MR750 scanner (GE Healthcare; Waukesha, WI) with a standard eight channel head coil. Functional images were acquired by using T2-weighted, gradient-echo, echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences sensitive to blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals (64 × 64 × 32 matrix with 3.75 × 3.75 × 5 mm<sup>3</sup> spatial resolution, repetition time = 2000 ms, echo time = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, field of view = 24 × 24 cm). A high-resolution T1-weighted structural image (512 × 512 × 180 matrix with a spatial resolution of 0.47 × 0.47 × 1.0 mm<sup>3</sup>, repetition time = 8.204 ms, echo time = 3.22 ms, flip angle = 12°) was acquired after the first four scans. Padded clamps were used to minimize head motion and earplugs were used to attenuate scanner noise. The stimuli were projected onto a screen at the head of the magnet bore using Presentation. Participants viewed the screen through a mirror attached to the head coil.</p><p>Functional images were preprocessed using SPM8 software (the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). Head movements were corrected within each run and six movement parameters (translation; x, y, z and rotation; pitch, roll, yaw) were extracted for further analysis in the statistical model. The functional images were resampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup> voxels, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template space and then spatially smoothed using an isotropic of 8 mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. Four participants from each group (i.e., Revenge and Control groups) were excluded from fMRI data analysis because their head movements exceeded 5 mm. Hence, 40 subjects in each group were included in further fMRI data analysis, which was identical for the Revenge and Control groups. In the first general linear model (GLM), brain activations were estimated using eight onset regressors to identify brain activations in response to painful vs. neutral expressions. These included 1) ID photos of Involved_Ingroup and Uninvolved_Ingroup targets; 2) ID photos of Involved_Outgroup and Uninvolved_Outgroup targets; 3) the symbol of painful shocks for involved targets, or the 2 s fixation for uninvolved targets; 4) the symbol of non-painful shocks for involved targets, or the 2 s fixation for uninvolved targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); 5) photos of painful expressions of Involved_Ingroup and Uninvolved_Ingroup targets; 6) photos of neutral expressions of Involved_Ingroup and Uninvolved_Ingroup targets; 7) photos of painful expressions of Involved_Outgroup and Uninvolved_Outgroup targets; and 8) photos of neutral expressions of Involved_Outgroup and Uninvolved_Outgroup targets.</p><p>We conducted separate GLM analyses of involved targets (using the above onset regressors but distinguishing the symbols of painful/non-painful shocks for Involved_Ingroup and Involved_Outgroup targets) and uninvolved targets for the whole-brain regression analysis of the effect of endogenous OT and region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. The GLMs included the realignment parameters to account for any residual movement-related effect. The voxels showing significant event-related responses to painful vs. neutral expressions were created using a canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF). Here, our fMRI analyses locked BOLD responses to the onset of facial expressions rather than symbols of shock decisions because we focused on the relationship between OT-level and empathic neural responses to targets' pain. The onset of a symbol of a shock decision indicated what type of shocks (painful or nonpainful) the winner was going to give to the loser. The onset of a face with a painful or nonpainful expression indicated the time when the target started to receive a painful or nonpainful shock and an emotional (painful or nonpainful) response was initiated. A whole-brain random effect analysis was then conducted to reveal brain regions that showed reliable responses to painful vs. neutral expressions of all targets. Brain activations were defined using a voxel-level threshold of p&lt;0.001, uncorrected and cluster-level threshold of p&lt;0.05, FWE corrected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>ROI analyses</title><p>ROI analyses were conducted to test (1) ingroup favoritism in neural responses to perceived pain, (2) group differences in the association between endogenous OT and mPFC activity in response to Involved_Ingroup target’s pain, and (3) the correlation between mPFC activity in response to Involved_Ingroup target’s pain and punishment propensity towards outgroup members. ROI analyses were also conducted in the mediation analyses that tested the mediation role of mPFC activity in response to an Involved_Ingroup target’s pain in the association between endogenous OT and punishment tendency towards outgroup members. To define the coordinates of ROIs independently, a leave-one-out test in which whole-brain analyses of the contrast of painful vs. neutral expressions which collapsed all the targets was conducted using 79 of the 80 participants from the two subject groups using a combined voxel-level threshold of p&lt;0.001, uncorrected and cluster-level threshold of p&lt;0.05, FWE corrected. ROI coordinates were defined at the peak voxel the corresponding brain regions for the left-out participant.

To do this, we estimated four regression models: 1) whether the independent variable (OT) significantly accounts for the dependent variable (punishment tendency) when not considering the mediator (e.g., Path c'); 2) whether the independent variable (OT) significantly accounts for the variance of the presumed mediator (mPFC activity) (e.g., Path a); 3) whether the presumed mediator (mPFC activity) significantly accounts for the variance of the dependent variable (punishment tendency) when controlling the independent variable (OT) (e.g., Path b); and 4) whether the independent variable (OT) significantly accounts for the variance of the dependent variable (punishment tendency) when controlling the presumed mediator (mPFC activity) (e.g., Path c). To establish the mediation, the path c' is not required to be significant, and the only requirement is that the indirect effect a x b is significant. Given a significant indirect effect, if Path c is insignificant, the mediation is classified as indirect-only mediation, which is the strongest full mediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kenny et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). A bootstrapping method was used to estimate the mediation effect.

Rather than imposing questionable distributional assumptions, bootstrapping generates an empirical approximation of the sampling distribution of a statistic by repeated random resampling from the available data, and uses this distribution to calculate p-values and to construct confidence intervals. 5000 resamples were taken for our analyses. Moreover, this procedure supplies superior confidence intervals (CIs) that are bias-corrected and accelerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Preacher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Preacher and Hayes, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Preacher and Hayes, 2008b</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Floris de Lange as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Carsten De Dreu (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well-designed study investigating neural mechanisms of revenge propensity. The study includes a manipulation to induce in-group/out-group attitudes and subsequently measures fMRI responses to images of painful faces depicting in- and out-group members, with (participants are made to belief) pain inflicted to in-group members by either an out-group member or a computer (control group). The study additionally includes pre-post measures of endogenous oxytocin. The study thus includes several different dependent measures (behavioral, neural, hormonal) and many experimental variables. The elaborate design allows for controlling factors of non-interest. The key result is that humans respond stronger -- behaviorally, hormonally, and neurally -- to punishment of in-group compared to out-group members, that such stronger responding can be best typified as empathy-based, and that such empathy-for-ingroup-pain predict retaliatory responding to out-group members. Overall, the paper reports an interesting set of results, bringing together insights from various literatures on (revenge propensity during) intergroup conflict. Both the fMRI and the endogenous oxytocin results are novel contributions in themselves, and the combination is unique.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Having such an elaborate design creates a challenge for conducting and reporting the analyses. These complexities made it difficult to digest what exactly was done when, why and how, and what analyses were performed (and why). There are so many possible ways to analyze the data that this needs to be done in a very principled manner, with each analysis well-motivated (related to main hypotheses) and including the relevant control conditions. There is a risk of selectively reporting only the significant results and it is easy to lose the reader in the many variables, interactions, mediation models etc. The paper would benefit from relaxing the write-up and some re-organization of (grouping together) analyses and results. One possibility is to report liking ratings and behavioral revenge measures first, with a pointed summary. Subsequently all analyses pertaining to oxytocin. Then all analyses pertaining to neuro-imaging. Only then analyses pertaining to the linkages between revenge and oxytocin, and oxytocin and neural activity. Other, even better, organization may be possible.</p><p>The fMRI reporting moves back-and-forth between whole-brain analyses and ROI-based contrasts, and results are difficult to digest. Again, the writing may be relaxed a bit to &quot;take the reader by the hand&quot; and interim summary statements may help.</p><p>2) The link between the specific hypotheses, reported analyses, and the theoretical background should be clarified and returned to in the Results section when motivating the analyses. The Introduction contrasts possible roles of the empathy network and the theory-of-mind network, but the hypotheses are not specified at that level (only mentioning &quot;brain activity&quot;); the analyses similarly don't compare the involvement of these networks directly. The whole brain contrasts to painful&gt;neutral expressions, revealing both the empathy and theory-of-mind networks would seem to be of central importance but is now presented as a supplementary figure. These regions could possibly be used as ROIs to test how these two networks are modulated by the manipulated variables.</p><p>3) The OT results differ greatly between groups, already at T1 where there should be no group difference (if I understood the design correctly). It looks like the OT measures for the Revenge group are all doubled relative to the Control group. This makes any subsequent analysis involving OT group comparisons (including some of the key results of the paper) problematic, also because the variability in the Control group at T1 is much smaller than in the Revenge group. Why does this not invalidate the analyses involving OT measures?</p><p>Furthermore, it is quite surprising that all correlations/mediations are based on OT in time 1. Should this not be with OT (time 2 minus time 1) which reflects ingroup pain induced OT change? For the main effect, the authors used Time 2 minus Time 1 to support &quot;intergroup conflict encountered by Revenge group is associated with increased salivary level of oxytocin&quot;. Later, the authors only used results from Time 1 to support &quot;The medial prefrontal activity to ingroup pain mediates the association between endogenous oxytocin and propensity to seek revenge by giving painful electric shocks to outgroup&quot;. It is post hoc and not logical. Why it is baseline OT levels rather than changes in OT levels that predict mPFC activity?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52014.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Having such an elaborate design creates a challenge for conducting and reporting the analyses.

We believe that these modifications will help readers to understand the results in a more clear and coherent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The link between the specific hypotheses, reported analyses, and the theoretical background should be clarified and returned to in the Results section when motivating the analyses.

We have now made the theoretical background clear for each specific hypothesis before reporting our analyses and results. We are also specific now in the Introduction regarding our hypotheses that empathy and theory-of mind networks are associated with endogenous OT. As we discuss in the Introduction, OT receptors have been observed in both networks and additional research has illustrated that nasal administration of OT affected activities in both networks. These findings suggest that the brain activity in both networks in response to ingroup members' pain may be associated with endogenous OT. We conducted whole-brain regression analyses using salivary levels of OT as predictors to examine the association between endogenous OT and brain responses to perceived ingroup pain so as not to bias either the empathy network or the theory-of-mind network. This is clarified on in subsection “Endogenous OT predicts mPFC activity in response to ingroup pain”.</p><p>We moved the results of whole-brain analyses of neural responses to perceived pain into the main text, and as suggested by the reviewers, we conducted ROI analyses using the leave-one-out method to define ROI (to avoid double-dipping) to examine which (the empathy or theory-of-mind) network is modulated by ingroup/outgroup manipulation and by Revenge. These results are reported in the revision (subsection “Brain responses to perceived pain in Revenge and Control groups”). We believe these changes have significantly improved the manuscript.</p><p>Our work used whole-brain analyses to examine which brain regions are activated in response to ingroup pain, and as noted, we showed evidence that both the empathy and theory-of-mind networks were activated. However, we did not focus on which network was more strongly activated in response to ingroup pain because there are a number of issues that make it difficult to address this question appropriately. For example, there is the question of how to define ROIs that do not bias activities in different networks, how large an ROI should be for different nodes of a network and of different networks, among other issues. The conventional ROI analysis compares activity in an ROI between two different conditions rather than to compare activities in two different ROIs in the same condition. This is why we did not compare the activity of the two networks directly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The OT results differ greatly between groups, already at T1 where there should be no group difference (if I understood the design correctly). It looks like the OT measures for the Revenge group are all doubled relative to the Control group.

Why does this not invalidate the analyses involving OT measures? Furthermore, it is quite surprising that all correlations/mediations are based on OT in time 1. Should this not be with OT (time 2 minus time 1) which reflects ingroup pain induced OT change? For the main effect, the authors used Time 2 minus Time 1 to support &quot;intergroup conflict encountered by Revenge group is associated with increased salivary level of oxytocin&quot;. Later, the authors only used results from Time 1 to support &quot;The medial prefrontal activity to ingroup pain mediates the association between endogenous oxytocin and propensity to seek revenge by giving painful electric shocks to outgroup&quot;. It is post hoc and not logical. Why it is baseline OT levels rather than changes in OT levels that predict mPFC activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for these very important comments. We believe that there are three questions here:</p><p>Regarding Question 1(Why does OT-level at Time 1 differ between Revenge and Control groups?), we must clarify the timing of salivary collection in our experimental design. Saliva was collected at Time 1 <italic>after</italic> introducing the conflict situation to participants of the Revenge group. Importantly, we've made clear in the revision that the conflict situation was different between the Revenge and Control groups at Time 1. A participant in the Revenge group had observed an ingroup member and an outgroup member who competed with each other and applied painful/non-painful electric shocks to each other. By contrast, a participant in the Control group had observed an ingroup member and an outgroup member who play the game independently and received painful/non-painful electric shocks from a computer. Therefore, at Time 1, the Revenge and Control groups already had different experiences of intergroup conflict which enabled us to directly test the hypothesis that early experiences of intergroup conflict causes a rise in OT level at Time 1 as compared to a control condition. We apologize that we had not made this point more clear in the original submission, and we believe that Question 1 was asked because there was a misunderstanding that the Revenge and Control groups had the same experience at Time 1 (which they did not). We now make this very clear in the revision in subsection “Punishment tendencies in Revenge and Control groups” and “Measures of endogenous OT”. We reviewed critical research that has shown that urine oxytocin level was escalated immediately after one group of chimpanzees had encountered another group of chimpanzees (Samuni et al., 2017). Accordingly, our finding of OT-level difference at Time 1 between the Revenge and Control groups was part of our design and fully expected, and consistent with the finding of the chimpanzees (Samuni et al., 2017). More generally, the results of both chimpanzee and our study suggest that endogenous oxytocin may increase as early as the initial experience of group conflict (e.g., encountering outgroup in chimpanzees in Samuni et al. and viewing an outgroup member brought physical harm to an ingroup member in our work). We include additional discussion regarding Question 1 in the revised Discussion.</p><p>Regarding Question 2 (Why was the variability in OT-level at T1 smaller in the Control group than in the Revenge group?), we agree that it is critical to clarify whether the results of OT measures reflect our experimental manipulation or a technical problem with the OT analyses. To address this question, we analyzed the variability of OT-levels at three time points and across the two groups. This is critical because Question 2 and the related concern of our OT measures/analyses are based on the assumption that “the variability in OT-level at T1 smaller in the Control group than in the Revenge group”. Therefore, we conducted three nonparametric Levene tests for equal variances (Nordstokke, D. W., and Zumbo, B. D. (2010). A new nonparametric Levene test for equal variances. Psicológica, 31(2), 401-430.) to statistically examine the differences in standard deviation (SD) of OT levels at Time 1, 2 and 3 between the Revenge and Controls groups. The results showed that there was no significant difference in SD of OT levels between Revenge and Control groups (Time 1/Time2/Time3: F(1,75) = 2.53, 1.75, and 1.37, p = 0.116, 0.190, and 0.245). Thus the results indicate no evidence for the assumption that the variability of OT levels in the Control group were smaller than that in the Revenge group. Accordingly, we believe that the variability of the OT-level cannot invalidate our analyses involving OT measures. The impression that the variability in the Control group at T1 is much smaller than in the Revenge group was produced possibly because we did not make clear the meaning of Figure 2A, in which the vertical lines illustrate the maximum and minimum values rather than SD. We apologize for this. In the revision we modified Figure 3 so as to make clear the SD in different conditions by plotting the results in a different way. We hope that the new figure does not make confusions regarding the SD.</p><p>Regarding Question 3 (Why it is baseline OT levels rather than changes in OT levels that predict mPFC activity?), we should first clarify that OT level at Time 1 is not a baseline because the participants in the Revenge group had the initial experience of witnessing intergroup conflict at Time 1 whereas the Control group did not. To test the association between brain activity in response to ingroup pain and OT levels at Time 1 (after the initial experience of witnessing intergroup conflict) and Time 2 (after the whole fMRI scanning procedure) have different meanings. As we noted; &quot;If the association between endogenous OT to brain responses to ingroup pain serves as a neurobiological correlate of revenge propensity during intergroup conflict, endogenous OT after the initial intergroup conflict at Time 1 should predict subsequent brain responses to ingroup pain which may then further predict revenge propensity. Accordingly, we first conducted a whole-brain regression analysis to examine whether OT levels at Time 1 predicts the brain responses to perceived ingroup pain. As discussed below, this analysis revealed an association between the mPFC activity and OT level at Time 1 in the Revenge group. In order to then estimate whether the OT-mPFC association was specific to OT levels at time 1, we conducted a second whole-brain regression analysis to examine brain responses to ingroup pain that were associated with endogenous OT measured after fMRI scanning at Time 2.&quot; The results of our whole-brain regression and ROI-based moderation analyses suggest that intergroup conflict enhanced the link between endogenous OT at Time 1 and mPFC activity in response to ingroup pain. As we note, we also tested associations between OT level at Time 2 and brain responses to ingroup pain, but the results provided no evidence for revenge specific association between brain responses to ingroup pain and further changes of endogenous OT at Time 2. These results provide bases for further examination of the functional role of the mPFC activity in mediating the association between endogenous OT after initial experience and revenge propensity. We hope we have made these clear in the revision.</p></body></sub-article></article>
