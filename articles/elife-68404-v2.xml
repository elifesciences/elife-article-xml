exist to treat disease. The small membrane (M) protein plays well-defined roles during viral egress and remains within virion membranes following release and maturation. However, it is unclear whether M plays a functional role in this setting. Here, we show that M forms oligomeric membrane-permeabilising channels in vitro, with increased activity at acidic pH and sensitivity to the prototypic channel-blocker, rimantadine. Accordingly, rimantadine blocked an early stage of ZIKV cell culture infection. Structure-based channel models, comprising hexameric arrangements of two <italic>trans</italic>-membrane domain protomers were shown to comprise more stable assemblages than other oligomers using molecular dynamics simulations. Models contained a predicted lumenal rimantadine-binding site, as well as a second druggable target region on the membrane-exposed periphery. In silico screening enriched for repurposed drugs/compounds predicted to bind to either one site or the other. Hits displayed superior potency in vitro and in cell culture compared with rimantadine, with efficacy demonstrably linked to virion-resident channels. Finally, rimantadine effectively blocked ZIKV viraemia in preclinical models, supporting that M constitutes a physiologically relevant target. This could be explored by repurposing rimantadine, or development of new M-targeted therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>viroporin</kwd><kwd>rimantadine</kwd><kwd>Zika</kwd><kwd><italic>Flavivirus</italic></kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>virus entry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0700124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bentham</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000777</institution-id><institution>University of Leeds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LIMR Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name><name><surname>Lefteri</surname><given-names>Daniella A</given-names></name><name><surname>Foster</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><name><surname>Kalli</surname><given-names>Antreas C</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name><name><surname>McKimmie</surname><given-names>Clive S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_12014/8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donald</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name><name><surname>Kohl</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N017552/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donald</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name><name><surname>Kohl</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/T016205/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moran</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014013</institution-id><institution>UK Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Impact Acceleration Account (IAA)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swinscoe</surname><given-names>Gemma</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new way to treat <italic>Zika virus</italic> infections could be achieved following the definition of an ion channel function for the M protein within virus particles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Zika virus</italic> (ZIKV) was first isolated in the eponymous Ugandan forest in 1947 and is a mosquito-borne arbovirus (<underline>ar</underline>thropod-<underline>bo</underline>rne), classified within the <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dick, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dick et al., 1952</xref>). Historically, ZIKV caused infrequent and relatively mild infections in humans with symptoms comprising fever, rash, headaches, joint/muscle pain, and conjunctivitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simpson, 1964</xref>). However, once confined to Africa and Southeast Asia, a large outbreak in 2007 on Yap Island (Micronesia), followed by further outbreaks in French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and the Cook Islands in 2013/14, signified spread of the virus across the Pacific. The virus then arrived in Brazil in 2015, where an epidemic affecting &gt;1 M people ensued. This resulted in worldwide spread of the virus involving more than 80 countries and signified emergent ZIKV as a global health concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lazear and Diamond, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Worryingly, the outbreaks in Yap and thereafter encompassed considerably more serious symptomology, which has been linked to evolution of New World ZIKV strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2017</xref>). This included more serious and frequent neurological complications, increased incidence of Guillian–Barre syndrome, and a devastating epidemic of microcephaly in new-borns where maternal infection had occurred during the first trimester of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rasmussen and Jamieson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasmussen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rasmussen et al., 2017</xref>). Eventually, the outbreak was contained by surveillance combined with control of insect vectors, predominantly <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peterson et al., 2016</xref>). More than 7 years later, a ZIKV vaccine remains elusive, although several are in trials (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poland et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, no licensed antiviral therapies exist to treat ZIKV infection, yet repurposing of nucleotide analogue inhibitors against the NS5 protein shows promise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mumtaz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masmejan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lim et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>ZIKV, like other <italic>Flaviviruses</italic>, possesses a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome over 10 kb in length, capped at the 5ʹ end by a methylated dinucleotide (m<sup>7</sup>GpppAmp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia-Blanco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ray et al., 2006</xref>). The RNA is translated into a polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved by host and viral proteases to yield 10 mature gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assenberg et al., 2009</xref>); these are spatially organised into structural virion components at the N-terminus, and non-structural replicase proteins at the C-terminus. The mature enveloped virion comprises the viral RNA, the capsid (C) protein and two membrane proteins: envelope (E) and the small membrane (M) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prasad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). Virions undergo maturation as they traffic through the cell during egress, with M and the precursor (pr) peptide acting as chaperones for the E protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Maturation occurs upon furin-mediated cleavage of pr-M in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stadler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sevvana et al., 2018</xref>), although this has variable efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dowd et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Junjhon et al., 2008</xref>). The cleaved pr peptide remains associated with E, preventing exposure of the fusion loop within acidifying secretory vesicles. Release from the cell into a pH-neutral environment leads to the loss of pr and resultant structural rearrangement of E and M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). Whilst E comprises the essential virus attachment and entry protein, the role of M within the mature infectious virion remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sirohi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The presence of dimeric M, bound to E dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sirohi et al., 2016</xref>), within the virion raises the question of whether it might play a role during the virus entry process. Unfortunately, cryo-EM structures of acidified <italic>Flavivirus</italic> particles – a proxy for changes likely to occur during endocytosis – do not contain density attributable to the M protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, E undergoes a shift from a dimeric to a trimeric form thought to mediate membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bressanelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stiasny et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Modis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nayak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). This presumably disrupts E–M dimeric interactions, thereby allowing M an opportunity to also adopt alternative conformations and explore other oligomeric states.</p><p>Interestingly, dengue virus (DENV) M peptides formed membrane channels in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Premkumar et al., 2005</xref>), which would require the formation of higher-order oligomers. However, electrophysiology studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes failed to detect M-mediated proton conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wong et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, due to its size and hydrophobicity, M has long been speculated to comprise a virus-encoded ion channel, or ‘viroporin’, typified by the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus (IAV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nieva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Royle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scott and Griffin, 2015</xref>). M2 functions to allow protons to pass into the virion core during virus entry, enabling the uncoating of viral RNA, and is the target of the antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine, setting clinical precedent for viroporins as drug targets.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that ZIKV M forms rimantadine-sensitive, oligomeric membrane channels whose activity increases at acidic pH. Rimantadine blocks an early step during the ZIKV life cycle, consistent with a role for M channels during virus entry. Critically, rimantadine also abrogates viraemia within in vivo ZIKV preclinical models, supporting that M channel activity is a physiologically relevant target. In-depth molecular dynamics (MD) investigations support that M channels are comprised of hexameric complexes, with the channel lumen lined by the C-terminal <italic>trans</italic>-membrane domain (TMD). Ensuing models provided an effective template for in silico high-throughput screening (HTS) of a library of FDA-approved and other biologically active compounds, targeting two discrete sites on the channel complex. Pleasingly, enrichment of the library led to the identification of much-improved blockers of M channel activity, laying the foundation for potential drug repurposing alongside bespoke antiviral development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ZIKV M peptides form channel-like oligomeric complexes within membrane-mimetic environments</title><p>M protein resides as a dimeric form resolvable within cryo-EM structures of mature ZIKV, and other <italic>Flavivirus</italic> particles, in close association with E dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sirohi et al., 2016</xref>).

However, hexamer models where helix 2 lined the pore collapsed rapidly upon simulation, whereas heptamers lined by either helix showed an inability to close in the majority of simulations (Appendix). Moreover, radial hexamers lined by helix 3 either closed rapidly within the simulation (6, 40 ns) or not at all (&gt;200 ns). In the two channels that closed, one of the subunits moves to the centre of the channel to occupy the pore (Appendix). This again was inconsistent with the formation of a stable channel complex. Notably, no restraints were placed upon secondary structures during atomistic simulations of channel complexes, providing added confidence of their relative stability.</p><p>Multiple atomistic simulations for each condition supported that the compact hexameric model with helix 3 lining the lumen comprised the most stable and viable representation of a putative channel structure formed by M protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The compact channel structure retained a lumen with a radius of 5.23 Å at its narrowest point, lined by Thr57, Val61, Ile62, Val65, Met66, Leu68, and Leu69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Upon 200 ns atomistic simulation within a model POPC bilayer, channels initially allowed the formation of a water column, but then closed at Leu64 and Leu68, despite the former not facing the lumen at the beginning of the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). Channel closing first occurred at 70, 80, and 176 ns within three separate simulations, with channels remaining closed for the remainder of the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). Thus, despite the starting position of this model possessing a relatively wide lumen compared with the diameter of a water column (~1.15 Å), compact M hexamer models lined by helix 3 displayed spontaneous closure, consistent with a reasonable physiological representation of a membrane channel. Interestingly, despite the effect of acidic external pH upon M channel activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), mimicking such an environment by protonation of a potential candidate pH sensor, His28 within helix 1, had little appreciable effect upon channel opening during simulations. This was confirmed by His28Ala mutant peptides responding to acid pH identically to wild-type in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, other ionisable residues within the M protein likely mediate acid-enhanced activity in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Identification of two potential druggable sites within hexameric M complexes</title><p>We hypothesised that MD-tested compact hexamer models might be sufficiently accurate to both characterise and improve upon the inhibitory action of rimantadine.

The same site also underwent predicted interactions with other adamantyl-containing molecules, including amantadine, which adopted a similar predicted binding mode to rimantadine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Two other potential lumenal sites were also identified with lower predicted druggability scores (L2, L3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, inspection of the M channel model identified an additional region upon the membrane-exposed periphery that could also undergo interactions with small molecules (P1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Such binding sites are less likely to be identified computationally due to the high solvent exposure of potential ligands, yet such sites have been successfully targeted for other viroporins, including HCV p7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaw et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To explore the potential relevance of the P1 site, we exploited a defined series of compounds developed targeting a similar site upon the HCV p7 channel complex. The planar structure of these compounds is more compatible with the shape of the P1 site compared to L1, as supported by the predicted in silico modelling. Encouragingly, two of the seven compounds tested displayed inhibitory effects versus M in dye release assays, with JK3/42 being most active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, adamantane derivatives with additional R groups were ineffective at targeting M activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), potentially due to the limited size of the L1 cavity. Thus, we investigated the possibility that more than one distinct druggable binding site existed within M complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>In silico screening enriches for improved repurposed M channel inhibitors</title><p>We investigated whether in silico screening could identify and enrich for compounds predicted to interact with L1 and/or P1, with a view to developing two distinct yet complementary inhibitor series. L1 was defined as the site comprising Val61, Leu64, Val65, and Leu68, and P1 by Tyr63, Leu64, Val65, Met66, Ile67, and Leu68. The two sites effectively represented the internal and external face of a single region within the channel complex, which is also involved during channel closing in simulations and centres upon Leu68.

a concentration of one micromolar, with positive hits defined as compounds exerting a 50 ± 5% decrease in M activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Twenty-four hits were identified from the L1-targeted short list, and 15 for the P1 site.</p><p>We selected three compounds from each list, based upon both potency and commercial availability, for validation in plaque-reduction assays. As the components of the repurposing library predominantly target cellular factors, MTT assays were used to determine non-toxic maximal concentrations for each compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Testing at these concentrations revealed that each of the compounds exerted a statistically significant reduction upon ZIKV infectivity, with the most effective showing sub-micromolar potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), whereas the inactive JK3/32 compound showed no detectable antiviral effects.</p><p>Two L1-selected compounds, KB SRC 4 and GNF 5837 displayed antiviral efficacy at 250 and 80 nM, respectively, whereas the most effective P1-targeted compound, AA 29504, was active at 10 μM. Examination of the predicted binding pose for these compounds at L1/P1 revealed that both molecules underwent additional interactions with regions adjacent to the core-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">5</xref>). GNF 5837, an inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) family, was predicted to make extended contacts within the lumen, including with two of the predicted rimantadine-binding sites, stabilised by H-bonding between a carbonyl and Thr57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These leading hit compounds were re-tested in a second round of plaque-reduction assays, confirming efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and displayed in vitro EC<sub>50</sub> values at similar orders of magnitude as their observed potency in cell culture, namely sub-micromolar for GNF 5837, and approximately 10 µM for AA 29504 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, G</xref>).</p><p>The considerable enrichment for potency, compared to rimantadine, seen amongst compounds selected by in silico screening supports the validity and utility of structure-guided models in their potential use as templates for rational drug development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>M channel inhibitors reduce the specific infectivity of ZIKV virions</title><p>It was important to establish whether M-targeted compounds might exert off-target effects upon virion stability, or other aspects of virus entry. Frustratingly, the role of (pr)M during virion egress precludes the efficient generation of <italic>Flavivirus</italic> envelope pseudotype systems in their absence, an otherwise useful tool in this regard. As an alternative, compound-treated ZIKV particles were compared to solvent controls following ultracentrifugation and separation using a continuous iodixinol gradient. This not only allows characterisation of specific infectious species, but also sequesters small molecules at the top, lower-density range of the gradient, preventing incidental exposure of target cells when inoculating with virus-containing fractions, and so minimising potential cell off-target effects.</p><p>Interestingly, ZIKV infectivity profiles contained two peaks of infectivity when samples were diluted 1:10 onto target cells: a low-density peak at ~1.11 g/ml, and a high-density peak at 1.13–1.14 g/ml. However, detection of infectivity within the low-density peak diminished upon dilution at 1:100 or 1:1000, and this was not the case for the high-density peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the distribution of the ZIKV E protein was considerably more abundant within lower-density fractions compared to the main infectivity peak at higher density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Drug treatment specifically reduced infectivity (measured at 1:10 supernatant dilution to maintain both species) within the high-density infectious fraction compared to controls; the lower-density fractions were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). Importantly, as well as a global loss of infectivity, specific infectivity within the high-density fraction normalised by (reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction) RT-qPCR for ZIKV RNA (E gene target) was also significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), meaning that intact virions were rendered less infectious following exposure to inhibitors rather than being physically disrupted via non-specific ‘virolysis’. Moreover, based upon previous studies, the concentration of inhibitors added to target cells from high-density fractions would have been negligible, excluding artefactual effects upon cell entry.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>M channel inhibitors lack virus-lytic or cell-targeted effects.</title><p>To exclude the possibility that early effects upon ZIKV infection were due to a directly damaging effect of compounds upon virion integrity, particles were concentrated and purified from Vero cell supernatants by PEG-precipitation and ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion. Virions were then dosed with inhibitors prior to ultracentrifugation through a continuous iodixinol gradient.

Thus, rimantadine exerted an antiviral effect in vivo that prevented dissemination of the virus, consistent with cell culture observations, and supporting the druggability of M in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This work supports that the ZIKV M protein mediates membrane permeability in vitro through the formation of oligomeric structures, and that small molecules targeting this activity also decrease the infectivity of ZIKV at an early stage of the life cycle in culture. This is reminiscent of the IAV M2 protein, which responds to endosomal pH to allow protonation of the virion core, expediting virion uncoating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wharton et al., 1994</xref>); we have recently demonstrated that HCV p7 plays a similar role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaw et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, like M2, the activity of M is sensitive to both prototypic small molecules and rationally targeted ligands, preventing the spread of infection both in cell culture and in vivo. Thus, M channels represent a potential new target for antiviral therapies that could both limit disease severity and engender prophylactic use to disrupt transmission.</p><p>M resides as E-associated dimers within the mature virion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sirohi et al., 2016</xref>), yet for M channels to assemble, higher-order structures must form in the virion membrane to generate an intact aqueous pore. We hypothesise that the rearrangement and formation of trimeric E complexes during acid-induced fusion may provide an opportunity for M to also adopt alternative conformations. Density corresponding to M is absent from cryo-EM reconstructions of acidified mature <italic>Flavivirus</italic> virions, which are themselves inherently unstable and require the binding of E-specific FAb fragments to preserve their architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that asymmetric formation of relatively few channel complexes leads to a loss of signal upon application of icosahedral symmetry, or due to the overwhelming inherent symmetry of the particle. It would be of interest to apply symmetry expansion or focused classification techniques to acidified virions to investigate this possibility.</p><p>DENV M protein was previously proposed to function as a viroporin based primarily upon its size and hydrophobicity, yet conclusive evidence for a defined role within <italic>Flavivirus</italic> life cycles has been lacking. C-terminal M-derived peptides from DENV type 1 were shown to form cation-selective channels in suspended bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Premkumar et al., 2005</xref>), with sensitivity to amantadine (10 μM) and higher concentrations of hexamethylene amiloride (100 μM). However, a subsequent study using a series of pr-M protein expression constructs with additional N-terminal signal peptides and myc epitope tags failed to demonstrate pH activated channel activity in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wong et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, in addition to the difficulties interpreting negative data, it was unclear whether proteins derived from these constructs underwent authentic proteolytic processing to enable trafficking of mature M protein to the oocyte membrane. Older studies showed that DENV replication in human peripheral blood leukocytes and Rhesus macaque kidney epithelial cells (LLC-MK2) was suppressed by amantadine and rimantadine, with maximal effect when drugs were administered concomitant with infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koff et al., 1980</xref>), reminiscent of findings herein.</p><p>Consistent with the formation an aqueous pore across the membrane, ZIKV M peptides migrated as higher-order structures when reconstituted in the membrane-mimetic detergent, DH<sub>6</sub>PC. These corresponded to potential hexamers or heptamers, albeit estimated by native PAGE, and were confirmed to adopt a channel-like architecture using TEM. However, heterogeneity prevented determination of precise stoichiometry by rotational averaging. Nevertheless, M complexes mediated membrane bilayer permeability using an indirect ion channel assay, based upon fluorescent dye release from liposomes. Dose-dependent dye release was not only increased by acidic pH, but was also sensitive to rimantadine. Importantly, rimantadine sensitivity supports that dye release was mediated by interactions with a folded protein complex rather than via aggregates disrupting membrane integrity, and increased activity at acidic pH is consistent with activation within acidifying endosomes during virus entry. Other pH-gated channels including IAV M2, HCV p7 (genotype and polymorphism dependent) and HPV E5, are similarly activated within the same assay system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wetherill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaw et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atkins et al., 2014</xref>). However, the most obviously solvent-accessible, conserved, ionisable residue present within M protein peptides, His28, had effectively no influence upon pH activated activity. It will be of interest to understand which residues might mediate such effects, assuming they are recapitulated within cellular membranes.</p><p>Rimantadine was able to interrupt ZIKV infection of Vero cells, causing a dose-dependent reduction in the number of cells infected and ensuing virus protein expression. The EC<sub>50</sub> for rimantadine was between 10 and 20 μM, which is comparable to drug potency versus susceptible HCV strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffin et al., 2008</xref>). Rimantadine was most effective when added prior to and simultaneously with infectious innoculae, suggesting that pre-loading of endocytic vesicles with the drug may expedite the inhibition of virion-resident channels. Interestingly, adding rimantadine both during and after infection was consistently less effective than adding it during the infection alone. We are uncertain why this should be the case, yet we speculate that in addition to inhibitory properties, rimantadine may also exert a drug rescue effect upon cells during multi-cycle replication, lessening the cytopathic effects of ZIKV infection and thereby artificially inflating the number of surviving cells remaining at the end of the assay.</p><p>However, rimantadine also potently suppressed ZIKV replication in a preclinical model, supporting that M channels constitute a physiologically relevant drug target. Rimantadine treatment prevented viraemia, consistent with an effect upon virus spread linked to drug effects observed in culture. To date only M2, and more recently SARS-CoV-2 E, are the only examples where targeting a viroporin has been shown to exert preclinical antiviral efficacy. Thus, our findings strongly support that M channels are also physiologically relevant drug targets.</p><p>In lieu of structural information for channel complexes, we employed molecular modelling and MD simulations to understand how channels might be formed from either dimeric, or monomeric M protein. Importantly, monomer simulations indicated that a single <italic>trans</italic>-membrane-spanning topology was unstable resulting in the C-terminus folding back towards the plane of the membrane surface. Hence, we considered that dual-<italic>trans</italic>-membrane topology protomers comprise the more energetically favourable conformation for mature M, as seen for multiple structures of mature <italic>Flavivirus</italic> virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sirohi et al., 2016</xref>). This was despite some prediction packages including TMHMM, TOPCONS, and Phobius, supporting that M formed single-pass protomers. In contrast, MEMSAT-SVM not only predicted dual-pass conformations, but also predicted that helix 3 would most likely be pore lining, despite the majority of lumenal residues being hydrophobic in nature.</p><p>Compact hexameric models for M channel complexes comprised of dual-spanning protomers displayed consistent channel-like characteristics compared to an array of alternative conformations and oligomeric states, with helix 1 contributing significantly to overall channel stability. Channel closure occurred in proximity to Leu64, closing off the water column.</p><p>Compact hexamer channel models have considerable limitations, despite performing best in MD analyses. The omission of the amino-terminal 17 amino acids from simulations was to recapitulate the sequence of the synthetic peptides, plus it is predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Nevertheless, disordered protein regions are increasingly implicated in various protein functions and may influence other roles of the M protein. We are developing in-house recombinant expression systems to investigate full-length M, modifying simulations accordingly in parallel. Another limitation of current channel models is uncertainty around protomer stoichiometry, topology, and orientation, although available data support that dual-transmembrane conformations are the most stable. However, they provided a seemingly robust template for the in silico screening of small molecules with improved potency compared to prototypic channel blockers. It will be important going forward to investigate the potential formation of oligomeric complexes within virion and/or cellular membranes to further validate a role for M channels, and to complement the functional studies based upon small molecule inhibitors described herein.</p><p>Whilst a blunt tool in terms of potency, rimantadine (or other prototypic blockers) binding can signify druggable binding sites within viroporin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaw et al., 2020</xref>). Rimantadine was predicted to bind within a lumenal cavity proximal to Leu64, repeated along the sixfold radial symmetry of the channel model. In addition, the external membrane-exposed face of the same part of the channel model also contained a cavity predicted to be conducive to binding small molecules. The presence of two binding sites for small molecules could enable M-targeted drug combinations that might minimise the chance of resistant variants being selected, potentially also achieving synergistic antiviral effects. In agreement, we found that two planar ‘JK series’ molecules from previous work on HCV p7 exhibited activity versus M channels in vitro, consistent with the shape composition of the P1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Thus, a series of chemically distinct molecules was identified using in silico HTS targeting each binding site, derived from a drug repurposing library. Hits were shortlisted for predicted binding accounting for hydrophobic exposure-induced penalties at the peripheral site, chemical properties (Lipinski), and those predicted to bind both sites were removed from both lists. Screening of shortlisted compounds using dye release assays identified multiple hits targeting both sites, several of which were corroborated by testing for antiviral effects in ZIKV infectious assays.

By far the most potent hit against M was GNF 5837, which was predicted to bind the L1 site. GNF 5837 is a potent inhibitor of TrKs A, B, and C, high-affinity receptors for nerve growth factor that regulate neuronal survival and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albaugh et al., 2012</xref>). GNF 5837 has an IC<sub>50</sub> of ~10 nM against its cognate targets, yet only achieved an antiviral ~EC<sub>50</sub> at 80 nM in BHK cell plaque-reduction assays. Importantly, TrK expression is primarily restricted to the (central nervous system) CNS and the thyroid, with only very low expression in kidney tissues according to the human protein atlas. Moreover, we could find no reference to TrK expression in either Vero or BHK cells. Other lumenal hits comprised the c-Src inhibitor, KB SRC 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandvold et al., 2012</xref>) (250 nM), and GSK 2837808A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billiard et al., 2013</xref>) (40 μM), an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenases A and B (LDHA/B). KB SRC 4 has an in vitro Ki of 44 nM versus c-Src (higher against other Src-related kinases), whilst GSK 2837808A has an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.6 and 43 nM against LDHA/B, respectively; the former impeded cell metabolic activity at 500 nM, whilst the latter had no effect. It will be critical to establish, for example via use of knock-down cell lines, whether compounds such as GSK 2837808A, GNF 5837, and KB SRC 4 are indeed affecting ZIKV replication specifically, as it is eminently conceivable that their effects may be indirect.</p><p>The peripheral hits tested in culture comprised Formoterol hemifumarate (80 μM), L-732 183 (40 μM), and AA 29504 (10 μM). Only high concentrations of Formoterol impeded metabolic activity (100 μM). Formoterol is a long-acting β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist (IC<sub>50</sub> in pM range), used as a bronchodilator in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger and Nadel, 2008</xref>). L-732 183 is a potent competitive tachykinin NK<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.3 nM), the receptor for substance P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quartara and Maggi, 1997</xref>), whilst AA 29504 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vardya et al., 2012</xref>) is a positive allosteric modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (IC<sub>50</sub> = 9–13 μM). Again, whilst there is a considerable difference in potency for both Formoterol and L-732 183 targeting their canonical targets compared to antiviral effects, it will be critical to establish whether these are independent phenomena. Notably, this is less clear in terms of differential potency of AA 29504, although, much like the case for GNF 5837, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, the target of AA 29504, are not expressed in the kidney. However, it should be emphasised that repurposed compounds provide the structural basis for further bespoke drug development targeting M channels, rather than being used directly as antivirals, providing opportunities to further ensure specificity through the establishment of structure–activity relationships (SARs) and the selection of drug resistant ZIKV.</p><p>Further evidence that repurposed compounds and rimantadine exerted specific antiviral effects resulted from density gradient separation of ZIKV virions from unbound compounds, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaw et al., 2020</xref>). This ensures that target cells are highly unlikely to be exposed to meaningful concentrations of each compound, minimising one possible source of off-target effects. Moreover, virolytic mechanisms were found to be similarly unlikely to explain compound effects as the specific infectivity of virions was diminished by drug treatment, normalised by ZIKV RNA content. Interestingly, compounds specifically reduced infectivity in the major high-density peak, but not in a lower-density region of the gradient where lower levels of infectivity were susceptible to relatively low serial dilutions; this was not the case for the high-density peak. Interestingly, the only published study we identified relating to multiple particle types in <italic>Flaviviruses</italic> was a study assessing the effects of pr-M cleavage site mutations in the morphogenesis and secretion of tick-borne encephalitis virus subviral particles (SVPs), generated via pr-M-E expression alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison et al., 2003</xref>). Preventing pr-M cleavage by furin increased the proportion of larger, faster sedimenting SVPs corresponding in size to virions, and which harboured altered E protein glycosylation. Whilst the link between altered particle species, M processing and, potentially, M channel function is intriguing, it currently remains unclear whether these aspects are linked mechanistically.</p><p>The compounds identified herein represent only the first steps towards the design of bespoke M inhibitors, which could be enhanced through the exploration of chemical space around potent repurposed ligands; ideally, this will enable the continued emphasis on developing small molecules with superior qualities compared to rimantadine, or other prototypic viroporin inhibitors. Nevertheless, given its activity in vivo and in cell culture, there may be value in considering the immediate clinical repurposing of rimantadine to combat severe ZIKV infection and/or <italic>trans</italic>-placental transmission via early-stage clinical trials. The epidemic in South America and ensuing worldwide spread illustrated the speed with which more pathogenic ZIKV can be transmitted, and outbreaks continue in Africa and the Indian subcontinent. ZIKV is also unique amongst <italic>Flaviviruses</italic> as it can also spread from person to person via sexual contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Ortenzio et al., 2016</xref>), as well as tragically infecting the unborn foetus causing microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">York, 2021</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that emerging ZIKV replicase-targeted drugs such as Galidesivir will not be safe to use during pregnancy due to potential teratogenic effects, although recent studies in Rhesus macaques did not indicate any issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lim et al., 2020</xref>). The FDA classes rimantadine as a class C drug during pregnancy, that is administered if the potential benefit might outweigh the risk. Whilst rimantadine will cross mouse placentas, eleven times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) is necessary to become embryotoxic. However, 3.4 and 6.8 times the MRHD did increase pup mortality up to 4 days post-partum, yet this still by far exceeds the dose used during influenza prophylaxis in the past (Product Information. Flumadine (rimantadine). Forest Pharmaceuticals, St. Louis, MO. 2007). No controlled studies have been undertaken during human pregnancy, but faced with the alternative of microcephaly, the balance of risk may be favourable. The generic status of rimantadine also means that it could be deployed rapidly at minimal cost to areas of endemic ZIKV infection or during outbreaks, which overwhelmingly tend to occur in lower/middle income countries (LMICs).</p><p>In summary, this work supports the formation of membrane channels by the ZIKV M protein, consistent with viroporin activity. Blocking this activity with small molecules reveals an important role during the early stages of ZIKV replication, consistent with virus entry and/or uncoating, and this also translates to antiviral efficacy a preclinical model. Rimantadine may constitute an easy-to-access generic drug for the treatment and/or prophylaxis against ZIKV in LMIC. Moreover, the selection of new repurposed ligands with anti-M activity demonstrates potential for developing novel therapies targeting this protein function, which in turn may also apply to other <italic>Flaviviruses</italic>. In addition, the relative enrichment of effective ligands versus both a lumenal and a peripheral binding site, combined with improved potency compared to rimantadine, further demonstrates the value of molecular models as templates for future drug development. Confidence in such models will be further enhanced via iterative drug development to generate an SAR for inhibitors targeting each site. In the longer term, structural information on M channel structures, ideally located within virion membranes, will be essential to both developing novel therapeutics, and then in turn, using these to investigate the precise roles for M channel function during ZIKV infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Vero (African Green Monkey kidney (ATCC Cat# CRL-1586, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0574">CVCL_0574</ext-link>)) and BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney (ATCC Cat# CCL-10, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_1915">CVCL_1915</ext-link>)) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified essential cell culture media, supplemented with 10% (foetal calf serum) FCS and 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified culture incubator.

This was minimised in a lipid membrane environment using an Optimised Potentials for Liquid Simulations (OPLS) force field and used for docking of unbiased compound analogues. The Maestro SiteMap function was used to assess the druggability score for three potential lumenal binding sites (L1–3), and another on the membrane-exposed periphery was identified manually.</p><p>For unbiased screening, a library of 1280 FDA-approved molecules (TOCRIS Screen, Biotechne. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/seqstats/emboss_pepinfo/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/seqstats/emboss_pepinfo/</ext-link>) underwent the LigPrep function using Maestro (Schrödinger) software. The in-built SiteMap function was then used on the M Protein structure to generate a Glide (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_000187">SCR_000187</ext-link>) grid for the docking of Rimantadine in the lumenal site (under aqueous conditions) using extra precise (XP) Glide setting. This was followed by docking in the same site mimicking membrane conditions. Rimantadine was then docked into the peripheral site under both aqueous and membrane conditions to generate 32 poses in each of the four scenarios. The prepared Tocris library was also docked into the two sites on the M protein structure using the four scenarios and Glide settings established using Rimantadine (lumenal-aqueous, lumenal-membrane, peripheral-aqueous, and peripheral-membrane). Duplicate poses were removed, and a final short list of 50 molecules was generated at each for in vitro testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Availability of materials</title><p>ZIKV M peptides can only be provided under an MTA if technical issues are shown to prevent commercial or in-house synthesis, within the limitations of stocks available in the SG laboratory.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Nir Ben-Tal as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>Experiments:</p><p>1. Small molecule Inhibitors of ZIKV fusion targeting the E protein have been recently described (see Pitts et al. DOI:10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.02.008, or Li et al. DOI:10.1021/acsinfecdis.8b00322). Since similar inhibitors identified in this work appear to exert their action at the level of viral entry, they could also interfere with receptor binding, viral particle integrity or membrane fusion. The authors should add direct experimental evidence that the inhibitors indeed operate on the M protein. For example, in their previous work, where this issue was covered, the authors used Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with viral glycoproteins to demonstrate the specificity of the inhibitors towards the viroporin target.</p><p>Related to this, to prove direct binding of the compounds to M it would be interesting to measure experimentally the process by ITC (detergent-stabilized samples?) or SPR (see for instance: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2015.12.028).</p><p>2. Permeability assays. Bilayers made of PC:PA might not reproduce adequately the viral membrane (thickness, potential interactions with specific lipids). Lipid compositions that approach more closely that of the ZIKV envelope should be used.

The authors claim that helix 1 and protonation of His28 therein are required for M channel function.

Small molecule Inhibitors of ZIKV fusion targeting the E protein have been recently described (see Pitts et al. DOI:10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.02.008, or Li et al. DOI:10.1021/acsinfecdis.8b00322). Since similar inhibitors identified in this work appear to exert their action at the level of viral entry, they could also interfere with receptor binding, viral particle integrity or membrane fusion. The authors should add direct experimental evidence that the inhibitors indeed operate on the M protein. For example, in their previous work, where this issue was covered, the authors used Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with viral glycoproteins to demonstrate the specificity of the inhibitors towards the viroporin target.</p><p>Related to this, to prove direct binding of the compounds to M it would be interesting to measure experimentally the process by ITC (detergent-stabilized samples?) or SPR (see for instance: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2015.12.028).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point to address that we had not previously explored given that pseudotyping with Flavivirus E glycoproteins is dependent upon the chaperone function of the (pr)M protein. We are confident that rimantadine and the other drugs identified herein do not interfere with membrane integrity as there are no effects upon liposomes in the absence of M (or indeed other viroporins).</p><p>The receptor interactions undertaken by ZIKV are complicated due to interactions with multiple host factors as well as the existence of a spectrum of virion species. See for example, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.01.018 and https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17638-y. Thus, determining effects upon specific E-receptor interactions is beyond the scope of this work.</p><p>However, in recognition of this important point, we investigated the integrity of ZIKV particles within iodixinol gradients (see new figure 7). First, consistent with the notion that ZIKV particles exist in different conformations, we witnessed two distinct peaks of infectivity, with a low-density fraction (~1.11 g/mL), only apparent in less diluted samples (1/10 dilution, see new supplementary figure 14). By contrast, the higher density fraction (1.13-1.14 g/mL) remained measurable upon sample dilution (1/100 or 1/1000) and contained the vast majority of particle infectivity. Infectivity within the higher density fraction was dramatically reduced by the addition of rimantadine, GNF 5837, or AA 29504, whereas minimal differences were observed in the lower density fraction. This was not due to virion lysis as the specific infectivity of particles in the peak fractions was diminished, normalised for genomic RNA content by RT-qPCR.</p><p>We acknowledge that biophysical characterisation of M-inhibitor interactions via SPR would be a desirable aim, but the establishment of the associated experimental pipeline is beyond the scope of this work, in particular due to the more hydrophobic nature of M compared with Vpu in the article mentioned, but also because of the difficulty assessing the predicted membrane-exposed binding site and allowing for partitioning of drug molecules into the bilayer. Assessments of the M2 peripheral binding site via such methods have, consequently, demonstrably favoured the interactions within the lumen compared to the periphery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Permeability assays. Bilayers made of PC:PA might not reproduce adequately the viral membrane (thickness, potential interactions with specific lipids). Lipid compositions that approach more closely that of the ZIKV envelope should be used. In this regard, given the high curvature of the viral membrane (small radius of the particle), SUVs or LUVs produced by extrusion through 0.05 um-pore filters might be more adequate model systems to assay M-induced permeability than the larger vesicles used by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We use PC:PA bilayers as a model system because the design of the dye release assay requires that viroporins insert themselves spontaneously into the membranes. Over twenty years ago we established that use of acidic PA promoted this most efficiently, most likely due to regions of basic charge present in the majority of viroporins that appear to mediate this process. For example, our first major focus was the HCV p7 protein, which contains a highly conserved basic loop that we later showed was essential for membrane integration.</p><p>We have undertaken various MD simulations using membrane compositions based upon that published for the West Nile virus (WNV) membrane, the closest proxy we found at the time to the ZIKV envelope. We essentially saw no difference. However, the high cholesterol content of this and other RNA virus envelopes is not suited to dye release assays as more solid-phase membrane regions are refractory to viroporin insertion. Accordingly, such membranes give poor activity in dye release assays, and we also witnessed partitioning of HCV p7 (with a GST tag) into the fluidic regions of mixed membranes using atomic force microscopy. AFM data are unpublished as the project was not taken forwards, but we can gladly provide them if helpful.</p><p>We had not considered the use of smaller vesicles previously and were intrigued to follow this suggestion. Pleasingly, as shown in revised figure 2, an equivalent concentration of M peptides led to efficient and exponential dye release, comparable, albeit slightly lower than, standard assay conditions. We did not titrate the peptide under these conditions, and surmise that the altered molar ratios might explain the modest decrease in channel activity. We note that use of the smaller 0.05 mm filters in our extrusion setup (Avanti) is challenging experimentally, requiring considerable force, causing leaks, shearing membranes, and taking much longer to extrude. We therefore do not intend to use this routinely, but we agree it was an excellent suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In the channel model (Figure 6A), to span the bilayer, Helix 1 in a tilted angle combines with the following helix-turn-helix motif. It remained unclear if the authors acknowledge this key structural role of Helix 1. Are monomers of δ-Helix 1 spanning the bilayer in their simulations (Figure 7D)? The importance of helix 1 and His28 for M function can be easily tested in liposome permeabilization assays using synthetic δ-Helix 1 or peptides lacking His at position 28.</p></disp-quote><p>It is right that we have not shown experimentally that helix 1 is required for channel function, although the simulation where it was lacking was compelling; Helix 1 does not span the membrane, but it lies parallel to the membrane in the lipid/water interface with some minor insertion in the bilayer. Only helices 2 and 3 span the membrane. We can only speculate of the role of Helix 1 but it can be: 1) it stabilizes the channels via its interactions with the bilayer surface (like an anchoring point) or 2) by contributing to the interactions with adjacent subunits. Indeed, in the simulation without helix 1, or in the “radial” hexamer simulations in which helix 1 does not interact with the other subunits, the channel is unstable. Hence, it can be either scenario, or a combination of the two.</p><p>The suggestion to generate a His28Ala peptide was taken forward and we tested this in the pH responsive dye release assay alongside the wild-type peptide. Surprisingly, this peptide retained virtually identical characteristics and increased activity at more acidic pH.</p><p>We agree that whilst our simulations do show some differences between the protonated and aprotonated channels, they are relatively small. This may be the reason that we don’t detect differences in the His28Ala experiment. We originally chose His28 as it is the most obvious site for becoming protonated at physiological pH. However, as the reviewer also notes, other amino acids are present within the M sequence that could become protonated. Thus, it may be that modelling the His28++ protein served to emulate other protonation events, rather than representing the precise biochemical mechanism; the pKa of amino acids within proteins can be significantly influenced by their local environment. Protonation could also feasibly promote a localised imbalance of acidic and basic charges, involving any of several Thr, Tyr, Asn, Arg, or Lys residues in the sequence.</p><p>We have amended the relevant section of the results and other sections and included additional discussion considering these new findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

And anyway, we probably need a real dose response curve, rather than a single concentration.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully accept that rimantadine potency is relatively low in vitro; this is expected as it is a generic broad-specificity channel blocker. We have attempted dose-response curves for most of the main hits, as well as rimantadine. These are, frustratingly, complicated by an assay artefact that occurs for some, but by no means all viroporin/inhibitor combinations; for example, M2 shows hyperactivation with HMA in our hands, and several of our JK series have the same effect upon p7 despite potently lowering activity when used at lower concentrations. This is not an effect of the drug upon lipids as it does not occur in the absence of viroporins. Other examples of compound hyperactivation are present in the drug screening data (Figure S10), including GBR12909 and abacavir.</p><p>Rimantadine is used in lieu of more tailored compounds to identify druggable targets because of its inherent promiscuity. The JK series were used to build an SAR for the peripheral binding site in p7 channel complexes (also a structure-guided channel model), which resembles the cavity in the predicted M complex. There was every chance that this series may not in fact work, but given that two did, we presume the peripheral site is a druggable option, supported by the docking and improved efficacy of our screening compounds. As such, we have moved the JK data to supplementary alongside adamantane analogues, so as not to disrupt the flow of the piece.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 9.

We have made efforts to vary the model by using two different orientations of the monomer that are sterically feasible. We have also constructed pentamers, hexamers and heptamers that differ in their pore radius. Regarding the tilt angle again we used two different protein orientations. We could have tried more tilt angles, but one advantage of MD is that proteins have the option to optimise packing and tilt angles during the simulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

We have also calculated and protein-lipid interfaces for the simulation with the monomeric and hexameric structures. These analyses show that the bilayer is properly functioning during the simulations. We also show convergence analysis (for 1us, 2us and 3us) of the protein/lipid interfaces for the monomeric simulations. This analysis shows that after 1us the coarse-grained simulation are converged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. &quot;Simulations of the two species within a POPC lipid bilayer revealed that the single helix rapidly began to revert to a hairpin-like structure (Figure 4c, d).&quot;: The figure does not support this statement.

However, we do see the tendency of the second helix to enter the bilayer. We already refer to this as a “hairpin-like” structure, but we have reworded this further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. &quot;The N-terminal extra-membranous helix regulates formation of predicted M dimers&quot;: What is the point in this section? Are the dimers physiologically relevant?

Indeed, most of these tentative models collapsed and were rejected. However, there is no compelling evidence that the &quot;compact hexameric channel complex&quot; is physiologically relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>This approach has been used in other published studies, including that discussed above in relation to ion permeation (https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002702). It is not possible to assemble the hexameric structures by starting with six monomers in the bilayer because of the computational cost. We could have potentially used coarse-grained simulations but forming a hexamer starting from monomers may not be possible due to the lower resolution of these simulations. Therefore, we had to start with pre-assembled dimers. We also compared two helical orientations (i.e. with either helix 2 or 3 lining the lumen), each as pentamers, hexamers, and heptamers. Thus, we did in fact test different conformations that are in a different part of the energy landscape. Also, as the reviewer states, if the hexamers weren’t energetically stable, they would have collapsed during the simulations as did the others, including where helix 1 was removed.</p><p>In addition to the improved inherent stability of the hexameric model, it should be noted that Flavivirus particles comprise a regulated protein stoichiometry pertaining to the E and (pr)M proteins, which is always a multiple of both two and three in relation to mature and immature virion membrane protein arrangements. Hence, whilst it is theoretically feasible for mixed particles to assemble dimers and trimers in different combinations, if the mature virions predominate the most likely channel building blocks will be M dimers.</p><p>We also point out that we consider the hexamer model to be very much a tool by which to investigate the potential role and relevance of M protein channels. The first way in which the relevance of this model was tested was to use it as a template to derive candidate small molecule inhibitors. Whilst early-stage hits may or may not eventually be found to interact at the specific site against which they are targeted (to be confirmed via later investigations), the accumulation and enrichment of effective molecules compared to that expected by random chance is, in our opinion, supportive that the model is approaching biological relevance. Moreover, the correlation between predicted binding, in vitro and cell culture efficacy adds to this evidence base.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Rimantadine docking (Figure 8B): Without hydrogen bonds that provide specificity, the suggested docking pose does not look particularly good. How does this pose compare with that of binding to the influenza M2 channel, where we know that binding is real?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that H-bonds will increase avidity and specificity for binding sites in general. However, the binding and orientation of rimantadine/amantadine even within M2 varies considerably between different structures. Even when appropriately oriented in the M2 lumen, the amine group interacts randomly with any one of the four His37 residues comprising the proton sensor within the channel. Moreover, binding at the peripheral, membrane-exposed binding site can also vary depending upon the environment in which peptides containing the peripheral site are analysed. Ultimately, neither rimantadine nor amantadine possess qualities that favour highly specific interactions. Instead, the compact adamantyl cage undergoes promiscuous interactions with multiple binding sites, which may or may not be augmented via H-bonding via the amine. Hence, we use this as a guide towards druggable sites, rather than any sort of benchmark, as described above, and this has led to some success including for rimantadine-resistant influenza (Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, PLoS Pathogens, 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. &quot;Thus, inhibitor effects and docking data supported the presence of more than one distinct druggable binding site within M complexes, to exploit via novel chemical series&quot;: A bold statement that is not supported by any data.

Either another viral protein or a host protein that interfaces with the virus.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have amended the relevant section in the text. However, we note that tropomyosin receptor kinases, the target of GNF5837, are primarily expressed in the CNS and the thyroid with only very low expression in kidney tissues according to the human protein atlas. Moreover, we could find no reference to TRK expression in either Vero, or BHK cells.
