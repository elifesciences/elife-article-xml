We show that active YAP, a key mediator of Hippo signaling, is distributed throughout the murine lung epithelium and loss of epithelial YAP severely disrupts branching. Failure to branch is restricted to regions where YAP activity is removed. This suggests that YAP controls local epithelial cell properties. In support of this model, mechanical force production is compromised and cell proliferation is reduced in <italic>Yap</italic> mutant lungs. We propose that defective force generation and insufficient epithelial cell number underlie the branching defects. Through genomic analysis, we also uncovered a feedback control of pMLC levels, which is critical for mechanical force production, likely through the direct induction of multiple regulators by YAP. Our work provides a molecular pathway that could control epithelial cell properties required for proper morphogenetic movement and pattern formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21130.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21130.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21130.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Air enters our lungs through a system of airways that spread outwards from the windpipe like the branches of a tree. Before we are born, each branch is shaped by the organization and movement of cells that form the walls of the airways, called epithelial cells. This process requires the cells to communicate and coordinate with each other by receiving and/or sending chemical signals.</p><p>One important system that epithelial cells use to communicate is called the Hippo pathway, which uses a molecule called YAP to execute received messages. Exactly how YAP helps airways in the lungs to develop was not well understood.</p><p>By studying developing mouse lungs, Lin et al. have now found that YAP is present in the epithelial cells of all developing airways. Inactivating YAP in specific parts of the lungs prevented the formation of new branches of the airway in just those regions that lacked YAP. This suggests that YAP is needed for airways to branch properly and form the extensive network present in healthy lungs.</p><p>Further investigation using genomics approaches revealed that YAP regulates the activity of genes that control how epithelial cells divide and contract. Without YAP, fewer cells were produced and they were unable to produce the forces required to change shape and move to form airways. In particular, YAP controls the production of a modified form of a protein called phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC) through a regulatory pathway. The pMLC protein is critical for the cells to produce the mechanical forces that they need to be able to contract correctly.</p><p>Overall, the results presented by Lin et al. suggest that YAP controls the properties of the epithelial cells to enable them to form new airway branches. Branched structures also form in a number of other organs, and the mechanisms that cause these structures to form are thought to be similar to those that form the airways. Lin et al.’s work could therefore help us to understand how organs develop more generally.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21130.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21130.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>YAP</kwd><kwd>Hippo signaling</kwd><kwd>lung branching</kwd><kwd>actomyosin</kwd><kwd>mechanical force</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000009</institution-id><institution>Foundation for the National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 HL111054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chuang</surname><given-names>Pao-Tien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000009</institution-id><institution>Foundation for the National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL115207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chuang</surname><given-names>Pao-Tien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The control of local cell properties such as epithelial cell number and mechanical force production by Hippo signaling is a major determinant of lung branching.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Development of the lung has served as a model system to study fundamental questions such as branching morphogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and cell-type specification. The lung primordium arises from the ventral foregut and its emergence is marked by the expression of the <italic>Nkx2.1</italic> transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Minoo et al., 1999</xref>). The lung primordium is composed of two parts: the future trachea and two endodermal buds. Both components are composed of an epithelial layer of endoderm surrounded by mesodermal cells. During lung branching morphogenesis, three characteristic modes of branching are repeatedly used at many different times and positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Metzger et al., 2008</xref>). They include formation of lateral branches from the parent branch (domain branching) and bifurcation at the tip of branches (planar and orthogonal bifurcation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Metzger et al., 2008</xref>). Initially, the buds grow ventrally and caudally, and initiate lateral branches at invariant positions, beginning around 10.5 <italic>days post coitus</italic> (<italic>dpc</italic>) in mice. In this way, five buds are generated, four on the right side and one on the left side, leading to the formation of four right lobes (cranial, middle, accessory and caudal) and one left lobe of the mature mouse lung. In this process, proximal-distal specification is associated with the emergence of <italic>Sox9</italic>-expressing progenitors and non-branching <italic>Sox2</italic>-expressing airways, which will become the conducting airway in the mature lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang and Chen, 2014</xref>). These complicated morphological movements culminate in an elaborate branching organ that also contains various differentiated cell types to fulfill the primary function of gas exchange. Acquisition of the spatial and temporal sequence of lung morphogenesis forms the basis of understanding the molecular mechanisms of lung development.</p><p>Precise control of lung growth and patterning is essential for the generation of a functional respiratory system. Several genes and pathways involved in this process have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morrisey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ornitz and Yin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Volckaert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domyan and Sun, 2011</xref>). However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how lung epithelial cell properties are dictated by these genes and pathways during growth and patterning. This is a central unresolved issue in understanding lung development and homeostasis. Since lung growth and patterning is a tightly controlled process, we speculate that a master regulatory pathway is required for integrating diverse inputs and coordinating a multitude of cellular behaviors. A strong candidate is the Hippo pathway, which mediates organ size control in several other organs. Indeed, several recent studies show that the Hippo pathway controls key aspects of lung development, homeostasis and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahoney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lange et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Extensive work in cell-based assays and model organisms has culminated in a working model of Hippo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gumbiner and Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsui and Lai, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harvey and Hariharan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barry and Camargo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Staley and Irvine, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>). The key executor of the Hippo pathway is the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP), which governs multiple aspects of cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Varelas, 2014</xref>). YAP activity is negatively regulated through a kinase cascade, and YAP phosphorylation is correlated with its cytoplasmic sequestration and degradation. Consequently, the transcriptional targets of YAP in the nucleus are not expressed. In contrast, when upstream kinases are inactivated in response to external signals (such as low cell density), YAP becomes hypophosphorylated. It is postulated that this form of YAP enters the nucleus and activates Hippo targets in conjunction with the TEAD1-4 transcription factors. This is required for orchestrating a multitude of cellular functions including cell proliferation, differentiation and death and changes in cell properties.</p><p>In this study, we utilize the Hippo pathway as a tool to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of lung development. Our findings support a model in which control of lung epithelial cell properties, such as cell proliferation and mechanical force production, by Hippo signaling determines lung growth and patterning. This knowledge significantly enhances our mechanistic understanding of lung branching morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Active nuclear YAP is distributed throughout the airway epithelium and is not confined to a specific zone</title><p>To assess the sites of active (nuclear) YAP at different stages of lung development, we examined the subcellular distribution of YAP protein in the lung epithelium by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. Nuclear YAP could be found in both SOX2<sup>+</sup> (proximal) and SOX9<sup>+</sup> (distal) epithelial populations in wild-type lungs at 11.5, 12.5 and 14.5 <italic>dpc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–P</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that YAP is active throughout the lung epithelium.

A high percentage of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells and SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells displayed nuclear YAP staining in wild-type lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S</xref>). Consistent with the distribution of active YAP along the entire lung epithelium, expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), an established YAP target, was detected in both the proximal and distal airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1T–V</xref>). We did not observe a sharp transition of YAP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at the junction between the SOX2<sup>+</sup> and SOX9<sup>+</sup> populations, a region dubbed the transition zone (TZ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1W</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahoney et al., 2014</xref>). In that study, inactive cytoplasmic YAP was detected in SOX2-expressing cells except those that abut SOX9-expressing cells at 12.5 and 14.5 <italic>dpc</italic>. We found that phosphorylated YAP (pYAP) was present in both SOX2<sup>+</sup> and SOX9<sup>+</sup> epithelial cells. pYAP levels were, in general, higher in the proximal than distal epithelium, but pYAP levels varied significantly from cell to cell in both the proximal and distal airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nevertheless, in many cells, low levels of pYAP were associated with the presence of nuclear YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Lung epithelial cells that do not have nuclear YAP usually stain positive for cytoplasmic YAP. This is consistent with a model in which pYAP is sequestered and degraded in the cytoplasm, but it also indicates a dynamic shuttling and distribution of YAP along the entire airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21130.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nuclear YAP is active throughout the mouse lung epithelium during development.</title><p>(<bold>A–R</bold>) Immunostaining of lung sections collected from wild-type and <italic>Yap<sup>f/f</sup>; Shh<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice at 11.5 and 14.5 <italic>days post coitus</italic> (<italic>dpc</italic>).

The small GTPase Rho binds and activates ROCK (Rho-associated protein kinase). ROCK is the major regulator of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and ROCK enhances myosin phosphorylation and consequently cellular contractility. RhoA activity is regulated by RhoGEF (Rho guanine exchange factor), which activates RhoA, and RhoGAP (Rho GTP activating factor), which inhibits RhoA.</p><p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which YAP regulates pMLC levels, we searched for RhoGEFs that are downregulated in <italic>Yap</italic> mutant lungs. We found that the mRNA levels of <italic>Arhgef17</italic> (encoding a RhoGEF) were reduced in <italic>Yap</italic>-deficient lungs by RNA-Seq and qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

This suggests that ARHGEF17 is an effector of YAP in controlling a Rho–ROCK-pMLC cascade and mechanical force production.</p><p>Dynamic lung branching requires intricate control of cellular contractility. We surmise that YAP controls pMLC levels and mechanical force production through multiple pathways, including a YAP–RhoGEF–RhoA–ROCK pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7S</xref>). Indeed, our RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analyses uncovered several new YAP targets that regulate pMLC levels via different mechanisms. They include the <italic>Laminin alpha 5 receptor</italic> (<italic>Bcam</italic>), <italic>Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2</italic> (<italic>S1pr2</italic>) and <italic>NUAK family, SNF1-like kinase, 2</italic> (<italic>Nuak2</italic>).

The NUAK2 kinase can also enhance pMLC generation by inhibiting MLC phosphatase independently of RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zagórska et al., 2010</xref>). Our results suggest that YAP could control pMLC levels and mechanical force production through an elaborate signaling network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7S</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our work provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which YAP controls lung development. We propose that reduced cell number and disrupted mechanical force generation contribute to defective branching in <italic>Yap</italic> mutant lungs. Previous studies reported abnormal lung branching through pharmacological manipulation of Rho, ROCK or the actomyosin cytoskeleton in <italic>ex vivo</italic> lung culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moore et al., 2005</xref>). This is consistent with our model in which mechanical force production via regulation of pMLC levels could play a central role in lung branching during development. These key findings establish a new conceptual framework for understanding how changes in local epithelial properties mediated by YAP drive lung branching morphogenesis. Major steps forward include studies that integrate dynamic changes in cellular properties in real time and investigations aimed to reveal how YAP senses changes in the external environment and the molecular mechanisms by which YAP outputs modify cellular behavior. These endeavors would unveil how Hippo signaling executes crucial steps of lung development. We anticipate that these results will also inform us how aberrant Hippo signaling leads to lung pathology.</p><p>Control of tissue tension by YAP has been described in medaka embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Porazinski et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, ARHGAP18 was reported to be an effector of YAP in that study. Moreover, the Hippo pathway can regulate F-actin accumulation in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaspar and Tapon, 2014</xref>) and YAP regulates genes that control cell cycle progression, F-actin polymerization and actin cytoskeleton remodeling in the mammalian heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morikawa et al., 2015</xref>). These genes were proposed to function in cell migration in the heart. By contrast, our work uncovers YAP targets that may regulate phosphorylation of myosin light chain and consequently mechanical force production in the lung. The actin cytoskeleton itself does not generate mechanical force. Mechanical force production is mediated by contraction of myosin in the actomyosin cytoskeleton, a network composed of myosin associated with F-actin bundles. Thus, our studies offer new insight into how YAP controls patterning of mammalian organs via cell number and mechanical force. It is unclear in which steps during lung branching these two cell properties are required and how they impact the morphogenetic movement. Nor is it clear what the functional consequence is when either cell number or mechanical force is disrupted. For instance, would a reduction in epithelial cell number lead to a smaller sized lung with grossly correct patterning? Answering these important questions would rely on additional genetic manipulations in mice. These studies will reveal the interplay between changes in cell number and acquisition of cellular properties, a long-standing question in tissue patterning.</p><p>In this study, we focus on how epithelial cell properties regulated by YAP contribute to lung branching. Given the complex interactions between the epithelium and mesenchyme during lung development, it is conceivable that coordination between these two compartments is critical for stereotypical branching. Indeed, classical transplantation studies have revealed the inductive ability of the mesenchyme in epithelial branching. Interestingly, recent studies suggest the involvement of mesenchymal smooth muscle in epithelial branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). How mesenchymal signals impinge on YAP activity is unclear. A better understanding of the molecular events in both the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments during branching is required to unveil the reciprocal interactions between these two compartments and the role that Hippo signaling plays in this process. We also anticipate that a combination of genetic studies, <italic>ex vivo</italic> organ explants and pharmacological and molecular manipulations would complement each other and bring us a more complete picture of how branching is executed at the molecular level.</p><p>Our work reveals a complex signaling network by which YAP regulates pMLC levels and cortical contractility. In addition to inducing <italic>Arhgef17</italic>, YAP also activates multiple pMLC regulators. This would ensure a dynamic control of pMLC levels in a temporally and spatially specific manner required for mechanical force production and lung branching. It is interesting to note that YAP also regulates the expression of other regulators of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. While many regulators of the cytoskeleton are known to control Hippo signaling, our finding reveals a novel feedback control of the actomyosin cytoskeleton by YAP. This could function to fine-tune mechanical force production. Uncovering the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of YAP targets that we have identified during lung development would increase our understanding of how YAP controls cellular contractility.</p><p>We reported mosaic patterns of nuclear YAP distribution in lung epithelium. pYAP levels also vary significantly from cell to cell in both the proximal and distal airways, and a lower pYAP level is usually associated with nuclear localization of YAP. This suggests that YAP is dynamically shuttling in and out of the nucleus along the entire lung epithelium. On the average, 30–50% proximal and 10–28% distal epithelial cells contain cytoplasmic YAP, which is presumed to be inactive. Lung branching takes place at specific locations in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Metzger et al., 2008</xref>). It is likely epithelial cells that undergo active branching need to maintain active YAP signaling. By contrast, epithelial cells not actively branching may have inactive YAP through YAP phosphorylation. We speculate that this could serve to facilitate directional epithelial movement and new bud formation. How nuclear YAP is activated and maintained in lung epithelial cells requires future investigations. Lung epithelial cells with scanty nuclear YAP usually stain positive for cytoplasmic YAP. If cytoplasmic YAP is inactive as postulated, we anticipate that deletion of YAP in these cells should not have significant functional consequences. Namely, deletion of cytoplasmic YAP by Cre is not expected to exert non-cell autonomous effects on neighboring cells that contain nuclear YAP. As an extension of these ideas, we propose that pMLC is only produced and/or maintained at active sites of branching. This would allow mechanical force production in a regional manner and induce corresponding morphological changes. Consistent with this idea, pMLC was shown to exhibit dynamical patterns in the epithelial membrane during branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schnatwinkel and Niswander, 2013</xref>). In the absence of YAP, disruption of pMLC production leads to a failure of new bud formation. One possibility is that new bud formation requires increased mechanical tension at the apical surface for its expansion and protrusion to produce new buds, while less tension is present in the interbud region. Testing these models relies on refined genetic manipulation coupled with cellular manipulation, real-time imaging and theoretical modeling.</p><p>Loss of YAP induced by <italic>Shh<sup>Cre</sup></italic> resulted in global cystic formation. It is interesting to note that the trachea and main stem bronchi appears to be spared. Moreover, most cysts also expressed SOX9. This could be due to a failure of <italic>Sox9</italic>-expressing progenitors to generate a sufficient number of cells that become the SOX2<sup>+</sup> conducting airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alanis et al., 2014</xref>). It is also possible that a fundamental difference in the mechanical properties of lung epithelial cells exists in different regions of the lung. In this scenario, cyst formation due to loss of mechanical force may be prone to occur at the distal tips of the lung. By contrast, lung epithelial cells in the proximal part of the airway may receive mechanical restraints from neighboring cells and cyst formation is less frequent.</p><p>How YAP integrates signals from the environment and orchestrates changes in local cell properties of the lung epithelium is unknown. Given that major signaling pathways control key aspects of lung branching, it is likely that these signals funnel through YAP. Interestingly, a previous study reported distal cyst formation in <italic>Frizzled 2</italic> (<italic>Fzd2</italic>)-deficient lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kadzik et al., 2014</xref>). Loss of <italic>Fzd2</italic> also resulted in reduced apical pMLC expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kadzik et al., 2014</xref>). These findings led to a model in which non-canonical Wnt signaling through its receptor Fzd2 regulates epithelial cell behavior necessary for lung branching. This raises the interesting possibility that Wnt signaling could impinge upon YAP during branching morphogenesis. The relationship between Wnt and YAP is controversial in the literature. Future genetic studies in mice are required to clarify the physiological function of pathway interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Our findings differ in several ways from a previous report in which localized YAP activity was detected in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahoney et al., 2014</xref>). In this model, a nuclear-cytoplasmic shift of YAP protein marks the ‘transition zone’, a small proximal epithelial domain (SOX2<sup>+</sup>) abutting the distal SOX9<sup>+</sup> epithelial compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahoney et al., 2014</xref>). Namely, nuclear YAP is present in cells in the distal airway and the transition zone, while cytoplasmic YAP is detected in the proximal airway. We found that active nuclear YAP is distributed along the entire airway epithelium. It is unclear why our results are different from the published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahoney et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that tissue processing and the staining procedure (such as tyramide signal amplification) may have played a role since they could unmask YAP antigens.</p><p>Moreover, nuclear YAP in SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells at the ‘transition zone’ was proposed in the published literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahoney et al., 2014</xref>) to directly induce <italic>Sox2</italic> expression. This enables the initiation of the progenitor cell program that forms the airways during branching morphogenesis. The global cystic lung phenotype in <italic>Yap<sup>f/f</sup>; Shh<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice was attributed to loss of a <italic>TGF</italic>β-mediated proximal-distal program due to selective disruption of a YAP-SOX2 axis in the transition zone. While attractive, this model seems to be at odds with studies in other tissues where Hippo signaling exerts a general effect on all cells. In this study, we found no evidence of localized YAP activity to the transition zone. Importantly, if the lung phenotypes in <italic>Yap</italic> mutants can only be initiated at a specific location in the lung epithelium (such as the ‘transition zone’ connecting SOX2<sup>+</sup> and SOX9<sup>+</sup> populations), we do not anticipate lung cysts to form in <italic>Yap<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Yap<sup>f/f</sup>; spc<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> lungs since high levels of Cre activity are not present in the SOX2<sup>+</sup>YAP<sup>nuclear </sup>transition zone in these mice. In fact, we observed distal cysts in both <italic>Yap<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Yap<sup>f/f</sup>; spc<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These findings contradict the predictions of localized YAP activity in the transition zone and instead support our model of a general effect of YAP on epithelial cell properties. Taken together, our studies form the basis of future mechanistic studies to understand how modulation of local epithelial properties by major signaling pathways controls cell number, morphogenetic movement and pattern formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p><italic>Shh<sup>Cre</sup></italic> [B6.Cg-<italic>Shh<sup>tm1(EGFP/cre)Cjt</sup>/J</italic>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:005622">IMSR_JAX:005622</ext-link>], <italic>Nkx2.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> [C57BL/6J-<italic>Tg (Nkx2–1-cre)2Sand/J</italic>] and <italic>ROSA26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> [<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo</sup>/J</italic>; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007576">IMSR_JAX:007576</ext-link>] mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). <italic>spc<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<italic>Sftpc-Cre</italic>) mice [<italic>Tg(Sftpc-cre)1Blh</italic>; MGI:3574949] were given by Dr. Brigid Hogan and <italic>Sox9<sup>Cre</sup></italic> [<italic>Sox9t<sup>m3(Cre)Crm</sup></italic>; MGI: 3608931] mice by Dr. Benoit de Crombrugghe.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Tushar Desai (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, Lin and colleagues investigate the role of the Hippo mediator, YAP, in the epithelium of the developing mouse lung. They show that nuclear (active) YAP is present in both proximal and distal compartments of the embryonic lung, and that targeted epithelial deletion of YAP early in lung development severely disrupts branching morphogenesis. Using mosaic epithelial deletion, they show that the cystic airway phenotype appears to be delimited to the regions where YAP was deleted, suggesting it acts locally to regulate branching. They then use RNA-Seq and ChIP-seq to identify differentially expressed genes and direct YAP target genes, respectively. Enrichment of cell cycle and cellular contractility genes prompted them to ask whether YAP controls cellular contractility, and they show that phospho-MLC is reduced in mutants. They then show a functional reduction in the speed of uninjured epithelial cell movement in mutant airways following neighbor ablation, consistent with a role for YAP in mechanical force production. Direct YAP target genes that activate RhoA, such as <italic>Arhgef17</italic>, are found to be reduced in mutants, supporting that YAP is upstream of mechanical force production.</p><p>This is an extensive study that reveals new information about the role of YAP during mouse lung development and puts forth an interesting model about YAP, which is itself regulated by mechanical tension, and might in turn regulate mechanical force generation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide more convincing experimental data as to whether or not branch initiation, however perturbed, is abrogated in the YAP mutants. Specifically, analyze H&amp;E sections scored for 'evaginations' (the putative 'branches' reported in the previous publication), as well as some live imaging of the mutant lungs in culture which could help delineate whether localized branches initiate or not.</p><p>2) Formulate more clearly a proposed model for how loss of mechanical force production in the epithelium translates into the observed cystic phenotype. Could this phenotype result without a 'branching' defect per se? Also, since the authors have not directly implicated mechanical force as the mechanism, they should temper the strength of their claim.</p><p>3) At the stages reported, a significant proportion of proximal (30-50%) and distal (10-28%) epithelial cells lack nuclear (active) YAP. The authors should discuss how this mosaicism factors into their proposed model. Do these cells stain for cytoplasmic YAP and, if so, could deletion of YAP in these cells be significant? If not, then does their failure to 'rescue' the YAP-deleted cells indicate a non-cell autonomous phenotype – the authors should clarify since they make a point of stating that the effects of YAP deletion are 'local' in the lung.</p><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>The authors present an enormous amount of data characterizing various aspects of their mutant phenotypes. While this is an impressive amount of work, the way it is organized makes the manuscript difficult to follow. Certain parts of the figures are slightly redundant and could be omitted (e.g. Figure 1—figure supplements 3 and 4). On the other hand, the authors often refer to data that is not included to justify their conclusions (e.g. aPKC, β-catenin and α-catenin distribution), and should therefore be part of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21130.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Provide more convincing experimental data as to whether or not branch initiation, however perturbed, is abrogated in the YAP mutants.

We found that at early stages of lung development, such as 11.5 and 12.5 <italic>dpc</italic>, limited lung branching occurred in the absence of YAP. Five lung buds could be discerned in <italic>Yap</italic>-deficient lungs at 11.5 <italic>dpc</italic>, although the extent of lung bud separation was not as complete as that in wild-type lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, N</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Limited branching continued at 12.5 <italic>dpc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>). Small “evaginations” could be found in <italic>Yap</italic>-deficient lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O, Q</xref>) but they failed to generate new buds beyond 13.5 <italic>dpc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R</xref>).</p><p>This conclusion was supported by live imaging of <italic>Yap</italic>-deficient lungs using time-lapse microscopy and <italic>ex vivo</italic>lung explants. For instance, we examined lung explants at 12.5 <italic>dpc</italic>. At this stage, limited lung branching in <italic>Yap</italic>-deficient mutants would soon stop. We found that the existing lung buds developed multiple small “evaginations” over time but within the time frame of live imaging, they never progressed to generate new lung buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that loss of YAP severely compromises branching after 12.5 <italic>dpc</italic> despite the presence of multiple small “evaginations”.</p><p> <italic>2) Formulate more clearly a proposed model for how loss of mechanical force production in the epithelium translates into the observed cystic phenotype. Could this phenotype result without a 'branching' defect per se? Also, since the authors have not directly implicated mechanical force as the mechanism, they should temper the strength of their claim.</italic> </p><p>In the Discussion section of the revised manuscript, we have formulated a more precise model for how loss of mechanical force production in the <italic>Yap</italic>-deficient lung epithelium could lead to the cystic phenotypes. In essence, we propose that regional YAP activation and mechanical force production may result in selective epithelial expansion and formation of new lung buds. Loss of YAP and mechanical force would compromise this process; limited omnidirectional outgrowth would lead to cyst formation.</p><p>We have toned down the claim of mechanical force in lung branching throughout the text of the revised manuscript. Our studies serve as the foundation for future investigation to fully understand the relationship between mechanical force production and lung branching.</p><p><italic>3) At the stages reported, a significant proportion of proximal (30-50%) and distal (10-28%) epithelial cells lack nuclear (active) YAP. The authors should discuss how this mosaicism factors into their proposed model. Do these cells stain for cytoplasmic YAP and, if so, could deletion of YAP in these cells be significant? If not, then does their failure to 'rescue' the YAP-deleted cells indicate a non-cell autonomous phenotype – the authors should clarify since they make a point of stating that the effects of YAP deletion are 'local' in the lung.</italic> </p><p>We have included discussion on the mosaic pattern of nuclear YAP distribution. pYAP levels also vary significantly from cell to cell in both the proximal and distal airways and a lower pYAP level is usually associated with nuclear localization of YAP. This suggests that YAP is dynamically shuttling in and out of the nucleus along the entire lung epithelium. On the average, 30%-50% proximal and 10-28% distal epithelial cells contain cytoplasmic YAP, which is presumed to be inactive.</p><p>Lung branching takes place at specific locations in the lung. It is likely epithelial cells that undergo active branching need to maintain active YAP signaling. By contrast, epithelial cells not undergoing active branching may have inactive YAP through YAP phosphorylation. We speculate that this could serve to facilitate directional epithelial movement and new bud formation. How nuclear YAP is activated and maintained in lung epithelial cells requires future investigations.</p><p>Lung epithelial cells that do not have nuclear YAP usually stain positive for cytoplasmic YAP, but some cells have no YAP, presumably because YAP is degraded through the phosphorylation-induced degradation mechanism. If cytoplasmic YAP is inactive as postulated, we expect that deletion of YAP in these cells should not have significant functional consequences. In other words, deletion of cytoplasmic YAP by Cre is not expected to exert non-cell autonomous effects of neighboring cells that contain nuclear YAP. These points have been discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p> <italic>Suggested revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The authors present an enormous amount of data characterizing various aspects of their mutant phenotypes.
