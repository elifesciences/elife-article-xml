sequences from tRNA precursor transcripts (pre-tRNAs) by ribonuclease P (RNase P) is essential for protein synthesis. Beyond RNA-based RNase P enzymes, protein-only versions of the enzyme exert this function in various eukarya (there termed PRORPs) and in some bacteria (<italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> and close relatives); both enzyme types belong to distinct subgroups of the PIN domain metallonuclease superfamily. Homologs of <italic>Aquifex</italic> RNase P (HARPs) are also expressed in some other bacteria and many archaea, where they coexist with RNA-based RNase P and do not represent the main RNase P activity. Here, we solved the structure of the bacterial HARP from <italic>Halorhodospira halophila</italic> by cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a novel screw-like dodecameric assembly. Biochemical experiments demonstrate that oligomerization is required for RNase P activity of HARPs. We propose that the tRNA substrate binds to an extended spike-helix (SH) domain that protrudes from the screw-like assembly to position the 5’-end in close proximity to the active site of the neighboring dimer. The structure suggests that eukaryotic PRORPs and prokaryotic HARPs recognize the same structural elements of pre-tRNAs (tRNA elbow region and cleavage site). Our analysis thus delivers the structural and mechanistic basis for pre-tRNA processing by the prokaryotic HARP system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aquifex aeolicus rnase p</kwd><kwd>HARP</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>mass photometry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HA 1672/19-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartmann</surname><given-names>Roland K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The novel cryo-electron microscopy structure of a bacterial protein-only RNase P illustrates how a small protein oligomerizes into a dodecameric assembly to catalyze the 5’-end maturation of tRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is the essential endonuclease that catalyzes the 5’-end maturation of tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klemm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rossmanith and Hartmann, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guerrier-Takada et al., 1983</xref>). The enzyme is present in all forms of life, yet shows a remarkable variation in the molecular architecture. There are two basic types of RNase P, RNA-based and protein-only variants. The former consists of a structurally conserved, catalytic RNA molecule that associates with a varying number of protein cofactors (1 in bacteria, 5 in archaea, and 9–10 in eukarya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klemm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jarrous and Gopalan, 2010</xref>]). Protein-only enzymes arose independently twice in evolution. In eukarya, a <underline>pr</underline>otein-<underline>o</underline>nly <underline>R</underline>Nase <underline>P</underline> (termed PRORP) apparently originated at the root of eukaryotic evolution and is present in four of the five eukaryotic supergroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lechner et al., 2015</xref>). This type of enzyme replaced the RNA-based enzyme in one compartment or even in all compartments with protein synthesis machineries, such as land plants harboring PRORP enzymes in the nucleus, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gobert et al., 2010</xref>). In metazoan mitochondria, PRORP requires two additional protein cofactors for efficient function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holzmann et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>More recently, a bacterial protein-only RNase P, associated with a single polypeptide as small as ~23 kDa, was discovered in the hyperthermophilic bacterium <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> that lost the genes for the RNA and protein subunits (<italic>rnpB</italic> and <italic>rnpA</italic>) of the classical and ancient bacterial RNase P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nickel et al., 2017</xref>). This prokaryotic type of minimal RNase P system was named HARP (for: <underline>H</underline>omolog of <underline>A</underline>quifex <underline>R</underline>Nase <underline>P</underline>) and identified in 5 other of the 36 bacterial phyla beyond Aquificae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nickel et al., 2017</xref>). Among HARP-encoding bacteria, only some lack the genes for RNA-based RNase P (i.e., Aquificae, Nitrospirae), while others harbor <italic>rnpA</italic> and <italic>rnpB</italic> genes as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daniels et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nickel et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, HARP genes are more abundant in archaea than bacteria. However, all of these HARP-positive archaea also encode the RNA and protein subunits of the RNA-based RNase P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nickel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daniels et al., 2019</xref>). Remarkably, HARP gene knockouts in two Euryarchaeota, <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> and <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic>, showed no growth phenotypes under standard conditions, temperature, and salt stress (<italic>H. volcanii</italic>) or nitrogen deficiency (<italic>M. mazei</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwarz et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, it was impossible to entirely erase the RNase P RNA gene from the polyploid genome of <italic>H. volcanii</italic> (~18 genome copies per cell in exponential growth phase; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breuert et al., 2006</xref>). Even a knockdown to ~20% of the wild-type RNase P RNA level in <italic>H. volcanii</italic> was detrimental to tRNA processing and resulted in retarded cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stachler and Marchfelder, 2016</xref>). The findings suggest that HARP is neither essential nor represents the housekeeping RNase P function in archaea, explaining its sporadic loss in archaea. HARPs are evolutionarily linked to toxin-antitoxin systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daniels et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwarz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gobert et al., 2019</xref>). Frequently, the toxin proteins are endoribonucleases that cleave mRNA, rRNA, tmRNA, or tRNA to inhibit protein biosynthesis in response to certain stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Masuda and Inouye, 2017</xref>). Conceivably, the progenitor of <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> and related Aquificaceae might have acquired such a toxin-like tRNA endonuclease via horizontal gene transfer and established it as the main RNase P activity with relatively little reprogramming.</p><p>HARPs belong to the PIN domain-like superfamily of metallonucleases. They were assigned to the PIN_5 cluster, VapC structural group, whereas eukaryal PRORPs belong to a different subgroup of this superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matelska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gobert et al., 2019</xref>). HARPs oligomerize and Aq880 was originally observed to elute as a large homo-oligomeric complex of ~420 kDa in gel filtration experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nickel et al., 2017</xref>). However, its specific mode of substrate recognition and the underlying structural basis is lacking to date. Here, we present the homo-dodecameric structure of the HARP from the γ-bacterium <italic>Halorhodospira halophila</italic> SL1 (Hhal2243) solved by cryo-electron microscopy (EM) at 3.37 Å resolution. Furthermore, we employed mass photometry (MP) to investigate the oligomerization behavior of HARP and correlated the oligomeric state with enzyme activity. Our structure reveals that HARPs form stable dimers via a two-helix domain inserted into the metallonuclease domain. These dimers further assemble into a screw-like assembly resulting in an asymmetric and thus imperfect novel type of homo-dodecamer. Our biochemical analysis suggests that pre-tRNA processing involves the neighboring dimers and thus requires the formation of a higher-order HARP oligomer. In conclusion, we here present the structural basis for the RNase P-like pre-tRNA processing activity of prokaryotic HARPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dodecameric structure of the HARP from <italic>H. halophila</italic></title><p>Structural information on <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> RNase P (Aq880) and HARPs is lacking and a mechanistic understanding of pre-tRNA processing by HARPs has remained unknown so far. As previously observed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), Aq880 forms large oligomers of ~420 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nickel et al., 2017</xref>). Our attempts to resolve its structure by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance were unsuccessful. Therefore, we also purified other HARPs to increase the chances of successful structure determination. Among those was the HARP of <italic>H. halophila</italic> (Hhal2243) that was purified to homogeneity using a two-step protocol consisting of Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; see Materials and methods). Hhal2243 formed an assembly of similar size as Aq880 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) but adopted a more uniform oligomeric state than Aq880 (see below). Like Aq880 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marszalkowski et al., 2008</xref>), Hhal2243 showed pre-tRNA processing activity in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>).</p><p>We succeeded in solving the structure of Hhal2243 by cryo-EM to 3.37 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">supplementary file 1a</xref>). Hhal2243 assembles into a dodecamer in a left-handed screw-like manner, with each molecule being rotated by approximately 58°, except for the interface between dimers 1/1* and 6/6*. Upon completion of the single screw turn, the first and last dimers (1/1* and 6/6*) encounter each other at a slightly larger angle of 70° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top view, left) and laterally displaced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, side view, right); they cannot form the same inter-dimer contacts as dimers can form within the screw turn; the steric clash between dimers 1/1* and 6/6* terminates oligomerization. Hypothetic geometric scenarios that would allow a continuation of oligomerization beyond a dodecamer are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. Hhal2243 consists of a PIN-like metallonuclease domain into which two helices are inserted that we termed the ‘spike-helix’ (SH) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The PIN-like domain is formed by six α-helices (α1–α4, α7, and α8) and four β-strands (β1–β4) that fold into an α/β/α domain with a central, four-stranded parallel β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Two Hhal2243 monomers align head-to-head with their SH domains consisting of helices α5 and α6 to form a dimer, while two SH domains form a four-helix bundle resulting in six spikes that protrude from the dodecameric assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The dimer interface covers a buried surface area of 1300 Å<sup>2</sup> and is mainly of hydrophobic nature with two clamping salt bridges formed by R141 and E91 from either monomer, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dodecameric structure of Hhal2243.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cryo-EM electron density map of Hhal2243 shown from a top view (left) and a side view (right).

Application of this method to Hhal2243 revealed a stable dodecameric assembly of 295 kDa that included 98% of all molecules in the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top left panel). To compare this oligomerization behavior with that of Aq880, we purified Aq880 by Ni-ion affinity chromatography and SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Interestingly, despite their similar behavior on SEC, MP of Aq880 unveiled a major species at 277 kDa that, however, included only 47% of all molecules, while several subspecies with lower molecular weights became visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top right panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">supplementary file 1b</xref>). This polydispersity of Aq880, not detectable in SEC profiles, is probably the reason why all structural approaches failed so far in the case of Aq880.</p><p>To investigate whether oligomerization of Aq880 might impact its pre-tRNA processing activity, we analyzed the oligomer interface of the Hhal2243 structure in more detail. As outlined above, the interdimer interaction involves the α4–α5 loop of one monomer (e.g., monomer 1) and the α7–α8 loop as well as the C-terminal helix α8 of the other monomer (e.g., monomer 2) provided by the neighboring dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This implied that C-terminal protein truncations affecting the integrity of helix α8 will impede oligomer formation. We thus evaluated the ability of C-terminally truncated Aq880 variants to oligomerize by MP and their activity in pre-tRNA processing experiments. Five truncated variants of Aq880 were purified to homogeneity and analyzed by SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, SEC calibration suggested molecular masses of 55–68 kDa for all truncated Aq880 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). MP of protein variant Aq880<sub>Δ184–191</sub> still showed a considerable subfraction (~18%; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">supplementary file 1b</xref>) of higher-order oligomers (≥133 kDa), whereas Aq880<sub>Δ181–191</sub> formed only 4% hexamer (peak at 134 kDa), 41% tetramer (peak at 81 kDa) beyond the dimer subfraction at 42 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, middle panels; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">supplementary file 1b</xref>). Further truncation of Aq880 had an impact on protein stability, as judged by lower purification yields, and MP revealed that variants Aq880<sub>Δ179–191</sub> and Aq880<sub>Δ177–191</sub> form only dimeric species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lower panels). Processing assays revealed that deletion of residues 184–191 resulted in a protein that still had substantial activity, while all the other truncations showed almost no activity or were entirely inactive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

This is consistent with the different structural basis of the two types of enzymes acting on tRNAs. PRORPs are composed of a PPR domain important for substrate recognition, a central zinc finger domain, and a flexible hinge connecting it to the metallonuclease domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Howard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Teramoto et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, HARPs solely consist of a metallonuclease domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The active sites of both molecules superpose well with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.445 over 30 Cα atoms. More precisely, the β-strands 5, 6, and 8, and the α-helices 16 and 20 within the metallonuclease domain of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> PRORP1 (<italic>At</italic>PRORP1) were used for the structural superposition with β1, β4, α1, and α6 of Hhal2243, as the overall scaffold of the two metallonuclease domains is related but shows large structural deviations.

Helices α5 and α6 of the SH domain expose several conserved arginines and lysines that might be critical for pre-tRNA binding. Notably, several of the residues lie within the distal part of the SH domain that was not resolved in our cryo-EM structure, likely due to a high degree of conformational flexibility. As secondary structure predictions indicated a continuation of the helical arrangement in this region, we generated a homology model of Aq880 based on the Hhal2243 structure and the secondary structure prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Our combined structural and biochemical analysis sheds light on this prokaryotic minimal protein-only RNase P system.</p><p>The Hhal2243 HARP structure assembles into a homo-dodecameric ultrastructure. The dodecamer consists of six dimers that oligomerize in a screw-like fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The monomeric subunits of the dimers interact via their SH domains. There are many examples of proteins forming symmetric homo-dodecameric assemblies (e.g., glutamine synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van Rooyen et al., 2011</xref>]; helicases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bazin et al., 2015</xref>] or bacterial DNA-binding proteins expressed in the stationary phase (DPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Roy et al., 2008</xref>]) and recent studies have discussed the theoretical types of possible quaternary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Laniado and Yeates, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahnert et al., 2015</xref>). However, the screw-like assembly of HARPs leads to an asymmetric and thus imperfect novel type of oligomer. This way, HARPs form a defined quaternary structure that is not entirely symmetric, while the screw-like assembly terminates the incorporation of new subunits at the stage of a dodecamer. By stepwise truncation of the C-terminus of Aq880, oligomerization could be reduced or abolished, which correlated with functional losses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Our results thus clearly show that only oligomeric species of HARP are able to cleave the 5’-leader sequence of pre-tRNAs.</p><p>HARPs belong to the PIN domain-like superfamily of metallonucleases and share this classification with the eukaryotic PRORPs, although the two systems belong to distinct subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matelska et al., 2017</xref>). We compared our structure to the PIN domain of PRORPs and could demonstrate that the active site residues superpose well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that the catalytic mechanism is basically conserved. Notably, the two proteins had to be superposed over a small range of Cα−atoms to obtain a good r.m.s.d. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) owing to the large overall differences of the two PIN domains.</p><p>With the knowledge of the structural conservation of the active site, we examined the pre-tRNA substrate recognition and binding by the two protein-only RNase P systems: the crystal structure of the PPR domain of <italic>At</italic>PRORP1 in complex with a tRNA unveiled how PRORPs recognize the pre-tRNA via its PPR RNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Teramoto et al., 2020</xref>). The characteristic feature of classical pentatricopeptide repeats (PPRs) is that each PPR repeat recognizes a specific nucleotide, allowing high RNA target specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the PPR domain of PRORP recognizes conserved structural elements of tRNAs rather than single nucleotides in a binding mode reminiscent to that of the RNA-based RNase P holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Teramoto et al., 2020</xref>). More precisely, the elbow region, where D- and T-loop interact, is the main tRNA-protein interaction interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Teramoto et al., 2020</xref>), a feature that became already evident in previous biochemical and biophysical investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pinker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gobert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brillante et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pinker et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the same region, representing the most conserved structural element of tRNAs, is also recognized by RNA-based RNase P enzymes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rossmanith and Hartmann, 2020</xref>). We thus considered it likely that pre-tRNA recognition by HARPs involves the tRNA elbow region in a similar manner as for all other RNase P types, although we were puzzled by the absence of any evident RNA binding motifs in HARPs. We then focused on exposed positively charged residues and were indeed able to identify a stretch of conserved arginine and lysine residues within the SH domain of the protein. Variation of this positive stretch to alanines rendered the protein inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Combining our knowledge on the active site, on the residues critical for pre-tRNA binding and the correlation of an oligomeric assembly with enzymatic activity, we set out to propose a model for pre-tRNA binding by HARP proteins. Assuming that the outer SH domain, harboring the stretch of positively charged amino acid side chains, interacts with the tRNA elbow, then the distance of approximately 45 Å between the outer SH domain of one dimer and the active site of the neighboring dimer perfectly positions one pre-tRNA molecule for cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To test this, we used the yeast tRNA from the PRORP structure as model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Teramoto et al., 2020</xref>) and could perfectly dock it onto our HARP structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Notably, in this scenario, the D-loop is near helix α3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We thus also consider it likely that residues within α3 are involved in the coordination of the D-loop. Our proposed tRNA binding mode considers that oligomerization is strictly required for HARP activity. This framework enables the cooperation of two adjacent dimers, where one monomer of each dimer binds the tRNA elbow in such a manner that the pre-tRNA cleavage site, at a distance of ~45 Å, directly reaches into the active site of the monomer from the neighboring dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model for tRNA recognition and processing by HARPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface of two adjacent Aq880 dimers colored according to the calculated electrostatic potential.

This way, five pre-tRNAs can potentially be docked onto the upper or lower layer of the dodecameric, distorted double donut structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This raises the question, how likely the simultaneous occupancy of all 10 potential tRNA binding sites is. So far, we have been unable to obtain stable HARP:tRNA complexes at submicromolar concentrations, for example, on size exclusion columns. However, considering that tRNA concentration within an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cell was estimated to be 0.5 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodsell, 1991</xref>), conditions might be conceivable (e.g., after shutdown of protein synthesis) at which all 10 tRNA binding sites could be saturated. Another possibility is cooperative tRNA binding, such that binding of one tRNA allosterically facilitates binding of the next one. Such a model could also explain the observed requirement of a higher-order oligomer structure for RNase P activity. However, we found no evidence for cooperativity in pre-tRNA cleavage kinetics catalyzed by Aq880 under multiple turnover conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nickel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although the model is hypothetical at present, other pre-tRNA binding modes seem unlikely based on the spatial constraints imposed by the dodecameric HARP structure and the uniformity and rigidity of prokaryotic tRNAs. Our data furthermore suggest that in the higher oligomeric assemblies, the dimers mutually stabilize by each other for productive pre-tRNA processing. Variant Aq880<sub>Δ181–191</sub> still forms tetramers and a low number of hexamers but is only 10% active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). In contrast, Aq880<sub>Δ184–191</sub> also assembles into octamers, decamers, and a small subset of even dodecamers but retains over 90% activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We thus consider it likely that higher oligomers form a more rigid scaffold, while a tetramer alone is too flexible for efficient binding and cleavage of precursor tRNAs. HARPs thus represent an impressive example of how a more complex biological task can be accomplished by a small protein that assembles into a large homo-oligomeric ultrastructure, and where different monomers contribute distinct partial functions.</p><p>Taken together, we here present the molecular framework for pre-tRNA processing by HARPs and show that this enzyme system, although it evolved independently of PRORPs, shares conserved features with eukaryotic PRORPs concerning pre-tRNA recognition and nuclease activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Aq_880</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">AAC07003.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Halorhodospira halophila</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Hhal_2243</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">ABM63007.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Rosetta (DE3)</td><td valign="top">Merck Novagen</td><td valign="top">70954–3</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Lemo21 (DE3)</td><td valign="top">NEB Biolabs</td><td valign="top">HC2528J</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>6×His Tag HRP (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen</td><td>Catalog #MA1-21315-HRP</td><td>Dilution <break/>1:5000</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Gel Filtration Markers Kit for Protein Molecular Weights12–200 kDa</td><td>Merck Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>MWGF200</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Apoferritin</td><td>Merck Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>A3660</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>Adobe Illustrator CC</td><td>Adobe</td><td/><td>Version 25.0</td></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>Adobe Photoshop CC</td><td>Adobe</td><td/><td>Version 22.0.0</td></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>CryoSparc</td><td>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4169">10.1038/nmeth.4169</ext-link></td><td/><td>v3.1</td></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>CTFfind4</td><td>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2015.08.008">10.1016/j.jsb.2015.08.008</ext-link></td><td/><td>Version 4.1.14</td></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>Topaz</td><td>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0575-8">10.1038/s41592-019-0575-8</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>COOT</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/">https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/</ext-link></td><td/><td>Version 0.9.3</td></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>Phenix</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phenix-online.org">http://www.phenix-online.org</ext-link></td><td/><td>Version 1.18</td></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>UCSF ChimeraX</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/">https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/</ext-link></td><td/><td>Version 1.2.5</td></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>Molprobity</td><td>Duke Biochemistry,<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/">http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>PyMol 2</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pymol.org/2/">https://pymol.org/2/</ext-link></td><td/><td>Version 2.0.6</td></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>AcquireMP</td><td>Refeyn (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.refeyn.com">https://www.refeyn.com</ext-link>)</td><td/><td>v.2.3</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular cloning and plasmid generation</title><p>In order to overexpress the Aq880cHis protein, a pET-28a(+)_Aq880cHis plasmid was constructed.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Nature has evolved remarkably different enzymes for the essential processing of 5´ ends of pre-tRNAs. The ribonucleoprotein RNase P uses its RNA component for pre-tRNA recognition and catalysis, the protein-only RNase P (PRORP) contains a pentatricopeptide repeat domain for pre-tRNA recognition and a nuclease domain for catalysis, and more recently a new family, Homolog of Aquifex RNase P (HARP), was identified. The HARPs seem mysterious as they are quite small (~23 kDa) and form oligomers. Although they appeared to possess a catalytic domain, it was unclear how they would recognize and process pre-tRNAs. Here the authors have addressed these questions by determining a cryo-EM structure of a dodecameric HARP, Hhal2243, and using the structural information to strikingly demonstrate the essential nature of the oligomerization for enzymatic activity of the Aquifex HARP, Aq880. Enzymatic activity assays with mutant enzymes identify basic residues for pre-tRNA substrate recognition, and a preliminary HARP/tRNA model suggests a possible mode for pre-tRNA recognition and catalysis by the dodecamer. The authors responded comprehensively and effectively to the prior concerns raised and included new data about the oligomerization state of the mutant enzymes. The revised manuscript is acceptable for publication.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structure and mechanistic features of the prokaryotic minimal RNase P&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing and Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and we have drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. There was strong enthusiasm for this study and almost all the requested revisions, though rather numerous, are related to improving the text and figure presentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors aligned their cryo-EM model with the crystal structure of the Arabidopsis PRORP1 to show that the arrangement of catalytic acidic residues is conserved in these two families, although I believe the overall structure of each protein family is distinct. To clarify this point, please explain the structural alignment more (page 9, lines 178-179). Are the folds distinct, yet the catalytic residues align? The authors should consider moving Figure S5 to the main figures. The conservation of the arrangement of catalytic residues will likely be of interest to enzymologists fascinated by the consistent geometric arrangement produced by distinct structural scaffolds.</p><p>2) The authors identified two basic residues, R125 and R129, that are located in the spike-helix region of the protein. Mutation of either or both arginine residues to alanine abrogates enzymatic activity. The authors did not include experimental data (such as mass photometry) to confirm oligomerization status of these point mutants. This is a critical control that is necessary to support the conclusion.</p><p>3) The manuscript could be considerably strengthened if elements could be provided to support the proposed model for tRNA binding. Obviously the 3D structure of complex with pre-tRNA would validate (or not) the hypothesis presented here. While this is not required for this particular publication, could authors at least mention, if they attempted to obtain such a structure and if they did so, describe what they tried. In addition, Figure 3 describing SH domain mutants should be renamed &quot;SH domain is essential for RNase P activity&quot; because only RNase P activity was measured and not tRNA binding. Although I agree with authors that their data very strongly suggest a requirement of the distal part of helix a6 from the SH domain for tRNA binding, their results do not directly show it. This assumption and the resulting model for HARP / tRNA interaction would be considerably strengthened if authors could directly measure pre-tRNA interactions with the one or two mutants compared to wild-type using techniques such as micro scale thermophoresis or similar techniques.</p><p>4) If the authors elect not to perform additional experiments on characterizing the pre-tRNA interaction with their RNAse P (which will not be required by <italic>eLife</italic>), we request additional edits. We found somewhat confusing to understand which monomers were engaging pre-tRNA, and we recommend improving the presentation of the model and how it was generated. Including the coordinates of the model as a supplement file would be important.</p><p>5) It would be helpful to establish clear and consistent nomenclature for the individual subunits and dimers and to add labels to figures. For example, Figure 1A refers to both monomer and dimer subunits and a dimer subunit is shown in Figure 1C that seems to include monomer N and N´ but a different interface is shown in Figure 2A (monomer N and N+1). Labeling the monomers and the two different types of interfaces would prevent confusion throughout the manuscript. I suggest numbering the chains in the PDB file to roughly follow the nomenclature.</p><p>6) How well do the different dimers superimpose, such as 1/1´ with 2/2´, etc. or 1/2 with 2/3, etc.? Do the interfaces or monomer-monomer arrangements suggest what causes the screw axis to form? Are there indications of why a dodecamer might be favored or a higher order oligomer prohibited?</p><p>7) The relationship of pre-tRNAs to the dodecamer in the protein-RNA model is difficult to appreciate from Figure 4 and the text. The text reads, &quot;This framework enables the cooperation of two adjacent dimer subunits, where one dimer binds the tRNA elbow in such a manner that the pre-tRNA cleavage site, at a distance of ~45 Å, directly reaches into the active site of the neighboring dimer (Figure 4B).&quot; Could you please clarify that the adjacent dimer subunits shown in Figures 4A and B are N/N´ and N+1/N+1´ and indicate which monomer binds the tRNA elbow and which monomer binds the 5´ end?</p><p>8) Only one recognition site and one active site are labeled in Figures 4A and B. It seems that there are two recognition sites close to each other from N and N´ monomers and therefore four recognition sites in the dimer of dimers shown in Figures 4A and B. Similarly, there should be four active sites. How did you choose which recognition sites and active sites to engage substrate? It would be helpful to provide a more detailed description of how you eliminated other possibilities. Was there a combination of recognition site and active site that more closely aligned with PRORP models? If you aligned the active sites as in Suppl. Figure 5A, would the tRNA elbow recognition sites of HARP and PRORP be near each other?</p><p>Please consider briefly discussing these points. Do you envision that all five pre-tRNA molecules are engaged via both 5´ end and T loop? Do you think the binding of one substrate molecule affects binding or cleavage of other pre-tRNAs? Do you know if it is possible to form a stable complex of the dodecamer and pre-tRNA or tRNA in solution to determine stoichiometry?</p><p>9) Part of the confusion about the model could be cured by adding labels and descriptions to Figure 4. In Figure 4A, please indicate the orientation relative to Figure 1. We expected that subunit 1 would be on the right and subunit 2 would be on the left, but it seems like PIN and PIN´ could be mislabeled. In Figure 4C, please label the features of the tRNAs: D loop, T loop, 5´ end, 3´ end. Are the model and cartoon showing the same orientation? It seems like they are not the same. Are they flipped 180°?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70160.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors aligned their cryo-EM model with the crystal structure of the Arabidopsis PRORP1 to show that the arrangement of catalytic acidic residues is conserved in these two families, although I believe the overall structure of each protein family is distinct.

While some structural elements superpose well, some don’t but still the catalytic residues arrange in a highly similar way. It now reads: “More precisely, the β-strands 5, 6 and 8 and the α-helices 16 and 20 within the metallonuclease domain of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> PRORP1 (AtPRORP1) were used for the structural superposition with β1, β4, α1 and α6 at Hhal2243, as the overall scaffold of the two metallonuclease domains is related but shows large structural deviations.” Furthermore, we have moved Figure S5 to the main text (now Figure 3) and included two panels with a full view of the two metallonuclease domains allowing an easier understanding of the structural differences. The colors of the Hhal2243 depiction have been changed to blue to generate a stronger contrast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors identified two basic residues, R125 and R129, that are located in the spike-helix region of the protein. Mutation of either or both arginine residues to alanine abrogates enzymatic activity. The authors did not include experimental data (such as mass photometry) to confirm oligomerization status of these point mutants. This is a critical control that is necessary to support the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that these controls were critically lacking. We have now included mass photometry data on the R125, R129 and the 5xmut Aq880 (see Figure 4D). All variants form mainly dodecamers and show similar oligomerization behavior as the wildtype. We thus concluded in the text: “Notably, variation of positively charged residues to alanines in the SH-domain did not significantly change the oligomerization behavior of Aq880 as judged by mass photometry (Figure 4D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The manuscript could be considerably strengthened if elements could be provided to support the proposed model for tRNA binding.

We completely agree that a tRNA-bound structure would significantly strengthen our study. We have indeed tried to perform MST experiments to determine the binding affinities between tRNA and HARP. Unfortunately, our attempts were unsuccessful to date as the affinities appear rather low (µM range). In addition, we tried to use hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to determine the regions at Aq880 involved in tRNA binding. Unfortunately, Aq880 seems undetectable by mass spectrometry probably due to inefficient proteolytic digestion.</p><p>In addition, we tried to obtain a tRNA-bound structure of Hhal2243 by cryo-EM. Again, the low affinities of tRNA complicate structure solution. Initially, large amounts of unbound tRNA contaminated the grid preventing proper 2D classification. We are currently optimizing the conditions and could already collect a small dataset of a potential tRNA-bound state. However, assuming up to 10 binding sites with partial/differential occupancy, classification is challenging and requires collection of large datasets for extensive 2D and 3D classification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If the authors elect not to perform additional experiments on characterizing the pre-tRNA interaction with their RNAse P (which will not be required by eLife), we request additional edits. We found somewhat confusing to understand which monomers were engaging pre-tRNA, and we recommend improving the presentation of the model and how it was generated. Including the coordinates of the model as a supplement file would be important.</p></disp-quote><p>We have thoroughly reworked the presentation of the tRNA-bound state, now presented in Figure 5 (previously Figure 4). Furthermore, we have supplied the coordinates from which the figure was generated: Aq880-tRNA.pdb. We hope we could clarify how each of the monomers likely contacts a tRNA and which part of it is potentially recognized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would be helpful to establish clear and consistent nomenclature for the individual subunits and dimers and to add labels to figures. For example, Figure 1A refers to both monomer and dimer subunits and a dimer subunit is shown in Figure 1C that seems to include monomer N and N´ but a different interface is shown in Figure 2A (monomer N and N+1). Labeling the monomers and the two different types of interfaces would prevent confusion throughout the manuscript. I suggest numbering the chains in the PDB file to roughly follow the nomenclature.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewers on this point. We have removed “subunit” throughout the text and replaced it with “monomers” or “dimers” where appropriate. In addition, the numbering in the pdb file has been changed accordingly. Figure 1C shows monomers 2/2*, while Figure 2A shows the oligomer interface between monomer 1 and 2. We also changed the nomenclature of the second monomer and used an asterisk instead of a quotation mark to prevent confusion with the 3’- and 5’-ends of the tRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) How well do the different dimers superimpose, such as 1/1´ with 2/2´, etc. or 1/2 with 2/3, etc.? Do the interfaces or monomer-monomer arrangements suggest what causes the screw axis to form? Are there indications of why a dodecamer might be favored or a higher order oligomer prohibited?</p></disp-quote><p>The different dimers superpose very well with r.m.s.d.’s of 0.2 or lower. We have now put more effort into making plausible why oligomerization terminates after a single screw turn when dimer 6/6* collides with dimer 1/1* (see Results section, 2nd paragraph). In addition, we have added a supplementary figure illustrating the steric clash between dimers 1/1* and 6/6* along with geometric scenarios that would allow a continuation of oligomerization (Figure 1—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The relationship of pre-tRNAs to the dodecamer in the protein-RNA model is difficult to appreciate from Figure 4 and the text. The text reads, &quot;This framework enables the cooperation of two adjacent dimer subunits, where one dimer binds the tRNA elbow in such a manner that the pre-tRNA cleavage site, at a distance of ~45 Å, directly reaches into the active site of the neighboring dimer (Figure 4B).&quot; Could you please clarify that the adjacent dimer subunits shown in Figures 4A and B are N/N´ and N+1/N+1´ and indicate which monomer binds the tRNA elbow and which monomer binds the 5´ end?</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the figure (now Figure 5) and the text accordingly: “This framework enables the cooperation of two adjacent dimers, where one monomer of each dimer binds the tRNA elbow in such a manner that the pre-tRNA cleavage site, at a distance of ~45 Å, directly reaches into the active site of the monomer from the neighboring dimer. According to this scenario and as exemplarily illustrated in Figure 5B, the SH domain of monomer 6* would bind the tRNA elbow region, while the tRNA 5’-end is docked into the active site of monomer 5*. This way, five pre-tRNAs can potentially be docked onto the upper or lower layer of the dodecameric, distorted double donut structure (Figure 5C).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Only one recognition site and one active site are labeled in Figures 4A and B. It seems that there are two recognition sites close to each other from N and N´ monomers and therefore four recognition sites in the dimer of dimers shown in Figures 4A and B. Similarly, there should be four active sites. How did you choose which recognition sites and active sites to engage substrate? It would be helpful to provide a more detailed description of how you eliminated other possibilities. Was there a combination of recognition site and active site that more closely aligned with PRORP models? If you aligned the active sites as in Suppl. Figure 5A, would the tRNA elbow recognition sites of HARP and PRORP be near each other?</p></disp-quote><p>We have only illustrated one recognition site and one active site in Figure 5A and B (formerly Figure 4) to keep the figure as simple as possible. As stated above, the elbow region of tRNA 5* is recognized by monomer 6* while the cleavage site reaches into the active site of monomer 5*. Monomers 5 and 6 would recognize tRNA 5 in a mirrored fashion (monomer 5: elbow and monomer 6: active site). In total, 10 active sites out of 12 could be potentially occupied simultaneously. The asymmetric screw-like assembly sterically excludes that dimers 1 and 6 together are able to productively bind a tRNA.</p><p>Furthermore, we have superposed HARP and AtPRORP but in the latter, metallonuclease domain and PPR-domain are connected via a flexible linker, which complicates a direct comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please consider briefly discussing these points. Do you envision that all five pre-tRNA molecules are engaged via both 5´ end and T loop? Do you think the binding of one substrate molecule affects binding or cleavage of other pre-tRNAs? Do you know if it is possible to form a stable complex of the dodecamer and pre-tRNA or tRNA in solution to determine stoichiometry?</p></disp-quote><p>We can largely rule out a cooperative tRNA binding mode based on comparison of single and multiple turnover kinetics using Aq880 (Figure 2D, E in Nickel et al., PNAS 2017) We, however, consider it likely that the dimers are more rigid in the context of a higher oligomer structure, thereby supporting productive pre-tRNA binding.</p><p>We haven't been able to form a stable HARP:tRNA complex on size exclusion columns. The low affinity in the µ-molar range prevents an analysis by mass photometry, as we use 50- 100 nanomolar concentration in this setup. Concerning the maximum amount of bound tRNAs, we consider it possible that a “fully loaded” state may exist in vivo, considering that the tRNA concentration has been estimated to be 0.5 mM in an <italic>E. coli</italic> cell.</p><p>We have cautiously discussed these points in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Part of the confusion about the model could be cured by adding labels and descriptions to Figure 4. In Figure 4A, please indicate the orientation relative to Figure 1. We expected that subunit 1 would be on the right and subunit 2 would be on the left, but it seems like PIN and PIN´ could be mislabeled. In Figure 4C, please label the features of the tRNAs: D loop, T loop, 5´ end, 3´ end. Are the model and cartoon showing the same orientation? It seems like they are not the same. Are they flipped 180°?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now thoroughly reworked Figure 5 (previously Figure 4). Figure 5C (left) is now in the same orientation as Figure 5A. The orientation of 5C relative to Figure 1 has been added as sketch in the upper left corner. Furthermore, the nomenclature has been changed to be consistent. The tRNA has been labeled accordingly. We hope that our changes make it easier to follow our conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
