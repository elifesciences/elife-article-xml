For example, in neurons, co-expression of <italic>Cdc42</italic> exon 6 and exon 7 isoforms (both are alternative 3′ terminal exons) is crucial for normal morphogenesis as loss of either isoform results in abnormal development of axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yap et al., 2016</xref>). However, for many genes, our knowledge about how their isoforms are regulated remains limited. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an important mechanism to generate RNA isoforms with different 3′ ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gruber and Zavolan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitschka and Mayr, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian and Manley, 2017</xref>). The mRNA 3′-end processing factor CFIm is not essential for the cleavage reaction but has an outsized role in regulating APA as a sequence-dependent activator of mRNA 3′-end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boreikaite et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmidt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). The human CFIm consists of two subunits: a small subunit, CFIm25 (encoded by the NUDT21 gene), which directly binds to the UGUA motif, and two alternative large subunits, CFIm68 (encoded by the CPSF6 gene) and CFIm59 (encoded by the CPSF7 gene), which activate 3′-end processing by interacting with CPSF, one of the essential mRNA 3′-end processing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). It has been shown that loss of NUDT21 or CPSF6, but not CPSF7, resulted in widespread and overlapping APA alterations in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghosh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hwang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Masamha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). This is consistent with the finding that CFIm59 is a weaker activator of 3′-end processing compared with CFIm68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) and highlights the important roles of NUDT21 and CPSF6 in APA regulation. Notably, APA changes from loss of NUDT21 or CPSF6 are predominantly proximal shifts that lead to 3′ UTR shortening or expression of truncated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Masamha et al., 2014</xref>), which can be explained by the skewed distribution of the UGUA motif that favors the distal PAS in CFIm target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghosh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hwang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The mTORC1 signaling pathway plays a central role in regulating cell metabolism and hyperactive mTORC1 causes a group of neurodevelopmental disorders termed ‘mTORopathies’ with shared clinical manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crino, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lipton and Sahin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). One of the best-studied mTORopathies is Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), which is caused by loss-of-function mutations in <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic>, both of which are mTORC1 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salussolia et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, a recent RNA-seq study identified hundreds of mRNAs with shortened 3′ UTRs in <italic>Tsc1</italic>-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2015</xref>), which is reminiscent of the aforementioned APA changes from loss of NUDT21 or CPSF6. Subsequently, a direct link between the mTORC1 pathway and CPSF6 was discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic>—in starvation, repression of the mTORC1 signaling allows two downstream kinases, CDK8 and CLK2, to phosphorylate CPSF6, which is required for its nuclear localization to promote 3′ UTR lengthening of autophagy genes <italic>Atg1</italic> and <italic>Atg8a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). The regulation of CPSF6 by CDK8 and CLK2 was also present in human MCF7 cells and was required for starvation-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these two studies indicate that CPSF6-mediated APA regulation is a previously underappreciated component of the mTORC1 signaling pathway and suggest that APA dysregulation might contribute to TSC pathogenesis.</p><p>Our laboratory previously developed the cTag-PAPERCLIP technique, which utilizes a Cre-inducible allele of GFP-tagged poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) to perform high-throughput APA profiling in vivo in specific cell types without cell purification in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>). Because primary morbidity for TSC patients comes from central nervous system involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salussolia et al., 2019</xref>), we sought to investigate how hyperactive mTORC1 impacts the APA landscape in different brain cell types in vivo using cTag-PAPERCLIP and the widely used <italic>Tsc1</italic> conditional knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bateup et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ercan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kwiatkowski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meikle et al., 2007</xref>). During the investigation, we discovered that mTORC1 activities modulate the balance between two <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> isoforms in mouse cortical excitatory neurons in vivo. <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> encodes a neuronally enriched E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates neuron morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winkle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Winkle et al., 2016</xref>), but it was not previously reported to be regulated by mTORC1 or CFIm. In this study, we present both the initial findings that lead to our discovery and the subsequent mechanistic studies characterizing the regulation of <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> isoforms by mTORC1 through APA. We found that the expression of the short <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> isoform was dependent on CPSF6 and NUDT21, and we identified an evolutionarily conserved twin UGUA motif (UGUAYUGUA) that is essential for its PAS usage. We further demonstrated the existence of similar functional twin-UGUA motifs in additional human CPSF6-dependent PASs. Importantly, we showed that it is possible to engineer a PAS to be regulated by CPSF6 and mTORC1 by insertion of a twin UGUA motif. Overall, our study identifies an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to regulate gene isoform expression by the mTORC1 pathway and expands current knowledge of APA regulation by CFIm beyond the UGUA motif.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Systemic adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery of Cre recombinase is an efficient way to model human disease in the cTag-PABP mouse for APA profiling</title><p>To conditionally knock out <italic>Tsc1</italic> in brain cortical excitatory neurons in cTag-PABP mice, we generated pAAV-Camk2a-iCre, an AAV vector that expresses codon-optimized Cre recombinase (iCre) under the excitatory neuron-specific mouse <italic>Camk2a</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), and injected adult <italic>Tsc1</italic>-WT (<italic>Tsc1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>) and <italic>Tsc1</italic>-floxed (<italic>Tsc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>) cTag-PABP mice with pAAV-Camk2a-iCre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We sacrificed the injected mice 2–3 wk after injection and performed cTag-PAPERCLIP profiling to identify APA shifts resulting from activation of the mTORC1 signaling in brain cortical excitatory neurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We expected pAAV-Camk2a-iCre injection to (1) turn on PABP-GFP expression in excitatory neurons for cTag-PAPERCLIP profiling in both <italic>Tsc1</italic>-WT and <italic>Tsc1</italic>-floxed cTag-PABP mice and (2) knock <italic>Tsc1</italic> out and activate the mTORC1 signaling in excitatory neurons in <italic>Tsc1</italic>-floxed cTag-PABP mice. To verify the expected effects from pAAV-Camk2a-iCre injection, we first examined <italic>Tsc1</italic> expression in the cTag-PAPERCLIP profiles. As expected, <italic>Tsc1</italic> mRNA expression was strongly reduced (&gt;80%, 44.9 cpm to 8.6 cpm, p&lt;0.01) in the injected <italic>Tsc1</italic>-floxed cTag-PABP mice (designated as <italic>Tsc1</italic>-KO hereafter) while both <italic>Tsc2</italic> and <italic>Mtor</italic> mRNAs were expressed at similar levels in the injected mice of both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we checked whether the decrease in <italic>Tsc1</italic> expression was sufficient to activate mTORC1 signaling in the <italic>Tsc1</italic>-KO cTag-PABP mice. We performed western blots for both total and phosphorylated S6 (PS6) ribosomal protein, a well-established indicator of mTORC1 activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sengupta et al., 2010</xref>). As expected, PS6 in the brain cortex was strongly increased in an injected <italic>Tsc1</italic>-floxed cTag-PABP mouse when compared to an uninjected mouse of the same genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For comparison, we also examined the increase in PS6 in a genetically bred <italic>Camk2a-Cre; Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mouse brain cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We found that the magnitude of the PS6 increase is identical between AAV injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and genetic breeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that Cre delivery efficiency from systemic AAV injection is equivalent to that of genetic breeding.

Therefore, to select APA shifts that are more likely to have functional impact for further investigation, we used the same strategy and searched for APA shifts that satisfied the following criteria: (1) switched the major PAS, defined as the predominantly used (&gt;50% of total read counts) PAS between two PASs, and (2) CDS-APA. Only one gene from the list, <italic>Trim9</italic>, fulfilled both criteria. <italic>Trim9</italic> encodes a neuronally enriched E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates neuron morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winkle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Winkle et al., 2016</xref>). The two <italic>Trim9</italic> isoforms identified by cTag-PAPERCLIP in mouse cortical excitatory neurons are designated as <italic>Trim9-L</italic> and <italic>Trim9-S</italic> hereafter. <italic>Tsc1</italic> knockout in mouse cortical excitatory neurons causes a shift toward <italic>Trim9-L</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>Trim9-L</italic> is the full-length isoform while <italic>Trim9-S</italic> uses an upstream PAS to skip exons 8–14 and lacks the SPRY domain at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The SPRY domain is commonly found in TRIM family proteins and is implicated in protein–protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ozato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perfetto et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We next performed western blotting with brain cortices from <italic>Tsc1</italic>-WT and <italic>Tsc1</italic>-KO cTag-PABP mice to examine the impact of <italic>Trim9</italic> APA shift at the protein level. In parallel with the cTag-PAPERCLIP results, a shift toward <italic>Trim9-L</italic> protein expression was also observed in the <italic>Tsc1</italic>-KO cTag-PABP mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the observed <italic>Trim9</italic> APA shift is specific to pAAV-Camk2a-iCre-injected cTag-PABP mice, we measured expression of <italic>Trim9-L</italic> and <italic>Trim9-S</italic> mRNA isoforms by RT-qPCR using brain cortex tissues from the <italic>Camk2a-Cre; Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mouse and <italic>Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mouse pair shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>. Although this assay is not cell-type-specific like cTag-PAPERCLIP, a similar shift toward <italic>Trim9-L</italic> mRNA expression was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Lastly, because the <italic>Trim9</italic> exon arrangement is conserved in human, we sought to determine whether activation of mTORC1 signaling also favors <italic>TRIM9-L</italic> expression in human cells of neuronal lineage. We measured the abundance of <italic>TRIM9-L</italic> and <italic>TRIM9-S</italic> isoforms in a published RNA-seq dataset generated from WT and <italic>TSC2</italic>-KO human neural stem cells (NSCs) after 6 wk of neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grabole et al., 2016</xref>). We found that <italic>TRIM9-L</italic> mRNA expression was increased by more than 1.6-fold in <italic>TSC2</italic>-KO NSCs compared to WT NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, left panel, 17.2 cpm to 28.4 cpm, p&lt;0.05). Moreover, the <italic>TRM9-L/TRIM9-S</italic> ratio was consistently higher in <italic>TSC2</italic>-KO NSCs compared to WT NSCs in all replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, right panel). Taken together, these results show that, in both mouse and human neurons, hyperactive mTORC1 causes an APA shift in <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> that favors full-length <italic>Trim9-L/TRIM9-L</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The mTORC1 signaling pathway regulates <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> isoform expression in mouse and human cells</title><p>We next sought to establish cell culture models to study the mechanistic link between the mTORC1 signaling pathway and <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> APA in human and mouse. We first examined whether manipulation of mTORC1 activities in mouse Neuro-2a (N2a) cells would recapitulate the <italic>Trim9</italic> APA shift observed in mouse cortical neurons in vivo. Since mTORC1 is active under normal growth conditions in culture, we started by treating N2a cells with Torin 1, a potent mTORC1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thoreen et al., 2012</xref>), and examined the expression of <italic>Trim9-L</italic> and <italic>Trim9-S</italic> by RT-qPCR and western blotting. As expected, Torin 1 treatment successfully shut down mTORC1 and eliminated PS6 in N2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also performed siRNA experiments in N2a cells to characterize a TRIM9 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qin et al., 2016</xref>) for <italic>Trim9-S</italic> and <italic>Trim9-L</italic> protein detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

As evidenced by a rise in PS6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), we found that either siTsc1 or siTsc2 transfection could increase mTORC1 activities in N2a cells, which then favored <italic>Trim9-L</italic> mRNA expression as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, right panel).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The mTORC1 signaling pathway regulates the balance between <italic>Trim9-L/TRIM9-L</italic> and <italic>Trim9-S/TRIM9-S</italic> in mouse and human cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blots showing the expression of total and phosphorylated S6 (PS6) ribosomal protein in N2a cells with different treatments for 48 hr.

We concluded that, like <italic>TRIM9-S</italic> PAS, <italic>BRD4-L</italic> PAS is regulated by CPSF6 and has a functional twin UGUA motif. Nevertheless, <italic>TRIM9-S</italic> PAS and <italic>BRD4-L</italic> PAS are not regulated by CPSF6 in the same way despite similar UGUA motif arrangements. Importantly, we note that, through PAPERCLIP profiling and reporter assays in <italic>BMPR1B</italic>, <italic>MOB4</italic> and <italic>BRD4-L</italic>, we have expanded the number of human CPSF6-dependent PASs harboring a functional twin UGUA motif beyond <italic>TRIM9-S</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Insertion of a twin UGUA motif into the <italic>JUNB</italic> PAS is sufficient to confer regulation by CPSF6 and mTORC1</title><p>We next wanted to test whether insertion of the <italic>TRIM9-S</italic> twin UGUA motif into a heterologous PAS is sufficient to make the host PAS responsive to CPSF6 and mTORC1 regulation in our reporter assay.

Hyperactivation of mTORC1 was reported to inhibit CPSF6 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that mTORC1 hyperactivation would dampen usage of <italic>JUNB</italic>-2xUGUA PAS but not <italic>JUNB</italic>-WT PAS. Because HeLa cells offer a better model than 293T cells for mTORC1 hyperactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alesi et al., 2021</xref>), we transfected HeLa cells with control siRNAs or <italic>TSC1</italic> siRNAs to hyperactivate mTORC1 48 hr prior to a second transfection of either <italic>JUNB</italic>-WT or <italic>JUNB</italic>-2xUGUA reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). <italic>TSC1</italic> knockdown is indistinguishable between the two experimental groups of <italic>JUNB</italic>-WT and <italic>JUNB</italic>-2xUGUA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

While usage of <italic>JUNB</italic>-WT was not affected by mTORC1 hyperactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, group 1 vs. group 2, p=0.18), usage of <italic>JUNB</italic>-2xUGUA was consistently decreased in siTSC1-transfected HeLa cells compared to siCtrl-transfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, group 4 vs. group 3, 29% decrease). Taken together, these results demonstrate that insertion of the <italic>TRIM9-S</italic> twin UGUA motif into a heterologous PAS is sufficient to make the host PAS responsive to CPSF6 expression and mTORC1 activities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The functional difference between <italic>Trim9-L/TRIM9-L</italic> and <italic>Trim9-L/TRIM9-S</italic> was reported in several biological contexts including neuron morphogenesis and glioblastoma progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Menon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winkle et al., 2014</xref>), but how the two <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> isoforms are regulated remains unclear. In this study, we discovered that the balance between two <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> isoforms was regulated by mTORC1 activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). We demonstrated that CPSF6 and NUDT21 are required for this regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and we further identified an evolutionarily conserved <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motif, UGUAYUGUA, which plays a key role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mTORC1 signaling was reported to regulate APA of autophagy genes, <italic>Atg1</italic> and <italic>Atg8a</italic>, through CPSF6 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). However, there are notable differences between the two regulatory events. First, <italic>Atg1</italic> and <italic>Atg8a</italic> PASs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> do not contain any twin-UGUA motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Second, the APA shifts in both <italic>Atg1</italic> and <italic>Atg8a</italic> lead to 3′ UTR lengthening and mRNA stabilization. In contrast, the APA shift in <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> changes gene isoform expression—<italic>Trim9-L/TRIM9-L</italic> and <italic>Trim9-S/TRIM9-S</italic> proteins have distinct 3′ termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and different biological functions (see below). Therefore, although exactly how mTORC1 regulates CPSF6 to alter the balance between two <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> isoforms in human and mouse remains to be further explored, our findings provide an example in which the mTORC1 signaling pathway alters protein isoform expression through APA regulation.</p><p>Our findings also expand current knowledge of APA regulation by CFIm beyond the UGUA motif. We provide multiple lines of evidence to support that the UGUAYUGUA motif is not distinct to <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic>. First, we have identified and experimentally confirmed the existence of a functional UGUAYUGUA motif in additional human CPSF6-dependent PASs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Second, despite the differences in the motif locations and the surrounding sequence contexts, the UGUAYUGUA motif plays a crucial role in CPSF6-mediated regulation in both <italic>MOB4</italic> distal PAS and <italic>TRIM9-S</italic> PAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5H</xref>). Lastly, the UGUAYUGUA motif can be transferred to a heterologous PAS to gain CPSF6-mediated regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Our findings indicate that the UGUAYUGUA motif is a naturally occurring <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motif for CPSF6 in human and mouse that might be stronger than a single UGUA motif. Furthermore, our results suggest that, in order to fully grasp how CFIm regulates APA, it might be necessary to look beyond the simple UGUA motif and take different combinations of UGUA motifs into consideration as well.</p><p>Our reporter assay results suggest that it might be advantageous to have a second copy of UGUA: First, neither of the two UGUAs in the UGUAYUGUA motif is solely responsible for the full effects from the entire motif in <italic>TRIM9-S</italic> PAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) and <italic>BMPR1B</italic> distal PAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Second, a single UGUA motif was insufficient to alter the <italic>JUNB</italic> PAS usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This is consistent with a previous study reporting that the chance for NUDT21 binding is increased by having a second copy of UGUA in the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). The UGUAYUGUA motif is reminiscent of a ‘bipartite motif,’ which is a pair of short motifs spaced one or more bases apart and the type of motif preferred by some RNA-binding proteins with multiple RNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dominguez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang and Darnell, 2011</xref>). Although NUDT21 forms a dimer (each contains a Nudix domain for RNA binding) that can bind to two UGUA motifs simultaneously on the same RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2010</xref>), the minimal distance between the two UGUA motifs that permits simultaneous binding is 7 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2011b</xref>). Therefore, it seems unlikely that the UGUAYUGUA motif functions by engaging both NUDT21 proteins in the dimer at the same time. Lastly, in human and mouse PASs, the UGUA motif is enriched in the 40–100 bp region upstream the cleavage site with a peak around 50 bp upstream the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gruber and Zavolan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>Trim9-S/TRIM9-S</italic> UGUAYUGUA motif is located more than 170 bp upstream of the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). It will be interesting to understand how CFIm promotes 3′-end processing from this location in the future. It is worth noting that the mRNA 3′-end region is often folded, and forming secondary structures can promote 3′-end processing by shortening the actual distance to the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu and Bartel, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Abnormal neuron morphogenesis has been reported in TSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tavazoie et al., 2005</xref>). In neurons, <italic>Trim9-L</italic> protein controls Netrin-mediated axon branching—it suppresses axon branching in the absence of Netrin-1 but permits it when Netrin-1 is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winkle et al., 2014</xref>). The response of <italic>Trim9-L</italic> protein to Netrin-1 depends on the SPRY domain, which interacts with the Netrin-1 receptor, DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winkle et al., 2014</xref>). Because the <italic>Trim9-S</italic> protein lacks the SPRY domain, in <italic>Trim9</italic>-KO neurons rescued with <italic>Trim9-S</italic> protein the axon branching is constantly suppressed and unresponsive to Netrin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Menon et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, in the mouse embryonic brain, <italic>Trim9-S</italic> protein seems to be the predominant isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winkle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Winkle et al., 2016</xref>). If that is indeed the case, we speculate that a premature increase in <italic>Trim9-L</italic> protein due to mTORC1 hyperactivation in the susceptible developmental window might alter normal neuron morphogenesis and synapse formation. It is of great interest to elucidate the functional significance of <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> isoform imbalance in TSC in future studies.</p><p>Taken together, our study reveals that mTORC1 hyperactivation causes <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> isoform imbalance in TSC. Furthermore, we show that the UGUAYUGUA motif in the <italic>Trim9-S/TRIM9-S</italic> PAS and CFIm are key <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors linking mTORC1 to the balance between <italic>Trim9/TRIM9</italic> isoforms, respectively. Importantly, although transcriptional and translational abnormalities have been identified in <italic>Tsc1</italic>- and <italic>Tsc2</italic>-deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nie et al., 2015</xref>), our results demonstrate that gene isoform imbalance is another mechanism for hyperactive mTORC1 to alter normal gene expression. As widespread dysregulation of gene isoform expression was recently found in cancer and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gandal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kahles et al., 2018</xref>), our results suggest that investigation of possible gene isoform imbalance in mTORopathies and cancer with hyperactive mTORC1 might provide important biological

BE2C cells were grown in DMEM/F12. All media were supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. N2a, HEK293T, MDA-MB-231, and BE2C cells were obtained from ATCC with authentication and free of mycoplasma contamination. CKO HEK293T cells were provided by Dr. Alan Engelman. shCPSF6-BE2C and shCPSF6-MDA-MB-231 cells were generated by transducing wildtype BE2C and MDA-MB-231 cells with lentiviruses encoding a short hairpin RNA targeting CPSF6 (EZ-Tet-shCPSF6-Puro, see ‘Method details’ below) followed by puromycin selection. To generate Cpsf6-KD and Ctrl N2a cells, puromycin-resistant N2a cells that stably express Cas9 and a Cre-inducible blasticidin cassette were first transfected with either a plasmid encoding Cre and Cpsf6-targeting sgRNAs (Cpsf6-KD cells) or a plasmid encoding Cre but no sgRNAs (Ctrl cells) and subsequently selected with blasticidin and puromycin. SiRNA transfection was performed using DharmaFECT reagents (Horizon Discovery) with Silencer Select siRNAs (Invitrogen) or ON-TARGETplus siRNAs (Horizon Discovery) at the final concentration of 10 or 25 nM following the manufacturer’s instructions.

For cTag-PAPERCLIP, mouse brain cortices were crosslinked with 254 nm UV at 400 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, lysed in 1× PXL buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). For PAPERCLIP, cultured cells were crosslinked with 254 nm UV at 200 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> and lysed in 1× TS buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100). Both mouse brain and cell lysates were digested with DNase I (Promega) for 5 min at 37°C and then with RNase A (Thermo Fisher) for 5 min at 37°C. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min.</p><p>For cTag-PAPERCLIP, PABP-GFP-mRNA complexes were immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates for 2 hr at 4°C using Dynabeads protein G (Thermo Fisher) conjugated to anti-GFP (clones 19F7 and 19C8, MSKCC). Beads were then washed sequentially with 1× PXL buffer, 5× PXL buffer (5× PBS, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and PNK buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% NP-40). For PAPERCLIP, endogenous PABP-mRNA complexes were immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates for 2 hr at 4°C using Dynabeads protein G (Thermo Fisher) conjugated to anti-PABP (clone 10E10, Sigma). Beads were then washed sequentially with 1× TS buffer, 2× TS buffer (2× PBS, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100), and PNK buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% NP-40). After wash, for both cTag-PAPERCLIP and PAPERCLIP, the immunoprecipitated protein-RNA complexes were treated with alkaline phosphatase and 5′ labeled with <sup>32</sup>P-gamma-ATP using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase on beads. The protein-RNA complexes were then eluted from beads, resolved on a Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (8% for cTag-PAPERCLIP; 10% for PAPERCLIP), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and film-imaged. Regions of interest were excised from the membrane and the RNA was isolated by Proteinase K digestion and phenol/chloroform extraction. Eluted RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III with BrdUTP. The resulting cDNAs were purified by two rounds of immunoprecipitation with Dynabeads protein G conjugated to anti-BrdU (clone IIB5, Millipore). The purified cDNAs were then ligated using CircLigase II (Lucigen) and PCR-amplified to generate the sequencing library.</p><p>Individual cTag-PAPERCLIP or PAPERCLIP libraries were multiplexed and sequenced by NextSeq (Illumina) to obtain 125-nt single-end reads. The procedures for raw read processing, mapping, and poly(A) site annotation were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, the raw reads were processed (filtered and collapsed) using the CIMS package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore et al., 2014</xref>) (now superseded by the CLIP tool kit [CTK]). Poly(A) sequence at the 3′ end was trimmed using CutAdapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin, 2011</xref>). Trimmed reads that are longer than 25 nucleotides are aligned to mouse (mm10) or human (hg19) genome using Novoalign (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.novocraft.com/">http://www.novocraft.com/</ext-link>). The aligned reads were further processed using the CIMS package to remove PCR duplicates and cluster overlapping reads for poly(A) site identification.</p><p>For APA shift analysis, different cutoffs for the definition of two poly(A) site genes were computed to generate a broad set of two poly(A) site genes for comparison. Statistical analysis for APA shift was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hwang et al., 2016</xref>) and is described below: EdgeR package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) was used to statistically test significant APA shifts between two experimental conditions, while accounting for biological and technical variability between experimental replicates. Each replicate dataset was first normalized to account for library size and compositional bias using the TMM methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robinson and Oshlack, 2010</xref>). The poly(A) site PAPERCLIP read count data were modeled as a negative binomial distribution and fitted a generalized linear model (GLM) with explanatory variables for batch, experimental, poly(A) location, and an interaction factor for experimental condition × poly(A) location. For each gene, GLM likelihood ratio test was conducted to test if the interaction coefficient between experimental condition and poly(A) location was non-zero. GLM likelihood ratio test-derived p-values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing using the qvalue package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>). Significant APA shift is defined as FDR &lt; 0.05 and a &gt;2-fold change of (proximal PAS/distal PAS) ratio between experimental conditions.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A twin UGUA motif directs the balance between gene isoforms through CFIm and the mTORC1 signaling pathway&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We encourage the authors to consider addressing many of the issues raised by the Reviewers and we note that several of the issues can be addressed textually while others can with minimal additional experimentation. One specific experiment that was a consensus concern of the Reviewers is: Showing that knockdown of CPSF6/NUDT21 makes TRIM9 polyadenylation insensitive to mTORC1 dysregulation (e.g. with Torin or Tsc1 KD), to demonstrate whether the change in TRIM9 isoform ratio seen during mTORC1 dysregulation directly requires CFIm and could not occur through an independent pathway.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The initial descriptions of the genetic challenges of the breeding schemes of the mice used is almost impenetrable. Much of this could be shifted to the methods. I appreciate the authors attention to technical detail, but momentum is immediately lost in this paper without much gain in technical resolution. The authors should consider consolidating the language.</p><p>2. The description of the two criteria for selecting candidate APA events for further investigation included 'resulted in expression of two different protein isoforms'. The authors need to clarify and justify this criteria. Only ~10% of APA events are splicing-APA in that distinct C-termini are created. By implementing this criteria, the authors artificially trimmed the list down by a huge margin. I think this is still ok, but more explanation is required so that the average reader understands what went into this filtering event.</p><p>3. Can the authors describe what a SPRY domain is for non-experts?</p><p>4. The section of the results focused on cdk8 or CLK2 is under-developed. What doe cdk8 or CLK2 inhibitors do in the absence of Torin1? Can the authors show that cdk8 inhibition does anything to phosphorylation of CPSF6? As it stands, this section is not well-controlled or analyzed and needs improvement.</p><p>5. Continuing along the lines of the previous point, CPSF6 phosphorylation is also under-developed. Where are these phospho-mutants localized? Do cdk8 manipulations also effect these reporter experiments? While the UGUA mutagenesis experiments are well done, the authors could consider removing the phosphorylation experiments altogether and not have their overall thesis impacted at all.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There is a lot to like here including the elegant in vivo model system for cTag-PAPERCLIP in mouse cortical neurons with mTORC1 hyperactivation and multiple relevant in vitro systems to support and extend the findings. But the reader is left wondering what the impact of Trim9 APA has on cellular physiology (Figure S2A?) and if phosphorylation of CPSF6 via TORC1 signalling alters its subcellular localisation as described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by Tang et al. (2018). The discussion does not make much of this evolutionary conservation, something that could easily be done with reference to (or by combining) Figures S3 and S4G. Are any CPSF6-dependent APA in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also driven by twin UGUA motifs?</p><p>The connection between APA and metabolism is likely much more pervasive than currently understood so this work is an important addition to the field. However, in this context, it seems disingenuous to limit the discussion of the Jong et al. (2019) eGFP plasmids to phosphorylation-state when the S8YD-CPSF6 was shown to be defective in nuclear accumulation, while S8YA, like wild-type was mostly nuclear. To support the current title, i.e., the connection between mTORC1 signalling and CPSF6 function it is strongly recommended that Figure 4I is extended to include the inhibitors (as in Figure 3G) or TORC1 hyperactivation (siTSC2). Based on Tang et al. (2018) knock down (or chemical inhibition) of CDK8 would result in a shift to cytoplasmic CPSF6. Ideally, microscopy of such experiments would confirm localisation data from Jong et al. (2019) and connect the research hear to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> data and evolutionarily conserved process. It would also clear up a current discrepancy in Figure 4I where WT and S8YD appear to restore relative PAS usage whereas S8YA does not, a finding that is hard to reconcile based on their reported localisation (see below).</p><p>I ask that the comments not be interpreted as negative, but rather from the intention to inform where/how I struggled to understand what was going on. If any comments are made in error, this should be taken as indication that as currently presented the data/text are unclear.</p><p>Specific comments on the manuscript that would help with clarity:</p><p>– It is important that in the first paragraph of page 9, you state that Tsc1-KO causes a shift toward Trim9-L mRNA use as this is assumed later rather than actually said.</p><p>– When written as Trim9/TRIM9-S (or Trim9/TRIM9-L), it makes it ambiguous whether you are referring to total mRNA/short form or short form/short form so it may be better to write this as Trim9-S/TRIM9-S. This is the same for Trim9/TRIM9-L. Throughout the text the nomenclature gets complicated as to what is mRNA, protein, human and mouse, splicing APA and UTR-APA TRIM9 and BRD4 vs BMPR1B and MOB4. It might be helpful find more explicit nomenclature.</p><p>– For description of Figure 3F, it should be stated that unlike in mice, siCPSF6 significantly increased TRIM9-L usage in human as based on what is said it would be easy to assume the results are the same in mouse and human.</p><p>– At the top of page 12, should be &quot;These results suggest that…&quot; (typo there).</p><p>– At the bottom of page 12, should be &quot;we compared L3-WT usage between wildtype…&quot; (remove in).</p><p>– At the top of page 16, should be &quot;we found that the BRD4-L-to-BRD4-S ratio&quot; (add hyphens).</p><p>– At the bottom of page 19, should be &quot;not distinct to Trim9/TRIM9&quot; (remove hyphen).</p><p>Comments on Figures:</p><p>In general, the data is well presented but not always consistent with respect to how equivalent data are presented (e.g. relative expression of TRIM9 isoforms vs ratio of isoform expression), labelling or colour scheme. It is recommended that the final version of the manuscript addresses these discrepancies. Detailed commentary for Figures1-4 follows but is not limited to those figures.</p><p>– 1A. Adding a timeline (eg. 2-weeks) would help.</p><p>– Figure 1B. The Trim9 transcript has been flipped in its orientation indicating a data manipulation that is not reflected in the legend.</p><p>– Figure 1C. In the accompanying text it would help the reader to understand the functional significance of losing/gaining SPRY by APA.</p><p>– Figure 1E and F. Unclear why there's a box around the heading. It seems inconsistent with other figures. These are also the first where it's not always clear what 'relative expression' on the y-axis means. If the intention is to set up the difference between absolute and ratio data it would be better to make the labelling of the y-axis in the ratio part of 1F consistent with those in Figure 2. Albeit why, data in Figure 2 are expressed as ratio rather than relative amounts (as similar data are expressed in Figure 3) is unclear.</p><p>– For Figure S2A, it is unclear how the statement &quot;in Torin 1-treated N2a cells, Trim9 expression was consistently shifted toward Trim9-S with similar magnitudes at both mRNA and protein levels.&quot; The data appears to relate to confirmation of specific knock down of either both the long and short or long-only Trim9 isoform by siRNA. If this was used as a control for quantitation, or if a phenotype was monitored for these cells it should be noted.</p><p>– Overall in Figure 2 it is unclear what, if anything the colours mean. This is a recurrent issue, where the reader expects there to be a logic, such as coding of mRNA type, cell type etc… but is left wondering what they are missing.</p><p>– Figure 3G. Expressed as a ratio, it is difficult to understand if an altered ratio is due to loss of the short isoform (eg Figure 3B and 3D) or increase of the long form (Figure 3F). Moreover, a stickler for statistics might wish to know how the compound error is calculated.</p><p>– Figure 4I. The data here should be expressed consistent with 4F if the reader is to be able to interpret the data. Including the data from 4F would help to understand if the relative PAS usage is a recovery to normal or over-shoots that.

The initial descriptions of the genetic challenges of the breeding schemes of the mice used is almost impenetrable. Much of this could be shifted to the methods. I appreciate the authors attention to technical detail, but momentum is immediately lost in this paper without much gain in technical resolution. The authors should consider consolidating the language.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 3 also raised this issue. We condensed the 3 paragraphs in the section into 1 paragraph and moved some information into the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The description of the two criteria for selecting candidate APA events for further investigation included 'resulted in expression of two different protein isoforms'. The authors need to clarify and justify this criteria. Only ~10% of APA events are splicing-APA in that distinct C-termini are created. By implementing this criteria, the authors artificially trimmed the list down by a huge margin. I think this is still ok, but more explanation is required so that the average reader understands what went into this filtering event.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded the paragraph (page 8) to explain the two types of APA shifts and the rationale to implement the filtering strategy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Can the authors describe what a SPRY domain is for non-experts?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a new sentence with citations (page 8) to describe the SPRY domain as suggested:</p><p>“SPRY domain is commonly found in TRIM family proteins and is implicated in protein-protein interaction.”</p><p>We also added the full name of SPRY domain to the Figure 1C legend (page 25).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The section of the results focused on cdk8 or CLK2 is under-developed. What doe cdk8 or CLK2 inhibitors do in the absence of Torin1? Can the authors show that cdk8 inhibition does anything to phosphorylation of CPSF6? As it stands, this section is not well-controlled or analyzed and needs improvement.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Continuing along the lines of the previous point, CPSF6 phosphorylation is also under-developed. Where are these phospho-mutants localized? Do cdk8 manipulations also effect these reporter experiments? While the UGUA mutagenesis experiments are well done, the authors could consider removing the phosphorylation experiments altogether and not have their overall thesis impacted at all.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the CDK8/CLK2 and CPSF6 phosphorylation sections could be expanded and substantiated. As our new experiments strengthened the role of CFIm in <italic>Trim9</italic> regulation by mTORC1, we decided to remove both sections as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There is a lot to like here including the elegant in vivo model system for cTag-PAPERCLIP in mouse cortical neurons with mTORC1 hyperactivation and multiple relevant in vitro systems to support and extend the findings. But the reader is left wondering what the impact of Trim9 APA has on cellular physiology (Figure S2A?) and if phosphorylation of CPSF6 via TORC1 signalling alters its subcellular localisation as described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by Tang et al. (2018). The discussion does not make much of this evolutionary conservation, something that could easily be done with reference to (or by combining) Figures S3 and S4G. Are any CPSF6-dependent APA in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also driven by twin UGUA motifs?</p><p>The connection between APA and metabolism is likely much more pervasive than currently understood so this work is an important addition to the field. However, in this context, it seems disingenuous to limit the discussion of the Jong et al. (2019) eGFP plasmids to phosphorylation-state when the S8YD-CPSF6 was shown to be defective in nuclear accumulation, while S8YA, like wild-type was mostly nuclear. To support the current title, i.e., the connection between mTORC1 signalling and CPSF6 function it is strongly recommended that Figure 4I is extended to include the inhibitors (as in Figure 3G) or TORC1 hyperactivation (siTSC2). Based on Tang et al. (2018) knock down (or chemical inhibition) of CDK8 would result in a shift to cytoplasmic CPSF6. Ideally, microscopy of such experiments would confirm localisation data from Jong et al. (2019) and connect the research hear to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> data and evolutionarily conserved process. It would also clear up a current discrepancy in Figure 4I where WT and S8YD appear to restore relative PAS usage whereas S8YA does not, a finding that is hard to reconcile based on their reported localisation (see below).</p><p>I ask that the comments not be interpreted as negative, but rather from the intention to inform where/how I struggled to understand what was going on. If any comments are made in error, this should be taken as indication that as currently presented the data/text are unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>The original figures S3 and S4G are now combined and presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 1C. In addition, we created a new Figure 7—figure supplement 1D to show the lack of twin UGUA motif in <italic>Drosophila Atg1</italic> and <italic>Atg8a</italic> PASs. We also revised the first paragraph of Discussion (page 20) to incorporate the evolution aspects as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments on the manuscript that would help with clarity:</p><p>– It is important that in the first paragraph of page 9, you state that Tsc1-KO causes a shift toward Trim9-L mRNA use as this is assumed later rather than actually said.</p></disp-quote><p>A new sentence, “<italic>Tsc1</italic> knockout in mouse cortical excitatory neurons causes a shift toward <italic>Trim9-L</italic> mRNA expression (Figure 1B)”, was added as suggested (page 8, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– When written as Trim9/TRIM9-S (or Trim9/TRIM9-L), it makes it ambiguous whether you are referring to total mRNA/short form or short form/short form so it may be better to write this as Trim9-S/TRIM9-S. This is the same for Trim9/TRIM9-L. Throughout the text the nomenclature gets complicated as to what is mRNA, protein, human and mouse, splicing APA and UTR-APA TRIM9 and BRD4 vs BMPR1B and MOB4. It might be helpful find more explicit nomenclature.</p></disp-quote><p>We change all Trim9/TRIM9-S and Trim9/TRIM9-L into Trim9-S/TRIM9-S and Trim9-L/TRIM9-L to improve the clarity as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For description of Figure 3F, it should be stated that unlike in mice, siCPSF6 significantly increased TRIM9-L usage in human as based on what is said it would be easy to assume the results are the same in mouse and human.</p><p>– At the top of page 12, should be &quot;These results suggest that…&quot; (typo there).</p><p>– At the bottom of page 12, should be &quot;we compared L3-WT usage between wildtype…&quot; (remove in).</p><p>– At the top of page 16, should be &quot;we found that the BRD4-L-to-BRD4-S ratio&quot; (add hyphens).</p><p>– At the bottom of page 19, should be &quot;not distinct to Trim9/TRIM9&quot; (remove hyphen).</p></disp-quote><p>All 4 listed typos/errors are either removed or corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on Figures:</p><p>In general, the data is well presented but not always consistent with respect to how equivalent data are presented (e.g. relative expression of TRIM9 isoforms vs ratio of isoform expression), labelling or colour scheme.

Unclear why there's a box around the heading. It seems inconsistent with other figures. These are also the first where it's not always clear what 'relative expression' on the y-axis means.

Albeit why, data in Figure 2 are expressed as ratio rather than relative amounts (as similar data are expressed in Figure 3) is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>1) Both boxes around the heading are removed from Figure 1EandF.</p><p>2) We thoroughly revised all bar graphs showing <italic>Trim9</italic> isoform shifts and expanded some of the figure legends to improve clarity. In N2a cells, <italic>Cpsf6</italic> or <italic>Nudt21</italic> loss-of-function had stronger effects on individual <italic>Trim9</italic> isoforms compared to the effects from changes in mTORC1 activities. Nevertheless, changes in mTORC1 activities did consistently alter the relative expression between the two <italic>Trim9</italic> isoforms in both directions. Therefore, the original Figure 2 was constructed to emphasize the consistent shift. In the revised manuscript, for all experiments, the expression of individual isoform is also shown either in the main or supplemental figures in addition to the relative expression between isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For Figure S2A, it is unclear how the statement &quot;in Torin 1-treated N2a cells, Trim9 expression was consistently shifted toward Trim9-S with similar magnitudes at both mRNA and protein levels.&quot; The data appears to relate to confirmation of specific knock down of either both the long and short or long-only Trim9 isoform by siRNA.

This is a recurrent issue, where the reader expects there to be a logic, such as coding of mRNA type, cell type etc… but is left wondering what they are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry about the confusion caused by all the different colors. We thoroughly revised all figures with a unifying color scheme: For endogenous genes (<italic>TRIM9</italic> or <italic>BRD4</italic>), individual isoform expression is colored in different shades of blue while the relative expression between the two isoforms is colored in orange. For reporter assays, different colors are used to represent distinct reporters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3G. Expressed as a ratio, it is difficult to understand if an altered ratio is due to loss of the short isoform (eg Figure 3B and 3D) or increase of the long form (Figure 3F). Moreover, a stickler for statistics might wish to know how the compound error is calculated.</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to remove the CDK8/CLK2 and CPSF6 phosphorylation sections as suggested by Reviewer 1 and the original Figure 3G was removed as a result.

For all other figures, in which RT-qPCR was used for measurement and quantification was calculated using the ΔΔCt method (no ratio was calculated), we use labels like “TRIM9-L RNA expression (relative to TRIM9-S)” to highlight the difference. We expanded the Figure 2 legend (page 25~27) to describe the plotting process and set up for the subsequent similar figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4I.
