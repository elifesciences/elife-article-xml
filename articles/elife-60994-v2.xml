the retina, are shaped by a combination of excitatory and inhibitory signals. Inhibitory signals can act presynaptically on axon terminals to control neurotransmitter release and regulate circuit function. However, it has been difficult to study the role of presynaptic inhibition in most neural circuits due to lack of cell type-specific and receptor type-specific perturbations. In this study, we used a transgenic approach to selectively eliminate GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibitory receptors from select types of second-order neurons – bipolar cells – in mouse retina and examined how this affects the light response properties of the well-characterized ON alpha ganglion cell retinal circuit. Selective loss of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition causes an enhanced sensitivity and slower kinetics of light-evoked responses from ON alpha ganglion cells thus highlighting the role of presynaptic inhibition in gain control and temporal filtering of sensory signals in a key neural circuit in the mammalian retina.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>GABA receptor</kwd><kwd>bipolar cell</kwd><kwd>ganglion cell</kwd><kwd>presynaptic inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY026070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>Raunak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007015</institution-id><institution>University of Wisconsin-Madison</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>David and Nancy Walsh Family Professorship in Vision Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>Raunak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007015</institution-id><institution>University of Wisconsin-Madison</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rebecca Brown Professorship in Vision Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoon</surname><given-names>Mrinalini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoon</surname><given-names>Mrinalini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagy</surname><given-names>Jenna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY031677</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoon</surname><given-names>Mrinalini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32NS105602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ebbinghaus</surname><given-names>Briana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Elimination of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors from the axon terminals of specific retinal bipolar cell types alters the sensitivity and kinetics of retinal output.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A common motif by which inhibition acts in neural circuits is at the axon terminals of presynaptic neurons where it regulates synaptic release and controls the input-output relationship of a neural circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fink et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacDermott et al., 1999</xref>). This motif of inhibition called presynaptic inhibition is widely used in the retina and is mediated by inhibitory retinal interneurons called amacrine cells (ACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diamond and Lukasiewicz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eggers and Lukasiewicz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eggers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jadzinsky and Baccus, 2013</xref>). ACs make synaptic contacts on the axon terminals of glutamatergic second-order neurons called bipolar cells (BCs) which relay rod and cone photoreceptor signals to retinal output neurons called retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Demb and Singer, 2015</xref>).

Of note, different BC types are also used to route dim light (rod bipolar; ON type) and day light (cone bipolar; ON and OFF types) visual signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Euler et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we explored the role of retinal presynaptic inhibition in regulating the output of one of the most well-characterized retinal circuits that use the ON sustained alpha GC (ONα GC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimes et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murphy and Rieke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Wyk et al., 2009</xref>).

RBCs and ON CBCs predominantly express GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors at their axon terminals, whereas OFF CBCs predominantly express GABA<sub>A</sub> and glycine receptors (GlyR) at their axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eggers and Lukasiewicz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fletcher et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lukasiewicz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wässle et al., 1998</xref>). In the primary rod (dim-light) pathway, presynaptic inhibition has been particularly well characterized where a specialized AC type, the A17 AC, makes GABAergic feedback synapses on RBC axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grimes et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grimes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimes et al., 2015</xref>). This A17-mediated feedback inhibition has been proposed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the feedforward excitatory output from RBC to AII amacrine cell near visual threshold, extend the luminance range over which RBC-AII synapses compute contrast gain, and mediate center-surround inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oesch and Diamond, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Völgyi et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, a few studies have shown that perturbing GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition alters the dynamic range of the light-evoked responses of RGCs for both rod and cone-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oesch and Diamond, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sagdullaev et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our understanding of how presynaptic inhibition shapes signaling at the BC output synapse largely comes from pharmacological manipulations or transgenic mutant mice globally lacking inhibitory receptor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eggers and Lukasiewicz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eggers and Lukasiewicz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oesch and Diamond, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sagdullaev et al., 2006</xref>). These approaches affect the entire retinal circuitry and thus lack the resolution required to perturb presynaptic inhibition in a cell type-specific and circuit-specific manner. In addition, such methods make it difficult to parse out the role of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition because, besides BCs, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are also expressed on ACs that can participate in serial inhibitory circuits between ACs that in turn contact BC terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eggers and Lukasiewicz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wässle et al., 1998</xref>). In fact, immunolabeling against the dominant subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors shows a dense expression, not specific to a single cell class but localized throughout the retinal synaptic layer that makes it particularly difficult to determine the specific contribution of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in shaping the synaptic output of individual retinal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wässle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Due to these limitations, most studies investigating the role of GABAergic presynaptic inhibition in shaping the light sensitivity of ON BC synapses have largely been restricted to evaluating GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition that is specifically localized to BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oesch and Diamond, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sagdullaev et al., 2006</xref>). This motivated us to use genetic manipulations that selectively eliminate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors from ON BC axon terminals to study the role of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition in regulating light evoked function in the tractable retinal circuit of the ONα GC with known cell types and a well-established pathway for dim light and day light signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selective removal of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors from the axon terminals of rod and ON CBCs</title><p>In this study, we focused on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition at axon terminals of ON BCs.

This triple transgenic mouse line – Ai9/<italic>Grm6</italic>Cre/<italic>Gabrg2</italic> cKO (henceforth referred to as KO) – has previously been used to study the subunit composition of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in axon and dendrites of ON CBCs after <italic>Gabrg2</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoon et al., 2015</xref>). Here we determined the GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor expression across axon terminals of RBCs which belong to the ON BC class after <italic>Gabrg2</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Immunolabeling with GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 receptor subunit specific antibody clearly showed the selective reduction in GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 expression from the ON sub-lamina of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) in the KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whereas the GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 expression in the OFF sub-lamina remained unperturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Co-labeling of GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 with the RBC marker, protein kinase C (PKC), revealed near-complete absence of GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 receptor subunit expression from RBC boutons in the KO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This dramatic reduction in GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 receptor expression in the KO retina was quantified by estimating the receptor percentage volume occupancy relative to the volume of the RBC axon terminal (see 'Materials and methods'). Despite the loss of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in KO RBC terminals, GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor expression was unchanged in KO RBC terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; quantifications of percentage GABA<sub>C</sub> volume occupancy). We confirmed the loss of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors from KO ON BC axon terminals by measuring GABA-evoked currents from RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Puffing GABA on the axon terminals of RBCs elicited smaller currents in the KO retina. Upon application of a selective GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor blocker, TPMPA, we found that this decrease in total GABA-evoked current is due to a drastic reduction of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated current with unaltered GABA<sub>C</sub> currents in KO RBC terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To confirm that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors remain unaltered in the OFF sublamina, we performed whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of light evoked excitatory currents from OFF alpha transient GCs (a measure of the OFF BC output) which showed no differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) in amplitude between KO and wildtype adult littermate control (WT) retina. This together with the unperturbed GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 expression in the OFF sub-laminas confirms that GABAergic presynaptic inhibition across OFF BCs is not altered in the KO retina.</p><p>To eliminate the possibility of decreased GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor expression in AC and GC processes in the KO retina, we next determined expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors across AC and GC processes that laminate in the same ON plexus of the retinal IPL as ON BC terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). We labeled AC and GC processes by labeling for the calcium binding protein calbindin that is specific to AC and GC processes in the IPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haverkamp and Wässle, 2000</xref>). To label all GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors across AC and GC processes we labeled for GABA<sub>A</sub>β2/3 receptor subunits which are ubiquitously expressed across BC, AC, and GC processes in the IPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greferath et al., 1995</xref>). We could not label for specific GABA<sub>A</sub>α receptor subunits in AC and GC processes as the composition of the GABA<sub>A</sub>α receptor types across different AC and GC processes remains unknown and because our previous work has shown that GABA<sub>A</sub>α1-containing receptors are enriched at BC processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoon et al., 2015</xref>) but not GC processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sawant et al., 2021</xref>). Upon quantification of the percentage occupancy of GABA<sub>A</sub>β2/3 receptors across ON-laminating AC and GC processes we observed comparable receptor amounts across genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) confirming that expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is not impacted across AC and GC processes in the KO retina. Together, our findings demonstrate the targeted deletion of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors only from the terminals of ON BCs in the KO retina.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Increased sensitivity of ONα GCs to dim light stimuli in the KO retina</title><p>We chose the ONα GC retinal circuit as a means to explore the role of presynaptic inhibition in shaping retinal output across luminance (i) due to its well-characterized glutamatergic excitatory pathway – via RBC and Type 6 (T6) ON CBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimes et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>) – and (ii) because previous studies have shown that ON BCs, primarily RBC and T6 CBC, express <italic>Grm6</italic> in the <italic>Grm6-tdTomato</italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kerschensteiner et al., 2009</xref>) and are thus specifically targeted in our triple transgenic mouse line (Ai9/<italic>Grm6</italic>Cre/<italic>Gabrg2 cKO</italic>). This means that in the KO retina, the majority of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors lost from the IPL are from RBC and T6 CBC terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoon et al., 2015</xref>), thus providing a unique opportunity to study how GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition alters the function of a specific retinal circuit, i.e. the ONα GC circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first probed the dim light sensitivity of ONα GC spike output using a full-field light stimulus that mostly activates the rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The characteristic response of an ONα GC to a light step (0.5 s duration) has two distinct kinetic components – a fast transient phase and steady-state sustained phase – which results in action potential firing throughout the duration of the light stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Such a biphasic response to a sustained dim light step has previously been observed in the excitatory currents of the AII amacrine cell and reflects the intrinsic synaptic properties of the RBC to AII amacrine cell ribbon synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oesch and Diamond, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oesch and Diamond, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the transient component has been attributed to encode contrast whereas the sustained component has been shown to encode the absolute luminance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oesch and Diamond, 2011</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oesch and Diamond, 2019</xref>). In the KO retina, there is a sizeable increase in the spike response of ONα GCs for both its transient and sustained component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>; see 'Materials and methods' for details). In addition to response amplitude, presynaptic inhibition is known to shape the kinetics of neuronal responses across diverse neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jadzinsky and Baccus, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohliger-Frerking et al., 2003</xref>).

The heightened response to the dim light stimuli is in fact more prominent in the excitatory synaptic currents of ONα GCs in the KO retina with nearly a twofold increase in the amplitude of the response in the KO retinas compared to that in the WT retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Both the sustained and transient response components for the ONα GC are equally affected in the KO retina and hence the ratio of sustained to transient response remained unchanged between the WT and the KO retina for light evoked excitatory synaptic currents as well as for spike output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and H</xref>). We next estimated the kinetics of the ONα GC dim light evoked excitatory synaptic currents and found that the time to peak of the current response remained unchanged between the WT and the KO retina similar to that for the spike output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To probe if the response differences in ONα GC between KO and WT retina are present across a broad range of dim light levels, we measured responses to brief light flashes (30 ms duration) of increasing intensity under dim light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–M</xref>). Both the ONα GC spike output and the excitatory synaptic currents in the KO retina showed a marked increase over a considerable range of dim light flash intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and M</xref>). This indicates that light-triggered output from the RBC terminals is increased in absence of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors across a wide range of dim light levels albeit not for the dimmest flashes. Moreover, enhancement of both the transient and sustained component of the ONα GC response to a sustained dim light stimulus indicates that perhaps both contrast and luminance encoding are altered at the dim light levels. Although the amplitude of the dim light evoked responses is perturbed, response kinetics remain unaltered in absence of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition. These results show that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at the RBC terminal play a key role in regulating the strength of dim light signals received by the ONα GCs presumably by controlling synaptic release from the RBC terminal. We cannot rule out a contribution of loss of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at the T6 ON CBC towards altered ONα GC sensitivity at dim light levels since rod-driven signals are routed from the AII amacrine via gap junctions to the ON CBC terminals and then onto the ONα GC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ONα GCs in the KO retina exhibit changes in amplitude and kinetics of responses to light stimuli that preferentially excite the cone photoreceptors</title><p>Given the increase in dim light sensitivity of ONα GCs in the KO retina, we wanted to test if this persists even for brighter light levels that primarily activate the cone pathway. To do so, we adapted the retina to a background luminance of ~1000 R*/cone/s, which mostly saturates the rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grimes et al., 2018</xref>) and allows us to preferentially probe the cone-mediated ONα GC responses. We first measured the spike response of ONα GCs to a full-field 100% contrast increment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The ONα GC response at these cone-dominated light levels also shows two kinetic phases, i.e. a transient and sustained phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), similar to the responses at dim light levels shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We observed a nearly twofold increase in the peak firing rate of the ONα GC in the KO retina compared to that in the WT retina. However, we did not see a systematic difference in the sustained phase of the spike response of ONα GCs between WT and KO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, we compared the kinetics of the spike responses of the ONα GCs between KO and WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, the time to peak of the ONα GC spike responses in the KO retina were significantly slower than in the WT retina in contrast to our earlier observations under dim light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To determine if the changes in the amplitude and kinetics of the cone-mediated spike responses are reflected in the excitatory inputs, we performed whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from ONα GCs in KO and WT retina in response to the above stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Both the transient and sustained phase of the light-evoked excitatory synaptic current were ~2-fold larger in the KO retina compared to that in the WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The ratio of the sustained-to-transient phase of the ONα GC response remained unchanged between KO and WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Upon comparing the response kinetics of ONα GC excitatory currents between KO and WT retina, we observed that the time to peak was higher in the KO retina than in the WT retina similar to the effects on the spike output seen earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). We further quantified the time of onset of the sustained phase of the light-evoked excitatory currents in ONα GC but did not observe any significant changes between KO and WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). The increase in response amplitude and slower time course of the ONα GC excitatory synaptic currents in the KO retina was also evident when we presented a briefer light flash of 10 ms duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–L</xref>). In addition to the longer time taken to reach peak response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>), we also found that the decay time of the flash-evoked ONα GC excitatory synaptic currents (from the peak to the baseline) was significantly longer in KO compared to WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). This suggests that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition regulates both the activation and recovery of the cone-mediated signals at the BC to ONα GC synapse. Given that the size of the flash-evoked ONα GC excitatory currents is ~2-fold larger in KO retina, we wanted to further probe the response recovery, particularly the overshoot after the flash response reaches the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>).

To characterize the responses, we used a linear-nonlinear (LN) model that provides a relatively simple description of how light inputs are transformed into neuronal responses and provides an effective way of determining contrast-dependent changes in the amplitude and kinetics of the light response of retinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaudoin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Rieke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>). The model has two components – a linear filter that describes the time course of the neuronal response and a time-invariant or ‘static’ nonlinearity that transforms the filtered stimulus into neuronal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaudoin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Rieke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rieke, 2001</xref>). We focused on excitatory synaptic currents since the loss of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at ON BC terminal in the KO retina will directly impact the ON BC output and hence the glutamatergic synaptic input onto the ONα GCs. We measured ONα GC excitatory synaptic currents in response to the time-varying stimuli that were modulated at two background light levels – one that preferentially activate rods and the other that selectively excites the cone photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,H</xref>). At cone light levels, linear filters show that the time course of the ONα GC excitatory current response in the KO retina is considerably slower than in the WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Both the time to peak and the decay time of the linear filters were significantly longer for ONα GC in KO retina compared to WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) similar to the above results from the responses to brief light flashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K,L</xref>). This suggests that lack of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition alters the temporal filtering of the T6 CBC output and hence the excitatory inputs in the ONα GCs by likely attenuating higher frequencies more and lower frequencies less. We next compared the static nonlinearity of the ONα GCs in WT and KO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We first quantified the response range which we defined as the absolute difference between the maximum and the minimum value of the measured current response to the chosen contrast range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This response range, i.e. dynamic range of the excitatory currents for the given range of contrasts, was ~2-fold larger for the ONα GCs in the KO retina in comparison to their counterparts in the WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This is consistent with our above results of the ONα GC responses to light flash/step of fixed intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Given the sizeable change in the response amplitude and the response range, we assessed if the contrast gain is altered in the ONα GCs in KO retina compared to that in WT retina. This can be estimated from the slope of the nonlinearity or the height of the linear filter since both the linear filter and the static nonlinearity share contrast-dependent changes in the amplitude of the neuronal response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Rieke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rieke, 2001</xref>). To unambiguously measure contrast gain, we normalized the linear filter and then compared the slope of the nonlinearity between ONα GC responses in KO and WT retina (see 'Materials and methods'). The nonlinearities of the ONα GC response in KO retina had a steeper slope and upon quantification the slope differed by a factor of ~2 compared to the ONα GC nonlinearities in WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

The nonlinearity of the ONα GC in the KO retina also had a bigger response range than in WT retina similar to that observed under cone-driven light levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K,L</xref>). The slope of the nonlinearity, i.e. contrast gain was also ~2-fold higher for the ONα GC in the KO retina than that in the WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). However, no significant difference in the kinetics of the linear filters between the genotypes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Our findings of alterations in response size and time course using randomly flickering stimuli are consistent with the results obtained above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) using fixed intensity stimuli. Thus, loss of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition at the RBC and T6 CBC terminal alters the contrast sensitivity and kinetics of the ONα GC excitatory inputs. Importantly the changes in response amplitude and kinetics observed at the level of ONα GC excitatory inputs in the KO retina are reflected in the spike output which highlights the importance of GABA<sub>A</sub> presynaptic inhibition as a mechanism in shaping visual signals being transmitted out of the retina.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Presynaptic inhibition is an important mechanism for regulating a neuron’s input-output relationship. However, it has been difficult to isolate its precise contribution in most retinal circuits due to lack of receptor type-, cell type-, and circuit-specific perturbations. Here we have taken advantage of a previously used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoon et al., 2015</xref>) transgenic manipulation in mouse retina that selectively eliminates a specific population of inhibitory receptors – GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors – from the axon terminals of defined types of presynaptic neurons – RBC and T6 CBCs – and determined its impact on the light-evoked response properties of one of the well characterized downstream retinal output neuron – the ONα GC. We show that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition is crucial for regulating the amplitude and contrast sensitivity of both rod and cone-driven signals routed to the ONα GCs. Interestingly, GABA<sub>A</sub> presynaptic inhibition shapes the kinetics of only cone-driven signals but not rod-driven signals reaching the ONα GCs. We show that the impact on the gain and kinetics of visual signals as observed in the excitatory synaptic inputs received by the ONα GCs, is propagated to its spike output. Thus, GABA<sub>A</sub> presynaptic inhibition is a key mechanism of gain control and temporal filtering for the ONα GC retinal circuit.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>GABA<sub>A</sub> presynaptic inhibition shapes rod and cone signaling in the ONα GC retinal circuit</title><p>Several studies including our current study have shown that GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors in ON BC terminals contribute to nearly equal amplitudes of GABA-evoked currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>). However, most of what we know about the role of presynaptic inhibition in shaping the retinal RBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2016</xref>) and ON CBC synaptic output has been attributed to GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oesch and Diamond, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sagdullaev et al., 2006</xref>). In the current study, we show that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition plays an equally important role in regulating the dynamic range and contrast sensitivity as GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition for both the RBC output under dim light conditions as well as for cone-mediated signals via the ON CBC synapse. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition restricts the response range and contrast gain of ONα GC responses which could allow the ONα GC retinal circuit to encode over a wider range of contrast and luminance without being saturated. This is a common feature of light adaptation whereby retinal neurons match their neural gain to the prevailing visual inputs such that they can continue to efficiently signal over a broad range of light inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rieke and Rudd, 2009</xref>). Thus, our results together with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oesch and Diamond, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sagdullaev et al., 2006</xref>) suggest that both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> presynaptic inhibition play a key role in regulating response amplitude and contrast encoding under rod- and cone-dominant lighting conditions.</p><p>A central role of presynaptic inhibition that has not been extensively explored in the retina is how it shapes the temporal sensitivity of rod- and cone-driven signals routed via specific neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asari and Meister, 2012</xref>). Temporal processing is crucial to encode dynamic features of visual signals such as motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jadzinsky and Baccus, 2013</xref>). Temporal filtering, i.e. sensitivity to certain temporal patterns, is different across RGC types, and synaptic inhibition is a common mechanism that is known to shape temporal filtering in most neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baden et al., 2016</xref>). Presynaptic inhibition is well positioned to decrease synapse output and attenuate steady inputs thus temporally filtering signals received by RGCs. Signals originating in rod vs. cone photoreceptors are known to exhibit remarkably distinct temporal characteristics with rod signals being substantially slower compared to cone signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cangiano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ingram et al., 2016</xref>). This difference is reflected in our results from both fixed intensity and randomly modulating stimuli where the time course of rod signals was nearly 2-fold slower than the cone-mediated signals in WT retina measured at the level of ONα GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and I</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,H and K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C vs J</xref>). Our findings show that GABA<sub>A</sub> presynaptic inhibition speeds up the time course of cone-mediated signals but not rod-driven signals in the ONα GC retinal circuit. This could be because under dim light conditions where photons are sparse, a longer integration time of the rod signals by the downstream circuit may benefit signal detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Field et al., 2005</xref>). In this case, temporal filtering by mechanisms such as presynaptic inhibition could be detrimental to the detection of sparse signals such as single photons. In fact, recent studies have shown that ONα GCs are one of the most sensitive GC types in the mouse retina under dim light conditions and comprise the major conduit for relaying single photon signals out of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smeds et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, minimizing temporal filtering by GABA<sub>A</sub> presynaptic inhibition may help prolong the duration of signal integration and may improve sensitivity of the ONα GCs for single photon signaling in near complete darkness.</p><p>Besides signaling efficiently at absolute threshold in darkness, the ONα GC retinal circuit also integrates cone-driven signals and can operate under high luminance conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimes et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>). Our results show that GABA<sub>A</sub> presynaptic inhibition limits the response size and contrast gain while speeding up cone-driven signals reaching the ONα GCs. This can have two potential advantages. First, encoding contrast with a smaller response amplitude might allow to effectively signal over a broader dynamic range of contrasts without being saturated. As the contrast range explored in our experiments represent a small fraction of the contrast distribution present in natural scenes, such a gain control mechanism would help match the contrast sensitivity of the ONα GC retinal circuit to the statistics of the prevailing light inputs. Second, being able to signal fast changes in light inputs might aid the ONα GC retinal circuit in the efficient encoding of dynamic features such as during motion.</p><p>Our findings that GABA<sub>A</sub> presynaptic inhibition regulates the gain and kinetics of visual signals in the ONα GC retinal circuit is consistent with previous studies in other neural circuits, besides the retina, where presynaptic inhibition has been shown to play a central role in gain control and temporal filtering of neural signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baden and Hedwig, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Regehr, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fink et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frerking and Ohliger-Frerking, 2006</xref>). For instance, presynaptic inhibition mediated by GABAergic interneurons contributes to motor behavior in the spinal cord, where it controls the gain of sensory afferents and mediates smooth muscle movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fink et al., 2014</xref>). In the olfactory system, GABAergic presynaptic inhibition of the olfactory sensory axon terminals serves as a primary gain control mechanism to maintain odor sensitivity over a wide range of inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Root et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, presynaptic inhibition mediated by GABA receptors controls temporal contrast enhancement and modifies odor-guided navigation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raccuglia et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Presynaptic inhibition regulates neurotransmitter release and synapse arrangement</title><p>The role of presynaptic inhibition is particularly important for the ONα GC pathway. Previous studies have shown that excitatory synaptic inputs dictate the spike output of the ONα GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murphy and Rieke, 2006</xref>), and we show that GABA<sub>A</sub> presynaptic inhibition is a key mechanism well-poised to shape the ONα GC excitatory synaptic inputs. Both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors are localized at axon terminals of ON BCs, but they have been shown to be present at spatially distinct sites at RBC terminals relative to the site of synaptic release, i.e. ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimes et al., 2015</xref>). Pharmacological blockade and genetic deletion of GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors have shown that GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition regulates the extent of multivesicular glutamate release at the bipolar ribbon-type synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oesch and Diamond, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sagdullaev et al., 2006</xref>). Particularly in the ON CBC synapse, loss of GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors results in activation of the perisynaptic NMDA receptors on RGC dendrites by glutamate spillover from the synapse thus enhancing synaptic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sagdullaev et al., 2006</xref>). This could be a potential underlying mechanism for the enhanced light-evoked response we observe in ONα GCs in absence of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on the ON CBC terminals.</p><p>In RBCs, luminance and contrast are encoded via dynamic release and replenishment of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles located at the ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oesch and Diamond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oesch and Diamond, 2019</xref>). A step increase in luminance results in contrast encoding via a transient bout of vesicle release from the RRP, which corresponds to a transient peak in the AII AC excitatory current. The size of the remaining vesicle pool is used to encode luminance and corresponds to the sustained component of the excitatory postsynaptic current. A17 AC-mediated feedback inhibition on RBCs acting via GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors has been implicated in regulating the extent of RRP depletion and synaptic output from RBCs which in turn shapes luminance and contrast encoding across a range of dim light levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oesch and Diamond, 2019</xref>). Our results show that lack of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the RBC and T6 CBC terminals affects both the transient and sustained components of RBC and T6 CBC output as measured from the impact on the ONα GC excitatory inputs under rod- and cone-dominant light conditions. This indicates that both contrast and luminance encoding in the RBC and T6 CBC pathway might be shaped by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition. However, we cannot distinguish between the contribution of ‘feedback’ vs. ‘lateral’ GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition at RBC and T6 CBC terminal on ONα GC function. Feedback presynaptic inhibition on BC terminals is mediated by an AC that is activated by the same BC it provides inhibition onto, and lateral presynaptic inhibition is mediated by ACs activated by other BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asari and Meister, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimes et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that for most synapses the input-output relationship of membrane voltage vs. transmitter release is nonlinear and has a sigmoidal shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). Previous studies have in fact proposed that this synaptic transfer function of the ON CBC terminals has a sigmoidal relationship between membrane voltage and glutamate release with a steep nonlinear foot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimes et al., 2014b</xref>). The ON CBC or presynaptic membrane potential can be influenced by gap junctional coupling from the AII amacrine cell processes which can alter synapse output by changing its location on the voltage-release curve. This form of regulating synaptic output has been shown to play a critical role in shaping ONα GC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimes et al., 2014b</xref>). GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition could also regulate the presynaptic membrane voltage of the ON CBC, thereby controlling the set point of the synapse input-output curve and hence the ONα GC excitatory inputs.</p><p>ON BC synapses are specialized ribbon synapses that often have defined postsynaptic partners. One such example is the RBC output synapse onto AII and A17 AC processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimes et al., 2015</xref>). Our recent study showed that presynaptic inhibition plays a key role in the precise assembly of the ribbon synapse at the RBC terminal and organization with correct postsynaptic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, under conditions where expression of both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors in the RBC terminals are downregulated, such as during lack of global inhibitory transmitter release or loss of specific synaptic adhesion molecules, ultrastructural analysis revealed that the RBC ribbon synapse is misorganised and makes erroneous connections with postsynaptic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, despite the downregulation of both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors at the RBC terminal in this situation, there is decreased dim light sensitivity of the ONα GC output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>) probably due to a reduced feedforward excitatory drive as a result of synaptic mis-arrangements at the RBC terminal. In the KO mice used in the current study, there is a drastic reduction of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor expression but unaltered GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor expression in the RBC terminals. Given that dim light sensitivity is increased in the KO retina, it will be interesting in the future to use ultrastructural techniques in the KO retina to determine if the selective reduction of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors results in any organizational deficits of RBC output (ribbon) synapse assembly.</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides the first characterization of how selective perturbation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition at ON BC terminals impacts visual signaling of a well-characterized GC circuit. Future studies will be needed to explore how presynaptic inhibition regulates functional properties of other ganglion cell pathways as well as its contribution to shaping the receptive field organization of ganglion cell types.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Gabrg2</italic></td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>JAX Stock# 016830 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:016830">IMSR_JAX:016830</ext-link></td><td>Transgenic mouse;

Retinas were thereafter incubated in secondary antibody solution using anti-isotypic Alexa Fluor (1:1000, Invitrogen) conjugates. Retinas were finally mounted on slides with Vectashield antifade mounting medium (Vector Labs; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2336789">AB_2336789</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Electrophysiology experiments were performed on whole-mounted retinal preparations made from dark-adapted KO and WT mice. Mice were sacrificed via cervical dislocation and enucleation was subsequently performed. Retinas were isolated in oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) Ames medium (Sigma-Aldrich) at 32–34°C, mounted flat in a recording chamber and perfused with oxygenated Ames medium at a flow rate of ~8 mL/min during recordings. Retinas were mounted ganglion cell side up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sinha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>) for recordings. The retinas were embedded in agarose and sliced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>) for RBC recordings. Retinal neurons were visualized for patch-clamp recordings using infrared light (&gt;900 nm). All recordings were obtained from the ventral retina. Voltage-clamp recordings from RBCs and ONα GCs were made with pipettes (~10 MΩ for RBCs and 3–4 MΩ for ONα GCs) filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mM) 105 Cs methanesulfonate, 10 tetraethylammonium chloride, 20 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 2 QX-314, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.5 Tris-GTP (∼280 mOsm, pH ∼7.2 with KOH). For all voltage-clamp recordings, cells were held at estimated inhibitory and excitatory reversal potentials ~−60 mV and ~0 mV respectively in order to measure excitatory or inhibitory synaptic inputs. Absolute voltages were corrected for liquid junction potentials. For puff recordings of RBCs, GABA was applied with a Picospritzer II (General Valve) connected to a patch pipette with a resistance of ~5–7 MΩ. GABA (200 μM) was prepared in HEPES-buffered Ames medium with 0.1 mM Alexa 488 hydrazide. Puffing duration (50 ms) and direction were chosen such that the axon terminal of the RBC was completely covered by the puff. For the quantification of GABA-evoked currents, peak amplitude relative to the baseline current before stimulus/drug application was determined and averaged across cells. (1,2,5,6- Tetrahydropyridin-4-yl) methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA, 50 μM; Tocris, Bristol, United Kingdom) and GABAzine (20 μM; Tocris, Bristol, United Kingdom) were added to the perfusion solution for RBC recordings as indicated. Alexa 594 dye (100–200 µM) was added to the intracellular solution for the following image acquisition of the exemplar ONα GC shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> using the software ScanImage (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014307">SCR_014307</ext-link>) and analysed using the software ImageJ (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>). Light responses were recorded from ONα GCs using whole-cell and cell-attached recordings. LED light sources with peak spectral output at 360 or 405 nm respectively were used to deliver full-field light stimuli that were 500 μm in diameter and focused on the photoreceptor layer through the optics of the microscope. Photon densities were calibrated using estimations of opsin photoisomerisations per photoreceptor, assuming a rod collecting area of 0.5 μm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Field and Rieke, 2002</xref>) and a cone collecting area of 0.2 µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nikonov et al., 2006</xref>). Recordings were made in darkness or background light levels at which rods dominate retinal responses and light levels at which cones dominate (~1000 R*/S cone/s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology data acquisition and analysis</title><p>All electrophysiology data was low pass-filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and acquired using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier. The data was acquired using Symphony Data Acquisition Software, an open-source, MATLAB-based electrophysiology software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/symphony-das">https://github.com/symphony-das</ext-link>). Subsequent data analysis was performed using self-written code in MATLAB (Mathworks; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>) and Igor Pro (WaveMetrics; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000325">SCR_000325</ext-link>). Peak response amplitudes of ONα GC were quantified by taking the peak spike rate or current during the stimulus presentation. The sustained component of ONα GC response to the 0.5 s light step was estimated by taking the average spike rate or excitatory current over a 200 ms time window (from 0.3 to 0.5 s) from the time of stimulus. The total spike response in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> was estimated as the average spike rate over the duration of the 0.5 s light step. Time to peak was estimated as the time taken for the response to reach from the stimulus onset to the peak amplitude. Decay time was estimated as the time taken for the response to recover from the peak amplitude to a value equal to the pre-stimulus baseline. The time of onset for the sustained phase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E</xref> was estimated using two approaches – (i) on a per trace basis as the time after the stimulus onset to when the response reached a fit line with zero slope and (ii) by fitting an exponential function to the response (average traces across trials from each cell) from the end of the transient phase (~175 ms from the time of stimulus onset) to the end of the stimulus and defining the onset time as the time at which the exponential fit decays to 20% of its initial value. Both analysis approaches yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Rebound amplitude for flash responses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref> was estimated as the amplitude of the peak of the overshoot from the baseline.</p><p>LN models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) were derived from ONα GC responses to randomly varying light stimuli (Gaussian distribution of light intensities with standard deviation = 50% of mean intensity; 0–60 Hz bandwidth) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Rieke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rieke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sinha et al., 2016</xref>). The linear temporal filter and the static nonlinearity were estimated using previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Rieke, 2001</xref>). Contrast-dependent changes are shared by the y-axis of the linear filter and the x-axis of the static nonlinearity. Therefore, to estimate the contrast gain unambiguously we needed to scale the linear filter in amplitude such that the variance of the filtered stimulus was equal to the variance of the stimulus. By scaling the filter in this way, differences in the contrast gain of the model would be reflected in changes in the slope of the static nonlinearity. The slope of the static nonlinearity was estimated as the average slope within the linear region of a quintic polynomial fit to each response in KO and WT retina. The slopes estimated from fits with a cumulative density function yielded similar values (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Confocal microscopy and image analysis</title><p>A Leica SP8 confocal microscope and a 1.4 NA 63× oil immersion objective at a voxel size of around 0.05–0.05–0.3 μm (x–y–z) was used to acquire the images in this study.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Katrin Francke.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Below is a synthesis of comments from all three reviewers. Note some of the comments are addressing the same point (namely interpretation of Figures 3 and 4). I thought it would be of benefit that you read the reviewers comments as they were written.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use targeted knockout approach to investigate the role of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mediated presynaptic inhibition at the bipolar cell (BC) axon terminal on the output of a specific retinal ganglion cell (RGC) type. Using a Grm6-Cre mouse line crossed with a floxxed gamma2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, they generated mice which eliminated GABA-A receptors from ON-cone bipolar cells and rod bipolar cells. This strategy was used previously (Hoon et al., PNAS, 2015) to eliminate of GABA-A receptors on cone bipolar cell terminals while maintaining GABA-A receptors in the bipolar cell dendrites. They confirm the KO of GABA-A receptors at terminal by immunohistochemistry and functional recordings. Then, they focus on how a lack of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mediated presynaptic inhibition modulates the output of On α RGCs – a well-described circuit of the inner retina. They find that this selective loss of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors enhances sensitivity for both dim and bright light conditions and that it affects the kinetic and contrast response of light-evoked, cone-driven responses of On α RGCs – thereby demonstrating that presynaptic inhibition shapes the output of a distinct retinal circuit.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers felt the experiments were well executed and the results were presented clearly. However all noted that the implications of the data should be analyzed and discussed more thoroughly. Moreover, a few addition experiments were requested so that authors can be more confident that there was no impact on GABA-A receptors in amacrine cells or RGCs. All felt these issues must be addressed in order to increase the impact of the study.</p><p>1. The authors need to test more rigorously whether the KO has impacted GABA-A receptors on RGCs and ACs. The authors show a dramatic decrease in GABA-A receptors in targeted KOs in the ON sublamina (Figure 1). However, there should still be GABA-A receptors on ACs and RGCs. Perhaps they are at a lower density and difficult to see but the other possibility is that there has been a development downregulation of postsynaptic GABA-A receptors in these KOs. Hoon et al. has shown that reduction of GABA-A transmission can impact maturation of GABA-A receptor in bipolar cell terminals so this might also happen in RGC or AC dendrites. These are important control to make sure that their results are indeed due to loss of presynaptic inhibition at the BC synapse and not due to loss of serial inhibition at amacrine cell processes or loss of inhibition on RGCs.</p><p>2. The authors make the claim that the increases in firing rate observed in KO mice is due to increases in excitatory currents and therefore due entirely to loss of presynaptic inhibition on bipolar cell terminals. To confirm this conclusion, they should assay the impact of inhibition in KO. They present what feels like a thin data set addressing this issue in Figure 2 – supplement 1 – with one example cell and no summary data. This data set needs to be expanded to make this conclusion.</p><p>3. The authors demonstrate that eliminating GABA<sub>A</sub> mediated presynaptic inhibition at the On BC synapse increases the gain and sensitivity of excitatory inputs to On α RGCs (Figures 2, 3) – which is likely not surprising given previous studies, but corresponds to a reasonable proof-of-concept result. However, when they continue to further investigate the functional relevance of the reduced presynaptic inhibition on On α RGC signaling, the interpretation of the results is incomplete (see next two points 3.1, 3.2). Here, a more detailed interpretation and added context is critical for the impact of the study – especially since the results about increased sensitivity are rather expected and in general the authors use a relatively simple stimulus set.</p><p>3.1. In Figure 3F, the authors show the mean excitatory synaptic current to a brief flash for WT and KO mice and quantify the change in response amplitude (Figure 3G). However, not only the amplitude but also the response shape looks significantly different, with the KO trace showing a rebound that is not present in the WT trace. This is an interesting finding that the authors do not comment on. The rebound could be due to a decrease in spontaneous activity of BCs, which would be visible in single trial responses. Is this what the authors observed? This effect is also present in traces shown in Figure 3C and might be related to the delayed onset of the sustained response component in Figure 3B and Figure 3C. I suggest the authors quantify the rebound and the onset of the delayed response component and comment and discuss this finding – what might be the underlying mechanism and the functional relevance?</p><p>3.2. In Figure 4, the authors find that in KO animals, temporal kernels estimated from a full-field, white noise stimulus exhibit a slower kinetic and that contrast changes are encoded by a larger current range. However, I do not follow their conclusion: &quot;This means that the ONα GCs in the KO retina are sensitive to a larger (~two-fold) range of contrasts than the ONα GC in the WT retina&quot;. Instead, I think that their results show that the same range of contrasts is encoded by a larger current range, suggesting that in KO animals ONα GCs have a larger dynamic range which likely allows better discrimination of contrast levels. Also, the authors do not speculate about the functional implications of their finding. Their results suggest that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mediated inhibition at On BC axon terminals speeds up ONα GC responses, however, at the cost of discriminating different contrast levels. Therefore, one could speculate that this circuit prioritizes fast changes over contrast discrimination – would the authors agree with this interpretation? For which visual tasks might this be useful?</p><p>4. Figures 2-3 The authors have interesting data here that should be investigated more thoroughly. It makes sense that removing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mediated inhibition from ON bipolar cells would increase the amplitude of responses in the ONαGCs, as is shown here. However, as the authors discuss later, removing inhibition also likely affects the timing of responses. The authors have data on the spike and currents responses to a brief flash of light that should give interesting information about kinetics, but this is not analyzed. Previous data (Eggers and Lukasiewicz, J Neuroscience 2006) suggests that removing GABA<sub>A</sub> specifically in ON bipolar cells would affect the timing of the peak more than the decay/half-width. Does that happen here?</p><p>5. Figure 4. The temporal differences in the linear filter are interesting. It appears that both the time to peak and the half-width of the filter are changed in the examples shown. Was this true generally? Also, did the change in the temporal filter correlate with a change in the time to peak and decay time/half width of the responses to brief light stimuli? This should be similar to what is being estimated by the linear filters. This could be an interesting point in the paper because often the brief flash response and linear filters are not measured in the same paper, in the same types of cells. Also, please show the similar data in Figure 4A, B, D for the rod activated responses. Rod vs. cone activation is an interesting comparison, especially as GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors may have a larger role in ON cone bipolar cells than in rod bipolar cells.</p><p>6. The authors need to clarify their stats. They use SEM to represent the variance in their data , implying normal distributions. However, they use rank sum tests for significance, implying non-normal data. The authors need to clarify whether their data follows a normal distribution and if so, then they should use more powerful t-tests rather than rank tests. If their data does not follow a normal distribution, then they need to use SD to represent variance or confidence intervals to represent significance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60994.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers felt the experiments were well executed and the results were presented clearly.

Perhaps they are at a lower density and difficult to see but the other possibility is that there has been a development downregulation of postsynaptic GABA-A receptors in these KOs. Hoon et al. has shown that reduction of GABA-A transmission can impact maturation of GABA-A receptor in bipolar cell terminals so this might also happen in RGC or AC dendrites. These are important control to make sure that their results are indeed due to loss of presynaptic inhibition at the BC synapse and not due to loss of serial inhibition at amacrine cell processes or loss of inhibition on RGCs.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has raised an excellent point about the specificity of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor deletion in the conditional knockout (KO) mice. We have addressed this concern by performing additional control experiments. We have assessed if expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in ACs and RGCs processes in the KO retina is changed compared to that in the WT retina through new immunohistochemistry experiments that are now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E. By performing co-labeling for calbindin, a marker for AC and GC processes in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and for specific GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits, we found that the expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the AC and GC processes in the ON sublamina of the IPL remains unchanged in the KO retina (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E). We have in addition tested if postsynaptic inhibition on ONa GCs is altered in the KO retina (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). We find no difference in the amplitude of the light-evoked inhibitory current recorded from ONa GCs in KO and WT retina.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors make the claim that the increases in firing rate observed in KO mice is due to increases in excitatory currents and therefore due entirely to loss of presynaptic inhibition on bipolar cell terminals. To confirm this conclusion, they should assay the impact of inhibition in KO. They present what feels like a thin data set addressing this issue in Figure 2 – supplement 1 – with one example cell and no summary data. This data set needs to be expanded to make this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the sample size and added a bar plot with quantification of the peak amplitude of the light-evoked inhibitory current for ONa GCs in KO and WT retina (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). This revised dataset shows that post-synaptic inhibition received by the ONa GCs remains unchanged in the KO retina.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors demonstrate that eliminating GABA<sub>A</sub> mediated presynaptic inhibition at the On BC synapse increases the gain and sensitivity of excitatory inputs to On α RGCs (Figures 2, 3) – which is likely not surprising given previous studies, but corresponds to a reasonable proof-of-concept result. However, when they continue to further investigate the functional relevance of the reduced presynaptic inhibition on On α RGC signaling, the interpretation of the results is incomplete (see next two points -- 3.1, 3.2). Here, a more detailed interpretation and added context is critical for the impact of the study – especially since the results about increased sensitivity are rather expected and in general the authors use a relatively simple stimulus set.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern about interpretation of results and added context. We have now included several new analyses, as the reviewers suggested (see below), which have bolstered the results and the impact of the study. We have also expanded the Discussion section substantially to provide better context for how our current findings advance the understanding of presynaptic inhibition and its role in retinal function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.1. In Figure 3F, the authors show the mean excitatory synaptic current to a brief flash for WT and KO mice and quantify the change in response amplitude (Figure 3G). However, not only the amplitude but also the response shape looks significantly different, with the KO trace showing a rebound that is not present in the WT trace. This is an interesting finding that the authors do not comment on. The rebound could be due to a decrease in spontaneous activity of BCs, which would be visible in single trial responses. Is this what the authors observed? This effect is also present in traces shown in Figure 3C and might be related to the delayed onset of the sustained response component in Figure 3B and Figure 3C. I suggest the authors quantify the rebound and the onset of the delayed response component and comment and discuss this finding – what might be the underlying mechanism and the functional relevance?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point about the response rebound and its underlying implications. As per reviewers’ suggestion, we quantified both the rebound amplitude for the response to brief 10 ms light flashes as well as the time of onset of the sustained phase for the responses to a light step (0.5s duration) in Figure 3. We have added the new analysis in Figure 3 (Figure 3M and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). We do not see a significant difference for either of those parameters across <bold>ONa GCs</bold> between KO and WT retina (Figure 3M and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E). To better represent the data, we have replaced exemplar traces in all figures with average responses (across cells). A previous study has shown that lack of GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor mediated inhibition enhances glutamate release from bipolar cells which leads to spillover activation of perisynaptic NMDA receptors on ON GCs and thus extends their dynamic range (Sagdullaev et al., 2006). We agree with the reviewer that it will be interesting to determine if a similar synaptic mechanism is at play in absence of presynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors for enhancing output to ONa GCs. This will be a subject of future investigation using detailed pharmacology and recordings of AMPA and NMDA receptor mediated spontaneous/evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents. We have added this potential mechanism of regulating synaptic output in the revised discussion (lines 367-373).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.2. In Figure 4, the authors find that in KO animals, temporal kernels estimated from a full-field, white noise stimulus exhibit a slower kinetic and that contrast changes are encoded by a larger current range. However, I do not follow their conclusion: &quot;This means that the ONα GCs in the KO retina are sensitive to a larger (~two-fold) range of contrasts than the ONα GC in the WT retina&quot;. Instead, I think that their results show that the same range of contrasts is encoded by a larger current range, suggesting that in KO animals ONα GCs have a larger dynamic range which likely allows better discrimination of contrast levels. Also, the authors do not speculate about the functional implications of their finding. Their results suggest that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mediated inhibition at On BC axon terminals speeds up ONα GC responses, however, at the cost of discriminating different contrast levels. Therefore, one could speculate that this circuit prioritizes fast changes over contrast discrimination – would the authors agree with this interpretation? For which visual tasks might this be useful?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have corrected this and discussed the interpretation and functional relevance at length in the expanded/revised Discussion section. We have dedicated one part of the discussion on the role of presynaptic inhibition in contrast encoding and temporal filtering for the ONa GC circuit. To better estimate the contrast sensitivity from the white noise stimuli, we have re-analyzed the nonlinearity after scaling the linear filter (see methods) since contrast-dependent changes are shared by both the y-axis of the linear filter and the x-axis of the nonlinearity. After scaling the filters, the slope of the nonlinearity can be used as a measure of contrast gain (Figure 4E, G, K, M). This clearly shows that ONα GC contrast sensitivity is increased in the KO retina under both rod and cone activated light conditions (Figure 4G, M). Our results thus suggest that GABA<sub>A</sub> presynaptic inhibition limits the size of the ONα GC current response to contrasts to perhaps allow for encoding over a broader range of contrast without saturation. We are a bit hesitant to speculate that the ONα GC circuit prioritizes fast changes over contrast discrimination. What if, perhaps, the variance in light encountered at this given light background in the real world was such that the animal needed to discriminate over a wide range of contrasts. Then, having the lower contrast sensitivity is actually a benefit, since it is matched to the statistics of the inputs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figures 2-3 The authors have interesting data here that should be investigated more thoroughly. It makes sense that removing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mediated inhibition from ON bipolar cells would increase the amplitude of responses in the ONαGCs, as is shown here. However, as the authors discuss later, removing inhibition also likely affects the timing of responses. The authors have data on the spike and currents responses to a brief flash of light that should give interesting information about kinetics, but this is not analyzed. Previous data (Eggers and Lukasiewicz, J Neuroscience 2006) suggests that removing GABA<sub>A</sub> specifically in ON bipolar cells would affect the timing of the peak more than the decay/half-width. Does that happen here?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making this excellent suggestion. We have now analyzed the kinetics of the light-evoked spike and excitatory current to a brief light flash and a light step (0.5s duration). We have further quantified the decay times of the excitatory current responses to light flash in Figure 3. We have added bar plots for each of the above kinetic analysis in Figures 2E,I and 3D,H,K and L. The results we observed for the linear filters are consistent with that for the responses to light flashes/steps. The differences in the kinetics of excitatory inputs of ONα GCs for cone-driven signals between KO and WT retina and the similarities in the kinetics of excitatory inputs of ONα GCs for rod-driven signals between KO and WT retina is reflected in the ONα GC spike output (Figure 2E and 3D). We see similar increase (~10 ms) in time to peak and decay time in the light-evoked excitatory inputs of ONα GCs in the KO retina compared to that in the WT retina (Figure 4C vs Figure 4D; Figure 3K vs 3L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 4. The temporal differences in the linear filter are interesting. It appears that both the time to peak and the half-width of the filter are changed in the examples shown. Was this true generally? Also, did the change in the temporal filter correlate with a change in the time to peak and decay time/half width of the responses to brief light stimuli? This should be similar to what is being estimated by the linear filters. This could be an interesting point in the paper because often the brief flash response and linear filters are not measured in the same paper, in the same types of cells. Also, please show the similar data in Figure 4A, B, D for the rod activated responses. Rod vs. cone activation is an interesting comparison, especially as GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors may have a larger role in ON cone bipolar cells than in rod bipolar cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point raised by the reviewer. See response to reviewer comment 4. The results we observed for the linear filters are consistent with that for the responses to brief light flashes. We have revised Figure 4 and added similar data for rod-mediated responses.We have included in the Discussion section a paragraph about this difference in temporal filtering between rod and cone-mediated signals and why GABA<sub>A</sub> presynaptic inhibition does not seem to play a role in shaping the time-course of rod-mediated signals in the ONα GC circuit (lines 322-352).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors need to clarify their stats. They use SEM to represent the variance in their data , implying normal distributions. However, they use rank sum tests for significance, implying non-normal data. The authors need to clarify whether their data follows a normal distribution and if so, then they should use more powerful t-tests rather than rank tests. If their data does not follow a normal distribution, then they need to use SD to represent variance or confidence intervals to represent significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have redone all the statistical analysis using an unpaired two-tailed t-test. We have revised the text in the methods accordingly. We have shown all data points for sample size of n&lt;10.</p></body></sub-article></article>
