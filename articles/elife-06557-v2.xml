composition in vivo. Here we show that the phospholipid remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3) is a critical determinant of triglyceride (TG) secretion due to its unique ability to catalyze the incorporation of arachidonate into membranes. Mice lacking <italic>Lpcat3</italic> in the intestine fail to thrive during weaning and exhibit enterocyte lipid accumulation and reduced plasma TGs. Mice lacking <italic>Lpcat3</italic> in the liver show reduced plasma TGs, hepatosteatosis, and secrete lipid-poor very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lacking arachidonoyl PLs. Mechanistic studies indicate that Lpcat3 activity impacts membrane lipid mobility in living cells, suggesting a biophysical basis for the requirement of arachidonoyl PLs in lipidating lipoprotein particles. These data identify Lpcat3 as a key factor in lipoprotein production and illustrate how manipulation of membrane composition can be used as a regulatory mechanism to control metabolic pathways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06557.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06557.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06557.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells are surrounded by a membrane that forms a barrier between the cell and its external environment. This membrane is largely made up of a variety of molecules known as lipids. The particular lipid molecules found in a cell membrane strongly influence its mobility, flexibility and other physical properties.</p><p>The liver and intestine can package lipids gained from the diet into molecules called lipoproteins, which are released into the bloodstream for use by the body. An enzyme known as Lpcat3 is found in high levels in the liver and intestine and it appears to be involved in the production of lipoproteins. Altering the amount of Lpcat3 in cells can change the types of lipids found in the cell membranes, connected to the production of lipoproteins.</p><p>Rong et al. studied newborn mice that were missing the Lpcat3 protein in either the liver or intestine. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the intestine had higher levels of lipids inside their intestine cells and grew more slowly than normal mice. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the liver also accumulated lipids in their cells and their bloodstream had lower levels of lipids that contain a molecule called arachidonic acid than normal mice. Further experiments showed that the loss of Lpcat3 reduces the ability of lipids to move within the cell membrane.</p><p>The experiments show that Lpcat3 plays a key role in attaching arachidonic acid to membrane lipids to promote the release of lipoproteins into the bloodstream. Rong et al.'s findings reveal that changing the type of lipids in the cell membrane plays an important role in regulating the levels of lipids in the blood.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06557.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06557.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>phospholipid</kwd><kwd>lipoprotein</kwd><kwd>nuclear receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL090553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Stephen G</given-names></name><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK063491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL030568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gratton</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM076516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gratton</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL074214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ford</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association (AHA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13PRE17150049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rong</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The enzyme Lpcat3 plays a unique role in the incorporation of arachidonic acid into membranes, which is required for the production of lipoproteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phospholipids (PLs) are important components of biological membranes and also serve as precursors for the generation of diverse signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spector and Yorek, 1985</xref>). In mammalian cells PLs synthesized de novo undergo further remodeling through deacylation by phospholipases and the subsequent and reacylation by lysophospholipid acyltransferases (Lpcats). Membrane PLs ultimately reach an equilibrium in which the majority of PL species contain a saturated acyl chain at the <italic>sn</italic>-1 position and an unsaturated chain at the <italic>sn-</italic>2 position. The Lpcat-dependent remodeling process is essential for the diversity and asymmetric distribution of acyl chains because the de novo PL synthesis pathway has little substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yamashita et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We previously identified the sterol-activated nuclear receptor LXR as an integrator of cellular lipid levels and membrane PL composition. LXR controls the expression of Lpcat3, which is the most abundant Lpcat family member in liver and intestine. Cell-based assays suggest that Lpcat3 preferentially catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) species containing an unsaturated fatty acyl chain at the sn-2 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>), but the importance of Lpcat3 activity for membrane PL composition in vivo remains to be established. We found that acute overexpression or knockdown of Lpcat3 in cultured cells or mouse liver altered the distribution of PL species, particularly those containing unsaturated fatty acyl chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rong et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, we showed that the ability of the LXR-Lpcat3 pathway to promote unsaturation of membrane lipids was protective against ER stress and inflammation in the setting of cellular lipid excess. However, the in vivo relevance of LXR-dependent modulation of endogenous PL composition for systemic lipid homeostasis was unclear.</p><p>Moreover, the larger topic of the regulatory potential of dynamic phospholipid remodeling has been largely unexplored. It has been reported that modifications of PL composition influence a range of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holzer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pinot et al., 2014</xref>). However, most analyses of the consequences of altered PL fatty acyl composition have been performed in purified membrane systems or have involved treating cells with high levels of exogenous lipids. Such experimental manipulations are unlikely to accurately model physiologic perturbations in membrane composition. The recognition that Lpcat3 activity can be regulated by cellular lipid status through LXRs raises the possibility that Lpcat3 activity could contribute to some of the well-documented effects of LXR on systemic lipid homeostasis.</p><p>The rate of lipoprotein production has been linked with the availability of PC, but the mechanisms underlying this link are not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vance, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abumrad and Davidson, 2012</xref>). PC is the major PL component of lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ãgren et al., 2005</xref>). It has been reported that active PC de novo synthesis is necessary for the biogenesis and/or secretion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) from hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vance, 2008</xref>). However, impaired de novo PC synthesis impacts all the PC species and reduces the total PC content of cellular membranes. Whether a specific PC species is selectively required for hepatocyte lipoprotein production is unclear. In the intestine, it has been proposed that PC may enhance lipid uptake by enterocytes and/or promote chylomicron assembly and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tso et al., 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voshol et al., 2000</xref>). Luminal PC is not absorbed intact, but is hydrolyzed into lysophosphatidylcholine (Lyso-PC) in the lumen and subsequently re-acylated within enterocytes by Lpcat enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nilsson, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Parthasarathy et al., 1974</xref>). The mechanistic role of specific PL species in lipid transport and lipoprotein production has been difficult to address due to an inability to selectively manipulate membrane PL composition in vivo. Interestingly, the LXR pathway has been reported to promote hepatic triglyceride (TG) secretion by the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Okazaki et al., 2010</xref>). The possibility that PL remodeling contributes to this effect has not been tested.</p><p>We demonstrate here that Lpcat3 is uniquely required for the incorporation of arachidonic acid into membranes in vivo, and that an absence of arachidonoyl PLs profoundly affects lipid transport and lipoprotein production. Biophysical, electron microscopy (EM) and biochemical studies indicate that Lpcat3-dependent production of arachidonoyl PLs is important for lipid movement within membranes and for the efficient lipidation of apoBâcontaining lipoproteins. We also show that induction of Lpcat3 activity is required for the ability of LXRs to promote hepatic VLDL production. These data identify Lpcat3-dependent phospholipid remodeling as a critical, LXR-regulated step in TG secretion, and suggest that this step might be further explored as a strategy to treat hyperlipidemias.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To examine the consequence of Lpcat3 deficiency in vivo, we generated Lpcat3-deficient mice from targeted ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The targeted allele was âconditional-readyâ, making it possible to create both global and tissue-specific knockout mice. The global knockout mice (i.e., homozygous for the targeted allele) showed markedly reduced levels of <italic>Lpcat3</italic> transcripts in liver and intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Global <italic>Lpcat3</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice on a C57BL/6 background were born at the expected Mendelian frequency, and their weights were indistinguishable from WT mice at birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). However, the blood glucose levels of <italic>Lpcat3</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice were very low at birth, and none survived beyond day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). <italic>Lpcat3</italic><sup>â/â</sup> pups survived for up to 6 days when given subcutaneous glucose injections, but the pups did not thrive and invariably died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Analysis of gene expression in liver and small intestines of the pups revealed changes in a number of genes linked to lipid metabolism, some of which were common in both tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Although these changes appeared consistent with a role for Lpcat3 in lipid metabolism, it was impossible to exclude the possibility that these gene-expression alterations were simply due to the extremely poor health of the mice. We therefore turned our attention to tissue-selective knockout mice, with the hope that we could obtain viable mice and decipher the function of Lpcat3.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06557.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation and analysis of global <italic>Lpcat3</italic> knockout mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Strategy for generating global <italic>Lpcat3</italic> knockout mice.

Furthermore, acute deletion uncovered a decrease in ad-lib plasma TG levels that was not observed with developmental deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,H</xref>). This finding suggests that there may be partial compensation for the chronic loss of Lpcat3 in the L-Lpcat3 KO mice.

Here, we showed that intestinal Lpcat3 expression is strongly responsive to the administration of a synthetic LXR-agonist, GW3965 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

However, even though the pups suckled, they failed to thrive and showed severe growth retardation by 1 week of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Expression of <italic>Lpcat3</italic> was reduced more than 90% in duodenum of I-Lpcat3 KO mice as expected, and there was no compensatory increase in expression of <italic>Lpcat1</italic>, <italic>Lpcat2</italic> or <italic>Lpcat4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Plasma insulin levels were also correspondingly reduced. Plasma TG levels were lower and total cholesterol and NEFA levels were unchanged in I-Lpcat3 KO pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Histological analysis of intestines from I-Lpcat3 KO pups revealed a dramatic accumulation of cytosolic lipid droplets in intestinal enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), a phenotype reminiscent of intestinal apoB-deficient mice.

Previous studies using in vitro systems have profiled the substrate specificities of the four mammalian Lpcat family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). These studies suggested that Lpcat3 exhibited a preference for LysoPC and polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates. Consistent with those results, we previously observed subtle changes in the levels of PC species containing polyunsaturated acyl in response to acute Lpcat3 knockdown in hepatocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rong et al., 2013</xref>). However, the consequences of a genetic inactivation of <italic>Lpcat3</italic> for membrane composition in vivo have never been addressed. Unexpectedly, analysis of phospholipid species in whole liver extracts from L-Lpcat3 KO mice by ESI-MS/MS revealed that Lpcat3 activity is uniquely required for the incorporation of arachidonate chains into PLs. Thus, despite the fact that Lpcat3 can catalyze the esterification of multiple unsaturated acyl chains into PC in vitro, and despite the fact that Lpcat3 is by far the most abundant Lpcat family member in the liver, the consequences of loss of Lpcat3 for PL composition were remarkably selective. The total level of PC was not different between L-Lpcat3 KO and control livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, there were striking reductions (â¼70%) in the abundance of 16:0, 20:4 PC and 18:0, 20:4 PC (nomenclature: a:b, c:d; where a and c are the number of carbons and b and d are the number of double bonds of the sn-1 and sn-2 aliphatic groups, respectively), two of the most abundant arachidonoyl PC species in liver membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, the actual reduction of 16:0, 20:4 PC and 18:0, 20:4 PCs in <italic>hepatocyte</italic> membranes was almost certainly much greater, given that a significant fraction of membranes in total liver extracts originate from other cell types (where Lpcat3 activity is preserved).

The diet increased the abundance of certain PC species, such as 16:0, 18:1 PC, presumably reflecting the abundance of oleate in the western diet. However, we observed the same prominent deficits in 16:0, 20:4 PC and 18:0, 20:4 PC on western diet as we observed on chow diet, with no change in total levels of PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition, there were reductions in 16:1, 18:2 PC and 18:1, 20:4 PC in western diet-fed Lpcat3 KO livers compared to controls. Severe reductions of phosphatidlyethanolamine (PE) species containing arachidonate chains were also observed in L-Lpcat3 KO mice on both chow and western diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, 16:0, 20:4 PE and 18:0, 20:4 PE are particularly abundant PE species in liver on western diet, and reductions in their levels was sufficient to reduce total PE levels.</p><p>Since unsaturated PC species are abundant in plasma lipoproteins, and since mice lacking Lpcat3 in liver or intestine show reduced plasma TG levels, we tested whether loss of Lpcat3 expression in liver would alter the phospholipid composition of VLDL secreted from the liver. After fasting L-Lpcat3 KO and control mice overnight, the VLDL was isolated from pooled plasma (n = 5 mice/group). Analysis of PC species in the pooled VLDL fractions by ESI-MS/MS revealed highly selective reductions in 16:0, 20:4 PC and 18:0, 20:4 PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, the phospholipid deficits of L-Lpcat3 KO hepatic membranes are passed on to the VLDL particles that they generate, strongly suggesting that loss of these PC species is mechanistically related to the altered TG content of the particles.</p><p>Interestingly, the severe loss of arachidonate in livers of Lpcat3 KO mice on chow diet was observed in PLs, but not in TG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) nor in cholesterol esters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Multiple genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport and in lipid droplet formation were upregulated, again likely reflecting a response to increased hepatic TG and cholesterol content. Interestingly, the putative transporter Mfsd2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>) was induced in Lpcat3-deficient livers on both chow and western diet, perhaps as compensation for the loss of arachidonoyl PLs. In addition, there was increased expression of a number of genes linked to inflammation and inflammatory cell recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These data are consistent with our earlier study showing that adenoviral expression of Lpcat3 is protective against hepatic inflammation in the setting of lipid excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rong et al., 2013</xref>). We validated the microarray results for a number of genes by real-time PCR and also assessed the expression of other genes relevant to lipoprotein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). Importantly, there was no change in the expression of mRNAs encoding apoB or of the critical lipid transfer protein MTTP in livers of Lpcat3 KO mice, indicating that altered plasma TG levels cannot be attributed to changes in expression of these factors.</p><p>We previously reported that acute knockdown of Lpcat3 expression in livers of genetically obese mice exacerbated lipid-induced ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rong et al., 2013</xref>). Genetic deletion of Lpcat3 from liver did not lead to increased mRNA expression of ER stress markers in mice fed chow or western diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These observations suggest that there may be compensatory responses in membrane composition that prevent induction of the ER stress response in the setting of chronic Lpcat3 deletion. In support of this idea, we observed a prominent increase in the abundance of oleoyl-PC species in L-Lpcat3 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that ER stress may be increased in L-Lpcat3 mice in the setting of genetic obesity or other causes of severe lipotoxicity.</p><p>We next investigated the etiology of reduced VLDL TG levels in mice lacking Lpcat3. Protein levels of apoB in liver were not different between control and L-Lpcat3 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Together with the preserved levels of apoB in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2, 3</xref>), these data suggest that a defect in production or secretion of apoB alone cannot explain the change in plasma VLDL. We directly assessed hepatic TG secretion by treating mice with the lipase inhibitor Tyloxapol and measuring TG accumulation in fasted mice. L-Lpact3 KO mice showed a markedly reduced rate of TG secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), suggesting that reduced incorporation of TGs into lipoproteins was the likely cause of the reduced VLDL TG levels.

Prior studies have employed the lipophilic dye laurdan to interrogate lipid dynamics in membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Parasassi and Gratton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vest et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Golfetto et al., 2013</xref>). Laurdan is a fluorescent lipophilic molecule that can be used to detect changes in membrane dynamics due to its sensitivity to the polarity of the membrane environment. Changes in membrane dynamics shift the laurdan emission spectrum, which can be quantified by the generalized polarization (GP) calculated from the spectrum shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parasassi et al., 1990</xref>). We isolated primary hepatocytes from L-Lpcat3 KO mice and controls, stained with laurdan, and monitored fluorescence in live cells by microscopy. A visual representation of the calculated GP intensity is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, and the data are quantitated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>. The prominent increase in GP (as shown by the yellow/orange pseudocolor signal) in cells lacking Lpcat3 is indicative of areas of cellular membrane with reduced dynamics. These data show that membranes are less dynamic, and their component lipids move less readily, in the absence of Lpcat3, an observation that is consistent with the reduced amount of arachidonate groups in membrane PLs. We propose that efficient transfer of bulk TG to nascent VLDL particles is enabled by the presence of arachidonoyl PLs in the ER/Golgi membrane due to its unique ability to facilitate optimal lipid movement and membrane dynamics.</p><p>Finally, as LXR agonists have previously been reported to promote hepatic TG secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schultz et al., 2000</xref>), we tested the requirement for Lpcat3 induction in this effect. Control and L-Lpcat3 KO mice were treated for 2 days with the LXR agonist GW3965 (20 mpk/day) by oral gavage. The TG levels in fractionated plasma were then determined after 6 hr fast. In line with prior studies, treatment of control mice with LXR agonist led to a prominent (95%) increase in plasma VLDL TG levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). By contrast, treatment of L-Lpcat3 KO mice with LXR agonist had a much more modest effect (45% increase). These data suggest that induction of Lpcat3 expression plays an important role in the control of hepatic VLDL production by LXRs.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06557.022</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Lpcat3 is required for LXR-dependent VLDL TG secretion from liver.</title><p>Plasma lipoprotein profile from flox/flox and L-Lpcat3 mice gavaged with LXR agonist GW 3965 (20 mg/kg) for 2 days.

These studies highlight a previously unrecognized requirement for a specific membrane lipid class in lipoprotein metabolism.</p><p>Earlier studies using in vitro systems have demonstrated that changes in polyunsaturated PL can affect membrane-associated biological processes, including the assembly of signalsomes on membranes and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koeberle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pinot et al., 2014</xref>). However, assessing the physiological impact of changing the abundance of individual PL species in animals has been a difficult experimental problem. Our study identifies Lpcat3 as a critical determinant of the abundance of arachidonoyl PLs in mice. The largely preserved levels of other PL species containing polyunsaturated chains in Lpcat3-deficient livers suggests that other Lpcats may be able to catalyze the incorporation of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids into membranes in the absence of Lpcat3. However, Lpcat3 is apparently unique in its ability to catalyze arachidonoyl PL synthesis. Lpcat3-deficient mouse models therefore provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the physiological and pathophysiological consequences of manipulation of membrane phospholipid composition in vivo.</p><p>Previous research has elucidated a requirement for de novo PC biogenesis in the production and secretion of VLDL from liver. Feeding mice a choline-deficient diet or deleting genes involved in de novo PC synthesis (e.g., <italic>Pemt</italic>, <italic>CT</italic>-Î±) impairs VLDL secretion and induces hepatosteatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Noga and Vance, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jacobs et al., 2004</xref>). These models exhibit reduced total apoB protein in plasma as well as lower plasma TGs, suggesting that adequate PC biosynthesis is important for both apoB secretion and VLDL lipidation. In our study, mice lacking Lpcat3 retain the ability to secrete apoB and are capable of producing small poorly-lipidated VLDL particles. However, they are unable to transfer TG to lipoproteins at an appropriate rate in the setting of increased metabolic demand. Our results suggest that the reduced availability of arachidonoyl PLs becomes especially problematic when there is a need to mobilize a large bolus of TG into lipoproteins. For example, when L-Lpcat3 KO mice are challenged with the lipogenic sucrose diet, they are unable to efficiently mobilize the newly synthesized TG into plasma lipoproteins and it instead accumulates in cytosolic lipid droplets in the liver.</p><p>Similarly, mice lacking Lpcat3 in the intestine are unable to handle the high TG load of milk during suckling and accumulate large amounts of lipid in enterocytes. Given that Lpcat3 is the major Lpcat enzyme in enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), loss of Lpcat3 would be expected to impair the re-esterification of LysoPC to PC in enterocytes, which has been demonstrated to be important for lipid absorption. Unfortunately, the early lethality of the I-Lpcat3 KO pups presents a challenge to the analysis of lipid absorption. An inducible knockout system may prove a better model for studying the impact of Lpcat3 on intestinal lipid transport in adult mice.</p><p>Lpcat3 is a integral membrane protein of the ER and is therefore ideally positioned to produce arachidonoyl PC at the site of lipoprotein biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fisher and Ginsberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Our observations suggest that Lpcat3 and its lipid products are likely not essential for the cotranslational lipidation of apoB and the generation of primordial VLDL particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fisher and Ginsberg, 2002</xref>). However, the small size of plasma VLDL particles, together with the reduced TG-rich apoB-containing particles in the Golgi fraction of L-Lpcat3 KO livers, strongly suggest that Lpcat3 impacts the second step of VLDL assemblyâbulk TG addition to lipid-poor apoB particles and the generation of mature VLDL. TG-rich VLDL assembly is highly dependent on the efficient trafficking of stored cytosolic lipid from lipid droplets or newly synthesized lipid to primordial VLDL particles. One factor that could affect this transfer is the membrane environment where the bulk lipidation occurs. Although the precise mechanism that links membrane PL composition and VLDL lipidation is not clear, biophysical studies suggested that greater lipid transport is generally observed with more fluid and highly curved membrane surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lev, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Results from our laurdan staining experiments support the notion that the presence of arachidonoyl PLs in intracellular membranes promotes the dynamics of the membranes. However, detailing these biophysical changes and elucidating how they influence lipid movement will require further study with specialized tools and systems. Nevertheless, our data suggest that membrane dynamics may play an important role in VLDL lipidation in vivo. Interestingly, a recent proteomic study identified Lpcat3 as a component of the VLDL transport vesicle, indicating that Lpcat3 travels with primordial VLDL particles as they bud from the ER and move to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rahim et al., 2012</xref>). Together with prior work, our data favor a model in which Lpcat3 modifies the arachidonoyl-PC composition of both membranes and lipoprotein particles during VLDL assembly, thereby generating a local membrane environment that facilitates lipid transport and bulk lipidation.</p><p>Our prior studies showed that acute shRNA-mediated knockdown of Lpcat3 expression in liver exacerbated ER in the setting of obesity and hepatic steatosis. However, genetic deletion of Lpcat3 expression in liver did not lead to overt ER stress pathway activation, suggesting that increased abundance of monounsaturated PC species (e.g., 16:0, 18:1 PC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) may partially compensate to maintain ER membrane homeostasis. It remains to be determined whether stronger lipotoxic stimuli, such as the hepatosteatosis observed in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, may yet provoke increased ER stress responses in the genetic absence of Lpcat3.</p><p>This work illustrates how manipulation of membrane composition can be used as regulatory mechanism to control metabolic pathways. A model for Lpcat3 action is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>. Lpcat3 is not only a required component of lipoprotein production; it is also a regulated one. The fact that Lpcat3 expression is dynamically regulated by LXRs in liver and intestine strongly suggests that the level of Lpcat3 enzymatic activity has evolved to respond to dietary and metabolic demands. LXR is transcriptionally activated as cellular cholesterol levels rise. Thus, the LXR-Lpcat3 pathway provides a mechanism to integrate sterol metabolism and membrane PL composition. We speculate that Lpcat3 expression is induced in response to lipid loading in order to increase ER/Golgi membrane flexibility and to facilitate efficient TG secretion (thereby unloading cells of excess lipids). In support of this idea, we found that the ability of pharmacologic LXR agonist to stimulate hepatic VLDL production was impaired in the genetic absence of Lpcat3.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06557.023</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of the role of the LXR-Lpcat3 pathway in VLDL lipidation.</title><p>Activation of LXRs promotes the incorporation of arachidonate into intracellular membranes through the induction of Lpcat3 expression.

Abnormal phospholipid metabolism has been associated with several metabolic diseases. For example, lower amounts of polyunsaturated PLs have been observed in liver biopsies from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puri et al., 2007</xref>), and cell membranes from patients with atherosclerotic disease tend to show decreased membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1995</xref>). However, it has heretofore been difficult to draw a causal link between aberrant PL composition and the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. Our studies provide direct evidence that alterations in arachidonoyl PC abundance impair lipoprotein metabolism in liver and intestine in vivo. Recently, a human GWAS reported a highly significant association between <italic>LPCAT3</italic> and the phospholipid composition of red blood cell membranes, indicating that Lpcat3 is also a key regulator of phospholipid composition in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tintle et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, an improved understanding of the mechanisms by which Lpcat3 and arachidonoyl PCs regulate lipid homeostasis could lead to new approaches to metabolic diseases. We speculate that small molecule inhibitors of Lpcat3 could be of potential utility for lowering plasma lipid levels in hyperlipidemic individuals. In pursuing such a strategy, one would need to monitor the impact of Lpcat3 inhibition on liver TG stores, hepatic inflammation and lipid malabsorption, in addition to the plasma lipids. However, modest increases in liver TG stores, even if they occurred in humans, might not doom such a strategy. Inhibiting apoB synthesis with antisense compounds has found a place in the management of some cases of hyperlipidemia, despite modest increases in liver TG stores.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gene expression</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was synthesized, and gene expression was quantified by real-time PCR with SYBR Green (Diagenode, Denville, NJ) and an ABI 7900.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Tobias Walther, has served as a guest Reviewing editor.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers noted the high quality of data, as well as the interesting findings presented. For a number of experiments, the reviewers feel there is a need for clarification.</p><p>First, the interpretation of Lpcat3 deficiency leading to membrane fluidity changes which in turn leads to the observed lipoprotein secretion defects is interesting, but not convincingly and fully shown here. Laurdan staining could reflect other changes in the membrane besides fluidity (curvature, orderâ¦) and it is unclear really how this would lead to the phenotype described. The authors should consider revising this point and elaborate the Discussion. For example, in the Discussion the authors state that lipid changes âincrease membrane fluidity and curvatureâ(does this mean the ER structure changes? Where does the curvature change? How do they know that happens?).</p><p>Second, the experiment fractionating Golgi and microsomes should be quantified and clarified. Was tauro-cholate or another detergent used here? Earlier data from the Olofsson laboratory indicate that in the absence of the detergent significant amounts of apoB lipoproteins associated with inner leaflets of microsomes. This might indicate that the authors in their experiments may select for a subpopulation of particles. It would also be of interest to see whether the ER and Golgi apoB-lipoproteins both were skewed in buoyant density to denser particles in the absence of Lpcat3. While the reviewers agree that most lipid is added to VLDL in the Golgi, it is also possible that there are some larger particles also formed in the ER (as implied by classic EM studies by Bob Hamilton) and they may be similarly affected by Lpcat3 deficiency.Third, since the group has previously suggested that ablation of hepatic Lpcat3 expression promotes inflammatory response and ER stress it is important to address whether these conditions might cause of the phenotype observed in liver-specific Lpcat3 knockout mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06557.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>First, the interpretation of Lpcat3 deficiency leading to membrane fluidity changes which in turn leads to the observed lipoprotein secretion defects is interesting, but not convincingly and fully shown here.

We have responded in two ways. First, we used detergent (0.025% deoxycholic acid) when we isolated the Golgi luminal contents. We have now included these missing details in the Methods. Second, we have added new EM data that directly assess the size of nascent lipoprotein particle in the ER and Golgi. These studies provide definitive support for our conclusion that the particles are less lapidated in the absence of Lpcat3.</p><p><italic>Third, since the group has previously suggested that ablation of hepatic Lpcat3 expression promotes inflammatory response and ER stress it is important to address whether these conditions might cause of the phenotype observed in liver-specific Lpcat3 knockout mice</italic>.</p><p>This was also an excellent point. We do not see prominent induction of ER stress responses in the Lpcat3 KO mice, and we believe that this is related to the difference between the experimental approaches (acute Lpcat3 knockdown vs genetic deletion). We have now added this data to the revised manuscript. We point out that we do in fact observe increased inflammation in the Lpcat3 KO mice in the setting of western diet feeding, and these data are included in the paper. The fact that the lipoprotein production defect is observed in the absence of inflammation (e.g. on chow diet), supports the conclusion that this defect is not secondary to inflammatory changes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
