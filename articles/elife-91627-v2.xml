basal trees. Both trees differentially contribute to the somatic response, defining distinct anatomical and possibly functional sub-units. To elucidate the contribution of each tree to the encoding of visual stimuli at the somatic level, we modeled the response pattern of a mouse L2/3 V1 pyramidal neuron to orientation tuned synaptic input. Towards this goal, we used a morphologically detailed computational model of a single cell that replicates electrophysiological and two-photon imaging data. Our simulations predict a synergistic effect of apical and basal trees on somatic action potential generation: basal tree activity, in the form of either depolarization or dendritic spiking, is necessary for producing somatic activity, despite the fact that most somatic spikes are heavily driven by apical dendritic spikes. This model provides evidence for synergistic computations taking place in the basal and apical trees of the L2/3 V1 neuron along with mechanistic explanations for tree-specific contributions and emphasizes the potential role of predictive and attentional feedback input in these cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>V1</kwd><kwd>pyramidal neuron model</kwd><kwd>dendrites</kwd><kwd>apical tree</kwd><kwd>basal tree</kwd><kwd>L 2/3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>ERC Starting Grant dEMORY</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GA 311435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poirazi</surname><given-names>Panayiota</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>H2020-MSCA ITN 2019, SmartNets</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GA 860949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poirazi</surname><given-names>Panayiota</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Santé a FORTH-Synergy Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EVO-NMDA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poirazi</surname><given-names>Panayiota</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>H2020-FETOPEN-2018-2019-2020-01NEUREKA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GA 863245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poirazi</surname><given-names>Panayiota</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH NEI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 grant EY-024019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smirnakis</surname><given-names>Stelios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>NINDS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 grant NS088457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smirnakis</surname><given-names>Stelios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013209</institution-id><institution>Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Scholarship (no. 6731)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petousakis</surname><given-names>Konstantinos-Evangelos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FORTH-Synergy Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FlexBe</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Papoutsi</surname><given-names>Athanasia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Apical and basal dendrites contribute differently to single-neuron orientation selectivity, highlighting the impact of feedforward and feedback signal interactions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the primary visual cortex (V1), layer 2 and 3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons conform to a stereotypical morphology characterized by separate apical and basal dendritic arbors. The apical tree consists of a thick apical trunk that extends into L1 and splits into an apical tuft. The basal tree consists of numerous dendritic segments, the majority of which sprout directly from the base of the soma, indicating that they can directly influence somatic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spruston, 2008</xref>). This compartmentalization of V1 neurons is also evident in the wiring diagram describing each tree: layer 4 (L4) and L2/3 pyramidal neurons synapse with basal dendrites of L2/3 pyramidal neurons, providing them with feedforward input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Larkum, 2013</xref>). The apical dendrites of the L2/3 pyramidal neurons instead receive feedback input from higher order areas of the cortex such as the secondary and tertiary visual cortices, lateromedial area and prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Larkum, 2013</xref>), as well as orientation-tuned thalamocortical input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cruz-Martín et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roth et al., 2016</xref>). These anatomical and connectivity features of the apical and basal trees, complemented by their distinct biophysical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2008</xref>), shape both the local dendritic processing and the integration of the two input streams at the soma.</p><p>Few studies have undertaken the technically difficult task of measuring single spine tuning properties in the mouse visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iacaruso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jia et al., 2010</xref>). These studies have shown that single spines of L2/3 pyramidal neurons exhibit orientation selectivity, with synaptic orientation preferences varying even on the same branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iacaruso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jia et al., 2010</xref>). These findings raise the question of how dendritic integration of sparse synaptic inputs along the apical and basal trees shape orientation tuning in L2/3 V1 pyramidal neurons.</p><p>The effect of synaptic input on neuronal output depends on the biophysical properties of dendritic branches. Older modeling work has established that blockage of dendritic sodium and NMDA activity leads to impaired or abolished orientation selectivity at the level of the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Archie and Mel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mel et al., 1998</xref>). It is also known that individual dendritic segments of L2/3 neurons generate nonlinear regenerative responses, termed dendritic spikes, independently of the soma, making their exact contribution to somatic output unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). This could indicate that multiple dendritic segments need to be activated in order to generate a spike at the soma. On the other hand, it was recently proposed that strong, sparse inputs to the dendrites are sufficient to drive somatic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goetz et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, although dendritic spikes in the apical tuft of L2/3 V1 pyramidal neurons influence orientation selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2013</xref>), this orientation selectivity is robust to ablation of the apical tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref>). Altogether, the above studies highlight the need to scrutinize the functional effect that synaptic inputs along the basal and apical dendritic arbors have on the soma, building towards a realistic theory of visual processing.</p><p>In this work, we used a detailed biophysical model of a L2/3 V1 pyramidal cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref>), to tease apart the relative contributions of apical vs. basal dendritic trees in somatic orientation tuning. We start by examining the threshold and strength of dendritic non-linearities, which are found to vary along the apical and basal dendrites. By comparing model output to in vivo two-photon calcium fluorescence imaging data, we find that dendritic and somatic spontaneous activity patterns in the model adequately reproduce experimental data. We then simulate orientation tuning in our model and evaluate its responses to specific combinations of dendritic disparity and synaptic distributions. We find that the tuned output of the model does not always match the linear summation of tuned input, instead deviating towards orientation preferences more closely matching either the apical or basal mean orientation preference.</p><p>We continue by evaluating the dependence of somatic spikes on dendritic voltage-gated sodium channel conductances by performing just-in-time interventions that nullify sodium conductance on either the apical or basal tree prior to a somatic spike. We find that the majority of stimulus-driven somatic spiking activity is dependent on sodium spikes generated in the apical tree, suggesting that apical and basal trees contribute via different mechanisms to tuned somatic output. We investigate this further by examining the role of both specific ionic (sodium channels) and synaptic (AMPA/NMDA) mechanisms in shaping orientation tuning. Results indicate that apical sodium channels are critical for proper neuronal tuning, while basal sodium channels do not play as significant a role. Conversely, AMPA and NMDA activity of both the apical and basal trees is required for orientation tuning at the level of the soma. A potential reason for this is that basal dendritic branches feature higher sodium spiking thresholds for similar electrotonic constant-normalized length values (i.e. ‘electrotonic length’) compared to apical branches, reducing their propensity to generate sodium spikes compared to apical dendrites.</p><p>Overall, our simulations suggest a synergistic effect between apical and basal trees, as somatic spikes are only reliably produced when apical dendritic sodium spikes coincide with basal synaptically driven depolarizations and/or spikes. In this manner, apical and basal dendrites contribute to neuronal function using different mechanisms, ionic or synaptic, which together drive action potential generation in this neuronal type.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Model description</title><p>The single neuron model is based on the L2/3 V1 pyramidal cell model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref> created in the NEURON simulation environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hines and Carnevale, 2001</xref>). As the model makes use of a variety of passive and active mechanisms ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2 table3 table4">Tables 1–4</xref>), its electrophysiological properties were validated against experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref>). Neither the morphology nor the biophysical properties of the source model were altered, barring specific ion channel or synaptic mechanism conductance changes wherever specified (see Extended methods for details). Apical stimulus-driven synaptic inputs have had a 10ms delay added, to better reflect experimental data on feedback synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ju et al., 2020</xref>).

Results show that the model can produce realistic dendritic spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>), while the properties of the spiking events vary between dendritic segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Both apical and basal dendritic segments exhibit a large degree of variation in their spiking thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>; threshold synapse count mean and standard deviations: basal 12.286±6.649 sodium, 51.429 ± 13.179 NMDA; apical 14.442 ± 13.825 sodium, 40.721 ± 23.675 NMDA). Dendritic segments with high sodium spiking thresholds also tended to exhibit higher NMDA spiking thresholds. To quantitatively characterize the nonlinear behavior of each dendritic segment we used the Nonlinearity Relative to Linear Extrapolation (NRLE) metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behabadi et al., 2012</xref>), which is an estimate of the degree of non-linear dendritic integration within a specific branch (see Extended methods, Quantification of dendritic nonlinearities). Results indicate that all dendritic segments of the model neuron exhibit non-linear input-output functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, NRLE = 1 denotes linear, NRLE &lt;1 sublinear, and NRLE &gt;1 supralinear), in line with experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the NRLE values are relatively widely dispersed (values ranging from &gt;1 to~3.5), providing a large dynamic range of possible dendrite-level computations. The above results show that there is diversity in apical and basal dendritic integration that can be exploited to modulate orientation tuning. The above differences are, at least in part, due to the morphological and electrophysiological features of dendritic segments, as we found that the sodium spiking propensity varies as a function of dendritic segment volume and electrotonic length (see Figure 5).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dendritic properties of a L2/3 V1 neuron model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical representation of the iterative paired-pulse protocol.

Stimulus driven synapses were modeled with individual orientation preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref>), leading them to exhibit different firing rates depending on the orientation of the presented stimulus (for details, see Extended methods, Model description). As dictated by experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), background-driven synapses comprise the majority of inputs to the model, although they are activated at lower rates than stimulus-driven synapses (see Extended methods, Model description). To validate their impact on somatic output, we compared the simulated spontaneous activity with in vivo calcium two-photon fluorescence imaging data (see Extended methods, Analysis and comparison of true vs “generated” fluorescence data and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>).

We used the disparity protocol, in which the apical and basal trees are tuned to different orientations: the apical tree features synaptic orientation preferences sampled from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0°, whereas the basal tree uses the same method, but with a different mean (0° - 90°, in steps of 10°). The expected orientation preference of the model neuron is calculated using Euler’s Formula, which assumes that synapses contribute to overall orientation preference in a linear fashion (for details, see Extended methods<italic>,</italic> Orientation disparity protocol). We found that the model neuron diverges from the expected orientation preference (linear summation of synaptic inputs) and exhibits a bias towards the preferred orientation of the basal tree. This is an example of <italic>basal dominance</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and was previously observed using the original version of the model used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref>). Of note, the model neuron did not exhibit adequate tuning (i.e. 20% or more of neurons featured OSI &lt;0.2 or tuning width &gt;80°; see Extended methods, Orientation tuning validation protocol) beyond a dendritic disparity of 50°.</p><p>To assess whether this result depends on the particular synaptic distribution used, we repeated the experiment using two different synaptic distribution profiles – the ‘inverse biologically plausible’ (40% on the basal tree, 60% on the apical tree) and ‘even’ (50% on both trees) models (see Extended methods<italic>,</italic> Model description). We found that, indeed, the deviation from expectation displayed by the neuron appears to be decreased in the ‘even’ model, and is clearly reversed in the ‘inverse biologically plausible’ model. Similar to the ‘biologically plausible’ model, these two models did not feature adequate tuning past 50° of dendritic disparity. Overall, the observed deviation from expectation indicates that apical and basal synaptic inputs are not linearly combined, but rather interact in a non-linear manner to produce somatic output. This interaction is influenced by the synaptic distribution along the two dendritic trees, as well as their mean synaptic orientation preferences.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Apical sodium spikes are the primary driver of neuronal output</title><p>The previous results show that orientation tuning emerges from non-linear interactions between apical and basal trees. To elucidate the contribution of each tree in orientation tuning, we selectively interrupt specific aspects of their operation and assess the effect of the intervention on somatic tuning. We start by selectively and precisely modifying the sodium spiking activity of each dendritic tree, while controlling for the type of input received (stimulus-driven vs background-driven). Specifically, we use the ionic intervention protocol (see Extended methods, Ionic intervention protocol) to remove the sodium-induced depolarization that is provided by either the apical or the basal tree, just before the generation of a somatic spike.</p><p>We start by using a control version of the ‘biologically plausible’ model (‘Control background’) and a preferred (0°) stimulus (case #1). In this condition, both stimulus-driven and background-driven synapses are active, and most synapses (60%; both stimulus-driven and background-driven) are allocated on the basal tree. For every somatic spike, we perform the intervention protocol and categorize the spike as either: ‘apically driven’ (dependent on the presence of apical sodium conductances), ‘basally driven’ (dependent on the presence of basal sodium conductances), or ‘cooperative’ (dependent on the presence of both apical and basal sodium conductances; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We find that the majority of somatic spikes are dependent on apical sodium conductance (N=131 spikes; apically driven 76.51 ± 10.21%, basally driven 9.61 ± 5.03%, cooperative 13.89 ± 11.22%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which is surprising, considering the proximity of the basal dendrites to the soma, as well as the salient nature of the feedforward, visually evoked inputs received by the basal tree. These somatic events are a mix of stimulus-driven and background-driven input. In order to separate the two, we changed the orientation of the stimulus being presented to 90° (i.e. orthogonal to the orientation preference of the neuron), rendering the vast majority of stimulus-driven synapses inactive, while keeping background-driven synapses active as normal (case #2).

While firing at low rates (0.11 Hz vs 0.3 Hz for stimulus-driven; see Extended methods, Model description), these synapses are vastly more numerous compared to stimulus-driven synapses (75% vs 25% of total synapses). To test this possibility, we equalized the contribution of background-driven synapses to apical and basal tree outputs, by introducing a new condition (‘Evenly distributed background’) whereby the model is configured as in case #1 (i.e. ‘biologically plausible’ model), but the distribution of <italic>background-driven synapses</italic> is the same on both trees (i.e. excitatory: 50% apical, 50% basal; inhibitory: 46.5% apical, 46.5% basal, 7% soma). In this way, we ensure that the greater proportion of background-driven synapses on the basal tree is no longer a confounding factor. Presenting a stimulus of the preferred orientation (0°) under these conditions (case #3), we find that the resulting percentages (N=156 spikes; apically driven 85.08 ± 7.34%, basally driven 5.15 ± 6.72%, cooperative 9.78 ± 8.17%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) are similar to those seen in case #1, indicating that the distribution of background-driven synapses does not significantly affect somatic spike generation.</p><p>By changing the orientation of the presented stimulus to 90° for this altered model configuration, we can also evaluate whether the same conclusion holds for background-driven spikes (case #4). Indeed, the results (N=42 spikes; apically driven 85.83 ± 29.83%, basally driven 2.5 ± 7.5%, cooperative 1.67 ± 5.0%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) are not significantly different from those seen in case #2. These simulations predict that somatic spike generation reliably depends on apical sodium conductance, a seemingly counterintuitive finding, as feedforward stimulus-driven input reaches mostly the basal tree and not the apical tree.</p><p>To gain more insight into these findings, we looked at the spatiotemporal evolution of voltage through different apical and basal paths during the occurrence of an apically or basally driven spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For heavily branching apical dendrites, input summation and/or voltage propagation in one segment along the path exceeds the sodium spiking threshold, leading to a cascade of dendritic sodium spikes both in the direction of the soma as well as towards any terminal dendrites that did not yet generate sodium spikes of their own (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>; dendritic sodium spiking does not originate from the terminal segment, but propagates to it). The lack of extensive branching on the basal dendrites, on the other hand, renders them less predictable in terms of sodium spiking activity (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although the intervention experiments are required in order to decisively determine the origin of each somatic spike, the temporal precedence of dendritic sodium spiking reliably indicates which tree drives somatic spiking activity (e.g. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C, E, F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Apical and basal dendrites influence somatic tuning via different mechanisms</title><p>The previous results are counter-intuitive: although we would expect both apical and basal dendritic segments to contribute to somatic spiking, the contribution of the apical tree overshadows that of the basal tree, at least with respect to the role of sodium conductances. However, as indicated by our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the basal tree, being the bearer of the majority of feedforward inputs, has a dominant role in orientation tuning. Thus, we assume that the basal tree exerts its influence via a different mechanism. To assess the veracity of this assumption, we performed a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the impact of ionic (see Extended methods<italic>,</italic> Sodium (channel) blockage and Ionic intervention protocol) and synaptic (see Extended methods<italic>,</italic> Synaptic modulation, Input manipulation and Synaptic intervention protocol) mechanisms on neuronal orientation tuning, using the biologically plausible model (see Extended methods, Stimulation protocol).</p><p>First, we assess the tuning characteristics of the neuron when stimulus-driven input is removed from either the apical or the basal tree (see Extended methods, sectionInput manipulation), and compare it with the control case.

For a decrease of 5%, we found that elimination of the apical but not the basal sodium component results in total loss of tuning (dependent two-sample t-test, control vs basal p-value: 0.32549). Importantly, in this scenario the apical tree remains the primary driver of somatic activity as the majority of somatic spikes are apically driven (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> N=345 spikes; 60 ± 15% of spikes are apically driven, 30 ± 18% are basally driven, and 10 ± 8% of spikes are cooperatively driven, for details on the characterization of spiking activity, see Results, Apical sodium spikes are the primary driver of neuronal output). However, a 10% decrease in the apical sodium conductance results in total loss of tuning when either the apical or the basal sodium component is eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In this case, a large number of spikes are completely lost (N=190 spikes vs 345), and out of the remainder, 41 ± 25% are apically driven, 48 ± 28% are basally driven, and 11 ± 12% are cooperatively driven. We further compare these two conditions (5% and 10% reduction) with one where the apical sodium conductance is unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> identical to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Similarly to the results seen in the 5% reduction, elimination of the apical – but not the basal – sodium component results in total loss of tuning (dependent two-sample t-test, control vs basal p-value: 0.24125). In this case, 80 ± 9% of spikes are apically driven, 13 ± 8% are basally driven, and 7 ± 4% of spikes are cooperatively driven. Notably, the number of spikes is drastically higher in this condition (N=885 spikes in the unchanged condition vs. N=345 for the 5% reduction and N=190 for the 10% reduction).</p><p>The above simulations show that, as expected, the reduction in apical sodium conductance results in a decrease of the overall spiking rate of the neuron (number of spikes: 885 in the unchanged condition, 345 for the 5% reduction, and 190 for the 10% reduction). Even so, decreasing apical sodium conductance by 5% failed to negate its role in somatic spike generation, with the apical tree remaining the primary contributor (60 ± 15% of spikes were apically driven vs 30 ± 18% basally driven; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A decrease of 10%, however, exerts greater influence as an ever-larger number of apically driven spikes are lost, shifting the percentages to a more even distribution between apically driven and basally driven (41 ± 25% vs 48 ± 28%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Of note, in this particular case the neuronal firing rate is well below the experimentally relevant range, suggesting that such a reduction is not physiological (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Overall, our sensitivity analysis suggests a greater-than-expected contribution of apical sodium non-linearities in somatic spike generation. This finding is in line with experimental work showing that L2/3 V1 neurons can produce spikes even in the absence of feedforward (i.e. basal stimulus-driven) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Keller et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our simulations predict that apical sodium channels are necessary for both spike generation in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) as well as for orientation tuning in particular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Additionally, AMPA and NMDA activity is necessary for both apical and basal trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). This means that the apical tree most likely exerts its influence on somatic spiking via sodium-mediated spiking, whereas the basal tree mostly utilizes AMPA- and NMDA-driven depolarizations, rather than sodium spikes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Tree-specific morphological and electrophysiological properties influence dendritic and somatic behavior</title><p>Our simulations predict that apical and basal dendritic segments exert causal influence on somatic spike generation via separate mechanisms.

Once again, however, we observe unusual attenuation values for basal dendritic segment #3 (all basal dendritic segments: 49.72±24.3 mV, outlier: –8.308 mV, basal dendritic segments excluding outlier: 59.4±5.8 mV), caused by additional current provided by its child branches that feature much lower sodium spiking thresholds (6 synapses for child branches vs 19 synapses for parent branch; see <italic>Extended methods,</italic> Relationship of branch order and distance with signal attenuation for details).

However, the threshold for inducing sodium spikes in apical dendritic segments is significantly smaller compared to basal dendritic segments of similar electrotonic length (most likely due to the proximity of the soma, causing a ‘current sink’ effect for basal dendrites), making it easier to drive such spikes in the apical compared to the basal tree. These findings provide a more intuitive explanation of the greater role of sodium conductances in the apical vs. basal trees of our model neuron.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we used a detailed computational model to delineate the dendritic constituents of neuronal computation in L2/3 V1 pyramidal cells. We found that the model exhibits a wide range of non-linear behavior at the dendritic segment level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and can mimic the activity patterns of neurons under spontaneous conditions in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The model neuron exhibits robust orientation tuning in response to tuned input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and under conditions of dendritic disparity, the model still remains robustly tuned (OSI &lt;0.2 and tuning width &gt;80°) for non-extreme dendritic disparity conditions (disparity ≤50°). Importantly, the neuronal orientation preference deviates from the expected one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>), indicating that apical and basal inputs interact in non-linear ways. This bias is dependent on the distribution of synaptic inputs along the two trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>), it follows the preference of basal tree inputs under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and is in line with prior work, whereby apical tree ablation had no impact on somatic orientation preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref>). Remarkably, while the above would seem to suggest a minor role for apical inputs in the orientation preference of our model cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), we found that the orientation tuning of the neuron is greatly affected by sodium conductances in the apical – but not the basal – tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, while basal sodium channel conductances are not critically important (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), AMPA and NMDA conductances are necessary in both dendritic trees for orientation tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). This indicates that depolarizations from the basal tree play a key role in shaping neuronal output, even when basal sodium spikes do not. As such, neuronal output is a synergistic phenomenon mostly between apical sodium spikes and basal depolarizations or sodium spikes. Our simulations suggest that a form of <italic>intra-tree dendritic cooperativity</italic> – a synergistic effect between apical and basal dendritic segments that exhibit activity in relative synchrony – might be present in these neurons. This is supported by the existence of extinction-prone ‘cooperative’ somatic spikes that are lost when either of their dendritic components (apical or basal, be that depolarization or spiking) is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Additional evidence is provided by the experiments in which removal or suppression (decrease in conductance) of basal stimulus-driven synapses (i.e. only background-driven synapses are fully active) significantly decreases the quality of orientation tuning (i.e. OSI values) in the model neuron, or abolishes tuning altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>).</p><p>A potential explanation for the differential contributions of apical and basal dendrites lies with their morphological and electrophysiological properties. Despite featuring a uniform sodium conductance throughout both dendritic trees, basal dendrites have higher sodium spiking thresholds than apical dendrites with similar electrotonic length values. Moreover, apical dendrites have highly variable spiking thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This is likely because the soma acts as a current sink, effectively increasing the sodium spiking threshold of all soma-proximal branches (mostly basal dendrites). Meanwhile, the majority of apical dendrites feature much better electrical isolation from the soma due to distance and branching, and are as such exempt from such current sink effects, instead only suffering a loss of current from other connected apical dendritic branches. As such, they exhibit a much greater range of possible thresholds compared to basal dendrites of similar volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), while simultaneously featuring greater signal attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, E</xref>). Put together, these results indicate that apical dendrites overcome their signal attenuation deficit (compared to basal dendrites) by having a greater propensity for dendritic sodium spike generation for different amounts of input. This suggests that sodium spikes are more difficult to induce in basal compared to apical dendrites, offering a potential explanation as to why apical sodium conductances contribute more to somatic output.</p><p>Taken together, our model predicts that somatic output in L2/3 V1 pyramidal neurons is likely to be determined through <italic>Bimodal Input Coincidence</italic>, a subcategory of coincidence detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Specifically, we propose that the basal tree receives visual feedforward input, representing the information therein as a series of hyperpolarizations, depolarizations, and occasional dendritic spikes. Thus, visual input creates a basal ‘backdrop’ of depolarizations that represents visual information. At the same time, predictive and attentional signals from higher-order cortical areas reach the apical tree of the neuron, causing the generation of dendritic spikes that propagate to the soma and are temporally summed with any concurrent basal depolarization. In the event that visual input is non-existent, or of a non-preferred orientation, the depolarization is minimal to none. Thus, the apical dendritic spike will not be significantly augmented through summation and will fail to produce a somatic response in the majority of cases. If there is visual input, however, especially of an orientation matching the preferred orientation of the basal tree, the aforementioned ‘backdrop’ will include multiple subthreshold depolarizations, perhaps even dendritic spikes. The apical dendritic spikes are thus likely to be temporally summed with these depolarizations and generate a somatic spike. As such, even though most somatic spikes will be generated through an apical tree dendritic spike, the cases in which this is possible in the first place will be dictated by the backdrop of depolarizations (and/or spikes) provided by the basal tree.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Graphical representation of AP generation via bimodal Input coincidence in a L2/3 V1 pyramidal neuron model.</title><p>Action potential generation requires the spatiotemporal coincidence of apical sodium spikes with either basal sodium spikes or significant basal depolarizations, allowing the neuron to respond to salient stimuli that may or may not be affected by attentional and/or predictive signals from higher-order areas.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91627-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The findings presented here propose a more central role for the apical tree than previously suggested. Specifically, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref>, we found that orientation selectivity was not abolished by in vivo laser ablation of the apical tree in L2/3 mouse V1 pyramidal neurons, remaining essentially unchanged following a recovery period of ~1 day. Importantly, the model pr‘sented here reproduces the in vivo ablation findings of the aforementioned study (see Extended methods, Ablation protocol; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). What is seen as a contradiction is resolved by considering that in both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref> and the simulations presented here, apical dendrite ablation is assumed to be accompanied by homeostatic alterations that counteract the increase in input resistance from the loss of the apical tree. These homeostatic mechanisms keep the firing rate of the neuron the same pre- and post-ablation, as seen experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, the neuron can potentially compensate for the loss of input from one of its dendritic trees via homeostatic mechanisms that amplify the effect of synaptic inputs on the other tree, an approach followed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mel et al., 1998</xref> in their efforts to demonstrate that V1 L5 pyramidal neurons were capable of exhibiting orientation tuned responses through either apical or basal inputs. Thus, the contribution of the apical tree to somatic spiking in the intact neuron can be obviated by homeostatic mechanisms following apical tree ablation.</p><p>Our findings suggest that L2/3 V1 pyramidal cells may perform salient feature extraction from visual input compatible with predictive coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>). When top-down signals reflecting attentional or predictive processes reach the apical tree, they ‘highlight’ appropriate parts of the signal ‘landscape’ generated by the visual input reaching the basal trees through the generation of apical dendritic sodium spikes. This could result in a neuron that is activated only when specific features are present in its receptive field, facilitating the processing of salient stimuli. Such phenomena have been observed experimentally as a result of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Simons and Chabris, 1999</xref>).</p><p>However, this work also suffers from a number of limitations. Our findings are inherently bound to the particular characteristics of the simulated morphology. To ensure their generality, further exploration of different neuronal morphologies of L2/3 V1 neurons is required. However, given that our findings correlate with specific anatomical and electrophysiological features of the model neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), it would be possible to infer whether the behavior we observe in our model could be present in other neuronal morphologies as well. In addition, while repeating our analysis using other morphologies is beyond the scope of this study (validating model function and performing the extensive parameter exploration reported here is highly resource-intensive), our code and all analysis scripts are made publicly available, allowing interested scientists to apply our approach to other morphologies. The sensitivity analysis that we added in Sensitivity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) also further establishes the robustness of our findings within biologically relevant ranges of ionic conductances. We have taken all these steps in order to more conclusively demonstrate that our findings are likely to generalize to other L2/3 V1 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, our model is limited by the lack of data on dendritic features such as signal attenuation and distribution of ion channel conductances. However, this has been counteracted at least to some extent by the use of experimental data (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>) and the sensitivity analysis, which demonstrates that our conclusions are robust to biologically relevant variations of the key conductances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). It should be noted, however, that there could be multiple ‘solutions’ to the problem of model validation, that is multiple different sets of values for the model parameters that yield the desired output. As such, we cannot be absolutely certain that our particular configuration of parameter values is correct, although this is an issue faced by all models in general, and not exclusive to this work.</p><p>Additionally, the single-neuron model sacrifices much of the complexity found in the actual L2/3 network, particularly certain input features. First, we do not simulate in vivo-like input patterns, due to a lack of data. Instead, we use randomly generated Poisson spike trains, which are widely used in the field. Also, in our model, inhibitory inputs are not patterned according to different interneuron subtypes and are background-driven, lacking tuning and featuring firing rates lower than stimulus-driven excitatory synapses. A similar complexity loss is incurred by using a relatively simple stimulation protocol, compared to the alternating stimulation of the ‘drifting gradient’ protocol that is more widely used. Additionally, the model does not account for retinotopically shifted inhibitory inputs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rossi et al., 2020</xref>). Retinotopic shift in inhibitory inputs would not affect our results, since stimulation is implicitly assumed to only take place at the center of the receptive field of the model neuron, a fact which would render any retinotopically offset neurons quiescent. Finally, although inhibitory inputs could be biased towards one dendritic tree over the other, the overall effect of such an imbalance would be a change in the net amount of excitation received by each tree – a scenario which we already explore in part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), finding tuning and somatic spike generation to be generally unaffected. The omission of these features that were unlikely to influence the presence or absence of orientation tuning was performed in an attempt to reduce the complexity (and thus computational requirements) of the model.</p><p>In terms of questions that still need to be answered, the exact nature of the attentional and predictive signals received by the apical tree remains to be deciphered. Secondly, the formation of the visual ‘backdrop’ as a result of basal tree depolarization merits further study. Encoding of visual information using mostly subthreshold depolarizations in the presence of noise is an interesting problem, possibly resolved through the effects of intra-tree dendritic cooperativity, where apical spikes sharpen responses to stimulus-driven input rather than noise, improving the signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poleg-Polsky, 2019</xref>). In addition, a number of differences emerge when comparing the visual system across different model species. In rodents, orientation-selective cells akin to V1 simple cells have been discovered in the thalamus itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scholl et al., 2013</xref>), and direct thalamocortical projections to L1 of V1 have also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roth et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, rodent V1 organization follows a dispersed salt-and-pepper motif, unlike the highly structured organization typical of higher mammals like primates and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ohki and Reid, 2007</xref>). These differences are important to take into account when trying to infer general rules of function from information derived from rules of information processing in different animal models. Finally, perhaps the most interesting unanswered question is whether these computations take place elsewhere in the cortex in addition to the visual system. Predictive coding as a means of stimulus compression has already been proposed as a way to simplify visual perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>), and this might also be the case for other sensory or cognitive tasks. Larger-scale models of the visual system, featuring realistic input structure and properties, will most likely be required to explore these phenomena in depth. Regardless, further investigation is required in order to unravel the Gordian knot that is visual perception.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-91627-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The code used to create the figures of this manuscript is publicly available in GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kepetousakis/petousakis_etal_2023">https://github.com/kepetousakis/petousakis_etal_2023</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petousakis, 2023</xref>).

sec-type="appendix" id="s8-1"><title>Model description</title><p>The single neuron model was derived from the L2/3 V1 pyramidal cell model of created in the NEURON simulation environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hines and Carnevale, 2001</xref>). It is a morphologically detailed reconstruction, featuring 43 apical dendritic segments, 7 basal dendritic segments and an axon. As the model makes use of a variety of passive and active mechanisms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2 table3 table4">Tables 1–4</xref>), its electrophysiological properties were validated against experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref>). Neither the morphology nor the biophysical properties of the source model were altered, barring specific ion channel or synaptic changes where explicitly specified.</p><p>The model features both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. Excitatory input was subdivided into background-driven (noise) and stimulus-driven, the latter consisting of orientation-tuned synapses. Inhibitory synapses are modeled as background-driven (inhibitory noise) which alongside background-driven excitatory synapses (excitatory noise) comprise the background-driven inputs. Stimulus-driven and background-driven synaptic input to the neuron is distributed uniformly on the target compartments using a density of 2 synapses per μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Defelipe and Fariñas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schuz and Palm, 1989</xref>). Activation of synapses occurs via pseudo-randomly generated Poisson spike trains. Background-driven and stimulus-driven synapses feature different peak Poisson activation frequencies (0.11 Hz and 0.3 Hz, respectively) to produce the electrophysiologically recorded firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref>). Stimulus-driven synapses feature variable activation frequencies, with a maximum of 0.3 Hz, based on the angular distance of the stimulus from the preferred orientation of each individual synapse. Unlike the original model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2019</xref>, apical stimulus-driven synaptic inputs have had a 10ms delay added, to better reflect experimental data on feedback synaptic inputs in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ju et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We modulate the proportion of stimulus-driven excitatory synapses on the apical versus the basal tree in various experiments in order to examine the effects of synaptic input distribution on somatic output. In all cases, the amount of inhibition at the soma is 7% of the total inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Defelipe et al., 2002</xref>). The default synapse distribution was 40% apical to 60% basal (“biologically plausible model”), in adherence with experimental data (excitation: 40% apical, 60% basal; inhibition: 33% apical, 60% basal, 7% soma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Defelipe et al., 2002</xref>). The ‘inverse biologically plausible’ model, conversely, features a 60% apical to 40% basal distribution (excitation: 60% apical, 40% basal; inhibition: 55.8% apical, 37.2% basal, 7% soma). The ‘even’ model features a balanced distribution of synaptic input across both trees (even: excitation: 50% apical, 50% basal; inhibition: 46.5% apical, 46.5% basal, 7% soma). The synaptic distribution of the ‘even’ and ‘inverse biologically relevant’ models are not derived by experimental data, yet they allow for the investigation of apical and basal tree interactions under conditions of balanced or imbalanced synaptic input. We also make use of other distributions biased in either the apical or basal direction (referring to stimulus-driven excitatory input; from 10% basal – 90% apical to 90% basal – 10% apical, in steps of 10%). Similar to above, background-driven synapses closely follow the stimulus-driven synapse distribution in these cases, except for background inhibition, which always features 7% allocated to the soma.</p><p>In our model, orientation preference was assigned on two levels: synaptic (input/single synapse) and dendritic (whole tree). Single synapse orientation preference is modeled as a synaptic weight vector biased towards a predefined (preferred) orientation, which also factors into the activation frequency of orientation-tuned synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Each synapse is assigned an orientation preference, with values being 0° to 360° in steps of 10°. This distribution of orientation preferences to the stimulus-driven synapses at the dendritic tree level followed a Gaussian probability density function wrapped around the unit circle:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where W is the standard deviation (30°; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), s is the synaptic orientation preference and b is the mean of the distribution (apical or basal tree mean orientation preference, ranging from 0° to 90° in steps of 10°). The parameter k controls the wrapping around the unit circle, and takes the values [-1,–0.5, 0, 0.5, 1]. As a result, the mean orientation preference of each dendritic tree is biased towards the chosen mean orientation preference. By implementing excitatory stimulus-driven connectivity in this way, we also emulate the ‘like-to-like’ connectivity motifs seen in vivo (as seen in e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rossi et al., 2020</xref>), as (virtual) presynaptic neurons with orientation preferences close to the mean orientation preference of the model neuron are more likely to connect to it, due to being over-represented in the overall pool of possible synapses.

At t<sub>i</sub> – 3ms, g<sub>Na</sub> is set to 0 on either the apical or basal tree dendrites in two separate simulations, until t<sub>i</sub> +1ms. This manipulation selectively eliminates the contribution of apical or basal dendritic sodium conductances (seen either as depolarization or as dendritic spikes) to the somatic spike. This protocol is repeated for all somatic spikes and the ensuing voltage traces are analyzed to ascertain whether the somatic spikes survived the manipulation. Spikes rendered extinct only when intervening on the apical tree are labeled as ‘apically driven’, while those rendered extinct when intervening on the basal tree are labeled as ‘basally driven’. The spikes rendered extinct by either intervention are labeled as ‘cooperative’.

As the NMDA spike exhibits a voltage plateau, 2 or more inflection points indicate an NMDA spike. As our voltage measurements are not continuous and the I3P protocol does not feature noise, it is unlikely to encounter a measurement point at which the second derivative is exactly zero.

Using the same approach, we measured the fraction of somatic-dendritic event pairs in our model and compared them to the in vivo data.

Paired events separated by more than 4 recording frames (~552ms) are highly unlikely to be the result of backpropagation, even when considering the slow kinetics of the calcium sensor. Moreover, the somatic events that are preceded by basal dendritic events are similar in proportion between datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>, red bins: 48.79% model, 48.12% actual when including all event pairs with a non-zero timing difference; 24.3% model, 27.8% actual when including only event pairs with an absolute timing difference &gt;4 recording frames).</p><p>To mitigate the risk that the in vivo findings are the result of noise or random chance, we constructed a null distribution of timing differences for the in vivo data by independently circularly shuffling the time-series data from the somatic and various dendritic segment ROIs 1000 times, and then re-computed the timing differences. We then compared the actual data with the null distribution data using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, finding that the two distributions of timing differences were significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>; test statistic ~0.105, p&lt;&lt;0.05), whereas a similar analysis of completely randomly generated event timings would results in identical (not statistically different) distributions for event pair timing differences. It is important to note that the analyses herein are inherently subject to the noisy nature of the recordings, the limitations of the slow kinetics of the calcium indicator, the low temporal resolution of the recording (frame time of ~138ms), as well as the possibility of undetected events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-8"><title>Electrotonic length calculation</title><p>The electrotonic lengths of all dendritic segments were calculated using the formula from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van Elburg and van Ooyen, 2010</xref>:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:msqrt></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where i refers to the dendritic segment, λ<sub>i</sub> is the electrotonic constant, b<sub>i</sub> is the radius of the branch, r<sub>m</sub> is the specific membrane resistance and r<sub>a</sub> is the intracellular resistivity.

Only one dendritic branch received inputs each time, and somatic (but not dendritic) sodium channels had their conductance set to zero in order to accurately measure signal attenuation. After measuring the attenuation of this EPSP or spike at the soma, we attempted to describe it as a function of different morphological and electrophysiological parameters by dividing the attenuation observed at the soma by the corresponding value of the parameter for the given dendritic branch. The parameters used were dendritic length, dendritic diameter, distance of dendritic segment from the soma, dendritic volume, dendritic path volume (defined as the sum of the volumes of all dendritic segments linking the given dendrite with the soma, including the volume of the given dendrite) and dendritic electrotonic length (see Electrotonic length calculation). Values can then be compared across dendrite types (apical vs basal) for each parameter by performing Welch’s t-test. We also performed a similar analysis using the dendritic sodium spiking threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>) instead of dendritic signal attenuation, with the same morphological and electrophysiological parameters as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). To ensure fairness of comparisons, we excluded from these analyses any dendrites belonging to the apical trunk (4/43 apical dendritic segments), any apical dendrites with atypical properties (4/43 apical dendritic segments featuring a relatively high sodium spiking threshold for their morphology, produced as a side-effect of the 3d reconstruction; lengths: 16.2±10.5 μm; diameters: 0.711±0.027 μm), as well as any apical dendrites whose value for the parameter under examination was outside 3 standard deviations of the basal dendrite mean for the same parameter.

We excluded basal dendritic segment #3 (root branch of the bifurcating basal dendrite) from some analyses, since it yielded extremely low or even negative attenuation values because of additional current received from its much more excitable child branches (sodium spiking thresholds: 6 for child branches vs 19 for parent branch, basal dendritic segment #3; EPSP attenuation values: all basal dendritic segments: 12.69±4.04 mV, outlier: 5.11 mV, basal dendritic segments excluding outlier: 13.96±2.8 mV; spike attenuation values: all basal dendritic segments: 49.72±24.3 mV, outlier: –8.308 mV, basal dendritic segments excluding outlier: 59.4±5.8 mV).

This is a relevant question because basal and apical dendrites receive different qualitatively different classes of inputs: feedforward inputs favour basal dendrites whereas feedback inputs preferentially target apical dendrites. Understanding the rules by which these two dendritic fields interact at the level of single neurons is therefore useful for understanding and predicting how different information streams might be integrated by cortical neurons. Here, the authors take a compartmental modelling approach. Using a previously established model of a layer 2/3 pyramidal cell, they systematically vary some of the model parameters to explore and quantify how much apical and basal dendrites contribute to the generation of somatic spikes when synaptic input is tuned to orientation. The main conclusion is that both apical and basal contribute to spiking, with the apical contribution depending more on sodium conductances and the basal contribution depending mostly on AMPA and NMDA receptors. This conclusion is well supported by the data and the parameter exploration presented will be useful to the field. While the data come from a compartmental model, attempts to understand the biophysical basis of the phenomena described are limited and often not grounded in the current knowledge of cortical neuron biophysics. This aspect of the manuscript could be significantly expanded.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The main strength of this paper is the systematic variation of parameters such as synapse distribution and background activity, and the subsequent quantification of the effect of changing these parameters on somatic spiking. The disparity experiments are interesting, especially for seeing when orientation selectivity breaks down, and extend the modelling results presented in Park et al. 2019. The temporally precise manipulations of conductances and direct spike-by-spike comparison between control and manipulation conditions is a new and nice approach that should be useful for future studies. Another potential strength is the attempt to match the background activity observed in vivo, though this effort has significant weaknesses.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Most of the results in the paper describe the behavior of the model when a set of parameters are changed. While this is useful information, the major strength of a model is that it should be possible to understand exactly why model behaves the way it does, but the authors do not make a serious attempt at this. Why do apical dendrites rely more on sodium conductances to influence somatic spiking? Why do basals rely more on AMPA and NMDA conductances? What exactly is different in terms of the spatiotemporal patterns of inputs and voltage propagation across the neuron during &quot;apical&quot;, &quot;basal&quot; and &quot;cooperative&quot; somatic spikes? The risk here is that the model behavior might only be valid for a restricted set of parameters (eg: density and distribution of conductances, most of which are not known experimentally), and thus the generality of the findings might be limited. Understanding the biophysics should allow for deriving general rules for the problem studied here and more robust conclusions.</p><p>Figure 6 is a step in this direction, but it mostly shows that the number of synapses to reach threshold increases with cable diameter and decreases with distance from soma, which is well known (ie: where the passive and active properties of the cable are uniform, as they are here, the result is explained by the differences in input impedance). The lack of granularity is well illustrated in the title of section 3.6.: &quot;Morphological and Electrophysiological Properties Influence Dendritic Behavior&quot; – indeed they do, this is very well known. But how exactly in this model? Overall, I would have expected a more thorough analysis of the relationships between voltage propagation, morphology, and synaptic activation pattern. For example, could the main results here be explained by fast sodium spikes being more heavily filtered by the basal dendrites (which tend to have a shorter spatial constant, eg : Nevian et al. 2007), which would also explain the higher dependency of the basals on NMDA conductances, which are slower and therefore less filtered? Or are there differences in the relationship between synaptic input patterns and the generation of local non-linearities between basals and apicals?</p><p>The attempt to use experimental calcium imaging data to estimate background activity is nice, but the data are not very convincing. In Figure 2C, most of the isolated dendritic events look like noise. I realise that the event-triggered average shown in 3D suggests that there is some real signal being analysed, but I suspect that it is heavily contaminated by noise, and that the authors are grossly over-estimating the frequency of decoupled dendritic events. The method details of the analysis procedure are also worrying: &quot;These percentile values were calculated via trial-and-error, attempting to match the expected firing frequency of a neuron (soma) under spontaneous activity conditions&quot;. What is the rationale here? The goal should be to detect the real events in the data, not changing the detection parameters until the result matches a previous publication. Also, if in the end the goal was to obtain the same value as other studies, it is unclear why the experiment was needed in the first place.</p><p>1. The authors propose that in Figure 1 they are validating their modelling approach, but it is unclear what exactly is being validated here. The figure shows that dendrites with sodium channels and AMPA/NMDA synapses can generate non-linear input-output curves, which is very much a guaranteed finding – in a model with reasonable passive parameters and morphology (which is the case here since model that has been previously validated against experimental data), I don't see how the result could be any different. Please clarify.</p><p>2. Line 587: figure call is wrong, should be 4A (same for the subsequent call)</p><p>3. In Figure 6 it is not clear why the results in panel C are qualitatively different that in A. Rm and Ra are presumably uniform, so the electrotonic constant is a transform of the dendritic diameter. Please explain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Petousakis et al. describes a modeling study of a pyramidal neuron in the Layer 2/3 (L2/3) of mouse primary visual cortex V1. The authors use a biophysically detailed, spatially extended model of the neuron, with voltage-gated conductances in the soma, basal dendrites, and apical dendrites to investigate how inputs to basal and apical dendrites sculpt the activity of the neuron and the corresponding major computation that L2/3 excitatory cells presumably carry out – that of orientation detection. The authors report a number of computational experiments and conclude that inputs to basal and apical dendrites synergistically sculpt the orientation selectivity of the neuron.</p><p>While the premise is interesting, the study, and especially the model architecture, relied on a number of assumptions that limit the interpretability of the outcomes.</p><p>1. The whole study is based on a single model of one neuron. This is a model from Park et al., Nature Communications, 2019, which in turn is based upon other previously published models (e.g., the supplementary tables 2-4 in this manuscript are copied from the Park et al. paper). Park et al. already showed how one can get orientation selectivity with this neuron model and how it can be manipulated by ablating apical and basal dendrites.</p><p>2. There is a lot of data on function-dependent connectivity for L2/3 excitatory neurons that sculpts orientation selectivity, but the authors do not mention even the most prominent of the papers in this area. First, it has been shown that excitatory connections are like-to-like (with respect to orientation and/or direction preference), in papers such as Ko et al., Nature, 2011; Cossell et al., Nature, 2015; Lee et al., Nature, 2016; Wertz et al., Science, 2015; Rossi et al., Nature, 2020. Second, there are indications that inhibitory connections are also structured non-randomly with respect to neuron tuning properties (Znamensky et al., biorXiv, 2018). And Rossi et al., Nature, 2020, showed that inhibitory inputs to L2/3 E neurons form a pool that's shifted retinotopically relative to the pool of excitatory inputs. None of these features of connectivity are taken into account by the presented model. It is possible that a model with these known biological features would lead to different conclusions.</p><p>In fact, the results presented here contradict the results from the same group of authors published in Park et al., 2019, as they point out in Discussion:</p><p>&quot;in vivo micro-ablation via laser of the apical tree in L2/3 mouse V1 pyramidal neurons did not abolish orientation selectivity, which remained essentially unchanged following a recovery period of ~ 1 day.&quot;</p><p>The authors explain this contradiction by potential homeostatic mechanisms &quot;that might alter the dependence of somatic spiking on basal inputs&quot;. But given the points above, it seems equally likely that a more realistic model would have produced these effects. Since this observation is available from in vivo data, why not use it to constrain the model? That seems like the most natural thing to do, and I suspect modeling results with respect to the factors contributing to orientation selectivity would be then quite different.</p><p>3. Modeling inhibitory synapses as just noise, without any orientation tuning, is a limitation. Inhibitory neurons certainly show orientation tuning.</p><p>4. Overall, using constant-rate Poisson process for all synapses is suboptimal. Cortical neurons generally exhibit log-normal distributions of firing rates, meaning that a single rate for all inputs of a given type is far from realistic. Also, feedback inputs are typically delayed relative to feedforward inputs by about 10 ms; that would be important to take into account.</p><p>5. Orientation-tuned synapses should certainly exhibit different amounts of activity for different orientations. Here, synapses are always activated at 0.3 Hz, and their orientation preference is modeled by changing their weight depending on orientation. That is unrealistic. It is the presynaptic activity that changes depending on the orientation, and not the synaptic weight. (Weights can change due to plasticity, but the authors ignore plasticity here, and plasticity can work in either direction – depressing or facilitating – depending on the cell types.)</p><p>Some of the points above may seem like minor details, but they are not – consequences of such choices can be substantial. Such assumptions establish the correlation structure of synaptic inputs that is very different from what we know to happen in reality. Since the authors are investigating fine details of neuronal operation, including coincidence of basal and apical inputs, such effects are likely important for their study.</p><p>1. Both this manuscript and Park et al. compare the model voltage response to a somatic current injection with that from experiment (for a single cell), but no evidence is provided that electrophysiological properties of dendrites are captured well. In other words, we have no idea if currents and voltages in dendrites in response to synaptic inputs, local current injections, or somatic spikes or current injections, are captured well by the model. Capturing such properties well seems very important for the subject of the study, so, in the absence of a proof that it's working well, it is hard to trust any results from the model.</p><p>2. It's not clear why background-driven synapses all have the same activation frequency. Inhibitory synapses should be activated with higher rates, since many inhibitory neurons, especially PV fast-spiking neurons, fire at substantially higher rates than excitatory cells. The rates, 0.11 Hz for spontaneous and 0.3 Hz for orientation tuned inputs, seem too low. It is also not clear whether all synapses receive inputs from just two Poisson processes, or each synapse receives input from its own Poisson process. The former obviously creates unphysiological correlations between synapses, whereas the latter provides no correlations, which is also incorrect (it is well known that activity of neurons in the cortex is correlated – not perfectly, but substantially). Some middle ground informed by the data would be better than either of these extremes. While it may seem like an unimportant detail, in fact it is hugely important for the topic of the study, since correlations between incoming spikes will strongly influence the dendritic processing and coincidence detection.</p><p>3. Another big problem with using Poisson spike trains to simulate orientation selectivity is that it completely ignores the spatial structure of the stimulus. The model used only has stronger or weaker input depending on the orientation, but it's always Poisson random input. In reality, a neuron exposed, say, to a drifting grating, will be subject to alternating black and white stripes, which strongly modulate firing. The resulting firing pattern typically has periods when spikes follow each other in close succession and periods when there are barely any spikes at all. This temporal structure of synaptic activation, reflecting the spatial structure of the stimulus and retinotopic distribution of presynaptic neurons, is very likely to have strong effects on the postsynaptic neuron output and phenomena like dendritic integration.</p><p>I understand that my comments will be disappointing to the authors, and I am sorry for that. But I hope the comments might be helpful for their future work, and I am sure their approach will continue providing new interesting insights.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91627.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

To address it, we have performed several new simulations and analyses in order to provide explanations for our findings. Specifically, we performed a detailed statistical analysis whereby we link the morphological and electrophysiological characteristics of apical vs. basal dendrites to biophysical properties such as: (1) signal attenuation measured at the soma (both for subthreshold EPSPs and dendritic sodium spikes) and (2) the number of synapses (threshold) required to induce dendritic sodium spikes. This analysis focused at explaining why apical dendrites have a larger contribution to somatic output compared to basal dendrites, when considering sodium spikes (Figures 3 and 4). The results (see Section 3.5), shown in two new figures (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 8) revealed that signal attenuation is greater in apical than basal dendrites with similar anatomical characteristics. This is expected due to their highly branching structure and overall larger distance from the soma. Thus, signal attenuation cannot explain the higher contribution of apical dendrites to somatic output. However, the threshold for inducing sodium spikes in apical vs. basal dendrites (of similar anatomical characteristics) is significantly lower, making it easier to induce sodium spikes in the apical compared to the basal tree. This is due to the current sink effect of the soma which makes proximal dendrites – that is, mostly basal dendrites – harder to excite. This finding explains the higher contribution of the apical tree in driving somatic output.</p><p>In addition to the abovementioned results, we also performed a new sensitivity analysis whereby we modify the sodium channel conductance within each dendritic tree and show that our results remain unchanged for biologically relevant values (Supplementary Figure 7). This mitigates the risk that our findings only hold for a very strict parameter range.</p><p>Taken together, our findings support the conclusion shown in the Abstract Figure, whereby apical dendrites are proposed to contribute to somatic output through sodium spiking because they have a greater propensity to do so compared to basal dendrites, which suffer from a current sink effect due to their proximity to the soma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 is a step in this direction, but it mostly shows that the number of synapses to reach threshold increases with cable diameter and decreases with distance from soma, which is well known (ie: where the passive and active properties of the cable are uniform, as they are here, the result is explained by the differences in input impedance).</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in our response to the first comment, we extended this line of investigation by adding two new Figures (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 8) and discussing additional comparisons (i.e., mentioning the p-values of explored parameters that failed to yield significant differences between apical and basal dendrites). Furthermore, while it is indeed known that, all else being equal, the threshold “increases with cable diameter and decreases with distance from soma”, what we are concerned with here is whether this change in threshold (and also EPSP and spike attenuation) is the same between apical and basal dendrites, with the results of section 3.5 showing that it is not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The lack of granularity is well illustrated in the title of section 3.6.: &quot;Morphological and Electrophysiological Properties Influence Dendritic Behavior&quot; – indeed they do, this is very well known.

Or are there differences in the relationship between synaptic input patterns and the generation of local non-linearities between basals and apicals?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which we addressed with new simulations and analyses detailed in our previous responses.</p><p>Section 3.5 now mentions our findings related to sodium spike attenuation (as measured at the soma) in apical vs basal dendrites: “There was no significant difference in spike attenuation when normalized by distance from the soma (data not shown; p-value 0.768547), dendritic path volume (data not shown; p-value 0.061389), or ELC (data not shown; p-value 0.396982)”. Moreover, even without normalization, the extent of signal filtering is similar (slightly larger for apical dendrites) for both fast dendritic spikes and slow EPSPs across apical and basal dendrites. This is seen in Supplementary figure 8, whereby signal attenuation as a function of distance from the soma and branch point order is depicted. These new results demonstrate that the greater role of apical sodium spikes in neuronal spiking is not due to higher filtering of signals along basal dendrites.</p><p>Finally, synaptic activation patterns are unlikely to affect apical vs. basal contributions because they do not have a specific spatiotemporal pattern. Dendritic segments are activated by a large number of synaptic inputs (each receiving a different, independently sampled input spike train), which are distributed randomly but uniformly within the activated dendrites. All experiments are also repeated multiple times with different (randomized) input spike trains, to minimize the influence of any one particular input spike train. The setup of stimulus-driven input synapses is explained in our Extended Methods section, subsection 8.1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The attempt to use experimental calcium imaging data to estimate background activity is nice, but the data are not very convincing.

We recognize that the data may not appear very convincing, but this is because of technical limitations beyond our control (e.g., low sampling frequency). Importantly, this data has no influence on the major findings of our study. Instead, we use this approach to assess the realism of our model, given the lack of data that can be used to reliably validate it. Although the trace shown in Supplementary Figure 2C might “look like noise”, it is vital to remember that events are detected via an unbiased algorithm whereby “a calcium event is registered when the ΔF/F value exceeds the 93.5<sup>th</sup> percentile (nearly 2 standard deviations from the mean of a normal distribution) at the same time as the derivative of the ΔF/F value exceeds the 67<sup>th</sup> percentile (1 standard deviation from the mean of a normal distribution)” – meaning that these events are not a commonly occurring “noise” signal, but a statistical outlier from the outset. In an attempt to (at least partially) account for the possibility of noise that could contaminate our event detection pipeline, we performed the Event-Triggered Average (ETA) analysis shown in Supplementary Figure 2D. The scaling of the dendritic vs somatic ETAs is also different (the two curves are not normalized), which could again mislead the viewer into thinking of the events as noise. We would like to offer Supplementary Figure 4 as additional evidence – although the increase in dendritic signal is seemingly not as prominent as in the somatic trace, note that the y-axis scaling is, again, different. We would also offer Supplementary Figures 2E and 2F as evidence – if the decoupled dendritic events were the result of noise, then surely the noise-free traces from the model data would not show any such events – but instead we find that the two (in vivo and model) match very closely. Regardless, we have removed these results from the main part of the manuscript as they do not influence our main conclusions and relegated them to a Supplementary Figure (Supplementary Figure 2), to de-emphasize their importance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors propose that in Figure 1 they are validating their modelling approach, but it is unclear what exactly is being validated here. The figure shows that dendrites with sodium channels and AMPA/NMDA synapses can generate non-linear input-output curves, which is very much a guaranteed finding – in a model with reasonable passive parameters and morphology (which is the case here since model that has been previously validated against experimental data), I don't see how the result could be any different. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, it seems we may have failed to convey our intent in this section. We are not attempting to validate the model in this section (since it was already validated to the extent possible in Park et al., 2019), but rather to quantify the non-linear behavior of the dendrites, and compare the behavior of apical vs basal dendrites. Clearly the dendrites are non-linear, but the extent to which that is the case, as well as whether apical dendrites are more/less non-linear than basal dendrites is not clear or known a priori, and thus a valid target for exploration, and particularly important given our main research question. The distribution of Non-linearity Relative to Linear Extrapolation values (NRLE; Figure 1D) illustrates this most clearly – although all dendrites exhibit non-linear behavior, they do not feature identical NRLE values. We have also renamed this session to better convey our ultimate goal. It is now entitled “3.1. The degree of non-linearity varies across basal and apical model dendrites”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line 587: figure call is wrong, should be 4A (same for the subsequent call)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting this. We have performed further proofreading of the manuscript, and have amended this, and many other, inaccuracies and typos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 6 it is not clear why the results in panel C are qualitatively different that in A. Rm and Ra are presumably uniform, so the electrotonic constant is a transform of the dendritic diameter. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We accidentally omitted part of the calculation of the dendritic electrotonic length constant (section 8.5.8). Although the calculation of λ<sub>i</sub> is correctly shown, we have failed to mention that the final value is calculated by dividing the length of each individual dendritic branch (L) by its λ<sub>i</sub> value, which explains why there are substantial differences between these panels. We have amended this error in the new ‘Extended Methods’ section (section 8). That said, we have decided to remove these figures altogether, and present this data in a different way in Figure 5 (section 3.5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript by Petousakis et al. describes a modeling study of a pyramidal neuron in the Layer 2/3 (L2/3) of mouse primary visual cortex V1. The authors use a biophysically detailed, spatially extended model of the neuron, with voltage-gated conductances in the soma, basal dendrites, and apical dendrites to investigate how inputs to basal and apical dendrites sculpt the activity of the neuron and the corresponding major computation that L2/3 excitatory cells presumably carry out – that of orientation detection. The authors report a number of computational experiments and conclude that inputs to basal and apical dendrites synergistically sculpt the orientation selectivity of the neuron.</p><p>While the premise is interesting, the study, and especially the model architecture, relied on a number of assumptions that limit the interpretability of the outcomes.</p><p>1. The whole study is based on a single model of one neuron. This is a model from Park et al., Nature Communications, 2019, which in turn is based upon other previously published models (e.g., the supplementary tables 2-4 in this manuscript are copied from the Park et al. paper). Park et al. already showed how one can get orientation selectivity with this neuron model and how it can be manipulated by ablating apical and basal dendrites.</p></disp-quote><p>The use of a single morphology is indeed a limitation of our study, as recognized in the Discussion. However, the additional analyses that we performed in Section 3.5 (new Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 8) provide several new insights with respect to the morphology dependent reasons for which the apical/basal trees contribute differentially to somatic tuning. Therefore, one could use this morphological analysis to predict whether a different L2/3 V1 pyramidal neuron morphology is likely to behave like ours. In addition, while repeating our analysis using other morphologies is beyond the scope of this study (validating model function and performing the extensive parameter exploration reported here is extremely time-consuming), our code and all analysis scripts are made publicly available thus enabling interested scientists to apply our model/analysis to other morphologies. Finally, the sensitivity analysis that we added in Section 3.4.1 (Supplementary Figure 7) further establishes the robustness of our findings within biologically relevant ranges of ionic conductances. Overall, these new data and analyses demonstrate that our findings are novel and likely to generalize to other L2/3 V1 pyramidal neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There is a lot of data on function-dependent connectivity for L2/3 excitatory neurons that sculpts orientation selectivity, but the authors do not mention even the most prominent of the papers in this area. First, it has been shown that excitatory connections are like-to-like (with respect to orientation and/or direction preference), in papers such as Ko et al., Nature, 2011; Cossell et al., Nature, 2015; Lee et al., Nature, 2016; Wertz et al., Science, 2015; Rossi et al., Nature, 2020. Second, there are indications that inhibitory connections are also structured non-randomly with respect to neuron tuning properties (Znamensky et al., biorXiv, 2018). And Rossi et al., Nature, 2020, showed that inhibitory inputs to L2/3 E neurons form a pool that's shifted retinotopically relative to the pool of excitatory inputs. None of these features of connectivity are taken into account by the presented model. It is possible that a model with these known biological features would lead to different conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not clearly explaining the setup of our model. To clarify, the model does feature “like-to-like” connectivity (from the perspective of a single neuron), as stimulus-driven inputs are sampled from a non-uniform (Gaussian; see section 8.1 for details) distribution that features more synapses of an orientation preference closer to the orientation preference of the model neuron itself, effectively emulating “like-to-like” connectivity. The reviewer is correct, however, that our single-neuron model does not account for tuned or retinotopically shifted inhibitory inputs. While we recognize the important role of inhibition, these specific inputs cannot produce orientation tuning in L2/3 V1 neurons, and their increased activity can mask the effect of excitatory synapses and voltage-gated channels. Moreover, a retinotopic shift in inhibitory inputs would not affect our results, since stimulation is implicitly assumed to only take place at the center of the receptive field of the model neuron, a fact which would render any retinotopically offset neurons quiescent. Additionally, although inhibitory inputs could be biased towards one dendritic tree over the other, the net effect of such an imbalance would be a change in the net amount of excitation received by each tree – a scenario which we already explore in part (Figure 2 and Figure 3), finding tuning and somatic spike generation to be generally unaffected.</p><p>Thus, we decided to include a simple form of inhibition, whereby inhibitory synapses are background-driven, rather than stimulus-driven as was the case in Park et al., 2019. Although further investigation of the role of inhibition in orientation tuning is certainly very interesting, it lies beyond the scope of this work. We also opted for a relatively simple stimulation protocol, instead of the alternating stimulation of the “drifting gradient” protocol that is more widely used, for complexity reasons. Given that we performed a very extensive parameter exploration using a detailed compartmental model, the abovementioned simplifications were necessary in order to reduce the complexity (and thus computational requirements) of the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In fact, the results presented here contradict the results from the same group of authors published in Park et al., 2019, as they point out in Discussion:</p><p>&quot;in vivo micro-ablation via laser of the apical tree in L2/3 mouse V1 pyramidal neurons did not abolish orientation selectivity, which remained essentially unchanged following a recovery period of ~ 1 day.&quot;</p><p>The authors explain this contradiction by potential homeostatic mechanisms &quot;that might alter the dependence of somatic spiking on basal inputs&quot;. But given the points above, it seems equally likely that a more realistic model would have produced these effects. Since this observation is available from in vivo data, why not use it to constrain the model? That seems like the most natural thing to do, and I suspect modeling results with respect to the factors contributing to orientation selectivity would be then quite different.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not communicating our model findings more clearly, as this comment is incorrect. Given that our model is near-identical to the Park et al., 2019 model (identical barring the addition of a 10 ms delay to stimulus-driven apical synaptic inputs, to emulate delayed feedback activity), it would be impossible for the model to contradict these prior results. To demonstrate this, we have reproduced the results of the ablation experiment from Park et al., 2019 using our current model (Supplementary Figure 9) and have added new text in the Discussion section of the manuscript to explain that this is the case. There is no contradiction between the Park et al. findings and this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Modeling inhibitory synapses as just noise, without any orientation tuning, is a limitation. Inhibitory neurons certainly show orientation tuning.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this is a limitation of our model – but one we believe has a minor impact in our simulations as inhibition is uniformly distributed and untuned throughout the basal and apical trees. The same form of inhibition was also used in the Park et al., 2019 study. We have expanded upon our reasoning for this choice in our response to point #2, as well as in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Overall, using constant-rate Poisson process for all synapses is suboptimal. Cortical neurons generally exhibit log-normal distributions of firing rates, meaning that a single rate for all inputs of a given type is far from realistic. Also, feedback inputs are typically delayed relative to feedforward inputs by about 10 ms; that would be important to take into account.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important point and apologize for the lack of clarity in presenting our model. In fact, our model features <italic>variable</italic>-rate Poisson processes for all stimulus driven synaptic inputs, and these Poisson processes are different (different sample) for each synapse, even if the rates happen to be the same. Unfortunately, our description in the methods was severely lacking here, very easily misleading the reader into believing that what was being varied was the <italic>weight</italic> of the synapses, which is <italic>not</italic> the case. The process being followed is that values of the weight vector are being used to re-scale a base activation rate (0.3 Hz) for the Poisson processes of stimulus-driven synapses, leading to variable-rate Poisson processes for synapses of different orientation preferences (verifiable by inspecting the model file “stimulus_uniform_basalvar.hoc”). This only applies for stimulus-driven excitatory synapses, and is not the case for background-driven inhibitory and excitatory inputs. More details can be found in the Extended Methods, section 8.1. As for the incorporation of delayed feedback, we concurred that it would be a very important addition, which is why we incorporated it into all apical stimulus driven synapses in the model. We redid all experiments that would be affected by this change, but there was no significant change in our overall results (e.g. see sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Orientation-tuned synapses should certainly exhibit different amounts of activity for different orientations. Here, synapses are always activated at 0.3 Hz, and their orientation preference is modeled by changing their weight depending on orientation. That is unrealistic. It is the presynaptic activity that changes depending on the orientation, and not the synaptic weight. (Weights can change due to plasticity, but the authors ignore plasticity here, and plasticity can work in either direction – depressing or facilitating – depending on the cell types.)</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we apologize for the lack of clarity. As mentioned in our response to the previous point, this was a misunderstanding borne out of a lacking explanation from our part – synapses are <italic>not</italic> always activated at 0.3 Hz, and the orientation preference is modeled by a frequency change, not a weight change. The “weight” was merely a vector used to rescale the activation frequency. Plasticity was indeed not explored in this work – despite being an important process, it was outside the scope of our experimentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the points above may seem like minor details, but they are not – consequences of such choices can be substantial. Such assumptions establish the correlation structure of synaptic inputs that is very different from what we know to happen in reality. Since the authors are investigating fine details of neuronal operation, including coincidence of basal and apical inputs, such effects are likely important for their study.</p><p>1. Both this manuscript and Park et al. compare the model voltage response to a somatic current injection with that from experiment (for a single cell), but no evidence is provided that electrophysiological properties of dendrites are captured well. In other words, we have no idea if currents and voltages in dendrites in response to synaptic inputs, local current injections, or somatic spikes or current injections, are captured well by the model. Capturing such properties well seems very important for the subject of the study, so, in the absence of a proof that it's working well, it is hard to trust any results from the model.</p></disp-quote><p>A fair point raised by the reviewers was the lack of convincing evidence concerning the dendritic biophysics of the model. Unfortunately, there is little to no data on dendrites of L2/3 V1 neurons, making a validation process more precise than the one followed in the setup of the original model (Park et al., 2019) unfeasible. This is true for all L2/3 V1 models, and yet several of them are published and extensively used by the community, highlighting the importance of building even partially validated models for moving the field forward (e.g. Goetz, Roth and Haüsser, 2021). In order to alleviate the concern that our results may be due to the selected value for VGSC conductance, we performed experiments where apical VGSC conductance was reduced, and the impact of this reduction evaluated (Supplementary Figure 7). Results show that our findings are robust to changes in conductance up to a point, beyond which the firing rate of the neuron is too low to adequately represent a L2/3 V1 neuron (see section 3.4). In addition, we have attempted to capture the spatiotemporal evolution of voltage propagating through the neuron by including an extra set of plots that show how apically- and basally-driven spikes are initiated and propagate through the cell (Supplementary Figure 6). Finally, we have greatly expanded the last section of our results (3.5), allowing us to provide more weight to our findings concerning the different “mechanisms of action” of apical and basal dendrites. We hope that this additional evidence will add sufficient weight to our modeling and findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It's not clear why background-driven synapses all have the same activation frequency. Inhibitory synapses should be activated with higher rates, since many inhibitory neurons, especially PV fast-spiking neurons, fire at substantially higher rates than excitatory cells. The rates, 0.11 Hz for spontaneous and 0.3 Hz for orientation tuned inputs, seem too low. It is also not clear whether all synapses receive inputs from just two Poisson processes, or each synapse receives input from its own Poisson process. The former obviously creates unphysiological correlations between synapses, whereas the latter provides no correlations, which is also incorrect (it is well known that activity of neurons in the cortex is correlated – not perfectly, but substantially). Some middle ground informed by the data would be better than either of these extremes. While it may seem like an unimportant detail, in fact it is hugely important for the topic of the study, since correlations between incoming spikes will strongly influence the dendritic processing and coincidence detection.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned previously, this was a misunderstanding borne out of a lacking explanation from our part – synapses are not always activated at 0.3 Hz, and the orientation preference is modeled by a frequency change, not a weight change. Our work does not explicitly model different interneuron subtypes, and purposely simplifies modeling of inhibitory inputs in order to alleviate computational load (see also our response to point #4 above). Each synapse samples an input spike train from a Poisson distribution independently. Input correlations are not enforced, but emerge as a side-effect of the large number of spike trains sampled from similar distributions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Another big problem with using Poisson spike trains to simulate orientation selectivity is that it completely ignores the spatial structure of the stimulus. The model used only has stronger or weaker input depending on the orientation, but it's always Poisson random input. In reality, a neuron exposed, say, to a drifting grating, will be subject to alternating black and white stripes, which strongly modulate firing. The resulting firing pattern typically has periods when spikes follow each other in close succession and periods when there are barely any spikes at all. This temporal structure of synaptic activation, reflecting the spatial structure of the stimulus and retinotopic distribution of presynaptic neurons, is very likely to have strong effects on the postsynaptic neuron output and phenomena like dendritic integration.</p></disp-quote><p>This model does indeed ignore the spatial structure of the stimulus, and does not model retinotopic effects (see also our response to point #2 above). It is true that in a “drifting grating” paradigm, the firing rate of the neuron during the shift from “dark” to “light” (or vice-versa) can be much higher than the observed peak mean firing rate of our model neuron. Although this would clearly influence the moment-to-moment output of the neuron, this would only be relevant in our evaluation of its orientation tuning capabilities (since no other neurons are modeled). As for the influence of this higher instantaneous firing rate on dendritic integration, our model already features dendrites producing sodium spikes at rates well in excess of the experimentally observed firing rate of L2/3 V1 pyramidal neurons, as well as backpropagation of somatic action potentials. As such, we do not believe that an increase in the instantaneous (but not the average) firing rate of the neuron would significantly change our results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
