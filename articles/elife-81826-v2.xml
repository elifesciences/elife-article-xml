In this study, we use mesoscale two-photon calcium imaging to examine spontaneous activity of cholinergic and noradrenergic axons in awake mice in order to determine the interaction between arousal/movement state transitions and neuromodulatory activity across the dorsal cortex at distances separated by up to 4 mm. We confirm that GCaMP6s activity within axonal projections of both basal forebrain cholinergic and locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons track arousal, indexed as pupil diameter, and changes in behavioral engagement, as reflected by bouts of whisker movement and/or locomotion. The broad coordination in activity between even distant axonal segments indicates that both of these systems can communicate, in part, through a global signal, especially in relation to changes in behavioral state. In addition to this broadly coordinated activity, we also find evidence that a subpopulation of both cholinergic and noradrenergic axons may exhibit heterogeneity in activity that appears to be independent of our measures of behavioral state. By monitoring the activity of cholinergic interneurons in the cortex, we found that a subpopulation of these cells also exhibit state-dependent (arousal/movement) activity. These results demonstrate that cholinergic and noradrenergic systems provide a prominent and broadly synchronized signal related to behavioral state, and therefore may contribute to state-dependent cortical activity and excitability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>noradrenaline</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS097287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCormick</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS118461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCormick</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cortical cholinergic and noradrenergic signaling contains a strong low-frequency component that is distributed across the mouse cortex and is related to the behavioral state of the animal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rapid, moment to moment, fluctuations in arousal state occur across species, from mice to humans, and have a significant impact on both cortical/subcortical activity and the ability to perform behavioral tasks (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flavell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McCormick et al., 2020</xref>). In mice, rapid behavioral state fluctuations are coupled with broad changes in cortical excitation and are often accompanied by changes in arousal (pupil diameter) or movement (locomotion or orofacial movement) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Salkoff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The neuromodulators acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline (NA) are believed to contribute to these cortex-wide fluctuations in neural dynamics by sending signals via broadly projecting axonal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandler and Waterhouse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mechawar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mobley and Greengard, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schwarz and Luo, 2015</xref>). The release of either ACh or NA can significantly impact the activity of single cortical neurons and how these neurons interact in local and long-range networks. For example, ACh can depolarize cortical neurons by binding to both metabotropic muscarinic and ionotropic nicotinic receptors, thereby reducing slow oscillations and facilitating higher-frequency rhythms, hallmarks of increased arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dasgupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hedrick and Waters, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Metherate et al., 1992</xref>). Similarly, NA suppresses slow oscillatory activity in the cortex via metabotropic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sara and Bouret, 2012</xref>). Activity patterns of cholinergic and noradrenergic neurons are highly correlated with arousal and behavioral state fluctuations. For example, cortical ACh activity increases during bouts of active whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eggermann et al., 2014</xref>), as well as during running and licking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>), and optogenetic activation of either NA neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) or ACh neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) promotes wakefulness and locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Irmak and de Lecea, 2014</xref>). Moreover, both cortical ACh and NA activity in primary auditory and visual cortices track pupil dilation/constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Larsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nelson and Mooney, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). Such studies provide clear evidence that both ACh and NA are involved in the modulation of arousal state and cortical neuronal/network dynamics.</p><p>In addition to the broad arousal-based neuromodulation described above, anatomical and functional evidence suggests that cholinergic and noradrenergic systems also provide more regionally specific signaling. The basal forebrain-derived cholinergic (BF-ACh) system is topographically organized such that subregions within the BF preferentially project to different cortical and subcortical targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gielow and Zaborszky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huppé-Gourgues et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zaborszky et al., 2015</xref>), and activation of distinct regions of the BF results in desynchronization of restricted cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Recent recordings from cholinergic neurons in different regions of the BF reveal a common signal strongly related to behavioral state, but also some degree of heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Robert et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In addition to BF-derived cholinergic signaling, the cortex also receives input from local cortical VIP-expressing interneurons (VCINs) that release ACh, GABA, or both, depending on their specific presynaptic release machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Granger et al., 2020</xref>). While many superficial layer VIP interneurons exhibit activity related to arousal/movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dipoppa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Munoz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petersen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Poulet and Crochet, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yu et al., 2019</xref>), it is unclear how homogeneous or heterogeneous the activity of cholinergic VCINs is in association with arousal or behavioral (e.g. movement) state.</p><p>Within the locus coeruleus-derived noradrenergic (LC-NA) system, synchronized activity between LC neurons is often observed in relation to increases in behavioral engagement/vigilance to external events or stimuli (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sara, 2009</xref>), while modularity is strongly suggested by evidence of topographically distinct projection patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loughlin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loughlin et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Waterhouse et al., 1983</xref>) and paired recordings in the rat LC which can show little synchrony in spontaneous or evoked activity, at least under conditions of anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Noei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Totah et al., 2018</xref>). Recent investigations in awake, behaving mice reveal some level of heterogeneity in neuronal activity between different LC neurons in relation to behaviorally relevant components on learned and rewarded tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breton-Provencher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Together, evidence suggests that a broadly synchronized, arousal and/or behavioral state-dependent component of cholinergic and noradrenergic activity may operate alongside a more local, task-specific component. Here, through simultaneous imaging of GCaMP6s expressed in multiple ACh or NA axons (and local cholinergic interneurons) across the dorsal cortex, we find that, during spontaneous behavior, cholinergic and noradrenergic signaling is dominated by a global (cortex-wide) component that is strongly predicted by arousal-related behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Relationship between neuromodulatory activity and behavioral state</title><p>To investigate the relationship between cholinergic (ACh) and noradrenergic (NA) dorsal cortical axon activity and behavioral state, we used two-photon mesoscope imaging to record GCaMP6s fluorescence in BF (basal forebrain)-ACh and LC (locus coeruleus)-NA axons in the cortex while recording facial movements, pupil diameter, and locomotion on a running wheel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in awake, head-fixed and habituated mice.

Both whisker twitches and whisking were associated with movements of other portions of the face (e.g. snout, jaw) and increases in pupil diameter (see Figure 3). Interspersed within these periods of non-walking, the mouse occasionally would walk or run on the circular wheel for 2 s or more. These bouts of locomotion were accompanied by forward-backward movements of the whiskers, occasional eye movements (especially at the beginning of walking), and significant increases in pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="gif" id="video3" xlink:href="elife-81826-animation1-v2.gif"><label>Animation 1.</label><caption><title>Example of mouse face during twitching, whisking, and walking.</title><p>Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>.

Simultaneous recordings were obtained from ROIs separated by up to approximately 3.5 mm for the BF-ACh axons and 4 mm for the LC-NA axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Selected axon segments were chosen from putative retrosplenial, somatosensory, primary and secondary motor, and visual cortices (regions defined using coarse alignment to the Allen Brain Institute Common Coordinate Framework; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Simultaneously imaged axon segments were always in the same hemisphere. Histological investigation of neurons and axons that reveal the presence of GCaMP6s and the precursors to acetylcholine (choline acetyl-transferase [ChAT]) in basal forebrain neurons or norepinephrine (tyrosine hydroxylase [TH]) in locus coeruleus cells demonstrated a strong overlap, with the vast majority of GCaMP6s (GFP+) containing neurons being ChAT+or TH+. These results confirm that our cortical axonal activity imaging is specific to these neuromodulatory systems (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Examination of individual axon segment recordings, averages of axon segments recorded within the same ROI (50 × 50 to 400 × 400 µm), and averages of all axon segments simultaneously monitored revealed activity that closely tracked behavioral state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G</xref>), across all dorsal cortical regions monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We confirmed that any movement-related axonal responses were not affected by motion artifacts in two ways. First, we compared GCaMP6s fluorescence to non-activity-dependent autofluorescence in small blebs within the imaging field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, blebs; see ‘Materials and methods’). Second, we compared GCaMP6s fluorescence activity to non-activity-dependent mCherry fluorescence, introduced into axons via viral AAV injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’). Whisker twitches were defined as whisker pad movements that lasted less than 0.5 s, while a whisking bout was defined as whisker pad movement that lasted longer than 1 s. Both were required to be preceded by a period of 1 s of non-whisker movement to be included in our analysis.</p><p>At the onset of both facial movements/twitches, as well as whisking bouts (which involve both larger and more prolonged movements of the whiskers than whisker twitches), both BF-ACh and LC-NA axonal activity sharply increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). Importantly, no change in fluorescence was observed at the onset of whisking in either autofluorescent blebs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) or non-activity-dependent mCherry axon fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Expanding the time base revealed that the onset of the increases in average BF-ACh and LC-NA axonal activity occurred, on average, nearly simultaneously with the onset of whisking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, insets). Whisker movements reached their peak prior to GCaMP6s fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, insets), presumably owing, at least in part, to the slower kinetics of intracellular calcium dynamics and the GCaMP6s fluorescence reporter mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) in comparison to whisker movements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Both cholinergic and noradrenergic axon activity decreased along with whisker movement just prior to onset of whisker twitches or a bout of whisking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). This decrease in whisker movement and ACh/NA activity is the result of our requirement of no whisker movements for at least 1 s prior to the bout, for the bout of whisker movement to be included in our analysis (see ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>At the cessation of facial movement, BF-ACh and LC-NA axon activity decreased slowly (over 1–2 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, offset), in comparison to the rapid rise at movement onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, onset). Previous studies of cholinergic and noradrenergic axonal GCaMP activity revealed that cholinergic fibers exhibit more sustained responses than noradrenergic axons during a bout of walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). By examining whisking bouts of different durations, from 1 s to &gt;5 s, we also observed that cholinergic axonal GCaMP6s responses are significantly more sustained than the noradrenergic axonal responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). For example, during prolonged (&gt;5 s) bouts of whisking, the NA axonal response typically exhibited a strong increase in GCaMP6s fluorescence at the beginning of the whisking bout, which decreased over the next 0.5–1.5 s to a steady value that was on average 11% of the peak value (activity at 2–3 s compared to peak, t = –15.14, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, cholinergic fibers exhibited a more sustained response, such that the activity 2–3 s into the prolonged whisking bout was 93% of the peak (activity at 2–3 s compared to peak, t = 0.91, p=0.36; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>The GCaMP6s activity of both BF-ACh and LC-NA axons increased prior to the onset and slowly decreased at the offset, of a walking bout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Again, no movement-related change in fluorescence was observed for either the autofluorescent blebs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) or non-activity-dependent mCherry in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). To determine the uniformity of the GCaMP6s response across axons and behavioral events (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we calculated the probability that a given axon would respond at the onset of a behavioral event (twitch, whisk, or walk). We defined ‘responsive’ as a significant increase in dF/F between 1 s following event onset and 1 s prior to event onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>; Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, alpha = 0.01), in comparison to a distribution obtained from shuffled data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>). We found that a large number of BF-ACh and LC-NA axons increased activity at the onset of twitching (BF-ACh: 44.2 ± 30.9%; LC-NA: 47.3 ± 28.4%) and whisking (BF-ACh: 78.8 ± 23.5%; LC-NA: 67.3 ± 30.9%) bouts. On average, each BF-ACh axon significantly increased activity on 43.5 ± 15.7% of twitching and 75.8 ± 25.0% of whisking bouts. Similarly, on average, each LC-NA axon segment significantly increased activity on 46.7 ± 13.7% of twitching and 74.4 ± 24.4% of whisking bouts. These results indicate that, on average, with each whisker twitch, approximately half of NA and ACh axons will show increased activity responses, while with the transition to full whisking ~75% of NA and ACh axons are activated. At the onset of whisking bouts, simultaneously recorded axons were varied in their response even for whisking bouts that exhibited very similar changes in average axonal dF/F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K–O</xref>).</p><p>Walking bouts, which are associated with strong increases in cholinergic and noradrenergic activity (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and F</xref>) were not associated with a significant difference 1 s after walk onset in comparison to 1 s prior to walk onset, owing to an increase in average cholinergic and noradrenergic axon activity in the 1 s prior to walk onset (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and F</xref>).</p><p>We suspected that the strong activation of ACh and NA axons prior to the onset of walking was the result of increases in movement (e.g. whisking) and arousal (e.g. pupil diameter) during this time period. To test this hypothesis, we compared the onset/offset of whisker pad movement and walking. We observed that whisker pad movement is consistently initiated, with a variable onset, 0.5–5 s prior to walking initiation and typically persists for approximately 1–3 s, with a variable offset, after the cessation of walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). Thus, the lack of tight temporal correlation between onset/offset of walking with cholinergic and noradrenergic activity is likely the result of a variable timing of onset/offset of whisking/arousal in relationship to walking bouts, and the strong association between ACh and NA axonal activity and behavioral state (which is tightly linked to whisker movements; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>).</p><p>Since we observed a strong relationship between whisker pad motion energy and modulatory axon activity, we wondered whether axon activity was linked to whisker movements per se or to facial movement more generally. To answer this question, we compared the relationship between axon activity and motion of the whisker pad to the relationship between axon activity and motion of the mouth, snout, and full face in a subset of recordings comprising 65 BF-ACh axons and 50 LC-NA axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Overall, these variables were highly correlated as motion in one part of the face often accompanies motion in other regions of the face. However, we were able to identify occasional instances where facial motion was predominantly localized to the whisker pad, jaw, or snout regions (green, red, and yellow bars, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) in all analyzed recording sessions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Facial movements are highly predictive of basal forebrain-derived cholinergic (BF-ACh) and locus coeruleus-derived noradrenergic (LC-NA) axon activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Restricted regions within videos of the face were analyzed to capture movement of the (left to right) whisker pad, jaw, and snout.

The full model accounted for 33.3 ± 2.9% of variance in BF-ACh axonal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Movement of the whisker pad area explained more of the variance in BF-ACh axonal activity than any other variable (whisker pad movement explained variance = 24.1 ± 2.8%; <italic>F</italic> = 89.2, p&lt;0.0001; one-way ANOVA). Walking speed explained less variance in axon activity than any other behavioral measure (R<sup>2</sup> = –0.05 ± 0.02). Movements of the snout were also informative, as were motion energy in the full face video (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). It should be noted that behavioral measures such a pupil diameter or walking speed, which exhibit a significant coherence with BF-ACh and NA-LC activity at low frequencies (1 Hz and 0.1 Hz, respectively), may not explain a high percentage of variance of the total axonal activity, presumably owing to low coherence at higher frequencies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Whisking can explain significantly more axonal fluorescence variance (versus walking or pupil diameter) since whisker movements are more highly coherent, and across a broader range of frequencies, with axonal activity than our other measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Similar to BF-ACh, activity of LC-NA axons lagged facial movements by 100–200 ms and facial (whisker, snout, full face) movements explained more variance in the noradrenergic axonal signal than walking speed or pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>; <italic>F</italic> = 17.16, p&lt;0.0001). Although we used ridge regressions to avoid overestimation, there still is the possibility that the regression overestimated the relationship between axon activity and behavior. We used the ‘session permutation’ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harris, 2020</xref>) to address this concern. Briefly, this method determines the likelihood of a correlation arising from truly non-correlated data by comparing the prediction error obtained from regressions of matching (simultaneously recorded) sessions, to the distribution of prediction error for regressions of all permutations of unmatched sessions. For both BF-ACh and LC-NA data sets, prediction error for matched whisking and walking data sets was low in comparison to the distribution of unmatched sessions; therefore, we conclude that the relationships determined by linear regressions are valid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Evidence for global vs. heterogeneous activity within ACh and NA axon segments across the dorsal cortex</title><p>To examine the possibility of both common and unique signals within cholinergic and noradrenergic axon segments across the cortex, we sought to measure the coherence and correlation in GCaMP6s signal between axon segments of the same modulatory system, and the ability of a common signal to explain this activity, as a function of distance and behavioral state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To establish an interpretable baseline for these measures, we compared the results obtained in all axon segments with those obtained by comparing the activity in a random sample of sub-segments of the same axons (n = 18 ACh axons; n=30 NA axons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This control allowed us to determine to what extent cholinergic and noradrenergic axons act homogeneously (as if they are segments of the same axon).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cholinergic and noradrenergic activity contains a global signal related to behavioral state</title><p>To determine the extent to which cholinergic and noradrenergic axonal activity was similar across the cortex, we first calculated the correlation between individual axons recorded in the same imaging session across multiple ROIs. Overall, we found a high average correlation between GCaMP6s activity in both cholinergic and noradrenergic axon segments (ACh: 0.54 ± 0.19; NA: 0.44 ± 0.15). However, we also observed a broad distribution of correlations that slightly decreased (for ACh axon segments), with distance, suggesting that heterogeneous signals may also be present (described below). Comparing the average coherence between all cholinergic/noradrenergic axon segments revealed a high coherence at frequencies less than approximately 1 Hz, and this group average coherence decreased markedly at frequencies above approximately 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>, Exp. data). This high level of average coherence between simultaneously imaged cholinergic/noradrenergic axon segments at frequencies &lt;1 Hz suggests the presence of a strong common signal that is broadly expressed across these segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). The drop off in coherence at frequencies &gt;1 Hz is most likely a consequence of the frequency limitations of our data collection technique (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The presence of strong coherence and correlation between ACh or NA axon activity and behavioral state (e.g. whisker movements) suggests that coherence/correlations between axon segments may arise simply because they are both coherent/correlated to a common signal, such as movements/arousal. To examine the possibility of such a signal driving the correlation between axonal segments, we calculated a ‘common signal’ as the average signal for all simultaneously imaged axon segments, minus the two axon segments under consideration (i.e. being correlated). This average or ‘common signal’ within cholinergic or noradrenergic axons is strongly coherent with movements of the whisker pad, especially at lower frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Next, we calculated the partial correlation between each pair of simultaneously imaged axon segments, given the average of all other simultaneously imaged axon segments (i.e. the common signal, see ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>Plotting the residual partial correlation versus the ordinary (full) correlation revealed a large decrease in correlation for the vast majority of axon segments when this common signal is taken into account, such that the partial correlation centered around approximately 0 (ACh: mean = 0.03 ± 0.14 [SD]; NA: 0.07 ± 0.11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). This result indicates that much of the ordinary correlation between axon segments, particularly at values below approximately 0.5–0.6, may have resulted from the correlation of the two axon segments to a common signal related to behavioral state.</p><p>At correlation values above 0.5–0.6, there are pairs of axon segments whose partial correlation rises toward 1 as the ordinary correlation also rises (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). A similar phenomenon occurs in correlating axon segments from the same axon, indicating that this may result from imaging branches of the same axon (however, see below – distant cell bodies of cortical cholinergic interneurons can also exhibit this property). Examining the fluorescence of non-activity-dependent mCherry-labeled axons did not reveal a significant decrease with partial (vs. ordinary) correlation, indicating that the effect observed in cholinergic and noradrenergic axons with this comparison is not due to movement-artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>What is the source of the common signal between axon segments? One possibility is that variations in behavioral state correlated with animal movement may represent a significant portion of the common signal. To test this hypothesis, we examined the degree to which restricting our analysis to periods in which behavioral state was less variant reduced the ability of the effects of the common signal on inter-axonal correlations. Specifically, we compared the difference between partial and ordinary correlation values for (1) full data set; (2) periods that exclude walking, but may include whisking; and (3) periods that exclude both walking or whisking. We found that removing periods of both walking and whisking significantly (p&lt;0.01) lessened the difference between the partial and ordinary correlations, while removing periods of walking did not have a significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>). This result confirms that a significant portion of the common signal in ACh and NA axon activity results from behavioral state variations associated with movements.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Characteristics of axonal segment activity that is not part of the common signal</title><p>Axons can signal heterogeneous activity either through their own trial-to-trial variations in activity or through their variations in correlation with other modulatory axons. To test these two hypotheses, we examined the correlation/coherence between activity in heterogeneous axon segments after accounting for the common signal (and in comparison to same axon activity and non-activity-dependent mCherry axons), as well as the trial to trial variation in activity in the simultaneously imaged population of axon segments.</p><p>While the average coherence between axon segments was high, there was a broad distribution of coherence between simultaneously monitored axon segments, as revealed by plotting the distribution of average coherence at frequencies between 0.05 and 0.5 Hz for all simultaneously recorded axon segments. The distribution of coherence values was substantially broader than that observed in pairs of segments from the same axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). The broad range of relationships between activity in simultaneously recorded axon segments is also illustrated by examining the correlation of fluorescence between these segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Comparison of axonal fluorescence correlations for both cholinergic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and noradrenergic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) axons revealed a broad distribution, ranging from –0.03 to 0.99 for ACh and –0.08 to 0.91 for NA, with an average correlation of 0.54 ± 0.19 for ACh and 0.44 ± 0.15 for NA. The average correlations between ACh axon segments decreased weakly with increased distance between segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), with the correlation between inter-axonal segment activity correlation and distance between segments being –0.12 (p&lt;0.001). In contrast, there was no significant relationship between distance and correlation between NA axon segments (<italic>r</italic> = 0.02; p=0.46; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). As with coherence, the distribution of correlations between both cholinergic and noradrenergic axons was substantially broader than that observed in pairs of segments from the same axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, G, J and K</xref>).</p><p>We addressed whether or not the broad distribution of correlations between heterogeneous axons was the result of variations in their correlation with the common signal by examining the distribution of partial (residual) correlations between these axon segments, once the common signal was taken into account (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N–Q</xref>). Interestingly, the distributions of residual correlations between heterogeneous cholinergic, noradrenergic, or non-activity-dependent mCherry axons were nearly identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>). We found no statistical differences between these distributions (p&gt;0.001; <italic>F</italic> = 76.98; one-way ANOVA). However, comparing the distribution of partial (residual) correlations between cholinergic axons revealed a significant distance dependence (<italic>r</italic> = −0.4; p&lt;0.01), such that axon segments within the same ROI exhibited a higher correlation than axon segments that were more distant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). This result may be explained by the axon segments within the same ROI being segments of the same axon. Indeed, examining the distribution of partial correlations in axon segments from the same axon revealed a similar positive-biased distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). In noradrenergic axon segments, the partial (residual) correlation decreased slightly with distance, dropping from 0.09 ± 0.12 within the same ROI, to 0.06 ± 0.10 between all other axon segment pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>). The overall correlation between distance and residual partial correlation for NA axon segments was very low, but statistically significant (<italic>r</italic> = –0.10; p&lt;0.001). Again, this result may have occurred owing to increased likelihood of imaging segments of the same axon when those segments are closer together (e.g. within the same ROI). We confirmed that artifactual movement within the imaging field was not driving distance-dependent changes in partial correlations by comparing partial correlations between non-activity-dependent mCherry axons across distance. No change in partial correlation was observed with increasing distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = –0.03; p=0.35).</p><p>Our results indicate that there is a strong correlation and coherence between axon segments of cholinergic and noradrenergic axons within the cerebral cortex, that these correlations extend for long distances (at least 3.5–4 millimeters), and that the major contributor to these correlations is a common signal related to behavioral state (e.g. uninstructed movements and arousal). The residual, partial correlations that remain once this common signal is subtracted had a similar distribution to that of correlations between non-activity-dependent axons, indicating that these correlations may not represent behaviorally relevant signals. Thus, while there is a broad range of correlations between modulatory axons, we were unable to confirm that the range of correlations not explained by the global signal is representative of a heterogeneous signaling mechanism.</p><p>Another way to reveal heterogeneity of activity between simultaneously monitored ACh and NA axonal segments is to compare their activity for overall average axonal responses that are of similar magnitude (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K–O</xref>). Indeed, even though the average response of the ACh of NA axons may be similar for two different bouts of whisker movement, the pattern of activity generated within the simultaneously monitored ACh or NA axon segment can vary strongly. These variations gave rise to the strong appearance of whisker bout to bout heterogeneity in axonal response patterns (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K–O</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it has been reported that cholinergic receptor activation across the dorsal cortex is decorrelated in association with increases in movement, suggesting that the cholinergic fibers projecting to different regions of the cortex may decorrelate with increased behavioral engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lohani et al., 2022</xref>). However, our results indicate that the ability to make this conclusion may be severely affected by the limited ability to monitor noradrenergic/cholinergic activity using fluorescent reporting methods. Indeed, we observed a striking decrease in correlation between cholinergic (and noradrenergic) axon segments during walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). However, we obtained the same result when comparing adjacent segments from the same axon (which should remain highly correlated throughout all behavioral states), indicating that this movement-related decorrelation in fluorescence-based activity is most likely an artifact of frequency-limited fluorescence-based data collection methods. Since we cannot resolve individual action potentials (or the resulting fluctuations in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) within axons at all frequencies, we are unable to measure whether there is, or is not, a decorrelation of biologically relevant activity between these axons during walking or whisking.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Relationship between VCIN activity and behavioral state</title><p>In addition to input from the basal forebrain, the cerebral cortex receives local cholinergic signaling through local VIP+/ChAT+ interneurons (VCINs).

Averaged activity across all recorded VCINs tracked changes in the animal’s behavioral state.

In similarity with both BF-ACh and LC-NA axons, VCIN activity quickly increased at the onset of facial movements and returned to baseline within 1–2 s following a return to stillness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Examining the relationship between whisking onset and VCIN GCaMP6s activity at an expanded time base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, inset) revealed a slight (&lt;150 ms) onset lag between whisking onset and VCIN GCaMP6s activity. VCIN activation was less tightly coupled to the onset and offsets of walking bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), likely due to facial movements consistently occurring prior to walking bout onsets and persisting after walking offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>).

Correlation of activity between pairs of VCIN neurons varied from 0.43 to 0.96 and averaged 0.74 ± 0.12. As a control, we compared the correlation between GCaMP6s signaling in two halves of the same VCIN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, black dots). We reasoned that any correlation below 1 would reveal limitations within our data set. Indeed, all (n = 18) of the adjacent cell body halves exhibited a correlation at, or near, 1 (minimum correlation = 0.91; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). These correlations are higher than those we obtained by comparing two segments of the same axon (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5K</xref>). We assume this difference is the result of the high dF/F signals, and larger imaging volumes, exhibited by cell bodies in comparison to axon segments.

For neurons with ordinary correlations less than approximately 0.6, the residual partial correlation centered around approximately 0, suggesting that these neurons were correlated in their activity owing to co-correlation with a common signal. Closer examination of the subset of pairs of neurons that exhibited ordinary correlations greater than approximately 0.6 revealed a population of neuronal pairs whose partial correlation was unusually positive, increasing toward a partial residual correlation of 0.84, as the ordinary correlation approached 0.96 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>).

Early work exploring the role of the noradrenergic neurons of the LC strongly suggested that this region is important for triggering sleep–wake transitions and variations in behavioral engagement and vigilance. For example, activity of LC neurons is higher during waking compared to sleeping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hobson et al., 1975</xref>), and increased LC activity occurs before the transition from sleep to awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981</xref>).

During slow wave sleep, ACh release in the cortex and thalamus is substantially reduced compared to the waking state and REM sleep state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 1994</xref>) and stimulation of the cholinergic basal forebrain promotes wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zant et al., 2016</xref>). In the waking state, cortical cholinergic axonal activity fluctuates in relation to increases in behavioral arousal and engagement (as measured by the onset of whisker movements, increases in pupil diameter and locomotion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eggermann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nelson and Mooney, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). Activation of the basal forebrain cholinergic system appears to be particularly important for the suppression of spontaneous slow oscillations in cortical and thalamocortical activity, which are characteristic of behavioral quiescence or drowsiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eggermann et al., 2014</xref>). Our observation of a global common signal in cholinergic axons correlated with measures of behavioral engagement, particularly movements of the whiskers and face, supports the view that one of the major roles of the basal forebrain cholinergic system is to provide a broad modulation of the neocortex in association with moment-to-moment changes in behavioral state, including arousal, engagement, vigilance, and attention.</p><p>Interestingly, a recent study of dopaminergic axons within the mouse cortex also revealed state-dependent activity very similar to that observed here for cholinergic and noradrenergic axons, including increases in activity with whisker movement, pupil dilation, and locomotion (Figure 4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sturgill et al., 2020</xref>). These results, along with studies of multiple cell types throughout the cortex, thalamus, and other structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McCormick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nestvogel and McCormick, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>), reveal frequent coordinated rapid shifts in neural dynamics throughout the mouse brain during the waking state that are highly coordinated with rapid changes in behavioral state. This coordinated shift in neural dynamics across broad regions of the brain, including neuromodulatory pathways, does not preclude important regional and temporal variations in activity that are specific to each pathway/system. For example, we have shown here that the activation of the basal forebrain cholinergic pathways remains sustained throughout prolonged bouts of movement, whereas the noradrenergic system from the locus coeruleus is more transient – mainly signaling the onset of a period of behavioral engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). This result suggests that the cholinergic system is more associated with alteration in brain dynamics associated with sustained engagement with the external world, while the noradrenergic input may be more related to the behavioral transition to external engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clayton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vazey et al., 2018</xref>).

While some anatomical and functional evidence supports the view that neurons within the LC-NA system share a broadly similar connectivity and functional effect, and that the activity of LC neurons are often synchronized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deitcher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>), more recent investigations have emphasized the presence of genetic, anatomical, and functional specializations within sub-regions of the locus coeruleus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Totah et al., 2018</xref>).

For example, presynaptic modulation of noradrenergic and cholinergic release or modulation of postsynaptic receptor–effector mechanisms can be locally specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lovinger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pardi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sarter et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that our data does not distinguish between heterogeneity owing to local modulation from variations in action potential activity across the active population of cholinergic or noradrenergic neurons. Another important caveat to keep in mind is that our fluorescence monitoring of noradrenergic and cholinergic axonal activity is limited in frequencies below approximately 1–2 Hz. Therefore, we are unable to determine if activity in these axonal pathways are widely synchronized or desynchronized at frequencies above this low frequency cutoff.</p><p>Our data is consistent with the LC-NA and BF-ACh systems broadcasting both a broad low-frequency state-dependent signal over wide regions of the neocortex, as well as more heterogeneous activity that may be regionally or temporally separate and distinct. Evidence supporting the presence of a broadly coordinated signal is the high degree of correlation between the GCaMP6s activity in axonal segments that could be explained by a common signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Evidence for a more heterogeneous signal is provided by the large range of activity that remains once the common signal is removed and the trial-to-trial variation in axonal segment activity, even on trials in which activation of that modulatory system was nearly identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K–O</xref>).

VCINs are functionally and spatially situated as a prime candidate to enhance regionally specific modulatory signaling of the cholinergic system. VCINs have been reported to be sparsely distributed throughout the cortex, primarily in layers 2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dudai et al., 2021</xref>), and they possess a combination of GABAergic and cholinergic axon terminals, arranged in a highly target-specific manner, ideal for circuit-specific modulation.

However, amongst the population of VCINs, there is clear heterogeneity in the cells’ responsiveness to behavioral state, with only a subset of VCINs across the cortex displaying activity that strongly and reliably tracks behavioral state variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, G–I</xref>). This heterogeneity of activity within local cholinergic signaling may reflect circuit-specific arousal-related modulation of cortical dynamics, or it may be evidence that there is a functionally distinct subgroup of VCINs, which are less strongly influenced by behavioral/arousal state changes. The presence of subsets of VCIN interneurons that exhibit broadly synchronized activity, even when these neurons are distant from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>), suggests the presence of a common synchronizing input. Identifying the mechanisms of this synchronization, particularly in relation to variations in behavior, will be important to understanding the role of these interneurons in cortical dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Together, our findings provide evidence that a significant portion of activity within cholinergic and noradrenergic cortical projections is tightly coupled to spontaneous behavioral state changes.

Images are displayed as mean intensity z-projections and were captured with a Nikon SoRa spinning disk confocal microscope using 20 X/0.75 NA and 40 X/1.15 NA objectives. Cholinergic axons in cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) were captured at ×160 by adding a ×4 additional objective to the light path while imaging with the ×40/1.15 NA objective. GCaMP6s and neuromodulatory marker expression in cell bodies were quantified by hand and used to determine the extent of colabeling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Behavioral data analysis</title><p>All imaging data was first aligned to behavioral data using custom MATLAB scripts. Pupil diameter was normalized to the max pupil diameter in each session to limit overestimation of arousal state in low lighting conditions. FaceMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Syeda et al., 2022</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MouseLand/FaceMap">https://github.com/MouseLand/FaceMap</ext-link>) was used to calculate motion energy of the snout and mouth. Onsets and offsets of walking bouts, whisking bouts, and facial twitches were detected using custom MATLAB code. Walking bouts were defined as times during which the mouse exceeded a speed of 2.5 cm/s for at least 2 s. Whisker pad motion energy was normalized between 0 and 1 for each session, and whisking bouts were defined as periods in which the normalized whisker pad motion energy exceeded 20% for more than 1 s. Twitches were defined as moments when the normalized whisker pad motion energy exceeded 20% for less than 0.5 s. Walking bouts, whisking bouts, and twitches that were not preceded and followed by 1 s of stillness were excluded. This requirement led to a drop in axonal fluorescence prior to the onset of movement (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). For the BF-ACh study, GCaMP6s activity in 397 axon segments was compared to 101 waking onsets and offsets, 330 whisking onsets, 201 whisking offsets, and 1108 twitch onsets. For the LC-NA study, GCaMP6s activity in 283 axon segments was compared to 34 walking onsets and offsets, 400 whisk onsets, 353 whisk offsets, and 644 twitch onsets. For the VCIN study, GCaMP6s activity in 84 cell bodies was compared to 127 walking onsets and offsets and activity in 98 cell bodies was compared to 1104 whisking onsets, 1015 whisking offsets, and 870 twitch onsets. For the mCherry motion control study, fluorescence in 93 axons was compared to 622 walking onsets and offsets, 3342 whisking onsets, 3137 whisking offsets, and 1129 twitch onsets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Two-photon imaging analysis</title><p>Suite2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pachitariu et al., 2017</xref>) was used to identify cells and axons from two-photon mesoscope imaging data. Axon segments and cell bodies were imaged in several (up to four) ROIs chosen across the dorsal cortex. Distances between ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) were determined based on the center point of each ROI. ROI size ranged from 50 × 50 to 400 × 400 µm.</p><p>All identified cells and axonal shafts were manually verified. A Suite2P-defined region was confirmed to be an axon if all pixels identified were within ~5 µm of the axon and presynaptic boutons and if a significant (&gt;~20 µm) length of the axonal segment was within the region (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A Suite2P-defined cell was considered to be a cell only if nearly all identified pixels were within a cell body. Any identified regions that did not correspond to a clearly identifiable distinct cell body or axonal process were excluded. Axons and cell body regions that were identified with Suite2P but were visually confirmed (i.e. clear continuity of axon form, within the imaging plane, connecting the two segments together) to belong to the same cell or axon were removed from our experimental data set and included in our same-axon/cell data set if they were of a similar size and shape to those selected in the experimental data set (ACh: n = 18; NA: n = 30; VCIN: n = 18).</p><p>To control for the possibility of motion artifacts, autofluorescent ‘blebs’ that did not have calcium-dependent activity and were approximately of similar size to axonal varicosities were selected from within the imaging fields (ACh: n = 22; NA: n = 19; VCIN: n = 8). Since these autofluorescent blebs are not necessarily a similar thickness or brightness to our experimental data, it is possible that movement in the Z plane is not entirely accounted for by comparing our experimental data to blebs. Therefore, we performed an additional control experiment in which we injected a cre-dependent mCherry virus (pAACV-hSyn-DIO-mCherry; a gift from Bryan Roth; Addgene plasmid #50459; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene">http://n2t.net/addgene</ext-link>:50459; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_50459">Addgene_50459</ext-link>) into the basal forebrain of three ChAT-cre mice. We then recorded fluorescence from 93 axons in 30 ROIs (between 5 and 8 ROIs recorded simultaneously each session). This control allowed us to determine whether there was any effect of movement of axons in and out of the imaging plane that could contribute to our observed experimental results. Preprocessing and analysis of mCherry control axons were performed in the same manner as for experimental data (described below).</p><p>Preprocessing of calcium fluorescence data was performed using methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nelson and Mooney, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, all traces were upsampled to 100 Hz and low-pass filtered to 10 Hz. Signal-to-noise ratios were then calculated for all traces by dividing the max power between the frequency range of 0.05–0.5 Hz by the mean power between 1 and 3 Hz. All traces that did not meet a minimum signal-to-noise criteria of log(20) were excluded from further analyses. Normalized fluorescence values were used in statistical analyses to avoid overweighting larger or brighter axon segments. For displaying data, ΔF/F was calculated for each identified axon or cell body using the median fluorescence value over each recording session as the baseline fluorescence. All preprocessing was performed using custom MATLAB scripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Relationships between behavior and axon activity</title><p>To determine the frequencies at which axonal GCaMP6s fluorescence and arousal-related behaviors (walking, pupil dilation, facial movement) were most correlated, magnitude-squared coherence was calculated using a 2 min window with a 98% overlap and a Hamming filter using the MATLAB function mscohere. As a control, axon activity traces were shuffled in time and coherence was calculated with all behavioral variables.</p><p>To assess the timing of axonal activity (GCaMP6s fluorescence) in comparison to arousal-related behaviors, cross-correlations between axon activity and behavioral measures were calculated using the MATLAB function xcorr with a 3 s maximum lag. Cross-correlations were calculated after low-pass filtering at 1 Hz to capture the frequencies at which our behavioral variables and GCaMP6s have the most power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Ridge regressions were used to determine the relative strength of the relationships between behavioral variables and axon activity. All data was first low-pass filtered at 1 Hz. Models were cross-validated to account for overfitting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Relationships between axons/cells</title><p>Magnitude-squared coherence and cross-correlation was calculated between all pairs of simultaneously recorded axon segments using the same parameters used to relate axon activity to behavior, as described above. Distance between axons was estimated by calculating the distance between the center point of each ROI. Therefore, axons within the same ROI were coded as 0 mm apart.</p><p>Since our data may be strongly influenced by the frequency of activity occurring in the axons (owing to the preference of GCaMP6s fluorescence for low frequencies: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), we sought to better understand the limitations of our activity monitoring methodology by comparing the coherence and correlation of activity in two adjacent segments of the same axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since axon conduction failures are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foust et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Popovic et al., 2011</xref>), we reasoned that any decrease below 100% coherence or below a correlation of 1 between activity in adjacent segments of the same axon most likely indicates a fundamental limitation of fluorescence-based data. This limitation results from the complex relationship between axonal action potential activity, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, GCaMP6s, and our ability to monitor axonal GCaMP6s fluorescence.</p><p>To this end, first we identified several (n = 18 ACh; n = 30 NA) pairs of adjacent axon segments that we determined by eye to be portions of the same axon (i.e. segments joined by a clear continuity of axonal form). Plots of coherence between adjacent segments of the same axon revealed high (e.g. ≥0.8) values at frequencies below approximately 1 Hz, but this coherence decreased strongly at frequencies above approximately 1 Hz, such that the coherence between the axon segments was similar to that obtained with shuffled data at frequencies &gt;approximately 3 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). This result indicates that our measure of axonal activity is limited to variations in action potential firing rate below approximately 1 Hz. Therefore, we applied a 1 Hz low-pass filter to the recordings prior to calculation of correlation. Examining different cutoff frequencies for the low-pass filter indicated that a cutoff frequency of 1 Hz was optimal for enhancing correlation in same-axon data, while preserving information (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and F</xref>).</p><p>Since we observed a broad distribution in cross-correlations between simultaneously recorded axons or cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J, K and M</xref>), we used a partial correlation analysis to determine whether some pairs were highly correlated due to a shared ‘common signal.’ Partial correlations were calculated by correlating the residuals of a linear regression between a controlling variable, or common signal, and each of two axons or cells in a pair using the MATLAB function partialcorr. The average dF/F of all simultaneously recorded axons or cells (excluding the two axons or cells being compared) was used as a controlling variable. Counts of simultaneously imaged axons or cells ranged from 7 to 61 for ACh, 9 to24 for NA, and 3 to 10 for VCINs. Since our data suggest that facial activity could contribute to the common signal, we also used whisking activity as the controlling variable in a separate analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H,I</xref>). Partial correlations were calculated after low-pass filtering at 1 Hz. To determine the impact of behavioral state on partial correlation, periods in which the animal was stationary (not walking) or still (neither walking nor whisking) were isolated (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>).</p><p>Custom MATLAB scripts used in data analysis are available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.github.com/lncollins91/ACh_NA_VCIN">https://www.github.com/lncollins91/ACh_NA_VCIN</ext-link>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins, 2023</xref> copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:ebc5f8702b61f0260d81302dcc5209da3e756a6a;origin=https://www.github.com/lncollins91/ACh_NA_VCIN;visit=swh:1:snp:c77761183849c1e15acbd2024a3aed94d1ed1645;anchor=swh:1:rev:6c03e912e115a52cf9118a777fa9aabfa6f17507">swh:1:rev:6c03e912e115a52cf9118a777fa9aabfa6f17507</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were approved by the University of Oregon Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sacha Nelson as Reviewing Editor and John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael London (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It will be essential to convince readers, including the editors and reviewers that the observed heterogeneity is not merely a reflection of motion artifacts. In discussion, it was recognized that this is difficult and might require new analyses or even new experiments, however it is a technical issue that goes to the heart of one of the main conclusions of the paper and so should be addressed rigorously.</p><p>2) Many details of the presentation were suboptimal and would benefit from revision. These include:</p><p>a) Improved clarity in the description of the methods, for example in the methods used to separate sources of variance in figure 3 and elsewhere.</p><p>b) Earlier and increased use of example recordings of single axon segment activity.</p><p>c) Improved reproduction of figure 5.</p><p>d) A discussion that more directly addresses the significance of the present findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) As stated before, the manuscript needs better controls for movement-induced artifacts as they might contribute to the heterogeneity in the recorded signals across axons. A control in which motion artifacts are quantified without a biased selection criterion is needed to better support the claim of heterogeneity. Ideally- Ca+ insensitive structures of the same size as the axonal ROIs might be already present in the recordings and can be selected with an unbiased criterion. Selecting particles of the same size and shape as axonal varicosities exhibiting both red and green fluorescence is a possibility, as GCaMP-expressing axons should not be red fluorescent. Adding some control animals expressing GFP instead GCaMP to the dataset and repeating the different metrics is also a possibility.</p><p>2) While the prospect that the measured signals do not completely relate to action potential induced changes in axonal calcium is raised in lines 410-413, the manuscript does not explicitly address there or later in the discussion that the observed heterogeneity might arise from local, axon-specific presynaptic modulations and not because of differences in the spiking activity across axons (see for example Pardi et al. Science 2020). In the case the heterogeneity is not caused by movement-induced artifacts, these two alternative explanations should be explicitly addressed when interpreting the results.</p><p>3) Besides controlling for movement artifacts using an unbiased criterion for selecting calcium-insensitive structures, the manuscript would benefit with more extensive controls of the potential contribution of movement induced artifacts to the different metrics:</p><p>a.

Better exemplars showing the heterogeneity picked up by the analyses in Figure 4 would strengthen the claims.</p><p>5) Line 1006. What criteria is used to determine if an ROI corresponds to an axon? Are most ROIs on varicosities as stated in line 1012 when describing blebs, or on axonal shafts as in the examples on Figure 4A? If they are mostly on varicosities, analyses from same axon pairs should also come from ROIs of the same size and shape as the rest of the data, as the size and shape might influence correlation values.</p><p>6) What constitutes a 'bleb&quot;? How are they distinguished from regular varicosities besides the lack of calcium-dependent activity? What is their size and shape compared to regular axonal ROIs?</p><p>7) Histological analysis of the GCaMP6 labelling is needed to control if the intended structures are the only ones labelled with GCaMP in both groups.</p><p>8) The original reference of the axon-GCaMP sensor used should be cited, not only the supplier of the virus (line 943).</p><p>9) Figure 3B does not have a time scale.</p><p>10) It is better to avoid using non metric units (line 952).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors miss the opportunity to compare behavioral state modulation across vs within cortical regions – that is, how similar or different is the &quot;common signal&quot; between different regions of cortex? They have these data (an advantage of the mesoscopic scale), and such an analysis would add significantly to the impact of the study.</p><p>The Results section is high in jargon and short on technical details related to the analyses shown, which are necessary for the reader to fully understand the meaning and potential significance of the analysis.

It is interesting background, but not directly relevant to the experiments and analyses at hand.

We addressed this concern by performing a new experiment using non-calcium-dependent mCherry expressed in cholinergic cortical axons. An example recording is included as a new supplemental video (Video 3) and data were analyzed in an identical manner to that of our experimental GCaMP6s data set. We did not find any evidence that motion of axons contributed to our results. We show that motion cannot account for our finding that cholinergic and noradrenergic axons increase activity around changes in behavioral state (i.e. whisking and walking; see Figure 2F). We also demonstrate that correlation between mCherry axons does not change at the onset of animal movement (see Figure 4 —figure supplement 1, panel G) or as a function of distance between axons (Figure 4L,P). We conclude that our experimental results were not impacted by movement of axons during our recordings. These findings are completely consistent with our previous results demonstrating that non-activity dependent fluorescent blebs also do not show movement-related changes in fluorescence. The addition of analysis of non-activity dependent axons facilitated a more thorough investigation of the partial correlational structure of GCaMP6s axons across the dorsal cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Many details of the presentation were suboptimal and would benefit from revision.

We also now include example recordings in the manuscript to better illustrate that robustness of our results, even in raw recordings. The original submission included a raw example in Figure 1 and Figure 4 and a video of raw data collection as the second supplemental video. We have included histological verification of cholinergic and noradrenergic axons in the current submission (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1), an example of a typical field of view during axonal recordings (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1G), as well as a third supplementary video of raw mCherry images (Video 3).

We have now expressed non-activity-dependent mCherry in cholinergic axons, resulting in data on axons of the same shape and size as our experimental data set. These non-activity dependent axons do not exhibit significant motion artifacts and help us to interpret our activity-dependent axonal results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the prospect that the measured signals do not completely relate to action potential induced changes in axonal calcium is raised in lines 410-413, the manuscript does not explicitly address there or later in the discussion that the observed heterogeneity might arise from local, axon-specific presynaptic modulations and not because of differences in the spiking activity across axons (see for example Pardi et al.

For this and other reasons, we feel that the new mCherry data set is a much stronger control than blebs. We continue to present the data on non-activity dependent blebs in our current manuscript, as data supporting our results obtained with the more vigorous control of non-activity dependent mCherry labeled cholinergic axons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Histological analysis of the GCaMP6 labelling is needed to control if the intended structures are the only ones labelled with GCaMP in both groups.</p></disp-quote><p>The current submission includes histological confirmation that all, or nearly all, of our GCaMP6+ axons were indeed cholinergic or noradrenergic (antibody positive for the presence of ChAT or TH) (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The original reference of the axon-GCaMP sensor used should be cited, not only the supplier of the virus (line 943).</p></disp-quote><p>The original reference (Broussard et al., 2018) is now included in the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 3B does not have a time scale.</p></disp-quote><p>This oversight has been corrected in the current submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It is better to avoid using non metric units (line 952).</p></disp-quote><p>The use of fahrenheit has been changed to celsius.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors miss the opportunity to compare behavioral state modulation across vs within cortical regions – that is, how similar or different is the &quot;common signal&quot; between different regions of cortex?

While rough alignment to the Allen Institute Common Coordinate Framework was performed to create Figure 1B using large landmarks (i.e. midline, frontal poles, and/or λ), this alignment is not precise enough to make claims about differences within vs. between cortical areas (except in broad terms). We believe that to make this comparison would require functional mapping of all of the areas examined in each mouse. This precise mapping within individual mice was beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>To approximate such a comparison we have presented correlations as a function of distance. It is reasonable to assume that axons within the same ROI (presented as 0 mm distance in Figure 4) are from the same region. As distance increases, so does the likelihood that the axons have been sampled from different regions of the cortex. We agree that further investigation of the strength of the common signal in different cortical areas would be interesting and impactful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Results section is high in jargon and short on technical details related to the analyses shown, which are necessary for the reader to fully understand the meaning and potential significance of the analysis. This section would benefit from a clearer narrative about what exactly each analysis adds to the overall picture so the reader does not have to keep toggling between methods (at end) and results to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>The results have been substantially edited, both for clarity and organization. We have tried to reduce the jargon and make a cleaner presentation. We hope that the current form is easier to follow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Discussion section reads more like a review article than a discussion of what this study has actually shown. It is interesting background, but not directly relevant to the experiments and analyses at hand. This section would benefit from less extraneous information and more direct discussion of what the present analyses have added to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>The Discussion section has been substantially edited for conciseness and clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be nice to see examples of axonal activity so we can see what they are imaging earlier in the manuscript – they don't show an example until Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Raw axonal activity is illustrated in Figures 1 and 4, Figure 2 —figure supplement 1, and in Videos 2, 3.
