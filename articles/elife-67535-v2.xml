system remains largely unknown. Here, by combining genetic, chemogenetic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approaches, we show that hypothalamic oxytocin (Oxt)-producing neurons modulate colitis-associated cancer (CAC) progression in mice. Depletion or activation of Oxt neurons could augment or suppress CAC progression. Importantly, brain treatment with celastrol, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, excites Oxt neurons and inhibits CAC progression, and this anti-tumor effect was significantly attenuated in Oxt neuron-lesioned mice. Furthermore, brain treatment with celastrol suppresses sympathetic neuronal activity in the celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion (CG-SMG), and activation of β2 adrenergic receptor abolishes the anti-tumor effect of Oxt neuron activation or centrally administered celastrol. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that hypothalamic Oxt neurons regulate CAC progression by modulating the neuronal activity in the CG-SMG. Stimulation of Oxt neurons using chemicals, for example, celastrol, might be a novel strategy for colorectal cancer treatment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Colorectal (or ‘bowel’) cancer killed nearly a million people in 2018 alone: it is, in fact, the second leading cause of cancer death globally.

There were 1.8 million new cases, and 900,000 patients died of CRC annually worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bray et al., 2018</xref>). It is estimated that there were more than 1.5 million people living with a previous CRC diagnosis in the United States in 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller et al., 2019</xref>), and approximately 147,950 new cases will be diagnosed and 53,200 individuals will die of CRC in 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). Besides, prevalence of CRC is rapidly rising in developing countries. For instance, incidence and mortality of CRC rank third and fifth in both men and women among all cancers in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is imperative to understand the mechanism(s) of CRC development. Negative moods, including anxiety, stress, and depression, are frequently associated with the occurrences of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antoni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lillberg et al., 2003</xref>). Anxiety is linked to a greater damage of adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lutgendorf et al., 2008</xref>) and impaired quality of life among cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delgado-Guay et al., 2009</xref>). Stress is related to the incidence or mortality of CRC in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kikuchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kojima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nielsen et al., 2008</xref>). Although negative mood is associated with the development of cancer, the underlying neural mechanism remains poorly understood.</p><p>The hypothalamus is a key brain region in mood regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Price and Drevets, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schindler et al., 2012</xref>). Oxytocin (Oxt) neuropeptide-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus are critical in the regulation of anxiety, stress, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neumann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neumann and Landgraf, 2012</xref>). Previous work demonstrated that Oxt was anxiolytic when administered to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heinrichs et al., 2003</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blume et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ring et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Windle et al., 1997</xref>), whereas disruption of <italic>Oxt</italic> gene elevated anxiety level in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amico et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mantella et al., 2003</xref>). Hence, Oxt plays a crucial role in mood control. Recent work indicated that nerve fibers of the autonomous nervous system are critically involved in the progressions of prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Magnon et al., 2013</xref>), stomach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayakawa et al., 2017</xref>), and breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kamiya et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the central nervous system (CNS), in particular the hypothalamus, was shown to regulate peripheral tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2010</xref>). However, the neuronal population(s) involved in this process remain unclear. In this work, by combining genetic, chemogenetic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approaches, we show that Oxt neurons in the PVN regulate tumor progression in a CRC mouse model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Depletion of Oxt neurons promotes CAC progression</title><p>Dysregulation of mood is frequently associated with the occurrences of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antoni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lillberg et al., 2003</xref>), while Oxt produced in the hypothalamus has an anxiolytic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neumann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neumann and Landgraf, 2012</xref>), suggesting that modulation of Oxt neurons may impact tumor progression in the periphery. To address this possibility, we crossed the <italic>Oxt<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2012</xref>) with the <italic>Rosa26<sup>DTA176</sup></italic> knockin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2006</xref>) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In the elevated plus maze test, lesion of Oxt neurons decreased the time spent in the open arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, in the light/dark box test, depletion of Oxt neurons significantly shortened the time spent in the light box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, lesion of Oxt neurons elevates anxiety level in mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Oxytocin (Oxt) neurons modulate the progression of azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis-associated cancer (CAC) in mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram showing the strategy of generating <italic>Oxt<sup>Cre</sup>;DTA</italic> mice.

To validate the DREADD system, CAC was induced in virus-injected mice. These animals were then intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered with a synthetic ligand, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) every other day for 3 weeks. Two hours after the final dose of CNO, the mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and then brain tissues were harvested. Immunofluorescent staining showed that treatment with CNO elicited a robust c-Fos expression in the Oxt<sup>PVN</sup> neurons of hM3Dq AAV-injected mice compared with the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>), suggesting the activation of these neurons.

While depletion of Oxt neurons led to the increasing of CAC number and diameter, CG-SMG resection markedly attenuated these effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). We noted that colorectal length was not affected in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In agreement with the data of tumor number and size, the effects on cell proliferation and cell apoptosis were both attenuated when CG-SMG were removed from these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–K</xref>).

A recent study showed that treatment with celastrol decreased the body weight in obese mice, but not mice with normal weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). A following study suggested that hypothalamus is critical for celastrol to regulate energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the effect of i.c.v. administered celastrol on hypothalamic neuronal activity. The data showed that the number of c-Fos-positive cells was increased in the PVN, but not other nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), suggesting that brain treatment with celastrol stimulates neurons in the PVN. Oxt neurons in the PVN play a critical role in energy balance control, therefore, we asked whether its activity is modulated by celastrol. To answer this question, we analyzed Oxt neuron excitability after bath application of celastrol via slice electrophysiology. The hypothalamic slices were obtained from <italic>Oxt<sup>Cre</sup>;Rosa26-LSL-EYFP</italic> (<italic>Oxt<sup>Cre</sup>;EYFP</italic>) mice, in which enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) was expressed in Oxt neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In response to 500 ms current steps, Oxt neurons fired more action potentials (AP) across increasing current injections in celastrol condition, suggesting an enhanced neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). We also analyzed the AP waveforms, and found that celastrol increased the size of afterhyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), but did not impact AP threshold, AP amplitude, AP half-width, or AP area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-E</xref>).

To do so, the AOM/DSS-induced CAC mice were implanted with a guide cannula directed to the third ventricle. After recovery, these animals were i.c.v. administered with vehicle versus celastrol every other day for 3 weeks. Besides, these mice received daily saline or isoprenaline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Treatment with celastrol and/or isoprenaline did not impact the body weight or food intake in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). As anticipated, brain treatment with celastrol suppressed CAC progression in mice. Yet, treatment with isoprenaline significantly abrogated this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H,I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Treatment with celastrol and/or isoprenaline did not impact colorectal length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2E</xref>). The immunohistochemistry data revealed that treatment with celastrol inhibited cell proliferation, however, this effect was markedly attenuated when the mice were administered with isoprenaline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

Overall, these data suggest that activation of β2AR can significantly abolish the anti-tumor effect of centrally administered celastrol.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Negative mood is associated with the occurrences of cancers, however, the underlying mechanisms remain less well understood. In this study, we show that excitation of Oxt<sup>PVN</sup> neurons remarkably ameliorated CAC progression in mice, and that this effect was mediated by inhibiting the neuronal activities in the CG-SMG. Also, brain treatment with celastrol suppressed the progression of CAC, and this effect required hypothalamic Oxt neurons. Moreover, we show that β2AR was involved in these processes. Together, our current work demonstrates that modulating hypothalamic Oxt neurons can impact the CAC progression in mice.</p><p>Negative moods, such as anxiety, depression, and stress, are implicated in tumor progression. As for CRC, a recent study has revealed a significant association of perceived stress with the incidences of rectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kikuchi et al., 2017</xref>). Perceived stress at work and stressful life events elevated the risk of CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azizi and Esmaeili, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanc-Lapierre et al., 2017</xref>). Besides, stress is one of the key contributing factors to the onset and development of spontaneous colitis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitchell and Drossman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salem and Shubair, 1967</xref>). This association, in particular the one between chronic stress and colitis, was further confirmed in murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reber et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, chronic psychosocial stress was shown to result in the deterioration of CAC progression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peters et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, these findings suggest that stress is critical for CRC progression. Previous studies showed that Oxt has an anxiolytic effect in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heinrichs et al., 2003</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blume et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ring et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Windle et al., 1997</xref>). Conversely, our current and others’ previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amico et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mantella et al., 2003</xref>) demonstrated that disruption of Oxt neuron or <italic>Oxt</italic> gene increased anxiety level in mice. Importantly, we show that depletion of Oxt neuron promoted tumor progression in CAC mice, which agrees with the previous findings showing that increased stress level could promote colorectal tumor progression. Remarkably, our data indicated that chronic excitation of Oxt<sup>PVN</sup> neurons or treatment with celastrol could significantly inhibit CAC progression in mice. These results are consistent with previous reports displaying that social support reduced the risk of colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ikeda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kinney et al., 2003</xref>). Besides, recent work demonstrated that Oxt has a prosocial role in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kosfeld et al., 2005</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lukas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Teng et al., 2013</xref>). Altogether, these findings suggest that the anxiolytic property of Oxt is critically important in its anti-tumor effect.</p><p>Previous studies unveiled a crucial role for nerve fiber in the tumorigenesis of various organs and tissues. For instance, both the densities of SNS and PNS nerve fibers were correlated with the aggressiveness of human prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Magnon et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, blockade of SNS activity suppressed the development of prostate cancer, whereas blockade of PNS activity inhibited the invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Magnon et al., 2013</xref>). A further study indicated that norepinephrine released from SNS nerves drove angiogenesis in prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zahalka et al., 2017</xref>). Besides, a recent study showed that vagal innervation contributed to the development of stomach cancer via muscarinic acetylcholine M<sub>3</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Infiltration of nerve fibers was associated with the aggressiveness of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pundavela et al., 2015</xref>). The sensory neurons were able to facilitate the initiation and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saloman et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these findings underscore an important role for nerve fiber of the autonomous nervous system in the initiation, invasion, or metastasis of cancers in peripheral organs, and hence the term ‘cancer neuroscience’ was coined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monje et al., 2020</xref>). However, whether the CNS is similarly important remains largely unknown. In this work, we show that stimulation of Oxt<sup>PVN</sup> neurons could suppress CAC progression in mice. Thus, in concert with other evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), our current study implicates a critical role for the CNS, in particular the hypothalamus, in peripheral tumor development.</p><p>In summary, our current study indicates that chemogenetic stimulation of Oxt<sup>PVN</sup> neurons or brain treatment with celastrol can suppress CAC progression in mice. The anti-tumor effect of celastrol requires hypothalamic Oxt neurons. Overall, these results suggest that modulating Oxt neuronal activity might be a relevant strategy for the treatment of CRC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Two weeks later, in vivo single-unit recordings were performed and analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tseng et al., 2011</xref>). The guide tubes housed 16-channel electrodes using 25.4 μm formvar-insulated nichrome wire (761500, A-M System, Sequim, WA). The final impedance of the electrodes was 700–800 kΩ. On the recording day, the CG-SMG located at the intersection of the descending aorta and left renal artery was identified, and the 16-channel electrodes were manually placed into CG-SMG. A sterile cotton swab was dipped in saline solution, and was then placed by the CG-SMG to maintain tissue humidity during recording.

Spikes were detected when a minimum waveform reached an amplitude threshold of –4.50 standard deviation greater than the noise amplitude. Principal component analysis and automatic scan were employed to separate single-unit waveforms into individual clusters. Manual checking was then performed to ensure that the cluster boundaries were clearly separated. All isolated single units exhibited recognizable refractory periods (&gt;1 ms) in the inter-spike interval histograms. Only well-isolated units (L ratio &lt;0.2, isolation distance &gt;15) were included in the data analysis.</p><p>The response of single unit was analyzed with Neuroexplorer V5.0 (Plexon). Well-separated units were used to analyze the responses before (baseline) and after celastrol or CNO infusion. Firing rates of neurons during baseline, 10 and 20 min after celastrol or CNO infusion were compared to determine the significance of difference in firing rates (paired Student’s t-test, 95% confidence interval). For heatmap analysis, z-score of each bin (10 s) was calculated by the following equation: z = (x-μ)/σ, in which x is the raw firing rate, μ is the mean firing rate during the baseline period, and σ is the corresponding standard deviation. Further normalization was utilized for better presentation.

interest to gastrointestinal physiologists, cancer biologists and neuroscientists, including readers whose interests include the hypothalamic effects of anxiety as well as central effects in cancer. Pan et al., studied the consequences of manipulations of hypothalamic oxytocin (OT) neurons on pharmacologically induced colorectal cancer progression in mice and determined that celastrol, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, which should excite OT neurons, also inhibited colorectal cancer progression, an effect, which was attenuated in OT neuron-depleted mice. The authors used a series of overlapping experimental manipulations (surgical, genetic, chemogenetic, pharmacological and electrophysiological) as a way to identify the role of the sympathetic nervous system in contributing to these effects as well as to dissect circuit and to largely support the key claims of the paper.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Stimulation of hypothalamic oxytocin neurons suppresses colorectal cancer progression in mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jeff Roizen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In order to increase the impact of the paper, and to justify the conclusions drawn, especially to show causalities between OT manipulations and progression in colorectal cancer, the following points should be taken into consideration:</p><p>1) The role of the sympathetic nervous system suppression in contributing to these effects is not yet clear. The authors could first identify that sympathetic neurons were impacted using a marker specific to catecholamine neurons (tyrosine hydroxylase, for example). Secondly, the authors could assess the effects in animals that lack SNS innervation to the target tissues in question using either surgical or chemical ablation (6-OHDA) approaches as opposed to a β-2 receptor agonist. Related to this is that the sympathetic nervous system effect was only examined in the context of their novel reagent (rather than, for instance, in the DREADD-dependent model).</p><p>2) What is missing is a proposed causal mechanism of the anticancer effect of OT neuron activation. Is it the attenuation of the activity of the HPA axis, as repeatedly shown by OT, is it the reduction in chronic stress levels mediated by OT, are anti-inflammatory effects involved or other effects on the immune system?

Here, answers to these questions need to be given.</p><p>5) Please provide evidence that celastrol selectively affects OT neurons in the PVN and not any other neurons in the brain, as it was administered icv, and not only into the PVN</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors were hoping to be able to demonstrate that oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus can impact anxiety and modulate colitis-associated cancer (CAC) progression using a mouse model. They also identified a compound, celastrol, that can activate oxytocin neurons and reduce CAC tumor progression through an oxytocin-like pathway. Lastly, they were hoping to be able to show that celastrol can suppress tumor activity by inhibiting sympathetic nervous system activation.</p><p>The major strengths to this body of work lie in the novelty of the hypotheses being examined and the number of sophisticated approaches taken to test their hypotheses. The investigators were largely able to achieve their goals given that they identified previous findings showing that impairments in oxytocin signaling can increase anxiety using a number of behavioral approaches. They were able to demonstrate an increase in CAC progression using a mouse model with depleted oxytocin signaling within the PVN. They then found that stimulation of PVN oxytocin neurons can inhibit CAC progression by suppressing cell proliferation and promoting cell apoptosis. They found that treatment with celastrol could excite PVN oxytocin neurons and that brain treatment with celastrol can suppress CAC progression in mice. In addition, they found that hypothalamic oxytocin neurons are required in the anti-tumor effect of celastrol.</p><p>The main weakness I identified has to do with their last question as to whether the SNS contributes to these effects. I think that the authors could have more fully identified that the neurons in question were actually sympathetic neurons using a marker such as tyrosine hydroxylase. In addition, I think they could have lesioned SNS innervation to the colon through a surgical or chemical (6-OHDA) to more fully determine the impact of defective SNS innervation in their model.</p><p>I think that the authors achieved the majority of their aims in question with the exception of their last aim addressing the role of the sympathetic nervous system.</p><p>This body of work will be largely impactful to gastrointestinal physiologists, cancer biologists and neuroscientists as it has high clinical relevance given the therapeutic potential of oxytocin treatment. It reveals a potential novel treatment for colitis-associated cancer and the mechanisms that may contribute to these effects. The authors used a series of compelling experimental manipulations (genetic, chemogenetic, pharmacological and electrophysiological) and the utility of these approaches in this particular context could be very useful to the scientific community. They used an elegant number of approaches as a way to dissect the circuit and to largely support the key claims of the paper.</p><p>The authors have provided an impressive body of work to dissect the relevance of oxytocin neurons in modulating colitis-associated cancer and the extent to which a compound found to reduce CAC progression works through the oxytocin pathway. The authors should be commended for their thorough examination using a variety of genetic, chemogenetic, pharmacological and electrophysiological as a way to dissect the circuit and to largely support the key claims of the paper.</p><p>I think that the main concerns I have pertain to the role of the sympathetic nervous system suppression in contributing to these effects. I think the authors could first identify that sympathetic neurons were impacted using a marker specific to catecholamine neurons (tyrosine hydroxylase, for example). Secondly, I think they could assess the effects in animals that lack SNS innervation to the target tissues in question using either surgical or chemical ablation (6-OHDA) approaches as opposed to a β-2 receptor agonist.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Pan et al., studied the consequences of manipulations of hypothalamic oxytocin (OT) neurons on pharmacologically induced colorectal cancer progression in mice. They use genetic and chemogenetic approaches to either chronically deplete all brain OT neurons or to selectively activate PVN OT neurons. Further, treatment with celastrol, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, which should excite OT neurons and which they applied into the cerebral ventricles daily over 3 weeks also inhibited colorectal cancer progression, an effect, which was attenuated in OT neuron-depleted mice.</p><p>Furthermore, brain treatment with celastrol suppresses neuronal activity in the celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion, and activation of β2 adrenergic receptor abolished the anti-tumor effect of centrally administered celastrol. In sum, the authors intend to show, by manipulation of the OT system its contribution to colorectal cancer progression. Although the experiments give some potential insights into the role of OT neurons in the immune responsiveness and the progression of colorectal cancer, novel causal relationships between the different findings are rather missing.</p><p>In order to increase the impact of the paper, especially to show causalities between OT manipulations and progression in colorectal cancer, the following points might be taken into consideration:</p><p>– What is missing is a proposed causal mechanism of the anticancer effect of OT neuron activation.

To examine this hypothesis the authors attempted to examine the extent to which oxytocin neurons might modulate incidence and progression of colitis induced cancer. To answer this question they looked at effects of both positive and negative manipulation of oxytocin neurons. They observed that inhibition enabled cancer progression and further that activation prevented cancer progression.</p><p>Initially the authors demonstrate that genetically enabled lesioning of oxytocin neurons allows increases colitis associated cancer progression. Then they further demonstrate that chemogenetic activation of oxytocin neurons decreases colitis associated cancer progression. To validate a novel reagent, they then demonstrate that a novel herbal isolate activates oxytocin neurons and also decreases colitis associated cancer progression. They demonstrate that lesioning of oxytocin neurons abrogates this effect. Finally, they demonstrated that their novel compound inhibited SNS outflow and that bypass of this inhibition with the β-adrenergic agonist abrogated its prevention of colitis associated cancer.</p><p>Strengths of the work demonstrating include multiple manipulations of oxytocin neuron activity on colitis associated cancer. One relatively weakness of the work is that the sympathetic nervous system effect was only examined in the context of their novel reagent.</p><p>This work provides a basis for how anxiety might alter cancer risk.</p><p>Overall this is a strong manuscript. As noted above, one weakness is the demonstration of oxytocin neuron downstream effects on the SNS and bypass by the β-adrenergic agonist only using the novel herbal reagent (rather than, for instance, in the DREADD-dependent model).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Stimulation of hypothalamic oxytocin neurons suppresses colorectal cancer progression in mice&quot; for further consideration by eLife. Your revised article has been evaluated by Mone Zaidi (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has addressed the responses of the previous reviewers and has been substantially improved. However, there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors should remove Figure 3S1-A-B as it does not provide helpful information to the paper. I have a concern over the use of TH intensity as a way to measure SNS activity in IBAT. As indicated in the paper by Vaughan and Bartness (Methods Enzymol, 537: 199-235, 2014): &quot;NETO is used as a direct neurochemical measure of sympathetic drive; as noted above, there is no surrogate for this method of assessment except for direct measures of sympathetic nerve activity electrophysiologically&quot;. The authors should remove mention of SNS activity within IBAT unless they can provide this assessment via NETO or electrophysiology. As mentioned earlier, the information provided is not the currently accepted approach to assess SNS in animals with IBAT denervation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67535.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In order to increase the impact of the paper, and to justify the conclusions drawn, especially to show causalilties between OT manipulations and progression in colorectal cancer, the following points should be taken into consideration:</p><p>1) The role of the sympathetic nervous system suppression in contributing to these effects is not yet clear.

The data indicate that excitation of Oxt<sup>PVN</sup> neurons rapidly suppressed the activities of TH-positive neurons in the CG-SMG (Figure 3A,B). In a separate experiment, we showed that i.c.v. administration of celastrol readily suppressed the activities of TH-positive neurons in the CG-SMG, and transection of the preganglionic fiber could significantly attenuate this effect (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A-C).</p><p>2) To address the reviewer’s second question, we elected to surgically remove CG-SMG in the <italic>Oxt<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Oxt<sup>Cre</sup>;DTA</italic> mice (Figure 3C-K). In agreement with our early observation, depletion of Oxt neurons promoted colitis-associated cancer (CAC) development in mice (Figure 3E-K). After the resection of CG-SMG, this effect was markedly abrogated (Figure 3E-K).</p><p>3) Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we examined the relationship between Oxt<sup>PVN</sup> neurons and β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) in the progression of CAC. The data indicate that the DREADD-mediated activation of Oxt<sup>PVN</sup> neurons (Figure 6A,B) suppressed CAC progression in mice (Figure 6C-J).

Our data indicate that depletion of Oxt neurons resulted in the elevation of circulating ACTH and corticosterone levels in mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 1L,M). Conversely, chemogenetic approach-mediated excitation of Oxt<sup>PVN</sup> neurons could lead to a significant decrease of ACTH and corticosterone levels in systemic circulation (Figure 1—figure supplement 2K,L).

The tumor tissues were then harvested and immune cells were assessed. The data show that the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was remarkably increased in the tumor tissue of the mice with Oxt<sup>PVN</sup> neuron activation, whereas other types of immune cell were not significantly impacted (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).

The data show that CAC progression was inhibited in the <italic>Oxt<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice in which Oxt<sup>PVN</sup> neurons had been stimulated (Figure 2C-J). Notably, blockade of OTR in the brain, which was achieved by injecting L-368,899 into the third ventricle, could markedly abolish the tumor suppression effect of Oxt<sup>PVN</sup> neuron activation (Figure 2C-J).

To examine this hypothesis the authors attempted to examine the extent to which oxytocin neurons might modulate incidence and progression of colitis induced cancer.

To validate a novel reagent, they then demonstrate that a novel herbal isolate activates oxytocin neurons and also decreases colitis associated cancer progression. They demonstrate that lesioning of oxytocin neurons abrogates this effect. Finally, they demonstrated that their novel compound inhibited SNS outflow and that bypass of this inhibition with the β-adrenergic agonist abrogated its prevention of colitis associated cancer.</p><p>Strengths of the work demonstrating include multiple manipulations of oxytocin neuron activity on colicitis associated cancer.

Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we examined the relationship between Oxt neurons in the PVN and β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) in the progression of colitis-associated cancer (CAC).

Notably, i.p. administration of isoprenaline, a β2AR agonist, could significantly attenuate this effect (Figure 6C-J).
