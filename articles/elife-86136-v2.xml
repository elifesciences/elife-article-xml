However, the mechanisms that drive these changes in circulating cells and their relationships to gene regulation are unknown. We identified age-associated DNA methylation sites in six purified blood-borne immune cell types (naive B, naive CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, granulocytes, monocytes, and NK cells) collected from healthy individuals interspersed over a wide age range. Of the thousands of age-associated sites, only 350 sites were differentially methylated in the same direction in all cell types and validated in an independent longitudinal cohort. Genes close to age-associated hypomethylated sites were enriched for collagen biosynthesis and complement cascade pathways, while genes close to hypermethylated sites mapped to neuronal pathways. In silico analyses showed that in most cell types, the age-associated hypo- and hypermethylated sites were enriched for ARNT (HIF1Œ≤) and REST transcription factor (TF) motifs, respectively, which are both master regulators of hypoxia response. To conclude, despite spatial heterogeneity, there is a commonality in the putative regulatory role with respect to TF motifs and histone modifications at and around these sites. These features suggest that DNA methylation changes in healthy aging may be adaptive responses to fluctuations of oxygen availability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>immune cells</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>healthy aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of human DNA sites differentially methylated with aging across six different primary immune cells suggests that the sensing of hypoxia drives the epigenetic clock.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human aging is associated with site-specific changes of DNA methylation. Summary measures of DNA methylation called ‚Äòepigenetic clocks‚Äô are extensively used in aging research to estimate biological age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horvath and Raj, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bocklandt et al., 2011</xref>). Epigenetic clocks closely approximate chronological age and beyond age, predict adverse health conditions, including frailty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gale et al., 2018</xref>), Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCartney et al., 2018</xref>), and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marioni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Research suggest that changes in DNA methylation with aging are regulated by specific mechanisms rather than by a stochastic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teschendorff et al., 2013</xref>). For example, a loss-of-function mutation in the H3K36 histone methyltransferase has been associated with epigenetic aging in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin-Herranz et al., 2019</xref>). In humans, polymorphisms in the telomerase gene (TERT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2018</xref>) and age-dependent gain of methylation in the Polycomb repressive complex 2 have been related to accelerated aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Teschendorff et al., 2010</xref>). However, so far, no sound hypothesis exists that explains the association of DNA methylation with aging and pathology.</p><p>A main obstacle in understanding mechanisms driving age-associated changes of DNA methylation is that most human studies were performed in mixed blood cell types. The few studies that investigated select immune circulating cells failed to propose a unifying biological hypothesis explaining predictable changes of DNA methylation with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dozmorov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reynolds et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tserel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kananen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acevedo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marttila et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We analyzed age-associated methylation in six purified blood-borne cell types sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 55 donors of ages ranging from 22 to 83 years. To minimize the confounding of age-associated pre-clinical and clinical diseases, participants were ascertained to be healthy by trained health professionals according to strict clinical criteria. We looked for CpGs differentially methylated with aging in the same direction in multiple cell types. Next, in each cell type, we conducted enrichment analyses of genes close to age-associated CpGs. Finally, we looked for chromatin accessibility markers and transcription factor (TF)-binding sites close to the same age-associated CpGs. Our findings suggest that changes in methylation with aging are related to fluctuation of energetic metabolism during the life course.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Age-associated methylation in individual cell types</title><p>A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on normalized DNA methylation data for all cell types from all the 55 donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Additionally, age-associated differentially methylated sites in PBMC poorly recapitulate age-dependent changes that take place in specific primary immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1E, F</xref>). These findings point to a wide heterogeneity of age-differential CpG methylation across immune blood cells and suggest that studies in PBMC poorly represents the changes that take place in specific cell types with aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Shared age-associated methylation across cell types</title><p>Only 181 age-associated hypomethylated sites and 169 hypermethylated sites were shared between all 6 cell types. These numbers increased to 776 (age-hypomethylated) and 404 (age-hypermethylated) sites in 5 or more cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Thus, most age-related methylation changes are cell specific. Of note, only 10 of the sites overlap with the 359 CpGs in Horvath‚Äôs pan-tissue epigenetic clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horvath, 2013</xref>). Several reasons can be attributed to this poor overlap including (1) use of methylation array with about 21,369 CpGs for development of the clock in contrast to the analyses in this study based on ~850,000 CpG sites; (2) use of data from peripheral or whole blood for development these clocks in contrast to data from flow-sorted circulating immune cells in this study. While the number of shared age-hypo- or hypermethylated CpGs across cells was relatively small, it was significantly much higher than that expected based on chance alone, suggesting that common underlying epigenetic mechanisms exist across the considered cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). For example, CpG sites adjacent to <italic>RCAN1</italic> (calcineurin 1) and <italic>KLF14</italic> (Krœãppel-Like Factor 14) show similar age-associated patterns in all cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>).</p><p>Next, we wanted to investigate whether the top age-associated genes are the ones which are shared across cell types.

THSD4 and CCDC102B were the most significant age-associated hypomethylated genes shared by five or more cell types, while ELOVL2, KLF14, LHFP14, and GPR158 were among the most significant age-hypermethylated genes in five or more cell types. This count increased to 5 and 13 genes, respectively, when the list was expanded to 50 top genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). It is noteworthy that only 13‚Äì15% of these ‚Äòtop‚Äô age-associated probes overlapped with the list of age-associated probes shared across cell types (181 hypomethylated and 169 hypermethylated probes).

For each cell type, all CpGs reported as significantly hypo- or hypermethylated with age (in beta-regression analyses adjusted for sex) were reanalyzed by incorporating data on seven pro-inflammatory cytokines (see Materials and methods for details). Briefly, by comparing a model with a cytokine as explanatory variable (CpG ~ age + sex + cytokine) with another model without it (CpG ~ age + sex), we explored the robustness of age as an explanatory variable of methylation change, as well as possible mediating effects arising from pro-inflammatory cytokines. Detailed results are provided in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/rxw6h/">OSF</ext-link> and summary statistics for each cell type, hypo-/hypermethylation association and pro-inflammatory cytokine are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>.

In addition, TNFRSF1B appears significantly associated with 9058 of the age-hypermethylated CpG sites in CD4 cells. For other cell types like B naive and monocytes, TNF-alpha was associated with 65‚Äì124 age-associated CpG sites, respectively. Fewer associations are observed for the remaining analytes. These results suggest a possible link between TNF-alpha signaling pathway, aging, and DNA methylation change in circulating immune cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Novel and important conclusions arise from our observations. First, only few CpG sites are hypo- and hypermethylated with aging across all circulating cells while majority of the significant age-associated methylation changes are cell selective. Indeed, several CpGs show differential age methylation in opposite directions in different cell types and are unchanged in PBMC, suggesting that they may be missed when studying mixed cell samples. Noteworthy, age-related methylation differences in this cross-sectional study were strongly and significantly correlated with longitudinal age-associated methylation changes in an independent population.</p><p>Second, age-associated hypomethylated sites were significantly enriched for active enhancers whereas age-hypermethylated sites were enriched for bivalent/polycomb regions, confirming previous findings in whole blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). Age-differential methylation coincided with specific chromatin status and histone markers patterns, suggesting that their position in proximity of promoter and active enhancer regions is connected with chromatic accessibility and potentially modulation of gene expression. Since the ENCODE data were only from two donors, it will be worthwhile to see how the histone or chromatin accessibility patterns change with age at and around these age-associated CpG sites.</p><p>Third, distinct TF-binding motifs co-localize with CpGs differentially methylated with aging despite wide variation in the distribution of such sites across cell types, suggesting a specific regulatory function. Noteworthy, the top age-associated TF identified, ARNT and REST act in coordination in hypoxia response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavadas et al., 2016</xref>). BCL6, another top TF-binding motif associated with age-differentially methylated CpG has also been shown to protects cardiomyocyte from damage during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu et al., 2019</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis that systematic methylation changes with aging may be induced by fluctuations in oxygen availability and energy metabolism. Interestingly, the mRNA encoding <italic>ARNT</italic> significantly increases with age in all cell types except monocytes, while mRNA coding for <italic>REST</italic> declines with aging in four cell types and shows no significant change in naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells. mRNAs coding for <italic>CTCF</italic> showed strong age association across numerous cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). The hypothesis that oxygen sensing regulates directly or indirectly DNA methylations is consistent with studies showing that in replicating fibroblasts, biological age estimated by DNA methylation slows down under hypoxia compared to normoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsuyama et al., 2019</xref>). Further, many genes close by to ‚Äòshared‚Äô age-differentially methylated CpG identified in our analyses play important roles in hypoxia response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>The specific mechanisms connecting age-related changes in DNA methylation in genes which also contain binding motifs the master hypoxia-response mediators remain unknown. Shahrzad et al. reported an inverse correlation between the severity of hypoxia and the degree of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shahrzad et al., 2007</xref>). There is evidence that hypoxia-induced hypermethylation may be due to reduced TETs activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thienpont et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings add to this literature by suggesting that a direct interaction between hypoxia-related TFs and DNA methylation at specific DNA sites occur with aging, perhaps as an adaptive response triggered by fluctuations in oxygen levels that occur in many age-related conditions. This hypothesis is consistent with oxygen availability been the most important environmental factor that requires physiological adaptation during pregnancy and development and extends this concept in a life course perspective.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that we have focused on circulating cells and, therefore, our findings may not apply to age methylation in other tissues. In addition, our findings were not replicated in an independent cross-sectional study population. Despite these limitations, this study has unique features: a cohort of exceptionally healthy donors and percent methylation was assessed in specific cell types obtained by cytapheresis and sorted by using state-of-the art methods.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Age-associated DNA methylation profiles of the six purified primary immune cell populations in the blood show more cell specificity than sharedness. However, we observe common regulatory features with respect to TF-binding motifs and histone modifications. Based on the consistent association of these methylated sites with ARNT and REST, which are master hypoxia regulators, we hypothesize that oxygen sensing and hypoxia drive mechanisms for changes in methylation. This hypothesis should be further explored in animal models with manipulation of oxygen levels and serial measures of DNA methylation in circulating immune cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cohort details</title><p>Buffy coat, PBMCs, and granulocytes were collected from Genetic and Epigenetic Signatures of Translational Aging Laboratory Testing study (GESTALT) study participants (<italic>N</italic> = 55; 34 men and 21 women; age 22‚Äì83 years) who were free of diseases (except controlled hypertension or history of cancer silent for &gt;10 years), not on medications (except one antihypertensive drug), had no physical or cognitive impairments, non-smokers, weighed &gt;110 lbs, had body mass index &lt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ubaida-Mohien et al., 2019</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A number of points require clarification as indicated by the reviewers. Please address each of these points in revision.</p><p>2) Clarify the study is a reanalysis of previously published data to shed light on new patterns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting study that potentially identifies a single fundamental mechanism that regulates chromatin changes in aging from stochastic changes. The notion that the methylation changes are cell selective is an interesting concept.</p><p>Building on the comments regarding circulating and tissue-resident cells, can the authors provide data to support or refute whether programs are consistent in the different compartments? It would strengthen the work to provide discussion on these points.</p><p>The interpretation of the data relies on changes in genes related to hypoxia to support that the metabolic state of the cell determines outcomes.

The identification of an inflammatory program in the data associated with aging is interesting. While it might occur that low-level inflammation is inherently associated with aging, distinguishing the two programs would be important in teasing the data apart. Thus, a current limitation of the work is the lack of cellular phenotypic and functional mapping corresponding to the molecular analysis to bring clarity to whether overlapping programs occur and inflammation contributes to driving aging normally, or whether separate programs usually occur in parallel but could overlap.

The authors claimed that clustering by cell type (PC2) was stronger than by age. For the PCA, it would be great if the authors could explain what PC1 indicates and present the information about all PCs.</p><p>2. It has been reported that sex-related differences contribute to immune cell aging (Huang et al., PNAS, 2021, PMID:34385315; Marquez et al., Nature Communications, 2020, PMID: 32029736). It is unclear how sex differences affect the dataset that the authors analyzed and how sex-adjusted Œ≤-regression was conducted.</p><p>3. The authors identified 350 age-associated differentially methylated sites among all six immune cell types and compared them with other published studies. Do these sites overlap with the DNA methylation clock sites identified in PBMCs since these sites change in the same direction in separate cell populations? Also, only 10 of these 350 sites overlap with Horvath's pan-tissue epigenetic clock. Is there any factor that can explain this difference? For example, sequencing depth, coverage, etc?</p><p>4. In the legend of Figure 2, the most significant genic probes are classified as -log10(padj)&lt;10. Did the author mean -log10(padj)&gt;10?</p><p>5. It needs to be clarified how the top 15 genes were chosen. How many age-associated CpGs contribute to these 15 genes? Also, if more genes are considered, will more genes be shared among cell types?</p><p>6. In Figure 3C and 3D, the differences in Œ≤ coefficient in the InCHIANTI study are small (scale at 0.003 and 0.006). Are the differentially methylated sites called in GESTALT identified as differentially methylated in the original InCHIANTI study?</p><p>7. In Figure 4C and Supp Figure 4, it seems both hypo- and hyper-methylated sites with age show the V-shaped pattern.</p><p>8. It is unclear how the expression levels were measured. Expression levels from qPCR or RNA-seq need to be shown in addition to Supp Table 6. RNA-seq was mentioned in the method section, and if this was performed in this study, the quality metrics for the data need to be provided and the data need to be uploaded to GEO. The current GEO number (GSE184269) provided in this manuscript is linked to a published study and does not contain RNA-seq data.</p><p>9.

Ten of these genes (right side of Figure 5C, genes under orange headings) have been linked to hypoxia response (37-46).

The data analyzed in this manuscript were collected in the context of the GESTALT study, a study of biomarkers of aging that is run in parallel to the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging at the clinical site of the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program in Baltimore. The senior author of this manuscript designed the study and has been the œÄ of this project from the beginning. Part of the GESTALT cohort data was previously deposited in the public domain as requested by the previous publication journal. In particular, the methylation data was previously used to explore epigenetic differences between different types of circulating immune cells in a previous published study [1]. However, methylation data was never used previously to look at association with aging, and to explore whether some CpG sites are differentially methylated with aging in the same direction across various circulating cell types. Identification of such shared CpG sites can suggest mechanisms of their agerelated changes. We note that it is common that data collected in a cohort study are used for multiple analyses that explore different hypotheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an interesting study that potentially identifies a single fundamental mechanism that regulates chromatin changes in aging from stochastic changes.

To investigate further into the role of age-associated inflammatory phenotype, we analyzed the published protein data from the same cohort of donors to look for age-associated changes in seven cytokines (IL6, IL1RN, IL1A, IL1B, TNF, TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF1B)[2]. For each cell type, all CpGs reported as significantly hypo- or hyper-methylated with age (in Œ≤-regression analyses adjusted for sex) were reanalyzed by separately adding each one of the seven pro-inflammatory cytokines Supplementary File 11. By comparing a model with a cytokine as explanatory variable (CpG ~ age + sex + cytokine) with another model without it (CpG ~ age + sex), we explored the robustness of age as explanatory variable of methylation, as well as possible mediating effects arising from pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p>In the Supplementary File 11, columns (C-J) show that the age association remains significant for most CpGs, even after adding one of these inflammatory mediators into the model. Interestingly we find that for age associated hypermethylated sites in CD4 cells, 10% of the CpGs associated with age show significant association with TNFRSF1A in the model which implies an association of these methylated sites or genes with the cytokine production and/or release in the circulation. The remaining columns (K-Q) show the number of CpGs for which there‚Äôs a significant association between CpG and the target analyte (in the model adjusted for age and sex). As noted above, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B are associated with more than 7000 CD4 age-associated hypermethylated CpGs, suggesting an important role of age-differential methylation in the pro-inflammatory state of aging. For other cell types (most notably, B na√Øve and monocytes) TNF-Œ± appears to play a role. Fewer associations are observed for the remaining analytes.</p><p>The new analysis has been added to the results and the description of the analysis has been added to the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors claimed that clustering by cell type (PC2) was stronger than by age. For the PCA, it would be great if the authors could explain what PC1 indicates and present the information about all PCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed gene set enrichment analysis with the top 500 CpG probes corresponding to PC1, PC2 and PC3. Following this, the probes were annotated to nearby genes as per manufacturer‚Äôs annotation file and the genes which had probes with both positive and negative values for a PC were excluded. With the revised manuscript, we have provided a supplementary spreadsheet with columns providing information on the associated PC component and direction. A filter with q-value&lt;1.e-5 was imposed to highlight the most significant pathways. PC1 genes are enriched for T cell receptor and Natural killer cells -associated pathways while PC2 shows enrichment of Hallmark IL2 STAT5 signaling and Reactome innate immune system. We conclude that PC1 contributes more towards separation of CD4, CD8 and NK cells from B cells, monocytes and granulocytes while PC2 separates the innate from the adaptive cells. The details have been added to the Results section (page 4) and the Methods section (page 18) along with the addition of Supplementary File 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It has been reported that sex-related differences contribute to immune cell aging (Huang et al., PNAS, 2021, PMID:34385315; Marquez et al., Nature Communications, 2020, PMID: 32029736). It is unclear how sex differences affect the dataset that the authors analyzed and how sex-adjusted Œ≤-regression was conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed Œ≤ regression with age and sex as two variables and in order to get the probes associated with age, we only selected the probes with adjusted p value for age &lt;0.05 and excluded the ones that were also had p&lt;0.05 for sex (N &lt;1000 probes in total). We have added this information in greater detail in the Methods section (page 17). We also agree with the reviewers that identifying sex-differences is an interesting avenue for future research with greater number of samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors identified 350 age-associated differentially methylated sites among all six immune cell types and compared them with other published studies. Do these sites overlap with the DNA methylation clock sites identified in PBMCs since these sites change in the same direction in separate cell populations? Also, only 10 of these 350 sites overlap with Horvath's pan-tissue epigenetic clock. Is there any factor that can explain this difference? For example, sequencing depth, coverage, etc?</p></disp-quote><p>There can be several reasons for the observation that the CpGs identified in our study show only a small overlap with those identified in Horvath‚Äôs epigenetic clock. The ‚ÄúHorvath clock‚Äù was developed on methylation from multiple tissues and the ‚ÄúHannum clock‚Äù was developed from whole blood. The contribution of different cell types depends on their frequency, and therefore methylation sites that change with aging in cells that are present in a high proportion would be predominant on those that only exist in low proportion. Indeed, the Horvath epigenetic clock works better in the GESTALT study when the data from PBMC are considered (59 probes overlapped instead of 10). Also, since these methylation clocks are statistically derived through a regression model using 21369 probes present in 27k microarray, it is possible that neighboring CpG gets picked up for the clock or many of the 850k sites went unrepresented. We have added this explanation to the Results section on page 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In the legend of Figure 2, the most significant genic probes are classified as -log10(padj)&lt;10. Did the author mean -log10(padj)&gt;10?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the error. It has been fixed in the figure legend of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It needs to be clarified how the top 15 genes were chosen. How many age-associated CpGs contribute to these 15 genes? Also, if more genes are considered, will more genes be shared among cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the question. As a clarification we have incorporated additional information on number of age-associated probes for each of these top 15 genes in the Supplementary File 5. In Figure 1, we have looked at the overlap of all age-associated probes. Here we wanted to focus on whether the most significant age-associated genes are shared across cell types. When we increased the selection to the top 50 genes (new data added to Supplementary File 5), the number of shared age-hypo- or hypermethylated genes increase by only 5 and 13 genes respectively. This underscores our conclusion that ‚Äúmost CpGs with age-associated methylation consistent across cell types undergo moderate (although significant) methylation changes with aging.‚Äù We have rephrased this part of the Results on page 6 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 3C and 3D, the differences in Œ≤ coefficient in the InCHIANTI study are small (scale at 0.003 and 0.006). Are the differentially methylated sites called in GESTALT identified as differentially methylated in the original InCHIANTI study?</p></disp-quote><p>Changes in methylation with age (per year) tend to be small although they may be highly significant. Taking that into account, both the cross-sectional and longitudinal association with aging in the InCHIANTI are consistent in direction with those detected in the GESTALT study for the ‚Äúshared‚Äù age-related CpG methylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 4C and Supp Figure 4, it seems both hypo- and hyper-methylated sites with age show the V-shaped pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>As correctly noted by the reviewer we do observe a V pattern and strong H3K4me1 peak at age-associated hypo as well as hypermethylated sites. This implies that the age-associated sites are enriched for active and/or primed enhancers. However, as the DHS and histone data in the ENCODE database was only available for either one of 2 donors (a 21-year-old male and a 37-year-old female), we were unable to see how the patterns change with age. We have added this note to the revised manuscript in the Results section (page 9) and Discussion section (page 13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. It is unclear how the expression levels were measured. Expression levels from qPCR or RNA-seq need to be shown in addition to Supp Table 6. RNA-seq was mentioned in the method section, and if this was performed in this study, the quality metrics for the data need to be provided and the data need to be uploaded to GEO. The current GEO number (GSE184269) provided in this manuscript is linked to a published study and does not contain RNA-seq data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their valid concern. We would like to clarify that expression values of the transcription factors are obtained from RNA-Seq data. In the paper we have specifically looked into the expression of 3 selected transcription factors to look for their association with age. Towards this, we have provided an additional Supplementary File 8 with the Kallisto TPM normalized values for the three transcription factors along with the sequencing data quality metrics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. There are several places where the authors mentioned &quot;data not shown&quot;.

No specific trend was observed for H3K4me3 and H3K27ac (data not shown)‚Äù. We have added the results for H3K4me3 and H3K27ac to the Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1 and edited the Results section of revised manuscript (page 9).</p><p>2.‚ÄúWe identified 35 genes that were hypomethylated with aging and had close by an ARNT motif in all six cell types (Data not shown)‚Äù.

We have added the results for all the 26 genes with REST motif in the vicinity, to the Supplementary File 10 and edited in the Results section of revised manuscript (page 11). We also corrected a typing error as there are 26 genes and not 20 (page 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific suggestions for Authors:</p><p>1) As mentioned in the public review, certain claims should be toned down or placed in context.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of the paper, we have added new citations and new data to address the concern raised by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors need to make it clear in the introduction that this current study is based on the reanalysis of a data set they have published in 2021 and describe key findings and limitations of the initial study.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with this statement. Very often data produced by cohort studies are reanalyzed according to different hypotheses. For example, NIA maintains the Baltimore Longitudinal study of aging and more than 1500 manuscript have been published over the last 20 years. Similarly, the genetic data from the UK biobank have been used for hundreds of analyses and produced some of the most interesting works in the literature over the last 10 years. There are probably hundreds of examples, including the Framingham study, the Cardiovascular Heart Study, the Health ABC study, and the Health and Retirement survey. In none of these cases, the content of previous papers is reported in the introduction, especially when, as in this case, the results are not relevant for the analysis reported in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not clear from the methods and figure legends that motif predictions were done on DMRs that could be found in at least 5 cell types, as only loosely mentioned in the text. Please clarify this point in methods and legends.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback. We used all the age-associated probes for HOMER analysis and not just the ones shared across 5 or more cell types. We added the associated details of the analysis on pages 17 and 20.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Presumably, motif enrichment was performed against a genomic background. This information is not found in the methods and should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the missing details. We added the HOMER background associated details in the Methods section on page 19. Briefly, HOMER software creates a list of background sequences which are randomly selected from the genome and matched for GC% content to the list of target sequences. We used this background file for our motif search in HOMER.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Motif enrichment analysis was done in windows of +200bp around DMRs. Please explain why this choice was made and whether a narrower window (e.g., 100bp) would yield drastically different outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate a very valid point raised by Reviewer 3. We have used a 200bp window because it is the default size in HOMER software. However following Reviewer 3 comments we reanalyzed the data with +50bp window size and the results have been tabulated in the revised Supplementary File 7. We observe that the top hits across 5 of the 6 cell types continue to be ARNT and CTCF for age-hypomethylated sites and REST for age-hypermethylated sites. Of note, unlike the hits with 200bp window size, Arid5a and Bcl6 were not observed in 50bp window size indicating that these motifs are comparatively farther from the CpG sites. We have added a note about the new analysis and the results on page 10 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Can the authors speculate on why they see enrichment for neuronal and pancreas gene ontology pathways related to conserved DNA methylation changes?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the question regarding the relevance of the abovementioned pathways to our study. A recent study by Ewing et al. found CpG sites getting hypermethylated in immune cells of multiple sclerosis patients mapped to neuronal pathways where they argue that neuronal genes like GRIN, GRID and Netrin play a critical role in immune cell development as well (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31053557/). Also, a paper by Karagiannis et al. finds neuronal genes in their PBMC aging data. Both references have been added to the Results section (page 8). However, didn‚Äôt find much with respect to pancreatic genes in the literature warranting future investigation in this direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Data should be shown in important instances like &quot;We identified 35 genes that were hypomethylated with aging and had close by an ARNT motif in all six cell types (Data not shown). Ten of these genes (right side of Figure 5C, genes under orange headings) have been linked to hypoxia response (37-46). Similarly, we found 20 genes with probes hypermethylated with age and with REST motif in the vicinity in all six cell types (data not shown).&quot; Please provide the information.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions. We have added the information in Supplementary File 10 along with modifying the Results section in the revised manuscript on page 11.</p></body></sub-article></article>
