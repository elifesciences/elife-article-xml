Pharmacological studies have identified Nts as a potent hypothermic agent. The medial preoptic area, a region that plays an important role in the control of thermoregulation, contains a high density of neurotensinergic neurons and Nts receptors. The conditions in which neurotensinergic neurons play a role in thermoregulation are not known. In this study, optogenetic stimulation of preoptic Nts neurons induced a small hyperthermia. In vitro, optogenetic stimulation of preoptic Nts neurons resulted in synaptic release of GABA and net inhibition of the preoptic pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (Adcyap1) neurons firing activity. GABA-A receptor antagonist or genetic deletion of Slc32a1 (VGAT) in Nts neurons unmasked also an excitatory effect that was blocked by a Nts receptor 1 antagonist. Stimulation of preoptic Nts neurons lacking <italic>Slc32a1</italic> resulted in excitation of <italic>Adcyap1</italic> neurons and hypothermia. Mice lacking <italic>Slc32a1</italic> expression in Nts neurons presented changes in the fever response and in the responses to heat or cold exposure as well as an altered circadian rhythm of body temperature. Chemogenetic activation of all Nts neurons in the brain induced a 4–5°C hypothermia, which could be blocked by Nts receptor antagonists in the preoptic area. Chemogenetic activation of preoptic neurotensinergic projections resulted in robust excitation of preoptic <italic>Adcyap1</italic> neurons. Taken together, our data demonstrate that endogenously released Nts can induce potent hypothermia and that excitation of preoptic <italic>Adcyap1</italic> neurons is the cellular mechanism that triggers this response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurotensin</kwd><kwd>preoptic area</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd><kwd>thermoregulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS124844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tabarean</surname><given-names>Iustin V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS094800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tabarean</surname><given-names>Iustin V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Norn Group</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Impetus grant 70051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tabarean</surname><given-names>Iustin V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Preoptic neurotensinergic neurons co-release GABA and neurotensin, triggering a rapid initial inhibition followed by a sustained excitation, and mice lacking GABA release from these neurons exhibit altered thermoregulation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homeotherms, including mammals, maintain core body temperature (CBT) within a narrow range, an essential requirement for survival.

The effect was associated with a robust increase in the frequency of IPSPs from 0.5 Hz to 21.8 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, inset). Overall, optogenetic stimulation of nearby MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic><sup>;<italic>ChR2</italic></sup> neurons reduced the firing rate of the recorded MPO neurons from 5.10±1.32 Hz to 1.39±0.36 Hz (n=9).

Upon ending the photostimulation a transient increase in firing rate was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We therefore studied the effect of photostimulation during incubation with the GABA-A receptor antagonist gabazine (5 µM). In the presence of the antagonist, the same neurons displayed the opposite effect, an increase in firing rate in response to photostimulation. Their firing rate was 7.89±2.61 Hz (n=9) in the presence of gabazine and increased to 9.57±2.83 Hz (n=9) during photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

These neurons are GABAergic as indicated by detection of <italic>Slc32a1</italic> transcripts as well as by the activation of gabazine-sensitive IPSCs in postsynaptic neurons in response to spot illumination of MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic><sup>;<italic>ChR2</italic></sup> neurons. Interestingly, this population had a tendency to burst in response to depolarization, a characteristic of neurosecretory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Black et al., 2014</xref>). In response to optogenetic stimulation MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic><sup>;<italic>ChR2</italic></sup> neurons released both GABA and Nts as indicated by pharmacological experiments. Postsynaptically, increased frequency of IPSCs was detected instantaneously upon photostimulation while an inward current was activated after 20–40 s, indicating a differential timecourse of action. In view of its slower timecourse of action, Nts may act to limit and/or shorten the inhibitory effect of GABA on the activity of the postsynaptic neurons following increased burst of activity of MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic> neurons. Nevertheless, the net effect during photostimulation was a decrease in the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron, an increase in firing rate being unmasked only upon ending photostimulation or in the presence of gabazine. Recordings from MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic><sup>;<italic>Slc32a1-/-;ChR2</italic></sup> neurons confirmed the activation of an inward current in postsynaptic neurons in response to photostimulation. The inhibition-excitation sequence observed here is compatible with a scenario where the postsynaptic neuron is inhibited if the presynaptic neurotensinergic neurons are active and quickly activated upon the end of this presynaptic spiking. In more general terms, a temporal sequence where fast inhibition precedes a slower excitation allows to quickly reset the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neurons making them ready to respond to new stimuli. The initial inhibition can also reset or synchronize neural activity, allowing the subsequent excitation to produce more precisely timed spiking assuming the process occurs simultaneously across a population of neurons. Alternatively, the sequence of inhibition followed by excitation can contribute to generating and maintaining rhythmic activity in neural networks and create oscillatory patterns at specific frequencies, depending on those of the synaptic input. Finally, the overall responsiveness of a neural circuit can be influenced by rapid inhibition to reduce gain followed by excitation to increase it.</p><p>In terms of local neuronal networks, MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic> neurons did not present reciprocal connections instead, they appeared to synapse onto MPO<italic><sup>Adcyap1</sup></italic> neurons. <italic>Adcyap1</italic> has been identified as a marker of preoptic thermoregulatory neurons activated in a warm environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tan et al., 2016</xref>) and also during torpor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hrvatin et al., 2020</xref>).

It is possible that MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic> neurons overlap with a previously hypothesized population of inhibitory neurons that receive peripheral cold input and project to EP3 neurons to trigger thermogenesis and inhibit heat loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Morrison and Nakamura, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nakamura et al., 2022a</xref>).</p><p>In view of the potent hypothermic properties of Nts when applied peripherally, centrally or in the preoptic area it was surprising to find that photostimulation of MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic><sup>;<italic>ChR2</italic></sup> neurons in vivo resulted in a mild hyperthermia, instead. In contrast, photostimulation of MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic><sup>;<italic>Slc32a1-/-;ChR2</italic></sup> neurons, which caused a net excitation of MPO<italic><sup>Adcyap1</sup></italic> neurons, resulted in hypothermia, supporting the idea that their excitation induces hypothermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hrvatin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have revealed that, in the preoptic area, GABA exerts complex effects on CBT depending on the environmental context and the specific neuronal subpopulation involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Frosini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ishiwata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Osaka, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Nts<sup>cre</sup> Slc32a1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice displayed significantly different thermoregulatory characteristics suggesting that GABA release from neurotensinergic neurons plays an important role in the respective responses. The fever response to endotoxin, when compared with the control, was characterized by lower CBT during the intermediate and late phases of the fever suggesting that GABA signaling is involved in the hyperthermic mechanisms activated. This finding is in line with the previous reports that preoptic GABA can induce thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ishiwata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Osaka, 2004</xref>); however, it is in disagreement with observations that the induction of fever is associated with decreased synaptic inhibition in the preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Osaka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tabarean et al., 2004</xref>).

Indeed, we observed that during heat exposure the CBT of <italic>Nts<sup>cre</sup> Slc32a1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice increased significantly faster than in the controls suggesting that in a warm environment GABA release from neurotensinergic neurons is involved in the control of heat loss mechanisms.</p><p>During cold exposure <italic>Nts<sup>cre</sup> Slc32a1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice displayed higher CBT relative to controls. Previous studies have revealed increased endogenous release of GABA in the preoptic area during cold exposure and hypothermic effects of exogenous GABA-A antagonist in a cold environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ishiwata et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, a decreased release of GABA from <italic>Nts<sup>cre</sup> Slc32a1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> neurons would be expected to induce a larger hypothermia during cold exposure, the opposite of the observed results. However, while an increase in preoptic GABA concentration induces hyperthermia, at all ambient temperatures, a widespread central increase in GABA is hypothermic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Frosini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nikolov and Yakimova, 2011</xref>), therefore it is possible that <italic>Slc32a1</italic> deletion in Nts neurons outside of the MPO may impact CBT during cold exposure and/or that the respective regions are differentially recruited during distinct thermoregulatory mechanisms.</p><p>Finally, <italic>Nts<sup>cre</sup> Slc32a1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice have entered the ‘up’ phase of the circadian CBT rhythm earlier and ended it later when compared to the control, supporting a role of neurotensinergic neurons, possibly in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, in the control of circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Meyer-Spasche et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamada et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>To question whether stimulation of all central neurotensinergic neurons induces hypothermia, we have generated <italic>Nts<sup>cre</sup> hM3D<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice. Chemogenetic activation of central <italic>Nts<sup>cre</sup> hM3D<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> neurons resulted in robust hypothermia, comparable to that induced by central infusion of exogenous neurotensin. The response was largely blocked by NtsR1 and NtsR2 antagonists injected in the MPO, suggesting that the locus of action is the MPO. Taken together our results suggest that stimulation of neurotensinergic neurons in the MPO is not sufficient to induce hypothermia although this region represents the locus where the hypothermia is triggered. The amplitude and duration of the hypothermia oberved when activating all central <italic>Nts<sup>cre</sup> hM3D<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> neurons is reminiscent of the characteristics of the torpor state. A previous study has identified a population of preoptic <italic>Adcyap1</italic> neurons is involved in the entry in the torpor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hrvatin et al., 2020</xref>). Since in this study we found that preoptic <italic>Adcyap1</italic> neurons receive excitatory input from neurotensinegic neurons outside the preoptic area, it is possible that these projections are involved in the initiation of torpor state.</p><p>Experiments at the cellular level showed that locally applied CNO in slices from <italic>Nts<sup>cre</sup> hM3D<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice had a net excitatory effect in nearby MPO<sup>Adcyap1</sup> neurons. In addition to the actions observed during photostimulation of MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic><sup>;<italic>ChR2</italic></sup>, namely increased sIPSCs frequency and an inward current, CNO also increased the frequency and amplitudes of sEPSCs recorded in MPO<italic><sup>Adcyap1</sup></italic> neurons. This may be due to activation of glutamatergic projections from brain regions that contain glutamatergic <italic>Nts<sup>cre</sup> hM3D<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> neurons. Such neurons have been identified in the posterior thalamus and in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhong et al., 2019</xref>). It is also possible that some of the parabrachial nucleus neurons’ glutamatergic projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2020</xref>) are also neurotensinegic. It is likely that the chemogenetic stimulation of MPO <italic>Nts<sup>cre</sup> hM3D<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> neurons and projections elevates the local Nts concentration to a level that activates the low affinity NtsR2. These receptors are expressed in MPO astrocytes and upon activation stimulate glutamate release from nearby synaptic terminals as observed when exogenous Nts is applied locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tabarean, 2020</xref>).

Washington DC: National Research Council, National Academies Press). The protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Scintillon Institute. The standards are set forth by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and in the Animal Welfare Act. The work was designed in such a way to minimize the number of animals used as well as their suffering.</p><p>The <italic>Nts-cre</italic> driver line (B6;129-Ntstm1(cre)Mgmj/J; stock no: 017525) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">St-Gelais et al., 2006</xref>) was purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The <italic>Nts</italic>-cre driver line was crossed with the Slc32a1tm1Lowl (also referred to as VGATflox/flox) (Jackson Laboratory; stock no: 012897) to generate mice that have the GABA vesicular transporter Slc32a1 (solute carrier family 32 member 1), knocked-down in Nts neurons.

To ensure that only cre-expressing neurons were targeted we have carried out control injections of the two viral vectors in wild-type C57/Bl6 mice (3 mice for each) and confirmed that no fluorescent signal was detected in the brain of these mice. We have carried out RNAscope for Nts (see below) to determine the colocalization with eYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) in three MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic><sup>;<italic>ChR2</italic></sup> mice. We have studied colocalization from six randomly chosen field of view from three slices from three different animals and found colocalization in 82% (355 out of 433) of the Nts positive neuros. Only 4 out of 359 eYFP neurons appeared to be Nts-negative (1.1%).

Key sets of experiments were also performed in female mice as specified in the text.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Estrous cycle monitoring</title><p>Female mice have a 4–6 days estrous cycle that consists of four stages – proestrus, estrus, diestrus I/metestrus, and diestrus/II. Mice were habituated to handling and vaginal smears prior to the behavioral experiments. Mice were swabbed daily before 9 a.m. and experiments started after 10 am. The stage of the cycle was determined using vaginal cytology. The smears were stained with hemalum-eosin and analyzed microscopically. Experiments in females were carried out in diestrus days since during this stage the baseline CBT is less variable for each animal and among different animals. The days of diestrus are characterized by the presence of leukocytes and the absence of keratinized epithelial cells with no nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Telemetry and MPO injections</title><p>For CBT measurements the mice (4–6 months old) were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction 3–5%, maintenance 1–1.5%) and radio telemetry devices (Anipill, BodyCap, Hérouville Saint-Clair, France) were surgically implanted into the peritoneal cavity. For MPO injections, mice were stereotaxically implanted with a bilateral guide cannula (27 Ga) as described in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tabarean, 2021</xref>). Coordinates for cannula implants in the MPO were: from Bregma: 0.05 mm, 0.35 mm, and −0.35 mm lateral, and ventral 4.75 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>).The ambient temperature was maintained at ~28  ±  0.5°C in a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle-controlled room (lights on 8:00 am, ZT0). All substances injected were dissolved in sterile artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). For MPO injections, mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame and the injector (33 Ga) was lowered inside the cannula. A volume of 100 nL (rate 0.1 μL/min) was delivered using an injector connected to a microsyringe (0.25 μL). After injections the animal was returned to the home cage. Injections were carried out at 10 am local time, during the ‘subjective light period’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>Coronal tissue slices containing the MPO were prepared from mice 4–6 months old MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic><sup>;<italic>ChR2</italic></sup>, MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic><sup>;<italic>Slc32a1-/-;ChR2</italic></sup> or <italic>Nts<sup>cre</sup> hM3D<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice. The slice preparation was as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tabarean, 2021</xref>). The slice used in our recordings corresponded to the sections located from 0.15 mm to –0.05 mm from Bregma in the mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Whole-cell patch-clamp recording</title><p>Whole-cell patch-clamp clamp was performed as described in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tabarean, 2021</xref>). The aCSF contained (in mM) the following: 130 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 glucose, osmolarity of 300–305 mOsm, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4. Other salts and agents were added to this saline. Whole-cell recordings were carried out using a K<sup>+</sup> pipette solution containing (in mM) 130 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 EGTA, 2 ATP and 1 GTP (pH 7.3). The electrode resistance after back-filling was 2–4 MΩ. All voltages were corrected for the liquid junction potential (−13 mV). Data were acquired with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) digitized using a Digidata 1550 interface and the Pclamp10.6 software package. The sampling rate for the continuous recordings of spontaneous activity was 50 kHz. The cell capacitance was determined and compensated using the Multiclamp Commander software.</p><p>The recording chamber was constantly perfused with extracellular solution (2–3 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>). The antagonists were bath-applied. The bath temperature was maintained at 36–37°C by using an inline heater and a TC-344B temperature controller (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA).</p><p>Synaptic activity was quantified and analyzed statistically as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tabarean, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lundius et al., 2010</xref>). Synaptic events were detected and quantified (amplitude, kinetics, frequency) off-line using a peak detection program (Mini Analysis program, Synaptosoft, Decatur, NJ, USA). Events were detected from randomly selected recording stretches of 2 min before and during incubation with pharmacological agent. Cumulative distributions of the measured parameters (inter-event interval, amplitude, rise time, time constant of decay) were compared statistically using with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test (K-S test, p&lt;0.05) using the Mini Analysis program. The averages for the measured parameters (frequency, amplitude, rise time, time constant of decay) for each experiment were obtained using the Mini Analysis program. Event frequency was calculated by dividing the number of events by the duration (in seconds) of the analyzed recording stretch.</p><p>Spot illumination of MPO<italic><sup>Nts</sup></italic><sup>;<italic>ChR2</italic></sup> neurons was carried out using a Polygon300 illumination system (Mightex, Toronto, Canada) that allows the control of the size, shape, intensity and position of the illuminated spot as described previously. In a field of view there were 1–4 fluorescent neurons. The position and size of the spot were controlled using the PolyScan2 software (Mightex). The intensity of the light at the bottom of the recording chamber was measured using a photosensor (ThorLabs, Newton, NJ, USA) and ranged from 1.2 to 1.4 mW/mm<sup>–2</sup>. The light pulses were 50ms long and delivered at 10 Hz for durations of 20–120 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Optogenetic stimulation in vivo</title><p>A dual fiber-optic cannula (100 µm diameter, NA 0.22, 0.7 mm pitch; Doric Lens, Quebec, Canada) was implanted as described above for the guide cannula. Light pulses were applied using high-power photodiodes, a digital and analog I/O control module and Polygon 300 software (Mightex, Toronto, Canada) via dual fiber cables (Doric Lens, Quebec, Canada). The intensity of the light at the end of the optic cannula was measured using a fiber photodiode power sensor (ThorLabs, Newton, NJ, USA) and ranged from 3.9 to 4.3 mW/mm<sup>–2</sup>. The light pulses were 50ms long and delivered at 10 Hz for 30 s periods followed by 10 s recovery breaks.

The content of the pipette was expelled in a PCR tube. dNTPs (0.5 mM), 50 ng random primers (Invitrogen) and H<sub>2</sub>O were added to each cell to a volume of 16 μl. The samples were incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and then put on ice for 3 min. First strand buffer (Invitrogen), DTT (5 mM, Invitrogen), RNaseOUT (40 U, Invitrogen), and SuperScriptIII (200 U, Invitrogen) were added to each sample to a volume of 20 μl followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 min, at 50 °C for 50 min and then at 75 °C for 15 min. After reverse transcription samples were immediately put on ice. One μl of RNAse H was added to samples and kept at 37 °C for 20 min. PCR assays were carried out using the pairs of primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1-table 1</xref>. The PCR products were verified using Sanger sequencing. Two rounds of PCR, using nested primers, were used to detect <italic>Nts</italic> and <italic>Slc17a6</italic> transcripts. For <italic>Adcyap1</italic> and <italic>Slc32a1</italic> a second round of PCR was not necessary since it did not yield additional positives when compared with the first round. Two negative controls were routinely carried out. The first one was amplified from a harvested cell without reverse-transcription while the second was represented by a RT/PCR of the ‘pipette tip’ (e.g. obtained when a successful gigaseal was not achieved and the cytoplasm was not harvested by suction). Since all single MPO cells tested were negative to <italic>Slc17a6</italic> a second positive control was carried out. Ventromedial hypothalamic neurons, a predominantly glutamatergic population was tested.
