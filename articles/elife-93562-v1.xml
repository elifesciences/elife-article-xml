However, there are dozens of unique atomic-resolution structures of these aggregates, and such a highly polymorphic nature of the α-synuclein fibrils hampers efforts in disease-relevant in vitro studies on α-synuclein amyloid aggregation. In order to better understand the factors that affect polymorph selection, we studied the structures of α-synuclein fibrils in vitro as a function of pH and buffer using cryo-EM helical reconstruction. We find that in the physiological range of pH 5.8–7.4, a pH-dependent selection between Type 1, 2, and 3 polymorphs occurs. Our results indicate that even in the presence of seeds, the polymorph selection during aggregation is highly dependent on the buffer conditions, attributed to the non-polymorph-specific nature of secondary nucleation. We also uncovered two new polymorphs that occur at pH 7.0 in phosphate-buffered saline. The first is a monofilament Type 1 fibril that highly resembles the structure of the juvenile-onset synucleinopathy polymorph found in patient-derived material. The second is a new Type 5 polymorph that resembles a polymorph that has been recently reported in a study that used diseased tissues to seed aggregation. Taken together, our results highlight the shallow amyloid energy hypersurface that can be altered by subtle changes in the environment, including the pH which is shown to play a major role in polymorph selection and in many cases appears to be the determining factor in seeded aggregation. The results also suggest the possibility of producing disease-relevant structure in vitro.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>α-synuclein</kwd><kwd>amyloid</kwd><kwd>polymorphism</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>205320_182800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riek</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The amyloid polymorph selection that occurs during α-synuclein aggregation is dictated by environmental conditions, in particular pH, with the largest variety of structures being observed near neutral pH.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyloid fibrils are a unique class of self-assembled filamentous protein/peptide aggregates that have been associated with dozens of human diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, type II diabetes, and prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiti and Dobson, 2006</xref>). It has long been established that all amyloids contain a common structural scaffold known as the cross β-sheet motif, yet only more recently, with the advent of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meier et al., 2017</xref>) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) helical reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He and Scheres, 2017</xref>), has it become clear that this shared repetitive motif can generate a wide range of structural folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iadanza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sawaya et al., 2021</xref>). Yet unlike globular proteins, whose amino acid sequence typically guides the protein folding process into a unique 3D structure, the amyloid structures derived from a single peptide sequence are often polymorphic: they can exist in various stable 3D architectures. Another unique property of amyloids is their tendency to induce their own formation in a self-replicative manner. Amyloid formation is a nucleated growth process analogous to the growth of a 1D crystal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Riek and Eisenberg, 2016</xref>) and can therefore be kinetically enhanced through templating on preformed fibrillar structures, termed seeds. Thus, in seeding, the amyloid fold itself acts as a structural template for nucleation and growth, whereby protein monomers are induced into the amyloid conformation and contribute to fibril elongation. Additionally, as revealed by kinetic experiments, there are secondary nucleation processes, which include de novo nuclei formation on the lateral surface of the amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Törnquist et al., 2018</xref>). Structural polymorphism and seeding-enhanced growth are two hallmarks of amyloid structural biology. However, despite their likely importance in the etiology of many diseases, the factors that control polymorphs and the molecular mechanisms of seeding are poorly understood.</p><p>Amyloid polymorphs whose differences lie in both their tertiary structure (the arrangement of the β-strands) and the quaternary structure (protofilament-protofilament assembly) have been found to display distinct biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Uemura et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peelaerts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van der Perren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bousset et al., 2013</xref>). In the case of the protein tau, cryo-EM has been used to correlate 14 different tauopathies with distinct combinations of 8 different amyloid polymorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2021</xref>). In the case of α-synuclein (α-Syn), the structures of many in vitro polymorphs have been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guerrero-Ferreira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guerrero-Ferreira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schweighauser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hojjatian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGlinchey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lövestam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frieg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sun et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frieg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2023</xref>) and yet, they are all distinct from the polymorphs that have been sarkosyl-extracted from the brains of patients of both multiple systems atrophy (MSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schweighauser et al., 2020</xref>) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Understanding how these disease-relevant polymorphs form and reproducing them in vitro will be critical in the study of these synucleinopathies. Some clues are present in the sarkosyl-insoluble brain-derived structures: two MSA polymorphs contain an unidentified molecule at the interface of the protofilaments and in the PD polymorph an unidentified molecule appears to be stabilizing the structure of the monofilament fibril. These findings support the idea that the polymorph type is in some way associated with the disease, and that the environment plays a critical role in amyloid formation, essentially dictating which polymorphs are accessible.</p><p>Concerning the seeding of polymorphs, it was demonstrated that prion strains with their specific pathologies can be serially transmitted from animal to animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prusiner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguzzi and Rajendran, 2009</xref>) and that strains can be amplified in vitro by protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saborio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soto et al., 2002</xref>) or similar approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Srivastava et al., 2022</xref>). However, in vitro, amyloid seeding is not always faithful in reproducing the seed polymorph. In the case of α-Syn, PMCA-based seeding has been proposed as a diagnostic tool that could also differentiate between MSA and PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerez and Riek, 2020</xref>). However, attempts to amplify the MSA and the PD patient-derived polymorphs in vitro with recombinant α-Syn have so far resulted in structures distinct from those that were extracted with sarkosyl from patient brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lövestam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strohäker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2021</xref>). These results could be due to the strong role of secondary nucleation in the in vitro seeding processes, which in the case of α-Syn have been shown to involve flexible interactions that might not be able to transmit polymorph-specific structural information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerez and Riek, 2020</xref>). However, it could also be that multiple polymorphs exist in diseased tissues and that the sarkosyl-based procedure itself selects different polymorphs compared to the PMCA-based procedures. Nonetheless, seeding with α-Syn disease-derived amyloids has, at least for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived seeds, some diagnostic utility as it been shown that under conditions of low α-Syn monomer, patient-derived CSF can seed several polymorphs while healthy CSF does not seed amyloid formation at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2023</xref>). On the other hand, seeding experiments with in vitro-derived polymorphs have yielded mixed results in that some polymorphs are seemingly easier to reproduce via seeding. For example, the Type 4 polymorph from E46K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2021</xref>) or G51D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2021</xref>) mutants can be transmitted to wild-type α-Syn, and a polymorph that forms normally only at low salt can be produced at high salt and vice versa by using very high seed concentrations (10%) and by limiting primary and secondary nucleation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bousset et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peduzzo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Having observed the plethora of α-Syn fibril polymorphs published in just the last few years, we set out to investigate the relationship between α-Syn polymorphs and their aggregation conditions. The speed and abundance of polymorphs being discovered have led to inconsistent naming conventions, and in this work, we expand upon previous nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guerrero-Ferreira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guerrero-Ferreira et al., 2019</xref>) which is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, whereby polymorphs with distinct folds are assigned different Arabic numerals and sub-polymorphs formed through different protofilament interfaces given different letters (with the exception of polymorph 1B whose name is kept for consistency with previous publications despite itself being a distinct fold, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We find that the pH of the aggregation condition is a major but not the only factor in determining which polymorph is formed in vitro. While attempting to reproduce the published conditions for the Type 2 polymorph, we found a new polymorph (here termed Type 5) and a monofilament Type 1 polymorph, providing further evidence that the energetic landscape of α-Syn aggregation is rough with many interconnected local minima. In addition, our findings with cross-pH seeding experiments support the notion that seeding with α-Syn is non-polymorph-specific under conditions of secondary nucleation-dominated aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peduzzo et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with difficulties in recreating the in vivo observed fibrils through seeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lövestam et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The polymorphs formed in vitro by wild-type α-synuclein (α-Syn).</title><p>The numbered backbone Cα traces depicting a single chain from each of the five types of polymorphs that have been reported to form in vitro with wild-type α-Syn but without cofactors.

Two mutant structures for the Type 3 fold are included in order to show the special 3A and 3D interfaces that form for these mutants (shaded background).

The authors of these structures often try to frame newly observed polymorph(s) in the context of the diseases associated with α-Syn aggregation. However, given so many published structures, an examination of the conditions under which the polymorphs were formed also offers hints into the environmental influences of polymorph selection. In particular, we noted that Type 1 structures were observed almost exclusively above pH 7.0, while Type 2 and 3 structures were observed below pH 7.4 and down to pH 6.5. To systematically analyze the effect of buffer and pH, we studied the structures of α-Syn amyloids of the full-length, N-terminally acetylated protein formed under a variety of conditions. In a first series, we produced α-Syn amyloids in PBS (10 mM PO<sub>4</sub>, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl) at the physiological pH values of 7.4, 7.0, 6.5, and 5.8.</p><p>At pH 5.8 we observed exclusively the Type 3 structures 3B and 3C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Considering the similarities between Type 2 and 3 structures (see below), it is noteworthy that an A-interface polymorph was not observed for Type 3. In its place, we find the 3C polymorph for which the interface contacts are shifted by one residue with respect to 2A and are now defined by a salt bridge between E46 and K58 instead of K45 and E57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In the previously reported Type 2A and 2B structures solved from a single sample aggregated in PBS at pH 7.4, the major polymorph (83%) was 2A. In our first sample prepared at pH 5.8, we observed 3B as a major polymorph (&gt;90%) with 3C as a minor polymorph. We hypothesized that the absence of a ‘3A’ polymorph and the presence of the 3B as the major polymorph could be related to the ionic strength of the buffer used in aggregation. Therefore, we also pursued cryo-EM structures under similar conditions but with an additional 50 mM or 100 mM NaCl. While we did see a difference in the relative abundance of the 3B and 3C polymorphs in these samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), ‘3A’ was never detected nor was there an obvious correlation between the NaCl concentration and the 3B:3C polymorph population. In fact, in a second sample prepared under the same original PBS conditions which had yielded an approximately 93%:7% 3B:3C ratio, we encountered yet another ratio of 54%:46%, leading us to the conclusion that stochastic or not well-controlled conditions affect the selection between the ‘B’ and ‘C’ interface variants of Type 3 fibrils.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>3D classification of particles in fibril samples from various conditions.</title><p>The 3D classes obtained in RELION for five different fibril samples grown at pH 5.8 and 6.5 in PBS with or without additional NaCl are shown. Each box presents the output classes from one sample with the ratio of the polymorphs determined by the number of particles assigned to each class and the total number of particles used indicated in the center of the box.

It is therefore noteworthy that in the five independent amyloid samples that we prepared at pH 5.8, none of them contained a detectable level of Type 2 fibrils. However, in the sample prepared at pH 6.5, we did indeed see a mixture of Types 2 and 3 (2A:2B:3B:3C at 25%:18%:31%:26%), suggesting that Type 2 is not accessible below pH 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The structural basis for the Type 3 preference at lower pH may lie in the protonation state of glutamic acid residues in the vicinity of the C-terminal β-strand (i.e. E83) or of H50, two regions where polymorphs 2 and 3 are most distinct from each other (discussed below). The fact that we observe the same set of polymorphs in the absence of MSA seed material suggests that not only was the seeding described above non-polymorph specific but also that pH was the main polymorph determinant. Seeding experiments have also been performed with CSF of PD patients at pH 6.5, this time with N-terminally acetylated α-Syn, yielding once again the 3B and 3C polymorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In both the MSA and Parkinson’s-CSF seeding experiments, the authors also reported on some samples that produced Type 1-like polymorphs which, unlike most in vitro polymorphs, existed primarily as single monofilament fibrils. These are noteworthy because the large majority of in vitro and in vivo α-Syn polymorphs are composed of more than one protofibril, most often with a C2 or pseudo 2<sub>1</sub> helical symmetry. Therefore, we were surprised to find that in several pH 7.0 aggregation samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we also observed a Type 1 monofilament fibril polymorph (termed 1<sub>M</sub>), similar to those from the MSA and Parkinson’s-CSF seeding experiments and very similar to the Juvenile-onset synucleinopathy (JOS) polymorph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lövestam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strohäker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, discussed below). This again indicates that seeding experiments may be influenced by environment-dictated polymorph formation. Also puzzling to us is that we could not produce Type 2 polymorphs at pH 7.0 or 7.4 despite previous reports of 2A and 2B being formed under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guerrero-Ferreira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frieg et al., 2021</xref>). In yet another of the pH 7.0 aggregation samples we found a completely new polymorph which we have termed Type 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Apart from its novel fold, it is unusual in the number of residues that are visible/ordered in the structure, starting from the acetylated N-terminal methionine (buried at the dimer interface) up until residue 96. Interestingly in a recent BioRxiv manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2021</xref>) (for which the coordinates are currently on hold), a similar polymorph is found upon seeding with MSA and PD material, again suggesting that the environment could play a role in the selection of polymorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The juvenile-onset synucleinopathy (JOS)-like Type 1<sub>M</sub> polymorph.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Type 1<sub>M</sub> monofilament structure (PDB:8PK2) overlaid with its EM density (including the unmodeled density).

Therefore, we were somewhat surprised that after measuring cryo-EM data for six independent fibrillization samples at pH 7.0 and 7.4 in PBS or Tris (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), we could not detect any Type 2 polymorphs. Instead, we found that at pH 7.0 in PBS, the samples exhibited a multitude of polymorphs including one having mostly flat (not twisted) fibrils of variable width and the other two each yielding a new polymorph (5A and 1<sub>M</sub>). However, in Tris buffer at pH 7.0 we did produce polymorph 1A as the major species. Considering the strong temperature dependence of the Tris p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>, it is worth noting that our Tris buffer was prepared for pH 7.0 at the fibrillization temperature of 37°C. Returning to PBS but at pH 7.4, polymorph 1A was the dominant species in both samples that we prepared, even though one was seeded by 5% Type 3 fibrils that had grown at pH 5.8 (the latter discussed in more detail below). While in our hands 1A is the preferred polymorph above pH 7.0, regardless of the buffer used, we also observed a higher degree of sample variability in the samples grown at pH 7.0 and 7.4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In order to further explore the variability/reproducibility of the pH 7.0 polymorphs, we measured cryo-EM data for six more independent fibril samples for a total of 10 samples, all aggregated independently at pH 7.0 and originating from four different batches of purified α-Syn (datasets 7–16, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In three of these pH 7.0 samples we did finally reproduce the type 2A/B polymorphs (datasets 11–13), two of which also had a significant amount of Type 1<sub>M</sub> fibrils. In yet two others datasets (14–15) we observed only Type 1A. Several samples contained predominantly non-twisted fibrils and could therefore not be used for helical reconstruction. In most samples, we also observed fibrils that were thinner or wider than the known polymorphs, but these were not pursued due to a poor homogeneity between fibrils, lack of twist, or an insufficient number of specimens and so were excluded either during manual picking or later in 2D and 3D classification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>On the structural heterogeneity of Type 1 polymorphs</title><p>27 structures of Type 1 polymorphs have been reported, mostly in the pH range of 7.0–7.4 in distinct buffers including Tris or phosphate and comprised of full-length α-Syn, N-acetylated α-Syn, shorter constructs (i.e. 1–103, 1–122), familial mutants (i.e. A53T, A53E, H50Q, and a seven residue insertion associated with JOS), patient-derived material (i.e. MSA and JOS), and fibrils that were seeded by MSA, PD, and dementia with Lewy bodies material (including brain or CSF). The Type 1 polymorphs display a large structural heterogeneity both at the tertiary structure level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and at the quaternary level, having distinct protofilament interfaces or even existing as a monofilament fibril (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guerrero-Ferreira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schweighauser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lövestam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sun et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frieg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2023</xref>). This can be rationalized in part, for example, with the familial mutants A53T, A53E, and H50Q which all have been found in polymorph 1C with its smaller protofilament interface (residues 59–60) compared to 1A (residues 50–57). The mutants lie at the 1A interface, destabilizing it and favoring the smaller interface of 1C or even the monofilament 1<sub>M</sub> (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the context of how buffer conditions influence the polymorph structure, it is interesting to mention that in the presence of phosphate, the K58 side chain is often facing out toward the 1A protofilament interface, thereby forming a triad with K43 and K45 of the other protofilament to surround some extra density that is interpreted to be phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This constellation of lysine residues is found in about two-thirds of the dozen structures of amyloids grown in the presence of phosphate. In contrast, in phosphate-free conditions (such as Tris, PIPES, or unbuffered) K58 is facing into the core in about two-thirds of a dozen structures, forming a salt bridge/hydrogen bond with E61. Since in the presence and absence of phosphate both K58 orientations have been documented, other buffer details such as pH may also be relevant for this and other variations. Furthermore, it points to a rather shallow amyloid energy hypersurface that can be altered by subtle changes in the environment.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Structural variability within the Type 1 polymorphs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Seven pairwise overlays of the wild-type 1A structure (PDB:6A6B) with other wild-type and mutant structures depicting the range of structural variability that is found in the Type 1 fold.

In this polymorph, the 1A protofilament interface is disrupted by an additional β-strand comprising the N-terminal residues E12-E25, yielding a monofilament structure that we term Type 1<sub>M</sub> as well as a double protofilament structure with a unique protofilament interface. Consequently, the lysine triad of 1A is lost (with K58 still facing outward), but now K43 and K45 together with K21 and K23 of the N-terminal additional β-strand embrace a small molecule that is likely negatively charged, yielding overall a similar local structural arrangement around K43 and K45 (and H50). An attempt to produce the JOS polymorphs in vitro using a mixture of wild-type α-Syn and variant containing the JOS-associated seven-residue insertion MAAAEKT after residue 22 yielded instead polymorph 1A structures with the typical protofilament interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). However, in our structure-buffer relationship screening, a JOS-like 1<sub>M</sub> polymorph containing the additional N-terminal strand of the JOS polymorph was obtained with wild-type N-terminally acetylated α-Syn. There is only a small difference in the conditions, pH 7.4 versus pH 7.0 in PBS, that lead to the 1A versus the JOS-like 1<sub>M</sub> polymorphs, again illustrating the shallow energy surface between the polymorphs and the critical role of the buffer conditions in polymorph selection. The in vitro prepared JOS-like 1<sub>M</sub> polymorph superimposes with the JOS purified material almost entirely except for the aforementioned K58 side chain facing inward in the former and outward in the latter, and the unassigned peptide density in the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The cryo-EM map for the JOS-like 1<sub>M</sub> fibrils also has an additional sausage-like density, likely for a β-strand, but it was not used for model building because it lacked enough features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>On the structural heterogeneity of Type 2 and 3 structures</title><p>The structures of Type 2 and 3 polymorphs share some similarities, however, there are significant differences that justify their assignment to unique polymorph classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AB</xref>). First, there is a displacement of the structural fragment comprising residues V52-T72 which appears to move on the G51 and G73 hinges. The turn with residues G73-A78 is again similar between the two structures but beyond this, there is an ‘inside-out’ rearrangement of the C-terminal β-strand (A85-G86-S87-I88-A89-A90-A91-T92) such that only in the Type 2 polymorph can the N-terminal fragment (V15-K21) form an additional β-strand packed against the β-strand A85-A91 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guerrero-Ferreira et al., 2018</xref>). However, also within Type 2 and 3 polymorphs exists a large structural heterogeneity: some polymorph 3 structures have an ‘inside-out’ C-terminal β-strand but still without the N-terminal fragment present. In terms of the interface variants, there is a difference between our Type 3B structure and that of from the MSA-seeded Type 3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lövestam et al., 2021</xref>).

However, a close inspection reveals that they are different, comprising neighboring sets of E/K residues: K45/E57 in 2A and E46/K58 in 3C. This is remarkable because there is no obvious reason that the ‘C’ interface is preferred over the ‘A’ interface. An example of a 3A polymorph has been reported but it is in the context of the E46K mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyer et al., 2020</xref>) and formed in an unbuffered solution. The familial PD mutant α-Syn (E46K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zarranz et al., 2004</xref>) has been extensively studied and the structures of fibrils of this mutant have been reported at pH 7.5 in Tris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 2020a</xref>), at pH 7.4 in PBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guerrero-Ferreira et al., 2019</xref>) and as mentioned above, unbuffered in 15 mM tetrabutylphosphonium bromide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyer et al., 2020</xref>). The Tris condition produced a Type 4 polymorph, the PBS a Type 2A, and the unbuffered condition a Type 3A. Interestingly, since the 2A and 3A polymorphs share the same dimer interface with symmetric K45/E57 salt bridges it is clear that the ‘A’ interface is not mutually exclusive with the Type 3 polymorph. However, it is still not clear as to why Type 3B and 3C polymorphs, both with E46 in their salt-bridged dimer interfaces, are preferred for the wild-type protein but we suspected that it was only through the elimination of E46 that the E46K mutant could access the 3A polymorph. To test this further, we produced E46K fibrils at pH 5.8, the condition where until now only Type 3 has been observed and uncovered yet another Type 3 polymorph with a new interface termed 3D formed by an E57/K58 salt bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This was surprising considering the previously mentioned Type 3A structure of this mutant and suggests that the Type 3 fibrils formed at pH 5.8 are somehow distinct from those formed, until now only by mutants, above pH 7. While researching deposited α-Syn structures we found another Type 3D polymorph (PDB entry 7WO0, not yet published) that is formed by the A53T mutant in the presence of 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> at pH 7.6. Finally, the coexistence of polymorphs 2A/2B and 3B/3C at pH 6.5 indicates either that they all have a similar thermodynamic stability or that some of them are kinetically trapped, the latter possibility having been observed in one case of two distinct α-Syn polymorphs grown in a single condition (10 mM Tris, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.0 at 37°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pálmadóttir et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The Type 5 structure</title><p>Apart from its novel fold, polymorph 5A is unusual in the number of residues that are visible/ordered in the structure, starting from the acetylated N-terminal methionine (buried at the dimer interface) up until residue E96. As is often the case, there are shared structural motifs between Type 5 and other α-Syn polymorphs. In particular, residues 47–72, comprising a two β-strand motif with a turn in between, overlay very well with the polymorph formed by a Y39 phosphorylated α-Syn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2020b</xref>) and to a lesser extent in Types 2, 3, and 4 as well. However, the first 35 residues are distinct in that they are usually disordered (Types 1 and 3), or only a segment thereof binds to the core in Type 2 or polymorph 1<sub>M</sub>. Within this segment, there are seven lysine and five glutamic/aspartic acid residues and five of the lysine residues are buried inside the structure and form salt bridges with buried glutamic/aspartic acid residues. This yields two large cavities separated only by the very polar segment G31-K32-T33-K34-E35-G36, and it is likely that these two cavities are filled with water. In comparison to the other known polymorph structures the size of the cavities and the presence of five internal salt bridges are unique. Only polymorph 1 shows a small significant cavity which as discussed above usually appears in the presence of phosphate buffer. However, even the more compact Type 3 structures which do not have any obvious cavities contain networked channels of waters that are shared between the wild-type Type 3B and E46K Type 3D structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). The occurrence of the Type 5A polymorph thus reflects again on the promiscuity of α-Syn polymorph formation, the influence of slight changes in buffer conditions, and more specifically the potential role of lysine residues in polymorph selection. It is also worth mentioning that in the 10 independent aggregations that we analyzed at pH 7.0, the Type 5 structure was found in only one sample, and then, in only 10–20% of the observed fibrils in the sample. The remainder of the fibrils in the sample were non-twisted and therefore could not be analyzed by 3D reconstruction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The buffer environment can dictate polymorph during seeded nucleation</title><p>While for many amyloids, seeded growth results in replication of the structural polymorph of the seeds, in at least one instance, the seeding with MSA brain-derived fibrils failed to reproduce the seed polymorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lövestam et al., 2021</xref>). One explanation could be the absence of the as yet unknown cofactor that appears to be bound in MSA polymorphs. However, as we have observed, the buffer environment/condition may play such an important role in polymorph selection that we wondered whether, for pure in vitro seeding experiments with in vitro-derived seeds, it would be the environment or the seed which dictates the resulting polymorph. To address this, we used fibrils of polymorph 3B/3C produced at pH 5.8 as seeds (5%) in seeding experiments at pH 7.4 and as a control at pH 5.8. The inverse experiment was also carried out with fibrils of the Type 1 polymorph produced at pH 7.4 used as seeds (5%) in seeding experiments at pH 5.8. In both cases, control seeding experiments were performed at the pH of the original seed fibrils. For these analyses, we monitored the effect of seeding on the kinetics of fibril formation using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rogers, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">LeVine, 1999</xref>) and probed the structures of the resulting seeded fibrils by cryo-EM.</p><p>In terms of kinetics, the presence of seed fibrils consistently accelerated the aggregation of α-Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). However, in the cryo-EM analyses of the fibrils produced at pH 5.8 with pH 7.4 seeds, only the polymorphs 3B and 3C are detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) and in the inverse case, with fibrils produced at pH 7.4 with pH 5.8 seeds only polymorph 1A is detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). We were unable to detect any traces of the seed polymorphs in either of the cross-seeded aggregations despite the fact that 5% seeds were used. Limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schopper et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Souza and Picotti, 2020</xref>), a quantitative technique that enables the detection of nearly single residue resolution structural differences/alterations in proteins in bulk solution, confirmed these findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). In our LiP-MS analysis, we digested the fibril samples with the sequence-unspecific protease proteinase K for a limited amount of time to generate structure-specific proteolytic fingerprints and then identified and differentially quantified peptides between the different fibril states by MS analysis. To obtain single amino acid resolution in our comparison of the structural features of different types of fibrils, we first assigned a score accounting for the extent of change between samples and a measure of statistical significance to each detected peptide and then aligned the peptides with overlapping regions to calculate the mean score value for each amino acid (see Methods for details). Thus, larger differences between two structures yield higher per-residue scores. LiP-MS analysis revealed that fibrils generated at pH 7.4 (F3) and pH 5.8 (F4), in the presence of unfragmented fibrillar seeds generated at pH 5.8 and pH 7.4 respectively, are on average more similar in their structure to the fibrils generated without seeds at pH 7.4 (F1) and pH 5.8 (F2), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). These data suggest that fibrillar conformations resulting from seeding monomeric α-Syn with unfragmented fibrillar seeds are driven by pH and not by the structure of the seed.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Cross-seeding does not preserve the seed polymorph.</title><p>Fibrils produced at pH 7.4 (F1) and pH 5.8 (F2) were used as seeds to generate new fibril samples with fresh α-synuclein monomer: at pH 7.4 with 5% unfragmented pH 5.8 seeds (<bold>F3</bold>) or at pH 5.8 with pH 7.4 seeds (F4).

In fibril elongation, the incoming protein adopts the conformation of the seed by attaching itself to the end of the fibril. In this process of growth acceleration, which is proportional to the number of fibril ends, the polymorph structure is expected to be preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jarrett and Lansbury, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jarrett and Lansbury, 1992</xref>). In the secondary nucleation process, de novo aggregation occurs on the sides of the fibril and therefore the kinetics of secondary nucleation is proportional to the mass of the fibril (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knowles et al., 2007</xref>). In the case of α-Syn, the secondary nucleation mechanism has been proposed to be based on the interaction of the positively charged N-terminal region of monomeric α-Syn and the disordered, negatively charged C-terminal region of the α-Syn amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumari et al., 2021</xref>). The interaction is transient but causes a further unfolding of the monomeric α-Syn while increasing its local concentration and possibly aligning it in a way that promotes aggregation. Since all known amyloid polymorphs of α-Syn are disordered in their C-terminal regions, we propose that secondary nucleation in α-Syn aggregation is generally polymorph unspecific. This conclusion is consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peduzzo et al., 2020</xref>, who showed that at lower seed concentrations under which secondary nucleation dominates over fibril elongation, the environment dictates the resulting polymorph. It is worth noting that unfragmented fibrils will likely favor secondary nucleation, while with shorter fibrils and more available ends per unit mass, elongation could dominate.</p><p>In addition to the α-Syn seeding experiments discussed until now, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strohäker et al., 2019</xref>, used NMR to analyze the results of PMCA using both PD and MSA seed material in PBS buffer at pH 7.4 in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. Both samples yielded indistinguishable polymorphs. Hence, it appears that their protocol amplified the seeds via secondary nucleation for which a single polymorph can be expected and whose identity is dependent on the environment; here that includes 1% Triton X-100 and 5% wt/vol brain homogenate. In another PMCA study that is published currently only on the BioRxiv server, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2021</xref>, use both MSA and PD patient-derived material to produce a new polymorph which they name Type 6. A similar Type 6 fold was obtained irrespective of whether the starting material was from an MSA or PD patient brain, however protofilaments were arranged in a disease-specific manner. Interestingly, the Type 6 fold resembles the Type 5 that we found at pH 7.0, deviating however in its three different protofilament interfaces yielding polymorphs 6A, 6B, and 6C as well as extra density that the authors have assigned to the C-terminal residues. Without the deposited coordinates for the Type 6 structures it is difficult to ascertain how similar these polymorphs are to Type 5, however, their obvious similarity suggests that the environment of the PMCA seeding could have played a role in determining the amplified polymorph. Here, the environment includes the brain homogenate at 2% wt/vol and the PMCA buffer: 150 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2021</xref>) at 37°C, which considering the temperature dependence of the Tris p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> could actually be close to pH 7 and thus similar to the buffer conditions that produced Type 5. However, it must also be stated that in addition to the cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2021</xref>), previous cell biological and biochemical support for polymorph-specific seeding of the MSA and PD patient-derived material under the same buffer conditions has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van der Perren et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The general impact of the environment for seeding assays was recently investigated in an RT-QuIC assay for which 168 different conditions were tested to find those optimal for α-Syn aggregate detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martinez-Valbuena et al., 2022</xref>). The results indicate that seeding experiments with α-Syn can be very sensitive to the environment and that it is a multifactorial problem where there is not a single optimal pH or optimal salt condition. Another recent report compared the biological activity of (non-seeded) in vitro fibrils versus those amplified from Lewy body diseased brains upon injection into mice brains, with the finding that only the latter faithfully models key aspects of Lewy body disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Uemura et al., 2023</xref>). The fact that a pH of 7.4 was used during the seeding process further suggests that there are other environmental factors at play in polymorphs selection. Considering the importance of reproducing the disease-relevant polymorphs and the often irreproducibility of amplification assays it is apparent that approaches need to be found that can establish robust methods for α-Syn polymorph-specific amplification. In addition to finding appropriate buffer conditions, we propose that any approach that reduces or eliminates secondary nucleation is worth pursuing. This could be potentially achieved by using shorter, fragmented fibrils as seeds thereby increasing the fibril end-to-side ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van der Perren et al., 2020</xref>) or alkaline fibrillation conditions and higher salt concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumari et al., 2021</xref>) where secondary nucleation appears to be less prominent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buell et al., 2014</xref>). The importance of salt for seeded polymorph replication has also been reported for the polymorph-specific seed replication between the non-ThT-sensitive ribbon polymorph and a fibril polymorph that succeeds in 150 mM KCl (with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 37°C) but not in the absence of KCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bousset et al., 2013</xref>). Another approach would be to use an N-terminal-truncated version of α-Syn or to proteolytically remove the disordered C-terminus from the seeds. While it has been shown that with a larger proportion of seeds, it is possible to drive the growth by elongation instead of secondary nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bousset et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peduzzo et al., 2020</xref>), this may be difficult to achieve by starting from in vivo material due to limited sample amounts. Finally, the use of molecules that inhibit secondary nucleation by binding to the C-terminus of α-Syn such as the protein BRICHOS could be explored.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The presented study, which focuses on the pH-dependence of fibril polymorph selection in both de novo as well as seeded fibril growth, shows the complexity of the fibril formation process, yielding many distinct polymorphs whose diversity is attributed to the absence of an evolutionary selection toward aggregation.

With respect to disease, the in vitro generation of a JOS-like polymorph could be obtained, and the problem of polymorph-unspecific seeding could in many experimental settings be attributed to secondary nucleation, opening an avenue to resolve this open problem in cell and animal disease studies and diagnosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Recombinant protein expression and purification of α-Syn</title><p>Recombinant N-terminally acetylated, human WT α-Syn was produced by co-expressing the pRK172 plasmid with the yeast <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase complex B (NatB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21(DE3*). α-Syn was expressed and purified according to the previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campioni et al., 2014</xref>) with slight modification.

processing</title><p>Image processing and helical reconstruction were carried out with RELION 4.0, following the procedure for amyloid structures as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheres, 2020</xref>. Movies were gain-corrected and RELION’s own motion correction was used to correct for drift and dose-weighting and CTF estimation was done using Ctffind4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). Individual filaments were either manually selected or selected with the Topaz implementation in RELION. The segments were extracted in a 333 Å box (except for dataset 13, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for which a 260 Å box was used) with an inter-box distance of 33 Å and initially binned 4× to a pixel size of 2.6 Å for 2D classification. In the case of mixed polymorphs, larger box sizes were also used to help visually separate the classes and extract the crossover distances. For mixed polymorph datasets, the segments belonging to different classes were separated either by inspection of the 2D classes or by the new filament subset selection tool in RELION (version 5). For the new polymorphs (1<sub>M</sub> and 5) we then used <italic>relion_helix_inimodel2d</italic> to generate an initial model that could be used for the subsequent 3D refinement steps. In some datasets, the polymorphs were separated purely by 3D classification and for others purely by filament subset selection (indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As the refinement progressed, the refined particles were re-extracted at either 1.3 Å/pixel (2× binning) or 0.65 Å/pixel (no binning) depending on the current resolution. For the deposited datasets, Bayesian polishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zivanov et al., 2019</xref>) and CTF refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zivanov et al., 2020</xref>) were performed to improve the resolution of the reconstructions. The deposited reconstructions were sharpened using standard postprocessing procedures in RELION.

Briefly, Proteinase K (PK) was added at a 1:100 enzyme-to-substrate ratio to 2 μg of α-Syn in 100 μl of LiP-buffer. Four independent PK digestions (technical replicates) were performed for each condition at 37°C for 5 min. Subsequently, PK activity was halted by incubating the samples at 99°C for 5 min. After the PK heat-inactivation step, all the samples were incubated for 5 min on ice. Sodium deoxycholate (DOC, 10%) was added to each sample to achieve a final DOC concentration of 5%. Next, the samples were reduced with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride at a final concentration of 5 mM at 37°C for 40 min with shaking at 800 rpm in a thermomixer (Eppendorf). Alkylation was performed with iodoacetamide at a final concentration of 40 mM in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. To decrease the DOC concentration to 1%, the samples were diluted with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Next, sequencing-grade porcine trypsin (Promega) and Lysyl endopeptidase LysC (Wako Chemicals) were added to the samples at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:100. The samples were digested overnight in a thermomixer at 37°C with continuous agitation at 800 rpm. After overnight incubation, the digestion was stopped by adding 100% formic acid (FA) (Carl Roth GmbH) to achieve a final concentration of 2%. Finally, precipitated DOC was removed by three cycles of 20 min centrifugation at 21,000 rcf. The samples were loaded onto Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters), desalted, and subsequently eluted with 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA. The samples were analyzed by Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in DIA mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gillet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cappelletti et al., 2021</xref>). The raw MS data were searched with Spectronaut (Biognosys AG, version 15) and statistical data analysis was performed in R version 4.3.1. A two-tailed t-test was used to calculate p-values. Scores were designated to each detected peptide, calculated as a product of the -log<sub>10</sub>(p-value) and |log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)|. Subsequently, we calculated the mean value of this score for each amino acid based on overlapping peptides.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-93562-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability</title><p>The Cryo-EM maps have been deposited in the EMDB under the accession codes: 17723, 50860, 50077, 50888, 17693, 17726 and 17714.

A deeper understanding of the factors influencing the formation of various α-syn polymorphs remains elusive. The manuscript by Frey et al. provides a comprehensive exploration of how pH variations (ranging from 5.8 to 7.4) affect the selection of α-syn polymorphs (specifically, Type1, 2 and 3) in vitro by using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and helical reconstruction techniques. Crucially, the authors identify two novel polymorphs at pH 7.0 in PBS. These polymorphs bear resemblance to the structure of patient-derived juvenile-onset synucleinopathy (JOS) polymorph and diseased tissue amplified α-syn fibrils. The revised manuscript more strongly supports the notion that seeding is a non-polymorph-specific in the context of secondary nucleation-dominated aggregation, underscoring the irreplaceable role of pH in polymorph formation.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>This study systematically investigates the effects of environmental conditions and seeding on the structure of α-syn fibrils. It emphasizes the significant influence of environmental factors, especially pH, in determining the selection of α-syn polymorphs. The high-resolution structures obtained through cryo-EM enable a clear characterization of the composition and proportion of each polymorph in the sample. Collectively, this work provides a strong support for the pronounced sensitivity of α-syn fibril structures to the environmental conditions and systematically categorizes previously reported α-syn fibril structures. Furthermore, the identification of JOS-like polymorph also demonstrates the possibility of in vitro reconstruction of brain-derived α-syn fibril structures.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>All my previous concerns have been resolved to my satisfaction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93562.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Frey</surname><given-names>Lukas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Dhiman</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Qureshi</surname><given-names>Bilal M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rhyner</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Guerrero</surname><given-names>Ricardo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Atlanta</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pokharna</surname><given-names>Aditya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kwiatkowski</surname><given-names>Witek</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Serdiuk</surname><given-names>Tetiana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Picotti</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Riek</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zürich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zürich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Greenwald</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><p>Revisions Round 1</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful reading of our manuscript and have taken all of their grammatical corrections into account.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The paper contains multiple instances of non-scientific language, as indicated below.

Additionally, this condition also fosters the formation of flat ribbon-like fibril across different batches. Notably, at pH 5.8, variations in experimental groups yield disparate abundance ratios between polymorph 3B and 3C, indicating a degree of instability in fibrillar formation. The variability would potentially pose challenges for replicability in subsequent research. In light of these situations, I propose the following recommendations:</p><p>(a) An explicit elucidation of the factors contributing to these divergent outcomes under similar experimental conditions is warranted. This should include an exploration of whether variations in purified protein batches are contributing factors to the observed heterogeneity.</p></disp-quote><p>We are in complete agreement that understanding the factors that lead to polymorph variability is of utmost importance (and was the impetus for the manuscript itself). However the number of variables to explore is overwhelming and we will continue to investigate this in our future research. Regarding the variability between batches of purified protein, we also think that this could be a factor in the polymorph variability observed for otherwise “identical” aggregation conditions, particularly at pH 7 where the largest variety of polymorphs have been observed. However, even variation between identical replicates (samples created from the same protein solution and simply aggregated simultaneously in separate tubes) can lead to different outcomes (see datasets 15 and 16 in the revised Table 1) suggesting that there are stochastic processes that can determine the outcome of an individual aggregation experiment. While our data still indicates that Type 1,2 and 3 polymorphs are strongly selected by pH, the selection between interface variants 3B vs. 3C and 2A vs. 2B might also be affected by protein purity. Our standard purification protocol produces a single band by coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE however minor truncations and other impurities below a few percent would go undetected and, given the proposed roles of the N and C-termini in secondary nucleation, could have a large effect on polymorph selection and seeding. In line with the reviewer’s comments we now include a batch number for each EM dataset. While no new conclusions can be drawn from the inclusion of this additional data, we feel that it is important to acknowledge the possible role of batch to batch variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) To enhance the robustness of the conclusions, additional replicates of the experiments under the same condition should be conducted, ideally a minimum of three times.</p></disp-quote><p>The pH 5.8 conditions that yield Type 3 fibrils has already been repeated several times in the original manuscript. Since the pH 7.4 conditions produce the most common a-Syn polymorph (Type 1A) and were produced twice in this manuscript (once as an unseeded and once as a cross-seeded fibrilization) we decided to focus on the intermediate condition where the most variability had been seen (pH 7.0). The revised table 1 now has 6 new datasets (11-16) representing 6 independent aggregations at pH 7.0 starting from two different protein purification batches. The results is that we now produce the type 2A/B polymorphs in three samples and in two of these samples we once again observed the type 1M polymorph. The other samples produced Type 1A or non-twisted fibrils.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) Further investigation into whether different polymorphs formed under the same buffer condition could lead to distinct toxicological and pathology effects would be a valuable addition to the study.</p></disp-quote><p>The correlation of toxicity with structure would in principle be interesting. However the Type 1 and Type 3 polymorphs formed at pH 5.8 and 7.4 are not likely to be biologically relevant. The pH 7 polymorphs (Type 5 and 1M) would be more interesting because they form under the same conditions and might be related to some disease relevant structures. Still, it is rare that a single polymorph appears at 7.0 (the Type 5 represented only 10-20% of the fibrils in the sample and the Type 1M also had unidentified double-filament fibrils in the sample). We plan to pursue this line of research and hope to include it in a future publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The cross-seeding study presented in the manuscript demonstrates the pivotal role of pH conditions in dictating conformation. However, an intriguing aspect that emerges is the potential role of seed concentration in determining the resultant product structure. This raises a critical question: at what specific seed concentration does the determining factor for polymorph selection shift from pH condition to seed concentration? A methodological robust approach to address this should be conducted through a series of experiments across a range of seed concentrations. Such an approach could delineate a clear boundary at which seed concentration begins to predominantly dictate the conformation, as opposed to pH conditions. Incorporating this aspect into the study would not only clarify the interplay between seed concentration and pH conditions, but also add a fascinating dimension to the understanding of polymorph selection mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>A more complete analysis of the mechanisms of aggregation, including the effect of seed concentration and the resulting polymorph specificity of the process, are all very important for our understanding of the aggregation pathways of alpha-synuclein and are currently the topic of ongoing investigations in our lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the study prompts additional queries regarding the behavior of cross-seeding production under the same pH conditions when employing seeds of distinct conformation. Evidence from various studies, such as those involving E46K and G51D cross-seeding, suggests that seed structure plays a crucial role in dictating polymorph selection. A key question is whether these products consistently mirror the structure of their respective seeds.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for reminding us to cite these studies as a clear example of polymorph selection by cross-seeding. Unfortunately, it is not 100% clear from the G51D cross seeding manuscript (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26433-2">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26433-2</ext-link>) what conditions were used in the cross-seeding since different conditions were used for the seedless wild-type and mutant aggregations… however it appears that the wildtype without seeds was Tris pH 7.5 (although at 37C the pH could have dropped to 7ish) and the cross-seeded wild-type was in Phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. In the E46K cross-seeding manuscript, it appears that pH 7.5 Tris was used for all fibrilizations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2012435118">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2012435118</ext-link>). In any event, both results point to the fact that at pH 7.0-7.5 under low-seed conditions (0.5%) the Type 4 polymorph can propagate in a seed specific manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the Results section of &quot;The buffer environment can dictate polymorph during seeded nucleation&quot;, the authors reference previous cell biological and biochemical assays to support the polymorph-specific seeding of MSA and PD patients under the same buffer conditions. This discussion is juxtaposed with recent research that compares the in vivo biological activities of hPFF, ampLB as well as LB, particularly in terms of seeding activity and pathology. Notably, this research suggests that ampLB, rather than hPFF, can accurately model the key aspects of Lewy Body Diseases (LBD) (refer to: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42705-5">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42705-5</ext-link>). The critical issue here is the need to reconcile the phenomena observed in vitro with those in in-vivo or in-cell models. Given the low seed concentration reported in these studies, it is imperative for the authors to provide a more detailed explanation as to why the possible similar conformation could lead to divergent pathologies, including differences in cell-type preference and seeding capability.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bring this recent report to our attention. The findings that ampLB and hPFF have different PK digestion patterns and that only the former is able to model key aspects of Lewy Body disease are in support of the seed-specific nature of some types of alpha-synuclein aggregation. We have added this to the discussion regarding the significant role that seed type and seed conditions likely play in polymorph selection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In the Method section of &quot;Image processing&quot;, the authors describe the helical reconstruction procedure, without mentioning much detail about the 3D reconstruction and refinement process. For the benefit of reproducibility and to facilitate a deeper understanding among readers, the authors should enrich this part to include more comprehensive information, akin to the level of detail found in similar studies (refer to: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature23002">https://doi.org/10.1038/nature23002</ext-link>).</p></disp-quote><p>As also suggested by reviewer #2, we have now added more comprehensive information on the 3D reconstruction and refinement process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The abbreviation of amino acids should be unified. In the Results section &quot;On the structural heterogeneity of Type 1 polymorphs&quot;, the amino acids are denoted using three-letter abbreviation. Conversely, in the same section under &quot;On the structural heterogeneity of Type 2 and 3 structures&quot;, amino acids are abbreviated using the one-letter format. For clarity and consistency, it is essential that a standardized format for amino acid abbreviations be adopted throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>That makes perfect sense and had been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p><p>After discussion among the reviewers, it was decided that point 2 in Reviewer #3's Public Review (about the experiments with different concentrations of seeds) would probably lie outside the scope of a reasonable revision for this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree as stated above and will continue to work on this important point.</p><p>Revisions Round 2</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>I do worry that the FSC values of model-vs-map appear to be higher than expected from the corresponding FSCs between the half-maps (e.g. see Fig 13). The implication of this observation is that the atomic models may have been overfitted in the maps, which would have led to a deterioration of their geometry. A table with rmsd on bond lengths, angles, etc would probably show this. In addition, to check for overfitting, the atomic model for each data set could be refined in one of the half-maps, and then that same model could be used to calculate 2 FSC model-vs-map curves: one against the half-map it was refined in and one against the other half-map. Deviations between these two curves are an indication of overfitting.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the recommendations for model validation. We have added the suggested statistics to Table 2 and performed the suggested model fitting to one of the half-maps and plotted 3 FSC model-vs-map curves: one for each half-map versus the model fit against only one half map and one for the model fit against the full map. We feel that the degree of overfitting is reasonable and does not significantly impact the quality of the models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the sudden drop in the FSC curves in Figure 16 shows that something unexpected has happened to this refinement. Are the authors sure that only the procedures outlined in the Methods were used to create these curves? The unexpected nature of the FSC curve for this type (2A) raises doubts about the correctness of the reconstruction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the attention to detail. We should have caught this mistake. It turns out that in the last round of 3D refinement, the two half-maps become shifted with respect to each other in the z direction. We realigned the two maps using Chimera and then re-ran the postprocessing. The new maps have been deposited in EMD-50850. This mistake motivated us to inspect all of the maps and we found the same problem had occurred in the Type 3B maps. This was not noticed by the reviewer because we accidentally plotted the FSC curves from postprocessing from one refinement round before the one deposited in the EMD. We performed the same half-map shifting procedure for the Type 3B data and performed a final round of real-space refinement to produce new maps and models that have been deposited as EMD-50888 and 9FYP (superseding the previous entries).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>There are two minor points I recommend the authors to address:</p><p>(1) In the response to Weakness 1, point (3), the authors state that &quot;the Type 5 represented only 10-20% of the fibrils in the sample.&quot; However, this information is not labeled in the corresponding Figure 4. I suggest the authors verify and label all relevant percentages in the figures to prevent misunderstandings.</p></disp-quote><p>We aim to be as transparent as possible and this information was included in the main text however we did not label the percentage of Type 5 fibrils in Figure 4 because that would make the other percentages ambiguous. The percentages in Figure 4 represent the ratio of helical segments used for each type of refined structure in the dataset (always adding up to 100%), not the percent of all fibrils in the dataset. That is, there are sometimes untwisted or unidentifiable fibrils in datasets and these were not accounted for in the listed percentages. We have added a sentence to the Figure 4 legend to explain to what the percentages refer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) While the authors have detailed the helical reconstruction procedure in the Methods section, it is necessary to indicate the scale bar or box size in the figure legend of the 2D representative classes to ensure clarity and reproducibility.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for reminding us to add the scale bars.
