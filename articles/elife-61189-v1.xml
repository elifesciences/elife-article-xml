<italic>O</italic>-mannosyltransferases (PMTs) represent a conserved family of multispanning endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins involved in glycosylation of S/T-rich protein substrates and unfolded proteins. PMTs work as dimers and contain a luminal MIR domain with a β-trefoil fold, which is susceptive for missense mutations causing α-dystroglycanopathies in humans. Here, we analyze PMT-MIR domains by an integrated structural biology approach using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy and evaluate their role in PMT function in vivo. We determine Pmt2- and Pmt3-MIR domain structures and identify two conserved mannose-binding sites, which are consistent with general β-trefoil carbohydrate-binding sites (α, β), and also a unique PMT2-subfamily exposed FKR motif. We show that conserved residues in site α influence enzyme processivity of the Pmt1-Pmt2 heterodimer in vivo. Integration of the data into the context of a Pmt1-Pmt2 structure and comparison with homologous β-trefoil – carbohydrate complexes allows for a functional description of MIR domains in protein <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein O-mannosylation</kwd><kwd>carbohydrate-binding module</kwd><kwd>x-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>glycosyltransferase</kwd><kwd>enzymatic processivity</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR2509 SI586/8-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinning</surname><given-names>Irmgard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201348542-SFB1036 TP11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strahl</surname><given-names>Sabine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR2509 STR443/5-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strahl</surname><given-names>Sabine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR2509 SCHW701/20-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwalbe</surname><given-names>Harald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Leibniz Program SI586/6-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinning</surname><given-names>Irmgard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201348542-SFB1036 TP22</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinning</surname><given-names>Irmgard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The MIR domain of protein-<italic>O</italic>-mannosyltransferases participates in glycosylation by binding mannosylated peptides and regulates enzyme processivity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein <italic>O</italic>-mannosyltransferases (PMTs) of the PMT family are multispanning membrane glycosyltransferases (GT family 39; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org">http://www.cazy.org</ext-link>) of the GT-C fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albuquerque-Wendt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2019</xref>) that catalyze the transfer of mannose from dolichol monophosphate-activated mannose (Dol-P-Man) to the hydroxyl group of serine and threonine residues of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neubert and Strahl, 2016</xref>).

This fold was originally identified in interleukin-1β and fibroblast growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murzin et al., 1992</xref>) but it is also present in many carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lombard et al., 2014</xref>]), such as the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (GalNAc-Ts) that are responsible for mucin-type protein <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gill et al., 2011</xref>). Although not assigned yet, according to the CAZy classification (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org">http://www.cazy.org</ext-link>), the MIR domain β-trefoils would belong to the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) fold family 2 (CBM families 13 and 42; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boraston et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujimoto, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lombard et al., 2014</xref>).

Overall, MIRm3 differs the most in sequence, with mainly key-residues like L492 and W524 of the core being conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, on the surface of the β11-β12 loop a two-residue insertion is present, which is specific to the PMT2 family (including Pmt2, Pmt3, and Pmt6) and human POMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>). This loop forms a surface exposed ligand-binding site in Pmt2-MIR, from now on defined as PMT2 family-specific site δ. It consists of F516, K517, and R518, of which only the arginine is conserved in other PMT-families. The exposure of the hydrophobic phenylalanine is peculiar and indicative of a specific functional implication. The three residues form a trident that has picked another glycerol ligand from the solvent via hydrogen-bonding to the arginine side chain and to the backbone amides within site δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Overall, MIRm3 site δ displays a pronounced positive surface potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

From superposition of Pmt2-MIR with MIR domains of RyR and IP<sub>3</sub>R family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), it is evident that sites α to δ are not conserved and the evolutionary correlation within the MIR family remains obscure.</p><p>Taken together, we identified three putative ligand-binding sites in the Pmt2- and Pmt3-MIR domains.

In order to characterize ligand binding of the Pmt2-MIR domain in more detail, we performed a structure-based homology search to find related carbohydrate binders. Besides the relationship of the PMT-MIRs to SDF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schott et al., 2010</xref>) and within the MIR family, we found a close structural homology to many lectins with small-sugar-binding Type C CBMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boraston et al., 2004</xref>). Other structurally related carbohydrate-binding β-trefoils were found in xylanases (PDB ID: 1isv) or galactosidases (PDB ID: 1ups), thus justifying the general β-trefoil classification as CBMs in the CAZy database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lombard et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In all compared β-trefoil structures, carbohydrate binding almost exclusively occurs at the triangular cap region (the hairpin triplet) and not at the β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

In contrast, the clear appearance and disappearance of signals and CSPs upon addition of the O-Man peptides (YAT(O-Man)AV and CYAT(O-Man)AV), which are already visible at a 1:1 Pmt2-MIR:peptide ratio, indicate an interaction on the intermediate to fast exchange NMR timescale. The affinity of Pmt2 for the O-Man peptides is much stronger than for the mannose alone. Mapping of the O-Man peptide binding on the Pmt2-MIR crystal structure shows that the same two regions are involved as for mannose, albeit to a different extent. The backbone amides showing the largest CSPs (slow exchange) are observed around site α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), which suggests this is the main region recognizing the O-Man peptide.

The fluorescence signal enabled measurements of labeled Pmt2-MIR at a typical concentration of 100 nM and a ligand concentration ranging from high nanomolar to low millimolar concentrations. For the unmodified peptide, MST measurements yield a weak binding affinity in the low millimolar range (K<italic><sub>D</sub></italic> of 2.8 ± 0.4 mM), whereas the O-Man peptide binds about seven times stronger (400 ± 55 μM), demonstrating that Pmt2-MIR is involved in product binding rather than in substrate recognition. To narrow down the interaction site and to challenge site α in sugar recognition, the two conserved histidines (H362, H364) at the bottom of the putative sugar-binding pocket were mutated to alanines. Performing the MST analysis with an identical parameter setup shows a threefold decrease in affinity for the O-Man peptide (1.2 ± 0.3 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The preferred binding over the unmodified peptide can be explained by the remaining wall of the cavity (e.g. Y380) at site α as described above.

Recent cryo-EM structures of the yeast Pmt1-Pmt2 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2019</xref>) did not assign a function to the MIR domains, leaving the open question of if or how they contribute to regulation of the PMT catalytic mechanism. Our analysis of high-resolution X-ray structures of the Pmt2- and Pmt3-MIR domains revealed particular ligand-binding sites (α, β, δ) on each lateral side of the triangular cap region. Generally, although the β-trefoil fold is a dedicated CBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boraston et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujimoto, 2013</xref>), carbohydrate-binding by PMT-MIRs had not been investigated. Sequence and structural conservation within sites α and β in other PMT-MIR domains and carbohydrate-binding β-trefoils prompted us to conduct an in-depth investigation into their binding propensities for mannose derivates and O-Man peptides. NMR investigations revealed that Pmt2-MIR is indeed a CBM and two adjacent regions are distinctively involved in the specific interaction with mannose, α-mannose-1-phosphate and O-Man peptides. While mannose weakly interacts preferentially with MIRm2 site β, the O-Man peptides show a much stronger binding particularly to MIRm1 around site α. Furthermore, the divergent interaction of Pmt5-MIR of the PMT1 family with the O-Man peptide may be related to the dynamic interplay and different specificity of the PMT families.</p><p>The complete Pmt1-Pmt2 cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2019</xref>) revealed an asymmetric MIR domain arrangement with Pmt1-MIR touching the Pmt2-transmembrane domain (TMD) and Pmt2-MIR not forming any tertiary contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). However, the architecture of the α and β sites is conserved between Pmt1 and Pmt2 suggesting functional accordance. Our analysis for Pmt2-MIR shows that both sites are able to bind carbohydrates, while the respective site γ in MIRm3 is sterically blocked. In the cryo-EM structure, the Pmt1-MIR γ site constitutes a major part of the interface with the PMT2-TMD next to the active center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and the interface is completed by a PMT1-MIR domain-specific loop insertion (Pmt1 421-SDW) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Strikingly, on the opposing side this contact involves a PMT2 family-specific four residue insertion within loop LL4 (Pmt2 570-PDKF) that links the MIR domain to the TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This insertion is complementary to Pmt2-MIRm3 site δ, exposing an aromatic residue conserved in the PMT2-family (Pmt2 F573), and we thus denote it as site δ’. When we superimpose the Pmt2-MIR structure on Pmt1-MIR in the cryo-EM structure and also swap the TMDs, Pmt2-MIR touches the Pmt1-TMD with a corresponding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In doing so, site δ spatially corresponds to the LL4 insertion and the two phenylalanines match exactly. Finally, the high conservation of site δa (next to site δ) within all PMT-MIR domains still remains enigmatic, but due to its position in close proximity to the active site it might be involved in substrate-peptide recognition.

Following the idea of dynamic interactions, our data for Pmt2-MIR provide also a first rationale for the specific function of sites α and β conserved in all PMT-MIR domains. When we analyze our data in the context of the Pmt1-Pmt2 cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2019</xref>), the PMT2-MIR site α is equidistant to site β and both active centers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), well suited to bind the reaction product with modified serine residues spaced about ten residues apart. Whether the peptide is mannosylated by the active center in Pmt1 or Pmt2 remains elusive as the reaction mechanism of the PMT dimers is not resolved and the substrate trajectories cannot be inferred from static superimpositions.</p><p>In vivo data presented here complement the structural interpretation and provide first insights into the molecular determinants driving PMT enzymology. The in vivo Pmt2 mutational analyses demonstrate that site α is relevant only for the <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation of S/T-rich substrates, however it seems to be dispensable for the <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation of unfolded protein targets. Altogether these data establish that PMTs can act as processive enzymes in which the highly conserved site α is key to catalysis most likely by binding the O-Man products to ensure efficient mannosylation of S/T-rich substrate domains (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Whether the function of the MIR domain is to keep the reaction product away from the active center and/or to increase the local concentration of nearby unmodified substrate serine and threonine residues remains to be seen.</p><p>Recently, a new class of protein O-mannosyltransferases, encoded by the <italic>TMTC1-4</italic> genes, has been identified in metazoan, which specifically mannosylate distinct serine and threonine residues in the β-strands within extracellular domains of cadherin superfamily members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larsen et al., 2017</xref>). TMTCs (GT family 105) are multispanning transmembrane ER proteins with a variable number of C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) that are assumed to be important for interactions between the mannosyltransferase and its protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsen et al., 2019</xref>). These enzymes resemble PMTs in number and topology of TMDs, as well as amino acid conservation in certain loop regions, although they lack MIR domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albuquerque-Wendt et al., 2019</xref>). This might explain the different substrate specificities of TMTCs and PMTs and further point to the importance of β-trefoil MIR domains for the glycosylation of S/T-rich multi-acceptor substrates.</p><p>Finally, the question remains whether our data could provide structural and functional explanations for mutations in the human POMT1/2 homologs that cause α-dystroglycanopathies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endo, 2015</xref>). Most of the missense mutations in POMT1/2 are found on the ER lumenal side, of which one third are within the MIR domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). When mapped onto the Pmt2-MIR structure, it is evident that most of them locate to the triangular cap region, although no obvious clustering can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). There are only a few mutations that directly affect site α (Q506 in Pmt2: Q<sub>499</sub>R mutation in POMT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Østergaard et al., 2018</xref>]) or site β (T419, V443 in Pmt2: T<sub>414</sub>M, V<sub>428</sub>D in POMT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beltrán-Valero de Bernabé et al., 2002</xref>]), while none occur in sites δ or δa. Interestingly, most of the point mutations concern non-solvent exposed polar residues involved in hydrogen-bonding networks, and thus their exchange might destabilize the MIR domains reflecting the effect of histidine mutations within Pmt2-MIR site α as measured here by nanoDSF. Since α-DG has a mucin-type <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation site in its central domain containing more than 40 S/T residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gomez Toledo et al., 2012</xref>), we deduce that in human POMT proteins, MIR domains use conserved mechanisms for <italic>bona fide</italic> substrate <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation, as described here for the Pmt1-Pmt2 complex. Sequence conservation suggests that those mechanisms are retained across PMT-MIR domains. In such a scenario, we speculate that Pmt1- and Pmt2-MIR domains interact in trans with the Pmt2- and Pmt1-TMDs and complement their respective active centers. Due to the asymmetry, both active centers are likely occupied sequentially rather than simultaneously by the S/T residue to be <italic>O</italic>-mannosylated within the acceptor polypeptide chain. In this manner, while the Pmt2-MIR domain holds the newly added mannose, mannosylation could proceed in the other active center at the level of the Pmt2-TMD and vice versa. Whether this mechanism holds also true for the Pmt4 homodimer remains open. Further studies are needed to derive mechanistic details e.g. by capturing PMT dimers in complex with bound donor and acceptor substrates or product peptides, or to challenge such a scenario and to finally gain insights into the mechanisms driving α-dystroglycanopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>PMT2</italic></td><td><italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome <break/>Database (SGD)</td><td>YAL023C</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>PMT3</italic></td><td>SGD</td><td>YOR321W</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>PMT5</italic></td><td>SGD</td><td>YDL093W</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>HSP150</italic></td><td>SGD</td><td>YJL159W</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>SCW4</italic></td><td>SGD</td><td>YGR279C</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>BY4741</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brachmann et al., 1998</xref></td><td/><td>MATa; his3-1; leu2-0; <break/>met15-0; ura3-0</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>Y00385 (<italic>pmt2Δ</italic>)</td><td>EUROSCARF</td><td/><td>(BY4741) YAL023c::kanMX4</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21(DE3)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>CMC0016</td><td>Electro competent cells</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>SHuffle T7 Express</td><td>NEB</td><td>C3029JVIAL</td><td>Electro competent cells</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-HA <break/>(mouse, monoclonal)</td><td>Covance</td><td>#MMS-101R</td><td>WB (1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pAG1 <break/>(plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td valign="top">Plasmid containing pYEP352 <break/>backbone and <break/>m<italic>PMT2-HA</italic> (H<sub>362</sub>A,H<sub>364</sub>A)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pAG2 <break/>(plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td valign="top">Plasmid containing pYEP352 <break/>backbone and <break/>m<italic>PMT2-</italic>HA (H<sub>428</sub>A,H<sub>430</sub>A)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pAG4 <break/>(plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td valign="top">Plasmid containing pYEP352 <break/>backbone and m<italic>PMT2-HA</italic> <break/>(H<sub>362</sub>A,H<sub>364</sub>A,H<sub>428</sub>A,H<sub>430</sub>A)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pAG9 <break/>(plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td valign="top">Plasmid containing pYEP352 <break/>backbone and <break/>m<italic>PMT2-HA</italic> (F<sub>516</sub>A,K<sub>517</sub>A)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pYEP351a <break/>(plasmid)</td><td>Gift from V.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript describes the structures and sugar-binding properties of protein O-mannosyltransferase (Pmt) MIR domains. At least three valuable and justified insights are presented. First, mannose-modified peptides are bound by the MIR domain, and the binding site is identified. Second, requirements for mannosylation of Ser/Thr-rich substrates can be distinguished by mutagenesis from requirements for activity on mis-folded substrates lacking Ser/Thr-rich regions. Third, a comparison of Pmt enzymes with GalNAc transferases suggests mechanistic commonalities. A structural comparison with homologous MIR domains from inositol triphosphate receptors and ryanodine receptors is also described. These studies complement the recent report of the cryo-EM structure of the yeast Pmt1/Pmt2 complex, which also presented an MIR domain crystal structure and noted the similarity to sugar-binding proteins but did not further explore the implications of these observations.</p><p>The reviewers had mixed opinions on whether the novelty of the work or the mechanistic advances in light of the Pmt1/Pmt2 cryo-EM structure are sufficient to warrant publication in a general biology journal. Nevertheless, the efforts of the authors to experimentally validate their claims and also to place them in a broader context within the field of glycosyltransferases and β-trefoil containing proteins was appreciated. Consequently, it was decided to invite the authors to present a more concise and substantially revised version of the manuscript for re-evaluation, taking into consideration the reviewers' general and specific comments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Attention should be paid to the suggestion for shortening and reorganization offered by reviewer #1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript picks up very appropriately where Bai et al., 2019 left off with their cryo-EM structure of the yeast Pmt1-Pmt2 mannosyltransferase complex. Bai et al. wrote at the end of their paper, &quot;Based on this structural homology and the fact that the MIR domain is located just above the Dol-P-Man entry or product-release path, we suggest that it may play a role in recognition of the mannose moiety of the donor substrate. More studies are needed, however, to determine the function of this domain.&quot; Chiapparino and colleagues now make a significant advance in such studies.</p><p>The results in Chiapparino et al. include the following: crystal structures of MIR domains, suggestion of ligand-binding sites, comparison with MIR domains in other ER-localized proteins, comparison to other carbohydrate-binding trefoil fold structures, experimental analysis of carbohydrate and peptide binding, and a mutational analysis of MIR domain function in Pmt1-Pmt2 in vivo.</p><p>While overall the findings are valuable to report, the manuscript should be drastically reorganized and the presentation should be more focused. The authors should aim to shorten it to about 2/3 the current length. Rather than emphasize the &quot;integrated structural biology&quot; approach, the authors should focus on what experiments and analyses are truly valuable, and devote time to presenting them in as effective (and concise) a manner as possible. This reviewer felt that the story only really got going on in the subsection “Analysis of the Pmt2-MIR domain as a CBM” and wondered why so much text (subsections “PMT-MIR domain structures”, “The Pmt2-MIR domain contains three putative ligand-binding sites” and “The Pmt2-MIR domain has unique features within the MIR family”) was wasted to get to something that was essentially already known – that β-trefoil folds are recognized carbohydrate binding proteins and have recognized binding sites. The authors should summarize their structural studies as briefly as possible in the context of what is known already about carbohydrate binding in other trefoil CBMs and then focus on their own binding and functional experiments. To clarify, the order should be:</p><p>1) MIR domains are β-trefoils, a subset of CBMs are β-trefoils, and the structures of Pmt-MIR domains are consistent with their being CBMs;</p><p>2) NMR and MST measurements;</p><p>3) Comparison with GALNTs and analysis of the findings in the context of the structure and mechanism of the full-length Pmt1-Pmt2 complex.</p><p>On a side note, the discovery of domains that have evolved to provide related functions in different contexts brings unity and order to our understanding of nature. This process should be accompanied by unification of nomenclature. This reviewer was surprised and disappointed after reading about sites I, II, and III to find out that carbohydrate binding sites were already called α, β, and γ in other β-trefoils. (Actually, in Boraston et al., α, β, and γ refer to the subdomains and not the binding sites: &quot;The three β-trefoil subdomains of SlCBM13 are labelled as α, β and γ…&quot;) If the authors were to discuss their structural work in terms of what is already known about β-trefoil CBMs as suggested above, they could use the conventional nomenclature (whatever it actually is) from the outset. For example, they could use the α, β, and γ designations and then introduce a putative δ site (their site III).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>A common post-translational modification in the endoplasmic reticulum is O-mannosylation or the transfer of a mannose carbohydrate to Ser/Thr residues of secretory pathway client proteins. In yeast there are seven protein O-mannosyltransferases (PMT1-7) while in mammals where they are termed POMT, there are only two (POMT1 and 2). This modification has functional implications especially for proteins in the cell wall (or the plasma membrane or extracellular matrix of mammalian cells). In yeast, it has also been shown to be used to signal proteins for degradation (UPOM; unfolded protein O-mannosylation). The Li lab recently solved the cryo-EM structure for the PMT1/PMT2 heterodimer. This interesting structure mainly focusses on the transmembrane domains and how they assemble and orientate the active site that binds the dolichol-monophosphate activated mannose substrate. In this important study, they also solved the structure of the luminal soluble MIR domain found between transmembrane domains 7 and 8. As this domain is the most significant luminal exposed part of the protein, it is expected to be involved in substrate recognition (especially for soluble substrates) though the Bai et al., study does not focus on this aspect. The role of the MIR domain in the PMTs is the focus on the current manuscript. Here, Chaipparino et al., have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the MIR domains from PMT2 and PMT3. Analysis of these β-trefoil structures and their comparison to similar known structures suggest that these MIR domains might be involved in carbohydrate binding (mannosylated peptide or dolichol-P-mannose). NMR and microscale thermophoresis analysis are supportive for a role in binding mannose modified peptides (product binding) but not the dolichol-P-mannose substrate, unmodified acceptor peptides or unfolded substrates (substrate recognition for UPOM).</p><p>Overall while the approach is suitable and experimental results are of high quality (MIR structure in 1.6 Å resolution). In short, I am not convinced that the insight uncovered significantly advances the mechanism of PMT O-mannosylation sufficiently to interest the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>If the MIR domain is not involved in initial substrate recognition/orientation, how are soluble substrates to be mannosylated recognized?</p><p>Compare the MIR domains of the UPOM PMTs (PMT<sub>1/2</sub>) with that of the MIR domains that modify properly folded Ser/Thr rich proteins (PMT4/4).</p><p>Figure 4A models the MIR domain on to the Bai et al., transmembrane regions of PMT<sub>1/2</sub> and with the IP3R and RyR MIR domains. This should be broken up to first show the MIR domain solely on the PMT transmembrane region, followed by comparison of MIR domains from PMT, IP3R and RyR.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper describes structural studies of two MIR domains involved</p><p>in mannosylation of proteins in the ER, and functional studies of mutants.

We wanted to get this sorted. In the revised version, we shortened this part considerably (by about a third). Further, we cut the MIR domain comparison significantly (no separate chapter anymore) and took the respective Figure 4 out of the main text. Finally, the mutational data concerning the protein core of Pmt1 has been taken out (including Supplementary Figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a side note, the discovery of domains that have evolved to provide related functions in different contexts brings unity and order to our understanding of nature.

As we deduce from the recent Pmt1-Pmt2 cryo-EM structure (Bai et al., 2019), although it was not described there, recognition is likely to occur in the interface between the TMDs and MIR domains. From the MIR side, it seems that the conserved site δa could be involved in substrate recognition, as stated in the Discussion:</p><p>“Finally, the high conservation of site δa (next to site δ) within all PMT-MIR domains still remains enigmatic, but due to its position in close proximity to the active site it might be involved in substrate-peptide recognition.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Compare the MIR domains of the UPOM PMTs (PMT<sub>1/2</sub>) with that of the MIR domains that modify properly folded Ser/Thr rich proteins (PMT4/4).</p></disp-quote><p>This is not possible yet as a structure of the Pmt4-MIR domain is not available.
