centers (MTOCs). Biochemical studies suggest that Spc110 facilitates higher-order γ-tubulin complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kollman et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless the molecular basis for this activity and the regulation are unclear. Here we show that Spc110 phosphorylated by Mps1 and Cdk1 activates γ-TuSC oligomerization and MT nucleation in a cell cycle dependent manner. Interaction between the N-terminus of the γ-TuSC subunit Spc98 and Spc110 is important for this activity. Besides the conserved CM1 motif in γ-TuCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sawin et al., 2004</xref>), a second motif that we named Spc110/Pcp1 motif (SPM) is also important for MT nucleation. The activating Mps1 and Cdk1 sites lie between SPM and CM1 motifs. Most organisms have both SPM-CM1 (Spc110/Pcp1/PCNT) and CM1-only (Spc72/Mto1/Cnn/CDK5RAP2/myomegalin) types of γ-TuCRs. The two types of γ-TuCRs contain distinct but conserved C-terminal MTOC targeting domains.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02208.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02208.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02208.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Microtubules are hollow structures made of proteins that have a central role in cell division and a variety of other important processes within cells. For a cell to divide successfully, the chromosomes containing the genetic information of the cell must be duplicated and then separated so that one copy of each chromosome ends up in each daughter cell. To separate the chromosomes, microtubules extend out from two structures called spindle pole bodies, which are found at either end of the cell, and pull one copy of each chromosome to opposite sides of the cell.</p><p>Although the individual proteins that make up a microtubule can self-assemble into tubes, this occurs very slowly, so cells employ other molecules to speed up this process. In yeast cells, a protein called gamma-tubulin is recruited to the spindle pole body by the protein Spc110, where it combines with two other proteins to form a complex called the gamma-tubulin small complex. Several of these complexes then join together to form a ring, which probably acts as the platform that microtubules grow from. Recent observations suggested that Spc110 may help to construct this ring, but without revealing how.</p><p>Now, Lin et al. reveal that Spc110 can regulate microtubule formation by controlling how several gamma-tubulin small complexes bind together, and have identified the exact section of Spc110 that interacts with the complexes. However, the Spc110 must become active before it can perform this role, and it is only activated during certain stages of cell division, through phosphorylation. The structures in Spc110 that bind to the gamma-tubulin small complex in yeast are also found in gamma-tubulin binding receptor proteins in human cells. The work of Lin et al. demonstrates that proteins that are assumed to have passive roles within cells, such as Spc110, often play more active roles instead.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02208.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02208.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>pericentrin</kwd><kwd>spindle pole body</kwd><kwd>gamma-tubulin complex</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>microtubule nucleation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Schi295-3-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Tien-chen</given-names></name><name><surname>Neuner</surname><given-names>Annett</given-names></name><name><surname>Schlosser</surname><given-names>Yvonne T</given-names></name><name><surname>Schiebel</surname><given-names>Elmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scharf</surname><given-names>Annette ND</given-names></name><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphorylation of Spc110 N-terminal domain encompassing conserved motifs and its interaction with conserved GCP3 N-terminal domain regulate the oligomerization of gamma-tubulin small complexes (γ-TuSCs).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The budding yeast spindle consists of ∼40 microtubules (MTs) that extend between the two opposed spindle pole bodies (SPBs). Because of the closed mitosis in yeast, the SPBs remain embedded in the nuclear membrane throughout mitosis. Cell-cycle regulated spindle assembly begins in S-phase with nucleation of MTs onto the surface of the newly assembled SPB. As soon as MTs emanate from both SPBs, they interdigitate (pole to pole MTs) or attach to the kinetochores (pole to kinetochore MTs) at the end of S phase, forming the bipolar spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Toole et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The γ-tubulin complex is the core player in MT nucleation. In budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, two molecules of γ-tubulin (Tub4) assemble together with one molecule of Spc97 (ortholog of human GCP2) and Spc98 (ortholog of human GCP3) into a tetrameric γ-tubulin small complex (γ-TuSC), which is conserved in all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geissler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knop et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guillet et al., 2011</xref>). The purified γ-TuSC of budding yeast is able to self-oligomerize into symmetric ring-like structures under low salt buffer conditions. The diameter and the pitch of the γ-TuSC ring resemble that of MT cylinder, suggesting that the γ-TuSC ring functions as a MT nucleation template. However, the in vitro nucleation activity of the γ-TuSC assemblies remained poor, presumably because of the suboptimal spacing of every second Tub4 within the γ-TuSC ring that blocks interaction with tubulin in the MT cylinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kollman et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choy et al., 2009</xref>). The concept of γ-TuSC oligomerization is further supported by in vivo measurements of budding yeast γ-tubulin complex components on detached single MT nucleation sites. The γ-tubulin:Spc97:Spc98 ratio was 2.4:1.0:1.3 with a total of ∼17 γ-tubulin molecules per nucleation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erlemann et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting a slight excess of γ-tubulin and Spc98 molecules over Spc97 in the assembled MT nucleation site.</p><p>In most eukaryotic organisms, such as fission yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and human, multiple γ-TuSCs further assemble with additional GCP family members (GCP4-6) into the larger γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gunawardane et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murphy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anders et al., 2006</xref>). However, these additional GCP proteins are not encoded in the budding yeast genome.</p><p>Various proteins are involved in the recruitment of γ-tubulin complexes to microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) such as centrosomes and SPBs. The small protein Mozart1 is encoded in most eukaryotic genomes except the one of budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Teixido-Travesa et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Mozart1 interacts with the GCP3 subunit of γ-tubulin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Janski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nakamura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batzenschlager et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Masuda et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic> Mozart1 appears important for the γ-TuSC recruitment to SPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Masuda et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Besides Mozart1, a group of conserved proteins called γ-tubulin complex receptors (γ-TuCRs) are required for targeting γ-tubulin complexes to MTOCs. Most of them carry a highly conserved centrosomin motif 1 (CM1) that interacts with GCP subunits of γ-tubulin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sawin et al., 2004</xref>). How Mozart1 and γ-TuCRs cooperate is not understood. However, in budding yeast cells that lack a Mozart1 gene, γ-TuCRs are the sole factors responsible for γ-TuSC recruitment to SPBs. Spc110 is the budding yeast homolog of pericentrin (PCNT) and functions as γ-TuCRs at the nuclear side of the SPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knop and Schiebel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sundberg and Davis, 1997</xref>). The N-terminal Spc110 encompasses the CM1 that interacts with the Spc98 subunit of γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knop and Schiebel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nguyen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vinh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sawin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang and Megraw, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Samejima et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the N-terminal region of Spc110 is phosphorylated in a cell-cycle dependent manner. Phospho-Spc110 appears as cells progress from S phase, continues accumulating during mitosis, and vanishes at the anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friedman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stirling and Stark, 1996</xref>). Spc110 phosphorylation accounts for the impact of Cdk1 and Mps1 kinases on spindle dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huisman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). However, a clear understanding behind this observation is lacking. Interestingly, when γ-TuSC and an N-terminal fragment of Spc110 (amino acids 1–220 of Spc110; Spc110<sup>1–220</sup>) were co-expressed in insect cells, a filament-like γ-TuSC-Spc110<sup>1–220</sup> complex formed. The nucleation capacity of this purified γ-TuSC-Spc110<sup>1–220</sup> complex exceeded that of the γ-TuSC alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kollman et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, Spc110<sup>1–220</sup> influences γ-TuSC properties with yet unclear mechanism.</p><p>Here we have tested the possibility that phosphorylation of the γ-TuCR Spc110 regulates MT nucleation by inducing γ-TuSC oligomerization. Single particle analysis of γ-TuSC incubated with phosphomimetic Spc110 mutant proteins showed that Mps1 and Cdk1 promoted MT nucleation through Spc110 phosphorylation. Phosphorylated Spc110 and the interaction with the N-terminal domain of Spc98 induce γ-TuSC oligomerization. In addition, bioinformatic analysis revealed a conserved region around T18, that we named Spc110/Pcp1 motif (SPM). SPM and CM1 motifs are both important for γ-TuSC binding and oligomerization. A comparison of γ-TuCRs for the presence of SPM and CM1 identified SPM-CM1 (Spc110, Pcp1, PCNT) and CM1-only types of γ-TuCRs (Spc72, Mto1, Cnn, CDK5RAP2, myomegalin) in most organisms. While the SPM-CM1 type of γ-TuCRs carries the PACT domain and is targeted only to the centrosome or the nuclear side of the SPB, the CM1-only type of γ-TuCRs has either a MASC (Mto1 and Spc72 C-terminus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Samejima et al., 2010</xref>) or a CM2 motif and is recruited to, centrosomes, the cytoplasmic side of the SPB or acentrosomal MTOCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphorylation of N-Spc110 at Mps1 and Cdk1 sites is required for efficient interaction with γ-TuSC</title><p>To test whether Spc110<sup>1–220</sup> phosphorylation promoted γ-TuSC ring formation, we purified GST-Spc110<sup>1–220</sup> (named Spc110<sup>1–220</sup>) from both <italic>E. coli</italic> and the baculovirus expression system.

Addition of Spc110<sup>1–220-P</sup> shifted γ-TuSC into fractions that eluted earlier than when γ-TuSC was run on the columns on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, shift from fraction 10 to fraction 8). The peak at the void-volume (fraction 8) likely represented γ-TuSC oligomers. In contrast, non-phosphorylated Spc110<sup>1–220</sup> expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> did not change the γ-TuSC elution profile. The γ-TuSC pool eluted as monomeric γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, fractions 10–11). This result suggests that Mps1 and Cdk1 kinases regulate the interaction between Spc110 and γ-TuSC through phosphorylation of Spc110 N-terminal domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phosphorylation of N-Spc110 regulates the γ-TuSC oligomerization promoting activity</title><p>To further confirm that phosphorylation of Spc110<sup>1–220</sup> alters the interaction with γ-TuSC, phosphomimetic and non-phosphorylatable Spc110<sup>1–220</sup> mutant proteins were purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>2A</italic></sup> (Cdk1 sites: S36A, S91A) and <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>3A</italic></sup> (Mps1 sites: S60A, T64A, T68A) have been studied in vivo before and shown to behave as non-phosphorylatable mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huisman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liang et al., 2013</xref>).

To confirm the existence of structurally organized oligomers, fractions corresponding to the void-volume peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, fraction 7) were subjected to EM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Consistent with the low A<sub>280</sub> absorbance, hardly any oligomeric γ-TuSC species were found in the void fraction of γ-TuSC only or γ-TuSC incubated with the non-phosphorylated Spc110<sup>1–220-WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>).

Since the effects of T18D/E and T18A/V mutations were indistinguishable, we cannot attribute these mutations as phosphomimetic or non-phosphorylatable. However, our results strongly suggest that these mutations affect the structure of an important yet unappreciated element around T18 that is important for γ-TuSC oligomerization. Consistently, with EM we observed hardly any oligomeric structures when γ-TuSC was incubated with Spc110<sup>1–220-5D-T18D</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>With the sequence alignments of Spc110 orthologs from yeast to human, we observed a conserved motif upstream of CM1, which we designated as Spc110/Pcp1 motif (SPM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Spc110<sup>T18</sup> sits within this motif. To evaluate the relative importance of CM1 and SPM, we constructed the Spc110<sup>1–220-CM1-QA</sup> mutant protein with mutations (KE to QA) in two highly conserved residues of the CM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) and the Spc110<sup>1–220-ΔSPM</sup> lacking the SPM motif (deletion of amino acids 1–20). Spc110<sup>1–220</sup> proteins were incubated with γ-TuSC in TB150 buffer to examine their oligomerization capacity. Spc110<sup>1–220-5D-CM1-QA</sup> and Spc110<sup>1–220-5D-ΔSPM</sup> mutant proteins failed to activate γ-TuSC oligomerization even when the five activating Cdk1 and Mps1 mutations were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Thus, Spc110<sup>1–220-5D-ΔSPM</sup> behaved as Spc110<sup>1–220-5D-T18D</sup> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), further emphasizing that T18D inactivates the SPM.

It is important to note that both Cdk1 kinase complexes had equal kinase activities toward histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom).</p><p>To confirm the cell-cycle dependent phosphorylation of Spc110 in vivo, we immuno-precipitated (IP) Spc110-GFP with GFP-binder from cells arrested either in G1 phase with α-factor, S phase with hydroxyurea (HU) or prometaphase with nocodazole, and then blotted with phospho-specific antibodies. At G1 phase, no signal was observed with any of the two phospho-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

To elucidate the function of T18 phosphorylation, we raised phospho-specific antibodies against pT18. In vitro phosphorylation assay showed that T18 was only phosphorylated by Cdk1-Clb2 but not by Cdk1-Clb5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Due to the low sensitivity of anti-Spc110<sup>pT18</sup>, we used mass spectrometry for the analysis of T18 phosphorylation in vivo. Total yeast cell lysates were fractionated into supernatant and pellet that contained SPBs. The pellet fraction was solubilized with high salt buffer and then used for Spc110 enrichment. pT18 was predominately detected in the SPB-containing pellet fraction of prometaphase cells but not in the corresponding fraction of G1 or S phase arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). These data suggest that T18 of Spc110 becomes phosphorylated at SPBs in M phase but not S phase, which is consistent with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keck et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we addressed the effects of T18 phosphorylation on γ-TuSC oligomerization. Because the T18A/V/D/E mutations inactivated the SPM function, we turned to an in vitro phosphorylation approach. Spc110<sup>1–220-5D</sup> was incubated with Cdk1<sup>as1</sup>-Clb2 in the presence or absence of the Cdk1<sup>as1</sup> inhibitor 1NM-PP1. Only in the absence of 1NM-PP1, Spc110<sup>1–220-5D</sup> was phosphorylated on T18 as shown by the phospho-specific anti-T18 antibodies. We incubated Spc110<sup>1–220-5D</sup> and Spc110<sup>1–220-5D-pT18</sup> with γ-TuSC and analyzed γ-TuSC by gel filtration. The activity of Spc110<sup>1–220-5D-pT18</sup> to promote γ-TuSC oligomerization was significantly reduced in comparison with Spc110<sup>1–220-5D</sup> (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).

Cells were synchronized with α-factor in G1 and then released into prewarmed media at 37°C, the restrictive temperature of some of the mutant cells. In SPM defective <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>T18A</italic></sup> and <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>T18D</italic></sup> cells, the reduction of GFP-tubulin signal at SPBs was already apparent in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, p&lt;0.001). In S phase, the stage where newly synthesized SPBs mature and MT nucleation is initiated, all <italic>spc110</italic> mutants except for <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>5D</italic></sup> cells exhibited a marked reduction in MT nucleation at SPBs when compared with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; for <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>5A</italic></sup>, p&lt;0.05; for <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>T18D</italic></sup>, <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>T18A</italic></sup>, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The reduction in tubulin signal was especially pronounced in <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>T18D</italic></sup> and <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>T18A</italic></sup> cells, indicating that SPM mutations blocked MT formation in vivo. <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>ΔSPM</italic></sup> cells also showed MT defects at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>The situation in metaphase was similar to that of S phase although the overall relative differences between WT and <italic>spc110</italic> mutants were less pronounced than in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, p&lt;0.001).

Taken together, the in vivo analysis of the tubulin signal at SPBs in <italic>spc110</italic> cells is consistent with the in vitro data on γ-TuSC oligomerization and MT nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2 and 4</xref>).</p><p>Reduced MT signal intensity at SPBs would be indicative of impaired γ-TuSC activity. In the simplest interpretation, γ-TuSC recruitment to SPBs is impaired.

Thus, the reduction of the Spc97-GFP signal in G1 and S phase most likely reflects a reduction of γ-TuSC binding to the <italic>SPC110</italic> mutant molecules at SPBs. The observation that all <italic>spc110</italic> cells had similar γ-TuSC signals at mitotic SPBs while the MT signal was only reduced in <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>T18D</italic></sup> and <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>5A</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggests that the SPB-associated γ-TuSC is not fully active in MT organization in these cells. The functions of Spc110 probably extend beyond γ-TuSC binding, most likely to include γ-TuSC oligomerization (‘Discussion’). However, compared with <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>T18D</italic></sup> or <italic>SPC110</italic> cells, Spc110-GFP at the SPB was reduced in <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>ΔSPM</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>), suggesting the <italic>SPM</italic> deletion affects incorporation of Spc110 into the SPB. This may contribute to the <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>ΔSPM</italic></sup> phenotype and may explain why the growth defect of <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>ΔSPM</italic></sup> cells was more pronounced than that of <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>T18D</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the MT nucleation defect in <italic>spc110</italic> phospho-mutant cells, we performed an in vivo MT nucleation assay. Cells were first arrested in S phase with HU, then MTs were depolymerized with nocodazole, followed by nocodazole wash out to trigger MT nucleation by the SPB bound γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erlemann et al., 2012</xref>). To prevent cell cycle progression into anaphase we retained the cells in the HU block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The re-growth of MTs was measured as a change in GFP-Tub1 intensity at SPBs. In comparison to WT and <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>5D</italic></sup> cells, MT nucleation activity was reduced in the <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>5A</italic></sup>, <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>T18A</italic></sup>, <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>T18D</italic></sup> <italic>spc110</italic><sup><italic>5D-T18D</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Again, these data are consistent with the in vitro data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 1–4</xref>) and suggest that Spc110's ability to stimulate MT nucleation is regulated through stimulatory phosphorylation and requires the SPM motif.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Spc110 interaction and γ-TuSC oligomerization are facilitated by the N-terminal region of Spc98</title><p>The N-terminal region of Spc98/GCP3 orthologs is conserved.

Binding of γ-TuSC to Spc110 is a prerequisite for γ-TuSC oligomerization into the ring-like template that initiates MT assembly. Phosphorylation of Spc110 by Cdk1 and Mps1 regulates γ-TuSC binding and thereby MT nucleation. Thus, Spc110 is a MT nucleation regulator. We thereby provide a molecular understanding of the previously observed spindle length phenotypes (the two Cdk1-Clb5 sites) and genetic interaction with <italic>SPC97</italic> (three Mps1 sites combined with S36) of <italic>SPC110</italic> phosphorylation site mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huisman et al., 2007</xref>).

In G1/S the duplication plaque then becomes inserted into the nuclear envelope. This allows binding of the Spc110-calmodulin-Spc29 complex from the nuclear side to the central Spc29-Spc42 layer of the embedded duplication plaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bullitt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elliott et al., 1999</xref>). In this cell cycle phase Mps1 and Cdk1-Clb5 phosphorylate the N-terminus of Spc110 at five sites to promote γ-TuSC binding to Spc110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Consistently, Cdk1-Clb5 associates with SPBs throughout this time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huisman et al., 2007</xref>). These phosphorylations increase γ-TuSC affinity for Spc110-5P and induce γ-TuSC oligomerization into ring-like complexes that promote MT nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).

Analysis of T18A, T18V, T18E, and T18D mutations resulted in similar in vitro and in vivo phenotypes. We have to assume that all these mutations inactivate the important SPM motif in which T18 resides. The fact that T18 of Spc110 is phosphorylated only by Cdk1-Clb2 and not by Cdk1-Clb5 and the in vivo phosphorylation of SPB-associated Spc110<sup>T18</sup> in mitosis but not in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) indicates that this Cdk1 site is different compared to the two S phase Cdk1 sites S36 and S91 in Spc110.

Thus, it is well possible that Spc110<sup>T18</sup> phosphorylation by Cdk1-Clb2 limits the MT nucleation activity of the SPB associated γ-TuSC. Most likely only the surplus of γ-TuSC that is not engaged in MT organization is phosphorylated and affected by Spc110<sup>pT18</sup>. This model fits with the observation that the yeast SPB of haploid cells organizes a constant number of 20 nuclear MTs during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Winey et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Co-overexpression of <italic>SPC97</italic>, <italic>SPC98</italic>, and <italic>TUB4</italic> does not induce MT nucleation despite of γ-TuSC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pereira et al., 1998</xref>).

This is consistent with the γ-tubulin binding ability of human PCNT, which lies within the region that contains the SPM-CM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takahashi et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, super-resolution analysis of human centrosomes has mapped the localization of γ-tubulin towards the N-terminus of PCNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lawo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>). Experimental evidences are awaited to validate the CM1 motif in Spc72 and PCNT.</p><p>Our study has identified SPM as a second conserved motif amongst a subgroup of γ-tubulin complex receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), namely the yeast Spc110 homologues, fission yeast Pcp1, and human PCNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doxsey et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dictenberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flory et al., 2002</xref>). The distance between SPM and CM1 is around 90–100 amino acids in the Spc110 and Pcp1 type of receptors. In the mammalian PCNT subfamily it is however only around 70 amino acids. Whether these differences are important for regulation or are indicative of co-adaptation with alterations in the γ-TuSC binding sites remains to be seen.</p><p>The SPM is important for Spc110 binding to γ-TuSC and induced oligomerization of γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>). Based on these results we propose that SPM co-operates with CM1 to form a bipartite binding element for the γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Interestingly, however, other γ-tubulin complex receptors such as Spc72, fission yeast Mto1, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cnn, and human CDK5RAP2 carry only the CM1 element but no SPM motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Strikingly, SPM-CM1 type of γ-TuCRs carry a C-terminal PACT domain that targets these proteins to MTOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The CM1-only type of γ-TuCRs either contain a MASC (fungi) or a CM2 C-terminal MTOC targeting sequence (metazoa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). We also noticed that in some metazoa and the fungi phylum Basidiomycota the PACT domain-containing γ-TuCRs (such as AKAP9 in human and D-PLP in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) have N-terminal regions distinctive from SPM and CM1 motifs, probably reflecting different binding partners in γ-TuRC. Altogether, we can classify γ-TuCRs in at least three classes: CM1-MASC, CM1-CM2, and SPM-CM1-PACT.</p><p>In budding and fission yeast, the CM1-MASC types of γ-TuCRs (Spc72 and Mto1) have specific functions in cytoplasmic MT organization, while Spc110 and Pcp1 (SPM-CM1-PACT) organize only nuclear MTs. This functional division is accompanied by the physical separation of the receptors by the nuclear envelope, which remains intact during the closed mitosis of both organisms. Human CDK5RAP2, myomegalin (CM1–CM2 types), and pericentrin (SPM-CM1-PACT type) are associated with the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doxsey et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fong et al., 2008</xref>). However, CDK5RAP2 and myomegalin also have functions in acentrosomal MT nucleation for example MT nucleation by the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roubin et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it may be the acentrosomal/cytoplasmic function that explains the lack of SPM element in Mto1/CDK5RAP2/myomegalin.</p><p>Budding yeast organizes MTs only with γ-TuSC and γ-TuCRs. Other organisms have additional building blocks that contribute to MT assembly, such as Mozart1 and GCP4-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Masuda et al., 2013</xref>). However, GCP4 to 6 are not essential for MT nucleation in fission yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, while GCP2/Alp4, GCP3/Alp6, and Mozart1 are essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anders et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Verollet et al., 2006</xref>). Puzzlingly, fission yeast Mozart1 is essential for γ-TuSC recruitment to SPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Masuda et al., 2013</xref>). This raises the question how budding yeast compensates for Mozart1's function. GCP3 and γ-TuCRs of the SPM-CM1 type are conserved between organisms with or without Mozart1. It is likely that small adaptive changes in GCP3 or Spc110 have evolved to compensate for the lack of Mozart1 in budding yeast.</p><p>What could be the function of γ-TuCR in organisms that are able to assemble the more stable γ-TuRC? γ-TuCRs may recruit and activate the already assembled γ-TuRC to MTOCs via GCP interactions. In addition, γ-TuCRs could induce γ-TuSC assembly into rings that then either function without the help of additional GCPs or subsequently become stabilized by GCP4-6. In any case, considering the conservation between the SPM and CM1 binding elements of γ-TuRCs and the N-terminal region of Spc98/GCP3, we suggest that the basic principals of MT nucleation are conserved from yeast to human.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid and strain constructions</title><p>A detailed list of DNA constructs and yeast strains is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. <italic>SPC110</italic> alleles were subcloned into the integration vector pRS304, and <italic>SPC98</italic> alleles were subcloned into pRS305K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sikorski and Hieter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christianson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taxis and Knop, 2006</xref>).

Yeast cells were allowed to attach to the dishes for 5–15 min at 30°C. The α-factor blocked cells were then released by two washes with 2 ml of prewarmed SC medium. Image acquisition was started 10–15 min after release from α-factor. Conditions for imaging were as follows: 15 stacks in the FITC channel, 0.1-s exposure, 0.3-μm stack distance, one reference image in bright field channel with a 0.05-s exposure, and 61 frames in total every 3 min. Images were quantified by measuring the integrated density of the sum of projected videos for the region of interest (ROI) around the SPBs and a background region selected from the periphery of the analyzed regions. The mean intensity of the background was subtracted from the ROI. To correct for acquisition, bleaching signal intensities were divided by a bleaching factor. The bleaching factor was determined from the mean of three very short videos that had been generated with the same image acquisition conditions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) The primary concern is with T18. It is likely that this site is phosphorylated in vivo, but Spc110 mutant proteins containing T18D or T18A have the same rather than opposing properties. Therefore, the evidence that that phosphorylation of T18 is really inhibitory is lacking. (It is likely that T18D did not act as a phosphomimetic.) The strong effect of T18Ala is a concern. It is difficult to see why this should perturb the structure, as the authors claim.

We have analyzed both mutants using biochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5A</xref>) and cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5B</xref>). The bottom line of both experiments is that <italic>spc110-T18A</italic> behaves as <italic>spc110-T18V</italic> and <italic>spc110-T18D</italic> behaves as <italic>spc110-T18E</italic>.</p><p>In addition, we have constructed a destruction box lacking <italic>ΔDB-CLB2-SPC110</italic> gene fusion following a strategy that was originally introduced by D. Morgan. We hoped that this gene fusion will target Cdk1 permanently to the SPB and phosphorylate T18 in a cell cycle independent manner. This should give us the <italic>spc110-pT18</italic> phenotype. However, the <italic>CLB2-SPC110</italic> gene fusion did not provide <italic>SPC110</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref>.)<fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-02208-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>To this end, we cannot say without ambiguities that T18D/E are phosphomimetic and T18A/V are phosphoinhibitory. However, it is clear that T18 lies within a conserved region, that we named SPM. Thus, we have changed the T18 phosphorylation part in this direction. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5 – figure supplement 1B</xref> we now show that T18 of Spc110 is phosphorylated in mitosis and we also show the <italic>in vitro</italic> data on Spc110<sup>1-220-5D-pT18</sup> on γ-TuSC oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5– figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). These data are consistent with an inhibitory role of pT18. This role is now discussed in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) It is puzzling that mitotic recruitment of Spc97 to the SPB of T18D mutants remains unchanged (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1"><italic>Figure. 7–figure supplement 1D</italic></xref><italic>), although there is an effect on microtubule nucleation. This also contrasts with the effect of T18 phosphorylation on the oligomerization of gamma-TuSCs seen in vitro. It is important to resolve this discrepancy</italic>.</p><p>In response to this comment, we have performed the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1D</xref>. It shows that Spc97-GFP is recruited to SPBs of <italic>spc110-T18D</italic> cells with a time delay after SPB duplication. However, despite equal Spc97 amounts at SPBs in mitosis, <italic>spc110-T18D</italic> cells have a MT organization defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2A</xref> shows that Spc110<sup>1-220-T18D</sup> and Spc110<sup>1-220-5D-T18D</sup> form putative dimers with γ-TuSC (shoulder at 600 kDa) without inducing γ-TuSC oligomerization (Vo). This indicates that γ-TuSC recruitment to SPBs via Spc110 and γ-TuSC oligomerization into a nucleation platform are mechanistically two distinct steps. We discuss this scenario in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) It would further strengthen this manuscript if the authors could demonstrate in a more refined way that the pT18 epitope peaks late in mitosis and is lost upon mitotic exit (e.g., by immunoblotting of synchronized cells with anti pT18 in a time course experiment). The anti-phospho-T18 blots in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6A</italic></xref> <italic>are not convincing</italic>.</p><p>We tried to detect pT18 of Spc110 in IB with the P-specific anti-pT18 antibodies. However, this antibody only works with <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylated Spc110-pT18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A</xref>). We therefore turned to mass spectrometry to determine the cell cycle dependent phosphorylation of Spc110. We have fractionated yeast cells into a supernatant fraction and a SPB containing pellet. We have extracted SPB proteins from the pellet. Spc110-GFP was enriched form the supernatant and the SPB faction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B,C</xref> T18 of Spc110 is predominately phosphorylated in mitosis. This fits with the data from Keck et al., which showed that Spc110-T18 was phosphorylated in mitosis.</p><p><italic>4) The biological significance of T18 phosphorylation to inhibit microtubule nucleation is unclear. The dynamics of spindle microtubules are high during this mid-mitosis, thus to support this property it is likely that nucleation activities from the SPB should be high as well</italic>.</p><p>As outlined under 1) we have changed this part of the paper. In budding yeast, nuclear MTs are only dynamic from the plus end because of the blocking cap of γ-TuSC at the MT minus end. Data from T. Stearns (Murphy et al., 1998) suggest that in budding yeast MT nucleation mainly happens in S phase when SPBs duplicate but probably not in other cell cycle phases. The T18 phosphorylation could inhibit excess MT nucleation by SPB-associated γ-TuSC in mitosis. SPBs organize relative constant numbers of 20 MTs in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Winey et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Because T18A is not behaving as a non-phosphorylatable mutation, we unfortunately cannot test this model. However, we have discussed in line 510 of the Discussion the possibility that pT18 restricts the number of nuclear MTs in mitosis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
