a key role in many higher-order functions of the insect brain including navigation and activity regulation. Genetic tools for manipulating individual cell types, and knowledge of what neurotransmitters and neuromodulators they express, will be required to gain mechanistic understanding of how these functions are implemented. We generated and characterized split-GAL4 driver lines that express in individual or small subsets of about half of CX cell types. We surveyed neuropeptide and neuropeptide receptor expression in the central brain using fluorescent in situ hybridization. About half of the neuropeptides we examined were expressed in only a few cells, while the rest were expressed in dozens to hundreds of cells. Neuropeptide receptors were expressed more broadly and at lower levels. Using our GAL4 drivers to mark individual cell types, we found that 51 of the 85 CX cell types we examined expressed at least one neuropeptide and 21 expressed multiple neuropeptides. Surprisingly, all co-expressed a small molecule neurotransmitter. Finally, we used our driver lines to identify CX cell types whose activation affects sleep, and identified other central brain cell types that link the circadian clock to the CX. The well-characterized genetic tools and information on neuropeptide and neurotransmitter expression we provide should enhance studies of the CX.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>central complex</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd><kwd>driver lines</kwd><kwd>cell types</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitters</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolff</surname><given-names>Tanya</given-names></name><name><surname>Eddison</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Nan</given-names></name><name><surname>Nern</surname><given-names>Aljoscha</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Gerald M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH 2R15GM125073-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaramurthi</surname><given-names>Preeti</given-names></name><name><surname>Sitaraman</surname><given-names>Divya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 2042873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaramurthi</surname><given-names>Preeti</given-names></name><name><surname>Sitaraman</surname><given-names>Divya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic tools were generated and used to determine the neurotransmitters and neuropeptides used by individual cell types within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central complex and to study their roles in sleep regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The central complex (CX) of the adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> brain consists of approximately 2800 cells that have been divided into 257 cell types based on morphology and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hulse et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>). These cell types are themselves organized into a set of highly structured neuropils (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The CX plays a key role in the flow of information between sensory inputs and motor outputs. It is particularly important in orientation and navigation, and much progress has been made in defining the cell types and circuits involved in these behaviors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fisher, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green and Maimon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfeiffer, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Turner-Evans and Jayaraman, 2016</xref>). The CX also appears to participate in sleep and/or activity regulation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shafer and Keene, 2021</xref>). But these are unlikely to be the only functions performed by the CX.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of CX neuropils.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The brain areas included in the hemibrain connectome are shown with the CX and key connected brain areas highlighted.

However, the functions of most cell types in the CX remain unknown. Gaining this knowledge will likely require measuring and manipulating the activity of individual cell types. Such experiments are greatly facilitated by the availability of cell type-specific genetic driver lines. Such lines also allow biochemical approaches for determining the neurotransmitters and neuropeptides used by individual cells. This is particularly relevant for the CX, which is one of the most peptidergic brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kahsai and Winther, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nässel and Zandawala, 2019</xref>). The roles of neuropeptide signaling in the CX are largely unexplored.</p><p>In this paper, we present the results of our efforts to develop and characterize genetic driver lines for CX cell types. We also provide a survey of neuropeptide gene expression in the adult central brain as well as determine neurotransmitter (NT) and neuropeptide (NP) gene expression in over 80 CX cell types. Many CX neurons express NPs, with some cell types expressing multiple NPs as well as a fast-acting neurotransmitter. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our collection of driver lines to screen for cell types that influence activity/sleep when activated. In doing so, we uncovered cell types not previously known to play a role in these processes as well as new pathways of communication between the circadian clock and the CX.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and analysis of split-GAL4 lines for CX cell types</title><p>We generated cell type-specific split-GAL4 lines for CX cell types using the same general approach that we previously applied to the mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meissner et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rubin and Aso, 2024</xref>) and the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tuthill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nern et al., 2024</xref>); see methods for details. In a previous report, we described the generation of split-GAL4 lines for cell types innervating the protocerebral bridge (PB), noduli (NO), and asymmetrical body (AB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>). Here, we extend this work to the rest of the CX and include some improved lines for the PB, NO, and AB.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref> show the expression of 52 new split-GAL4 lines with strong GAL4 expression that is largely limited to the cell type of interest. All lines were imaged in the brain and ventral nerve cord of adult females, and some were also imaged in males; we did not image expression in the peripheral nervous system or in non-neuronal tissues. Together with the other lines generated in this study and our previous work, we generated high-quality lines for nearly one-third of CX cell types that were defined by analysis of the connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hulse et al., 2021</xref>). We also generated lines of lesser quality for other cell types that in total bring overall coverage to more than three quarters of CX cell types. These additional lines often show some combination of expression in more than one CX cell type, unwanted expression in other brain areas, or weak or stochastic expression. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> lists the two best split-GAL4 lines we generated for each CX cell type with comments about their specificity as well as the enhancers used to construct them.

Neuropeptides are widely expressed in the CX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kahsai and Winther, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nässel, 2018</xref>) and are likely to play important roles in its function. However, information on the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors is not provided by the connectome. To look for expression of neuropeptides in the CX, we took a curated list of 51 neuropeptide-encoding genes from FlyBase (FB2024_02, released April 23, 2024; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Öztürk-Çolak et al., 2024</xref>) and eliminated 12 genes based on their not having been detected in RNA profiling studies of the adult brain. Trissin and Natalisin were added to the FlyBase list based on evidence summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nässel, 2018</xref>. We only examined a small subset of neuropeptide receptors, selecting those whose cognate neuropeptides we thought might play a role in the CX. We used EASI-FISH to determine the expression patterns of these genes in the adult central brain of females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The list of 41 neuropeptides and 18 neuropeptide receptors we explored is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>The neuropeptide expression patterns we observed fell into two broad categories. Some neuropeptides, like those whose expression patterns are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, appeared to be highly expressed in only a few relatively larger cells. Such large neurosecretory cells often express the transcription factor DIMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2008</xref>). Several of these neuropeptides—for example, SIFa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Terhzaz et al., 2007</xref>) and Dsk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2020</xref>)—are expressed in broadly arborizing neurons that appear to deliver them to large areas of the brain and ventral nerve cord. In contrast, neuropeptides like those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are expressed in dozens to hundreds of cells and appear poised to function by transmission to nearby cells in multiple distinct circuits. NPF and SIFa appear to act in both these modes. As we show below, most of the neuropeptides shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are expressed in the CX, each in distinct subsets of cell types.</p><p>Neuropeptide receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) are more broadly, but not uniformly, expressed. In cases where more than one receptor has been identified for a given neuropeptide, such as Dh44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2023</xref>) and Tk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7T</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wohl et al., 2023</xref>), the different receptors have distinct, but overlapping, expression pattens.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Neuropeptide expression in CX cell types</title><p>We selected 17 neuropeptides whose transcripts were observed in cell bodies located in the same general brain areas as those of the intrinsic cells of the CX (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We used probes for these 17 genes to perform EASI-FISH on brains that also expressed GFP in a specific cell type. In this way, we could score neuropeptide expression in individual cell types as we had done for neurotransmitters. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows examples of this approach.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> presents a summary table of neurotransmitter and neuropeptide use by individual cell types based on our EASI-FISH results. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref> contains a list of the individual stable split lines that were used for each cell type and how they were scored. We also characterized six CX cell types by RNA profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2</xref>) and additional RNA profiling of CX cell types is provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Epiney et al., 2025</xref>. These RNA profiling results are largely congruent with the EASI-FISH data and allow a comparison of transcript number and in situ signal strength.</p><p>A few general features emerge from these data. First, more than half of the cell types assayed express a neuropeptide. This frequency is perhaps not surprising given that the CX is considered one of the most peptidergic regions of the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kahsai and Winther, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nässel, 2018</xref>); nevertheless, the fraction of cells expressing an NP appears to be several fold higher in the CX than observed in the adult brain as a whole, as judged by single-cell RNA profiling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davie et al., 2018</xref>). Second, every cell type that expressed a neuropeptide also expressed a small molecule neurotransmitter (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nässel, 2018</xref> for a discussion of other cases of co-expression). This co-transmitter was most often acetylcholine or glutamate, but we observed cases of GABA, dopamine, tyramine, octopamine, and serotonin. Third, co-transmission of two small molecule, fast-acting transmitters does occur but is rare. Conversely, co-transmission of a fast-acting transmitter and a modulatory transmitter such as serotonin is common: nine of ten cell types expressing the serotonin transporter also express another small transmitter, most often glutamate or acetylcholine. Octopamine is often, but not always, co-expressed with glutamate (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sherer et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Screen for cell types whose activation modifies sleep</title><p>Sleep is a behavior widely studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shafer and Keene, 2021</xref>). The phenotypic description of sleep and its relationship to activity, as well as the cell types that play a role in sleep regulation are under active study in many labs. The CX has been documented to be a significant brain region for sleep regulation. But many cell types in the CX have never been assayed for a role in sleep due to the lack of suitable genetic reagents. Therefore, we used our genetic drivers for CX cell types to screen for those whose activation by thermogenetics or optogenetics strongly influenced sleep or activity. As described in methods, we used three metrics: sleep duration; P(Doze), the probability that an active fly will stop moving; and P(Wake), the probability that a stationary fly will start moving. These assays were carried out over several years in parallel with our building the collection of lines, so many of the lines we assayed did not make it into our final collection of selected lines. Conversely, we did not assay all our best lines as many only became available after our behavior experiments were completed.</p><p>Our screen identified several cell types not previously associated with sleep and/or activity regulation. For example, hDeltaF was found to be strongly wake promoting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). We also identified PEN_b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>), PFGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>), EL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3</xref>), and hDeltaK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s4">Figure 10—figure supplement 4</xref>) as likely to play a role. In most of these cases, we were able to assay multiple independent driver lines for the cell type. We also assayed several lines that each contained a mixture of dorsal FB cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s5">Figure 10—figure supplement 5</xref>) but were otherwise free of contaminating brain or VNC expression. In addition to intrinsic components of the CX, we evaluated several cell types that, based on the connectome, we thought likely to convey information from the circadian clock to the CX. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> (SMP368) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref> (SMP531) present two such cases of strongly wake promoting cell types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Activation of hDeltaF, comprised of eight intrinsic FB columnar neurons (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hulse et al., 2021</xref>) decreases sleep.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Thermogenetic activation and DAM-based monitoring using the split-GAL4 lines SS54903, SS53683, and SS63959 produced decreased sleep duration and increased P(Wake) in all three lines as compared to the control (empty-GAL4).

While we identified several new potential sleep regulating cell types within CX, we did not perform the additional characterization needed to elucidate the roles of these cell types. For example, we did not examine the effects of inhibiting their function. Nor did we examine parameters such as arousal thresholds or recovery from sleep deprivation. Finally, by using only a 24-hr activation protocol we might have missed features only observable in shorter activation protocols. On the other hand, we assayed all lines in both males and females with identical genetic and environmental manipulations and many lines were evaluated by both optogenetic and thermogenetic activation. We observed that many lines showed phenotypes that differed between sexes, even though the expression patterns of the split-GAL4 lines did not obviously differ across sexes. Lines that showed strong effects generally did so with both activation modes and with both beam crossing-based activity measures and video-based locomotion tracking.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Connections between the CX and the circadian clock</title><p>Not surprisingly, the connectome reveals that many of the intrinsic CX cell types with sleep phenotypes are connected by wired pathways.

We found two SMP cell types, SMP368 and SMP531, that were very strongly wake promoting when activated suggesting they might be components of previously undescribed wired pathways from the clock to the CX.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Circuit diagram of CX cells implicated in regulating sleep.</title><p>Selected CX cell types, plus non-CX cell types SMP368, LNd, and OA-VPM3, are shown. The number within each circle denotes the number of cells in that cell type. The neurotransmitters used by each cell type are indicated by color coding, and the number of synapses between cell types is represented by arrow width. Cell types that have been shown to promote sleep or wake when activated are indicated. Experimental evidence for the wake promoting effects of OA-VPM3 is from Reyes, M and Sitaraman D (in preparation). In cases where we have experimentally determined expression of neuropeptides or neuropeptide receptor genes by either EASI-FISH or RNA profiling, this information is indicated in the boxes next to the relevant cell type. Cell type names are from the hemibrain release 1.2.1 except for the LNd neurons whose names have been modified based on morphology and connectivity; they have been grouped into two types: LNd (E1) corresponds to hemibrain body IDs 5813056917 + 5813021192 and LNd (E2) corresponds to hemibrain body IDs 511051477 (5th LNv) + 5813069648 (LNd6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shafer et al., 2022</xref>). Because the CX is a central body and the inputs from CX cells that have their soma in right or left hemisphere appear to be comingled on their downstream targets, the synaptic strengths shown represent the combined number of cells of each type, regardless of soma position. For example, the arrow thickness between FB6F and hDeltaF reflects the total number of synapses (368) from FB6F_R and FB6F_L to all hDeltaF cells; the individual synapse number between each of the two FB6F cells to each of the eight hDeltaF cells, which ranges from 7 to 39, can be found in neuPrint. The sole exception is the LNd cells where the synaptic strength represents only the output of LNds in the right hemisphere.

We illustrate their use in discovering cell types involved in activity regulation, and uncovered new potential wired and peptidergic connections between the circadian clock and the CX. We surveyed neuropeptide and neuropeptide receptor gene expression in the adult central brain. Neuropeptides fell into two broad categories, those at are expressed in only a few cells and those that are expressed in dozens to hundreds of cells. We observed that neuropeptide receptor genes were much more broadly expressed than those of their cognate neuropeptides. Finally, we generated the largest available dataset of co-expression of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters in identified cell types. Unexpectedly, we found that all neuropeptide-expressing cell types also expressed a small neurotransmitter. Our data reveal the pervasive potential for peptidergic communication within the CX—more than half of the cell types we examined expressed a neuropeptide and one-third of those expressed multiple neuropeptides.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Generation of split-GAL4 lines</title><p>Split-GAL4 lines were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dionne et al., 2018</xref>).

Most assignments were rated as Probable indicating 70–95% confidence. Lines whose cell type assignments are listed as Probable have been rigorously examined and the assignments are the most accurate that the available data allow. In the absence of single-cell data available in MCFO brains (the case for many lines) or additional data (e.g., physiological data on connectivity), cell types that are morphologically very similar cannot be distinguished with complete confidence.

Robert Ray performed the RNA profiling experiments summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2</xref> and the meta-analysis of RNA profiling data to identify which neuropeptide genes were expressed in the adult brain. Marisa Dreher (Dreher Design Studios) performed connectomic analyses and figure generation. We thank Janelia’s Project Technical Resources led by Gudrun Ihrke for assistance: ME, Kari Close and Yisheng He performed EASI-FISH experiments, and Claire Managan scored results; Dan Bushey helped with earlier versions of python scripts to collate sleep assay datasets. Jennifer Jeter imaged and scored EASI-FISH experiments. Janelia’s FlyLight Project Team and Project Pipeline Support team, especially Allison Vannan, Jennifer Jeter, Joanna Hausenfluck, Zachary Dorman, Kelley Lee, and Geoffrey Meissner, performed CNS dissections, staining, and imaging. Janelia’s Invertebrate Shared Resource and Scientific Computing contributed to stock generation and image processing, respectively. Geoffrey Meissner and Rob Svirskas contributed to the split-GAL4 website. Michael Kunst, Preeti Sareen, and Michael Nitabach contributed to early screening of split-GAL4 lines for effects on sleep. Wyatt Korff helped with establishment of the 96-well sleep assay. Heather Dionne, Martin Reyes, Anisha Ali, and Matthew Finger helped with conducting sleep experiments and analyzing data. We thank Brad Hulse, Alexander Bates, Gabi Maimon, Maria de la Paz, Dick Nässel, Mubarak Hussain Syed, Meet Zandawala, and members of the Rosbash lab for comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript and for helpful discussion.

All this is very useful. I have one suggestion to help a reader trying to get a &quot;bird's eye view&quot; of such a large amount of detailed and multi-layered information. Give each of the 257 CX cell types an arbitrary number: 1 to 257. In fact, Supplemental File 2 lists ~277 cell types each with a number in sequence, so perhaps in principle, it is there. This could expedite the search function when a reader is trying to cross-reference CX cell type information from the text, to the Figures and/or to the Supplemental Figures. Also, the use of (arbitrary) cell type numbers could expedite the explanation of which cell types are included in any compilation of information (e.g., which ones were tested for specific NT expression).</p></disp-quote><p>In this report we adhered to the nomenclature introduced in Hulse et al. 2021. We agree that the nomenclature of cell types in the CX is imperfect. There are inherent limitations to what can be done with present data. Even between the hemibrain and FAFB/Flywire EM datasets, it was not possible to derive a one-to-one correspondence in many cases, largely because we do not yet have enough information to distinguish between natural variation within a cell type and distinct cell types (see Schlegel et al. 2024). Moreover, many cell type distinctions depend on connectivity differences that are observable only in EM datasets but not in LM images. Several research groups are currently engaged in a comprehensive and collaborative effort to update the CX nomenclature that will extend over the next few months as additional connectomes become available. This work will require hundreds of hours of effort from anatomical and computational experts in multiple laboratories who have a strong interest in the CX. Since the correspondence between the established Hulse et al nomenclature we use and this new nomenclature will be made clear, it will be easy to transfer our data to that new nomenclature. For all these reasons, we believe we should not unilaterally introduce any new naming systems at this time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>manuscript p 2</p><p>&quot;Figure 2 and Figure 2-figure supplements 1-4 show the expression of 52 new split-GAL4 lines with strong GAL4 expression that is largely limited to the cell type of interest. .... We also generated lines of lesser quality for other cell types that in total bring overall coverage to more than three quarters of CX cell types.&quot;</p><p>This section describes the generation and identification of specific split Gal4 lines, and the presentation is generally excellent. It represents an outstanding compendium of information. My reading of the text suggests ~200 cell types have Gal4 lines that are of immediate use (having high specificity or v close-to-high). Use of an arbitrary number system (mentioned above) could augment that description for the reasons stated. For example, which of the 257 cell types are represented by split Gal4 lines that constitute the ~1/3 representing &quot;high-quality lines &quot;? A second comment relates to this study 's functional analysis of the contributions of CX cell types to sleep physiology. The recent literature contains renewed interest in the specific expression patterns of Gal4 lines that can promote sleep-like behaviors. In particular Gal4 line expression outside the brain (in the VNC and outside the CNS) have been raised as important elements that need be included for interpretation interpretation of sleep regulation. This present study offers useful information about a large number of expression patterns, as well as a basis with which to seek additional information., including mention of VNC expression in many cases However, perhaps I missed it, but I could not find a short description of the over-all strategy used to describe the expression patterns and feel that could be helpful. Were all Gal4 lines studied for expression in the VNC? and in the peripheral NS? It is probably published elsewhere, but even a short reprise would still be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a couple of sentences to clarify that the lines were imaged in the adult female brain and VNC and many were also imaged in males. These data, including the ability to download the original confocal stacks, are contained in an on-line web source cited in the text. We also make clear that we did not assay expression outside of the brain, optic lobes and VNC. Therefore, we cannot rule out expression in the peripheral nervous system (other than detected in the axons of sensory neurons in the CNS) or in muscle or other non-neuronal cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>manuscript p 9</p><p>Neurotransmitter expression in CX cell types</p><p>&quot;To determine what neurotransmitters are used by the CX cell types, we carried out fluorescent in situ hybridization using EASI-FISH (Eddison and Irkhe, 2022; Close et al., 2024) on brains that also expressed GFP driven from a cell-type-specific split GAL4 line. In this way, we could determine what neurotransmitters were expressed in over 100 different CX cell types based on ....&quot;</p><p>Reading this description, I was uncertain whether the &gt;100 cell types mentioned were tested with all the NT markers by EASI-FISH? Also, assigning arbitrary numbers to the cell types (same suggestion as above) could help the reader more readily ascertain which were the ~100 cell types classified in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>The specific probes used for each cell type are indicated in Figure 9 and in Supplemental File 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>manuscript p 10</p><p>&quot;Our full results are summarized below, together with our analysis of neuropeptide expression in the same cell types.&quot;</p><p>I recommend specifying which Figures and Tables contain the &quot;full results&quot; indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the wording to read:</p><p>“Our full results are summarized, together with our analysis of neuropeptide expression in the same cell types, in Figures 5 -9 and in Supplemental File 1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>NP expression in CX cell types</p><p>Similar to the comments regarding studies of NT expression: were all ~100 cell types tested with each of the 17 selected NPs?

For neuropeptides, each of the 17 selected NP probes shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 was used on all cell types in Figure 9 except those marked by “—” in the neuropeptide column.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>manuscript p. 11</p><p>&quot;The neuropeptide expression patterns we observed fell into two broad categories.&quot;</p><p>This section presents information that is extensive and extremely useful. It supports consideration of peptidergic cell signaling at a circuits level and in a systematic fashion that will promote future progress in this field. I have two comments. First, regarding the categorization of two NP expression patterns, discernible by differences in cell number: this idea mirrors one present in prior literature. Recently the classification of the transcription factor DIMM summarizes this same two-way categorization (e.g., doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0001896). That included the fact that a single NP can be utilized by cell of either category.</p></disp-quote><p>We inserted a sentence to acknowledge this earlier work:</p><p>“Such large neurosecretory cells often express the transcription factor DIMM (Park et al. 2008).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, regarding this comment:</p><p>&quot;In contrast, neuropeptides like those shown in Figure 6 appear to be expressed in dozens to hundreds of cells and appear poised to function by local volume transmission in multiple distinct circuits.&quot;</p><p>Signaling by NPs in this second category (many small cells) suggests more local diffusion, a smaller geographic expanse compared to &quot;volume&quot; signaling by the sparser larger peptidergic cells. Given this, I suggest re-consideration in using the term &quot;volume&quot; in this instance, perhaps in favor of &quot;local&quot; or &quot;paracrine&quot;. This is only a suggestion and in fact rests almost entirely on speculation/ interpretation, as the field lacks a strong empirical basis to say how far NPs diffuse and act. A recent study in the fly brain of peptide co-transmitters (doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2020.04.025) provides an instructive example in which differences between the spatial extents of long-range (peptide 1) versus short-range (peptide 2) NP signaling may be inferred in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to now read:</p><p>“those shown in Figure 6 are expressed in dozens to hundreds of cells and appear poised to function by transmission to nearby cells in multiple distinct circuits.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Spab was mentioned (Figure 6 legend) but discarded as a candidate NP to include based on a personal communication, as was Nplp1. The manuscript did not include reasons to do so, nor include a reference to spab peptide. I suggest including explicit reasons to discard candidate NPs.</p></disp-quote><p>While there is strong supportive evidence for many NPs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the fact that other transcripts express NPs is more circumstantial often relying simply on sequence analysis and without convincing evidence for a specific cognate receptor. We note that Spab is not listed as a neuropeptide in the current release of FlyBase. In these cases, we relied on the opinion of individuals with extensive experience in studying Drosophila NPs. The results obtained with the probes for Spab and Nplp1 are still available in Supplemental File 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Fig 9-supplement 1, neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes were measured by RNA-seq for given CX cell types to augment the cell type classification. The same methods could be used to support cell type classification regarding putative peptidergic character (in Figure 9 supplement 2) by measuring expression levels of critical, canonical neuropeptide biosynthetic enzymes. These include the proprotein convertase dPC2 (amon); the carboxypeptidase dCPD/E (silver); and the amidating enzymes dPHM; dPal1; dPal2. PHM is most related to DBM (dopamine beta monooxygenase), the rate limiting enzyme for DA production, and greater than 90% of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuropeptides are amidated. If the authors are correct in surmising widespread use of NPs by CX cell types (and I expect they are), there could be diagnostic value to report expression levels of this enzyme set across many/most CX cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>In our admittedly limited experience, most cells express these enzymes and the level we observed in confirmed NP expressing cell types was not reproducibly higher. (The complete data for all genes for the cell types we assayed are available from our deposition in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus with accession number GSE271123.) Given our small sample size we chose not to comment on this in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #6</p><p>Screen of effects on Sleep behavior</p><p>This work is large in scope and as suggested likely presents excellent starting points for many follow-up studies. I again suggest assigning stable number identities to the elements described. In this case, not cell types, but split Gal4 lines. This would expedite the cross-referencing of results across the four Supplemental Files 3-6. For example, line SS00273 is entry line #27 in S Files 3 and 4, but line entry #18 in S Files 5 and 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the interested reader can make this correspondence by searching the supplemental files which are excel spreadsheets. We note that both driver lines and cell types have stable identifiers that are used across Figures and Tables: the line numbers (for example, SS00273) for driver lines and the Hulse et al cell type names for cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>manuscript p 26</p><p>Clock to CX</p><p>&quot;Not surprisingly, the connectome reveals that many of the intrinsic CX cell types with sleep phenotypes are connected by wired pathways (Figure 12 and Figure 12-figure supplement 1).&quot;</p><p>Do intrinsic CX cells with sleep phenotypes also connect by wired pathways to CX cells that do not have sleep phenotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, but we do not have high confidence that negative sleep phenotypes in our assays indicate no role in sleep.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;The connectome also suggested pathways from the circadian clock to the CX.

The behavior of control flies is not as disrupted or altered at this temperature, and 29 degrees for activation is routinely used in behavioral experiments.</p><p>We similarly selected an optogenetic stimulation protocol that minimizes the response of flies to the red-light pulses. We chose this protocol because we found, in earlier experiments in a different project, that this level of stimulation was able to elicit activation phenotypes across a range of cell types (including several known clock neurons). However, we cannot rule out false negatives in both the TrpA and optogenetic experiments and agree that we might have missed some phenotypes.</p><p>Finally, as the reviewer rightfully points out, a thorough, detailed investigation of each cell type is a herculean task. We screened in both genders with very sparse, and often cell-type-specific, driver lines while using two distinct modes of activation and different methods for assessing sleep. For these reasons, we believe the GAL4 lines we identified provide excellent starting points for the additional investigations that will be required to better understand the roles of specific cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) There are multiple spelling errors in the manuscript that need to be addressed.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors created and characterized genetic tools that allow for precise manipulation of individual or small subsets of central complex (CX) cell types in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain.
