As a result, vitamin D supplements are widely prescribed with an estimated 18% of adults in the USA reportedly taking supplements daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rooney et al., 2017</xref>). However, there is increasing evidence from the literature suggesting that vitamin D supplements may be ineffective at reducing disease risk in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bouillon et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, these conventional association studies may have been susceptible to bias, given that vitamin D levels are known to differ amongst individuals based on various lifestyle factors, including their body mass index (BMI), as well as being prone to reverse causation, for example due to inflammatory processes which are known to lower vitamin D levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Preiss and Sattar, 2019</xref>).</p><p>An approach to mitigate the influence of these sources of bias is Mendelian randomization (MR), a causal inference technique which exploits the random allocation of genetic variants at birth to evaluate the genetically predicted effects of modifiable exposures on disease outcomes and circulating biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davey Smith and Ebrahim, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Richmond and Davey Smith, 2022</xref>). For example, MR has been applied in recent years to suggest that vitamin D supplements are unlikely to have a beneficial effect on risk of T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Manousaki et al., 2021</xref>), whereas a recent study suggests that genetically lowered vitamin D levels may increase the risk of multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mokry et al., 2015</xref>). We previously extended the application of MR to investigate epidemiological hypotheses in a lifecourse setting (known to as ‘lifecourse MR’), by deriving sets of genetic variants to separate the independent effects of body size during childhood and adulthood within a multivariable framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Richardson et al., 2020</xref>). Applying this approach has highlighted the putative causal role that early life adiposity may have on outcomes such as T1D risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Richardson et al., 2022</xref>) and cardiac structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">O’Nunain et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, we have demonstrated that its influence on other disease outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular disease; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Power et al., 2021</xref>) is likely attributed to the long-term consequence of remaining overweight into later life.</p><p>Whilst these applications serve as powerful examples of lifecourse MR as an approach to separate the effects of the same exposure based on data derived from early and later life, it has yet to be applied to the same outcome when measured at different timepoints in the lifecourse. In this study, we applied lifecourse MR to investigate the independent effects of childhood and adult body size on 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels measured during childhood (mean age: 9.9 years, range = 8.9–11.5 years) using individual-level data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyd et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fraser et al., 2013</xref>) and during adulthood (mean age: 56.5 years, range = 40–69 years) using summary-level data based on individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Manousaki et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic instruments for childhood and adult body size</title><p>Derivation of genetic instruments for childhood and adulthood body size have been described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Richardson et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted on 463,005 UKB participants (mean age: 56.5 years, range = 40–69 years) who had both reported their body size at age 10 as well as had their BMI clinically measured. Genetic instruments were identified from these analyses (based on p&lt;5 × 10<sup>–8</sup>) and the resulting genetic score for childhood body size has been validated using measured childhood BMI in ALSPAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Richardson et al., 2020</xref>), the Young Finns Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>), and the Trøndelag Health (HUNT) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandkvist et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children</title><p>ALSPAC is a population-based cohort investigating genetic and environmental factors that affect the health and development of children.

MR analyses to estimate effects on adulthood 25OHD were undertaken in a two-sample setting using the inverse variance weighted method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess et al., 2013</xref>), as well as the weighted median and MR-Egger methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bowden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>—Table 1). Multivariable MR analyses were performed in one- and two-sample settings respectively for childhood and adulthood measures of 25OHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>—Table 2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Firstly, using data measured at mean age 9.9 years in the lifecourse from the ALSPAC study, our analyses indicated that childhood body size directly influences vitamin D levels during childhood after accounting for the adult body size genetic instrument in our model (beta = −0.32 standard deviation change in natural log-transformed 25OHD per change in body size category, 95% CI = −0.54 to –0.10, p=0.004) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Using data from the UKB study, evidence of an effect of higher childhood body size on adulthood measured 25OHD levels (beta = −0.14, 95% CI = −0.10 to –0.03, p=2.4 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) attenuated in a multivariable setting upon accounting for adulthood body size (beta = 0.04, 95% CI = −0.01 to 0.08, p=0.10). In contrast, strong evidence of an effect for higher adult body size on lower 25OHD levels measured in adulthood was found in the multivariable model accounting for the childhood body size score (beta = −0.17, 95% CI = −0.21 to –0.13, p=4.6 × 10<sup>–17</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggests that childhood body size has an indirect influence of 25OHD levels in adulthood, likely due to its persistent effect throughout the lifecourse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Separating causal from confounding factors, particularly in a lifecourse setting, would have been extremely challenging to disentangle without the use of genetic variants as achieved in this study. In contrast, appropriately accounting for confounding factors in an conventional epidemiological setting is notoriously challenging, with previous studies reporting evidence of association between vitamin D and T1D in early life even after adjusting for factors such as birthweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hyppönen et al., 2001</xref>). Taken together with evidence from previous MR studies, which have found that childhood body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Richardson et al., 2022</xref>), but not vitamin D levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Manousaki et al., 2021</xref>), increases risk of T1D, our results suggest that adiposity may have acted as a confounding factor on the observed association between vitamin D and T1D. Evidence from this study therefore highlights the importance of developing a deeper understanding into the role that confounding factors, such as adiposity, may potentially have in distorting observational associations between vitamin D levels and disease risk. Future studies are therefore warranted to disentangle the causal factors which influence disease risk from non-causal confounding factors through the triangulation of multiple lines of evidence including those identified by robustly conducted MR studies.</p><p>Our conclusions are also supported by the outcomes of recent large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation. For instance, as highlighted by recent reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebeling, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bouillon et al., 2022</xref>), whilst observational studies have found that low vitamin D levels associate with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer outcomes, there has been little convincing evidence from RCTs that a causal relationship may underly these findings. Additionally, recent RCTs have reported evidence of a potential interaction between vitamin D supplementation and BMI, such as the Finnish Vitamin D Trial (FIND) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Virtanen et al., 2022</xref>) and D-Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Waterhouse et al., 2021</xref>) studies.</p><p>Effect estimates derived from MR studies are conventionally interpreted as ‘lifelong effects’ given that the germline genetic variants harnessed by this approach as instrumental variables are typically fixed at conception. The results of this study serve as a compelling demonstration that the timepoint at which both exposures and outcomes are measured across the lifecourse can meaningfully impact conclusions drawn by MR investigations. Whilst the childhood and adult body size genetic scores were used in this study as a proof of concept, our findings also help to further validate their utility in separating the temporal effects of adiposity within a lifecourse MR framework. Overall, these findings emphasise the importance of future MR studies taking further consideration into the age of participants that their genetic estimates are based on, as well as the age at which cases are diagnosed for disease outcome estimates, before interpreting and drawing conclusions from their findings.</p><p>Furthermore, our results suggest that conducting GWAS on populations of different age groups will add value in helping uncover time-varying genetic effects scattered throughout the human genome. Findings from these endeavours should facilitate studies applying techniques such as lifecourse MR, which can provide insight into the direct and indirect effects of modifiable early life exposures on disease outcomes by harnessing genetic estimates obtained from unprecedented sample sizes when conducted in a two-sample setting. That said, lifecourse MR requires careful examination of genetic instruments to ensure that they are capable of robustly separating the effects of an exposure at different timepoints over the lifecourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sanderson et al., 2022</xref>). Doing so may help to elucidate the critical timepoints whereby conferred risk by these exposures on disease outcomes starts to become immutable, which has important implications for improving patient care in a clinical setting.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Consent</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained for all study participants.

obesity. It uses a Mendelian randomization framework to separate the genetically predicted effects of adiposity at two timepoints in the lifecourse, childhood, and adulthood. The key claims are well supported by the data. Higher childhood body size had a direct effect on lower vitamin D levels in early life, while in midlife, childhood body size impacted adult obesity to result in lower vitamin D levels.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79798.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01pxwe438</institution-id><institution>McGill University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Ebeling</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02bfwt286</institution-id><institution>Monash University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.11.22274956">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.11.22274956v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and I personally oversaw the evaluation in my joint role of Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Ebeling (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another and with me. I drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As recommended by the two reviewers, please include a discussion on recent trials or studies that shed light on the same topic of the interplay of BMI and vitamin D on health outcomes.</p><p>2) Please acknowledge the limitations and additional caveats pointed out by reviewer #2</p><p>3) In addition, please revise the manuscript as per the additional recommendations by both reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This reviewer has the following recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. It might be worth including data from recent large RCTs showing interactions of BMI with outcomes related to vitamin D supplementation, cardiovascular events and falls, highlighted in a recent editorial (PMID: 35348579). This would support their data.</p><p>2. Examples are the FIND (PMID: 34982819) and D-Health (PMID: 34337905) studies with the specific outcomes of increased cardiovascular events and falls, respectively, in those supplemented participants with a BMI &lt;25 kg/m2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>– Line 50-52: I would suggest replacing the Murai et al. 2021 reference by a paper providing a more general overview, as the Murai et al. 2021 publication describes a RCT for vitamin D supplementation in covid-19 patients specifically.

I was wondering whether similar results are obtained when selecting variants from the Revez et al. 2020 GWAS (PMID 32242144) ? Both are conducted in UK Biobank, though there are small differences in sample sizes and number of variants (especially due to differences in minor allele frequency filtering).</p><p>– Line 93: Multivariate while in line 96: multivariable.

Would it be possible to add some more details on selection of instrumental variables (in line with STROBE-MR guidelines), as initially 295 variants for childhood and 557 variants for adulthood body size have been identified in Richardson et al. 2020 while respectively 253 and 488 are included in the MR analyses.
