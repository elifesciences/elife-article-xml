figuring out how to use antibiotics therapeutically without promoting the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Here, we demonstrate proof of concept for an adjunctive therapy that allows intravenous antibiotic treatment without driving the evolution and onward transmission of resistance. We repurposed the FDA-approved bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine, which we show binds the antibiotic daptomycin, as an ‘anti-antibiotic’ to disable systemically-administered daptomycin reaching the gut. We hypothesized that adjunctive cholestyramine could enable therapeutic daptomycin treatment in the bloodstream, while preventing transmissible resistance emergence in opportunistic pathogens colonizing the gastrointestinal tract. We tested this idea in a mouse model of <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> gastrointestinal tract colonization. In mice treated with daptomycin, adjunctive cholestyramine therapy reduced the fecal shedding of daptomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> by up to 80-fold. These results provide proof of concept for an approach that could reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance for important hospital pathogens.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Antibiotics are essential for treating infections. But their use can inadvertently lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that do not respond to antibiotic drugs, making infections with these bacteria difficult or impossible to treat. Finding ways to prevent antibiotic resistance is critical to preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics.</p><p>Many bacteria that cause infections in hospitals live in the intestines, where they are harmless. But these bacteria can cause life-threatening infections when they get into the bloodstream. When patients with bloodstream infections receive antibiotics, the bacteria in their intestines are also exposed to the drugs. This can kill off all antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, leaving behind only bacteria that have mutations that allow them to survive the drugs. These drug-resistant bacteria can then spread to other patients causing hard-to-treat infections.</p><p>To stop this cycle of antibiotic treatment and antibiotic resistance, Morley et al. tested whether giving a drug called cholestyramine with intravenous antibiotics could protect the gut bacteria. In the experiments, mice were treated systemically with an antibiotic called daptomycin, which caused the growth of daptomycin-resistant strains of bacteria in the mice’s intestines. In the laboratory, Morley et al. discovered that cholestyramine can inactivate daptomycin.</p><p>Giving the mice cholestyramine and daptomycin together prevented the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the mice's intestines. Moreover, cholestyramine is taken orally and is not absorbed into the blood. It therefore only inactivates the antibiotic in the gut, but not in the blood.</p><p>The experiments provide preliminary evidence that giving cholestyramine with antibiotics might help prevent the spread of drug resistance. Cholestyramine is already used to lower cholesterol levels in people. More studies are needed to determine if cholestyramine can protect gut bacteria and prevent antibiotic resistance in people.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Enterococcus faecium</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial resistance</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial stewardship</kwd><kwd>evolutionary medicine</kwd><kwd>daptomycin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Eberly College of Science, Penn State</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Read</surname><given-names>Andrew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Eberly Family Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Read</surname><given-names>Andrew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI143852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woods</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cholestyramine, an FDA-approved bile acid sequestrant, can be repurposed to inactivate the antibiotic daptomycin in the gut, which prevents the emergence of transmissible antibiotic resistance in gastrointestinal <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> populations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> (VR <italic>E. faecium</italic>) is an important cause of antibiotic-resistant infections in healthcare settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias and Murray, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">García-Solache and Rice, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Driscoll and Crank, 2015</xref>). The antibiotic daptomycin is one of the few remaining first-line therapies for VRE infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Driscoll and Crank, 2015</xref>), but daptomycin-resistance is spreading in VRE populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Judge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamboj et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kinnear et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Woods et al., 2018</xref>). Therapeutic daptomycin use is thought to be a key driver of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinnear et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Woods et al., 2018</xref>). Managing the evolution of daptomycin-resistance in healthcare settings is crucial to future control of VRE infections.</p><p><italic>E. faecium</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the human GI tract asymptomatically, spreads via fecal-oral transmission, and causes symptomatic infections when introduced to sites like the bloodstream or the urinary tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias and Murray, 2012</xref>). <italic>E. faecium</italic> colonizing the gut may be exposed to daptomycin during therapeutic use, potentially contributing to the transmission of daptomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic>. Daptomycin is administered intravenously to treat infections caused by pathogens including VRE and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Daptomycin is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, but 5–10% of the dose enters the intestines through biliary excretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woodworth et al., 1992</xref>). We hypothesize that this therapeutically unnecessary intestinal daptomycin exposure could drive resistance evolution in <italic>E. faecium</italic> colonizing the gut. Increased resistance in colonizing populations is important, because gut <italic>E. faecium</italic> populations are sources for nosocomial infections and transmission between patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alevizakos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olivier et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>If unintended intestinal daptomycin exposure drives resistance evolution in <italic>E. faecium</italic>, this offers an opportunity to intervene. The opportunity emerges from a key feature of this system—the bacteria causing infection are physically separated from the population contributing to transmission. If daptomycin could be inactivated in the intestine without altering plasma concentrations, daptomycin could be used to kill bacteria at the target infection site without driving resistance in off-target populations. Preventing resistance evolution in these reservoir populations could protect patients from acquiring resistant infections, and it could limit the shedding of resistant strains and so onward transmission to other patients. We hypothesized that co-administering an oral adjuvant that reduces daptomycin activity would prevent selection for daptomycin-resistance in the gut during systemic daptomycin treatment. We tested this strategy using the adjuvant cholestyramine in a mouse VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> gut colonization model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of daptomycin-resistant VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> in the mouse GI tract</title><p>To directly test the proposition that systemic daptomycin treatment could select for resistance in the GI tract, and to generate daptomycin-resistant VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> mutants for subsequent experiments, we inoculated mice orally with daptomycin-susceptible VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> strains. Beginning one day after <italic>E. faecium</italic> inoculation, mice received daily doses of either subcutaneous daptomycin (50, 100, or 400 mg/kg), oral daptomycin (5, 50, 100, or 400 mg/kg), or a control mock injection for 5 days. We used a range of doses and routes of administration to maximize the likelihood of observing resistance emergence in at least one of the mice. The 50 and 100 mg/kg subcutaneous doses were selected to generate pharmacokinetics similar to clinical human doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mortin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Samonis et al., 2008</xref>), and the 5 mg/kg oral approximates the 5–10% of a daptomycin dose that is secreted into the intestines during standard intravenous treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woodworth et al., 1992</xref>). We used two susceptible VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> strains, BL00239-1 (MIC<sub>c</sub> = 2.0 (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration computed, see Methods)) and PR00708-14 (MIC<sub>c</sub> = 2.7), which were originally isolated at the University of Michigan Hospital from a clinical bloodstream infection and a different patient’s clinical perirectal swab, respectively. Mouse fecal samples were collected to quantify VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> shedding and determine daptomycin susceptibility of isolated <italic>E. faecium</italic> clones.</p><p>Only very high daptomycin doses (400 mg/kg subcutaneous, ≥50 mg/kg oral) consistently reduced fecal VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> below the level of detection during treatment; with lower doses, VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> shedding was often detectable throughout treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For Strain BL00239-1, <italic>E. faecium</italic> clones with increased daptomycin-resistance were isolated from two of three mice following treatment with 100 mg/kg subcutaneous daptomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). We chose one of these daptomycin-resistant clones to use in subsequent experiments (strain BL00239-1-R, MIC<sub>c</sub> = 8.6). Sequencing of the core genome showed that the resistant strain acquired a mutation in the major cardiolipin synthase <italic>clsA</italic> gene (R211L, CGA→CTA), which has been previously described in association with daptomycin-resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2015</xref>), and a transposon insertion into the methionine sulfoxide reductase <italic>msrA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). For the second strain (PR00708-14), mice were treated with subcutaneous daptomycin (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) or a mock injection. We screened for the emergence of increased resistance by plating mouse fecal suspensions on daptomycin-supplemented agar. Samples from two mice treated with 200 mg/kg daptomycin produced colonies on daptomycin-supplemented plates, and we isolated three clones from each of these samples. These isolated clones had increased daptomycin MIC<sub>c</sub> relative to PR00708-14 by broth microdilution (MIC<sub>c</sub> = 13.5, 11.5, and 8.0 from one mouse; MIC<sub>c</sub> = 12.0, 29.8, and 12.0 from the second mouse).We chose one of these isolated clones for use in subsequent experiments (PR00708-14-R, MIC<sub>c</sub> = 12.0). Genome sequencing revealed that PR00708-14 and PR00708-14-R differed by two mutations, which to our knowledge have not previously been associated with daptomycin-resistance. We identified mutations in a TerC family integral membrane protein (locus tag HMPREF0351_10759 in D0 <italic>E. faecium</italic> reference genome, I22T, CGA→CTA) and in a hypothetical protein (locus tag HMPREF0351_12146 in D0 <italic>E. faecium</italic> reference genome, frameshift, deleted G at 190nt). These experiments show that daptomycin-resistance can emerge de novo in <italic>E. faecium</italic> colonizing the GI tract following systemic daptomycin treatment.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Emergence of daptomycin-resistant VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> in mouse GI tracts following subcutaneous daptomycin treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> densities in fecal samples during and after daptomycin treatment (strain BL00239-1).

We orally inoculated mice with a 1:20 mixture of the experimentally generated daptomycin-resistant and susceptible VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> strains (BL00239-1-R and BL00239-1). Note that this approach – seeding inocula with known numbers of resistant bacteria – allows the response to selection to be measured while avoiding the experimental noise introduced by mutation waiting times. Mice were treated with subcutaneous daptomycin (50, 75, 100, or 200 mg/kg) for five or ten days after VRE inoculation. Control mice received either a mock saline injection or no injection. Fecal samples from Days 8 and 14 post-inoculation were plated in triplicate to quantify total VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> density, and samples were also plated on daptomycin-supplemented agar to estimate the proportion of VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> that were daptomycin-resistant.

To quantify fecal daptomycin concentrations, we analyzed fecal samples from a subset of daptomycin-treated mice by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Samples from all time points tested (Days 2, 6, and 8) contained detectable daptomycin, and concentrations generally peaked at the end of treatment (Day 6). Higher daptomycin doses generally corresponded to higher fecal concentrations, but concentrations were highly variable and overlapped between treatments. While fecal VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> densities correlated poorly with the daptomycin dose administered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), fecal VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> densities correlated with the amount of daptomycin recovered in feces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These data confirmed that subcutaneously-administered daptomycin at our experimental doses generated a range of daptomycin concentrations in the GI tract that included inhibitory concentrations for the susceptible VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> strain.</p><p>We ran two additional experiments to further investigate the competitive dynamics between this susceptible and resistant pair (BL00239-1 and BL00239-1-R) in the presence and absence of daptomycin treatment. First, we tested whether susceptible bacteria competitively suppressed resistant bacteria in the GI tract. We inoculated mice with either a mixture of 10<sup>8</sup> CFU susceptible + 10<sup>3</sup> CFU-resistant VR <italic>E. faecium</italic>, or with a resistant-only inoculum at one of two inoculum sizes (10<sup>8</sup> CFU or 10<sup>3</sup> CFU). Mice received 5 days of subcutaneous daptomycin injections at 100 mg/kg or control saline injections. Shedding of resistant and susceptible bacteria were quantified at time points throughout the experiment by plating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the absence of daptomycin treatment, the daptomycin-susceptible strain remained the most prevalent in mixed populations. When mixed populations were exposed to daptomycin, resistance increased to high frequency in three populations, and the population size fell dramatically in the remaining two populations. In mice inoculated with only 10<sup>3</sup> CFU-resistant bacteria, the resistant clone was able to grow to high numbers with or without daptomycin. These data were consistent with the competitive suppression of the resistant strain by the susceptible strain in the absence of daptomycin treatment, and competitive release of the resistant strain during daptomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Day et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wargo et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Competitive dynamics between daptomycin-resistant and susceptible VRE <italic>faecium</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Each panel shows VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> counts on plates with daptomycin (+DAP, red line) and without daptomycin (-DAP, blue line) for a single mouse over time.

Colonization with VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> is a risk factor for future infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alevizakos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olivier et al., 2008</xref>), presumably because GI tract populations are sources for infections. By maintaining daptomycin sensitivity GI tract populations, this strategy could reduce the risk of resistant infection for colonized patients, as well as reducing transmission of resistance between patients. With some optimization, this adjunctive approach could be implemented in hospitals. Cholestyramine is an inexpensive, FDA-approved drug with few side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckett and Wilhite, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacobson et al., 2007</xref>). Cholestyramine has been used clinically for over 50 years, including in hospital patient populations that would be targets for adjunctive cholestyramine therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballantyne, 2009</xref>). Cholestyramine does have potential to interfere with other orally administered drugs, which could be a risk considered on a patient by patient basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scaldaferri et al., 2013</xref>). This drug–drug interaction potential is managed in practice by administering oral drugs an hour before or 4 to 6 hr after cholestyramine administration. Because the effects and risks of cholestyramine are well understood, testing cholestyramine as an adjuvant with daptomycin in human trials is appealingly low risk to patient health while offering large potential gains to hospital infection control.</p><p>While cholestyramine has the potential to be repurposed in hospitals, this study also revealed potential limitations of cholestyramine therapy and areas requiring further study prior to clinical trials. Cholestyramine therapy was most effective in a narrow range of conditions (intermediate daptomycin doses, cholestyramine started prior to daptomycin therapy) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>), and the daptomycin dose at which resistance was most likely to be enriched varied between <italic>E. faecium</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>). The effect of cholestyramine was also variable among mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>), possibly as a result of variable daptomycin concentrations in the intestines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). This is potentially a major limitation for translating this therapy, as daptomycin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics also vary among human patients. Optimizing cholestyramine therapy will require detailed data on intestinal daptomycin pharmacokinetics, including temporal variation over the course of treatment and variation among individuals. From these data, one could estimate a maximum target for daptomycin capture, and optimize cholestyramine dosing accordingly. This therapeutic approach has the potential to be expanded to other pathogen-drug combinations, but there is likely no one size fits all adjunctive therapy; optimization may be required for each pathogen-drug combination.</p><p>In addition to binding antibiotics, cholestyramine sequesters bile acids in the intestine, which alters the GI tract environment. This means that cholestyramine treatment could indirectly affect bacteria in the GI tract through mechanisms other than direct interactions with drugs. For example, exposure to bile acids has implications for <italic>E. faecium</italic> phenotypes. Secondary bile acids trigger a morphotype switch in <italic>Enterococcus</italic> that facilitates intestinal colonization and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McKenney et al., 2019</xref>). In our experiments, we did not observe differences in colonization efficiency or VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> counts in mice treated with cholestyramine alone. In mouse models, cholestyramine has also been shown to reduce bile acid-mediated resistance to <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection, which is a possible risk associated with cholestyramine treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buffie et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here we tested cholestyramine as an adjuvant to reduce selection for antibiotic resistance in the GI tract, but other adjuvants could be used or designed for the same purpose. At least two other drugs that reduce antibiotic activity in the GI tract are currently in development. DAV-132, a formulation of activated charcoal encased in zinc-pectinate beads, was shown to site-specifically bind antimicrobials in the gut in a stage I clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Gunzburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Gunzburg et al., 2015</xref>). DAV-132 has been shown to reduce fecal concentrations of antibiotics by 99% without affecting plasma concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burdet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Gunzburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Gunzburg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khoder et al., 2010</xref>). Activated charcoal could adsorb antibiotics in the gut, and could be an effective adjuvant for a broad range of antibiotic classes. Adjuvants with specific activity against particular antibiotics could also be developed. This has been successfully demonstrated with orally-administered β-lactamases given with intravenous β-lactam antibiotics. β-lactamases enzymatically inactivate β-lactams. Under the name SYN-004, this β-lactamase treatment advanced to clinical trials in human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaleko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kokai-Kun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitout, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tarkkanen et al., 2009</xref>). Data from clinical trials show the drugs successfully inactivate β-lactams in the digestive tract without adversely affecting levels of antibiotic in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaleko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kokai-Kun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitout, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tarkkanen et al., 2009</xref>). These drugs have been developed with the goal of preventing infection with <italic>C. difficile</italic> after antibiotic therapy, but they could likely also prevent the emergence of antibiotic resistance in the GI tract. The orally-administered β-lactamase SYN-006 mitigated the enrichment of genes associated with antibiotic resistance in the microbiomes of pigs treated with a carbapenem antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Connelly et al., 2019</xref>). So far as we are aware, there is no direct experimental evidence analogous to ours that those drugs can prevent resistance emergence in colonizing opportunistic pathogens, but it seems likely they could.</p><p>Adjunctive therapies like the one proposed here could help manage resistance evolution in other important pathogens listed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) as major threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">CDC, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">WHO, 2017</xref>). Like VRE, many opportunistic pathogens experience substantial antibiotic exposure when they are not the targets of treatment. Opportunistic pathogens like <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> colonize the gut asymptomatically, where they can be unintentionally exposed to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morley et al., 2019</xref>). Accordin<italic>g</italic> to one estimate, over 90% of the total antimicrobial exposure experienced by <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> occurs when <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was not the target of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tedijanto et al., 2018</xref>). For <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> over 80% of total exposure to antibiotics was estimated to occur when the bacteria were bystanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tedijanto et al., 2018</xref>). These colonizing populations are sources for infections, so selection for resistance in bystander populations can contribute to rising rates of resistant infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morley et al., 2019</xref>). Adjunctive strategies that allow intravenous antibiotics to reach target sites while reducing off-target exposure could help stem the spread of resistant pathogens listed by the CDC as urgent or serious threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">CDC, 2019</xref>), including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus</italic> (VRE), methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), and drug-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. The strategy presented here focuses on inactivating antibiotic in the gastrointestinal tract, the likely source of the bulk of the antimicrobial resistance in pathogens listed as top threats by the CDC, but similar strategies could be developed to shield microbiota at other sites, such as the skin and respiratory tract.</p><p>While adjunctive therapies have potential to be used for a variety of pathogens, the genetic mechanism of resistance will influence the resulting evolutionary dynamics. The cholestyramine therapy described here prevents enrichment of resistant clones within a bacterial population consisting of both sensitive and resistant bacteria. Daptomycin-resistance in <italic>E. faecium</italic> emerges through point mutations in the genome, so patients colonized with daptomycin-susceptible <italic>E. faecium</italic> likely harbor low-frequency resistant clones due to spontaneous mutation. Other forms of resistance, like VanA-type vancomycin resistance in <italic>E. faecium,</italic> emerge through horizontal gene transfer rather than point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Depardieu and Courvalin, 2017</xref>). For resistance to emerge in patient colonized with vancomycin-susceptible <italic>E. faecium</italic>, a horizontal transfer event would have to occur, or a new resistant colonizer would have to be introduced. If these events are rarer than spontaneous mutation, patients are less likely to be colonized with a mixture of vancomycin sensitive and resistant bacteria than with daptomycin-resistance, as studied here. However, gains and losses of transmissible resistance elements have been observed in the gut microbiomes of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinnear et al., 2020</xref>), and altering antibiotic pressure in the gut could reduce selection for resistant bacteria, even when that resistance is encoded by horizontally transferred genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse, female)</td><td valign="top">Swiss Webster (CFW)</td><td valign="top">Charles River</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse, female)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6</td><td valign="top">Charles River</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">cholestyramine</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">cat #: C4650</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. faecium</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL00239-1</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">clinical bloodstream isolate, R.

The motivation is clear because daptomycin is given to treat sepsis, where resistance evolution would be a dead-end, but often also selects for resistance in the gut where it is transmissible. Overall, the premise is strong and the experimental design well described.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) All reviewers found that the manuscript overstates the generalizability of the findings and the results are more inconsistent than acknowledged. The preventative effect they measured was limited to a narrow range of conditions (Figure 6) and the effect was inconsistent (Supplementary figure 2). First, in the absence of cholestyramine, a relative enrichment of the resistant strain was observed in 4 of the 6 dose-strain combinations (Figure 6A and C), but with an inconsistent dose-response (for Strain PR00708-14, in the absence of cholestyramine, relative enrichment was observed at a daptomycin dose of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, but not 150 mg/kg). There is significant variability in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antibiotics in humans too, so the narrow dose-effect range observed in this study may be limiting. Also, it may differ substantially for every bug-drug combination. The etiology of this narrow effect window is not known and was not investigated. The authors should discuss this finding as a possible major limitation of the model and potentially to the future application of this overall strategy.</p><p>2) Additionally, when cholestyramine was administered on the same day as daptomycin, no effect, or perhaps even the opposite effect, was observed (Supplementary figure 2). The data in Supplementary figure 2 is not discussed in the manuscript and is cited in the Materials and methods section with the sentence, &quot;Preliminary experiments were preformed to determine the timing of experimental conditions (Supplementary figure 2)&quot;. However, the data presented in Supplementary figure 2 contradicts the main conclusion of the manuscript. The authors should provide further clarity because if one considers all of the data provided, the reproducibility of the major finding described in the manuscript might be significantly diminished.</p><p>3) The data in Supplementary figure 2 should be combined with the data in Figure 6, so that the reader can assess all of the data in aggregate. In fact, given bacterial densities were found to not correlate with daptomycin dose (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), it would be reasonable, for each bacterial strain, to combine all doses of daptomycin into a single group. This aggregate data should be presented in the main text and presented with a statistical evaluation of the effect size (comparing “standardl” vs. “chol”) at each time point. This evaluation of the data would be more logical and greatly simplify its presentation. The parsed-out data of individual daptomycin doses could still be presented in the supplemental data section.</p><p>4) The genome sequencing results are unacceptably vague and the requisite data do not appear to be available. You state &quot;We confirmed that the isolated clone (PR00708-14-R) had an increased daptomycin MICc relative to PR00708-14 by broth microdilution (MICc = 12.0). Genome sequencing revealed that PR00708-14 and PR00708-14-R differed by several mutations in hypothetical proteins and noncoding regions, which to our knowledge have not previously been associated with daptomycin-resistance.” Please be specific. Further, this one limited example does not show that daptomycin-resistance evolved in vivo consistently. One could argue that the populations were uncontrolled at some concentrations and grew steadily to higher levels because of some physiological tolerance. Although this is unlikely, it would not be hard to pick a few more clones and confirm in fact that they evolved heritable resistance and identify the causative mutations, which you would report.</p><p>5) The distinction between preventing de novo emergence of a resistant pathogen and enrichment of a resistant colonizer is important and mechanistically distinct. For mechanisms of antibiotic resistance (such as daptomycin), where point mutations in the genome are causative, resistant clones within susceptible populations are likely to be present at very low frequencies simply due to spontaneous mutation. In this case, this approach does have promise because, in theory, all patients receiving daptomycin would be “at-risk” of developing de novo emergence of daptomycin-resistance. However, for mechanisms of antibiotic resistance that rely on horizontal gene transfer (HGT) or strains with intrinsic resistance, resistant clones do not arise spontaneously from a susceptible population. Instead, a HGT event must take place, or the patient must become newly colonized with that resistant strain. These are relatively rare events. For example, vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus (VRE) is caused by a van gene cassette. This multi-gene cassette does not arise spontaneously. Bacteria get this by HGT and patients get this by being inoculated with VRE in the hospital and, presumably, VRE colonization is sustained in the setting of repeated vancomycin exposures. Thus, a strategy for preventing enrichment of VRE:VSE would only work for patients that are already colonized with VRE. Consider drawing this distinction in the Discussion.</p><p>6) There is insufficient detail of the statistical models used by the authors to assess their validity. The full structure of all reported mixed effects models should be specified. In addition, only p-values for the statistical tests are reported. Effect sizes and their error should also be reported. Full tables of all estimated parameters, including for random effects, from the mixed effects models should be reported.</p><p>7) For analysis of time-series of VRE it is stated that interpolated density values were used. It needs to be clarified why and how this interpolation was carried out, and whether this has inflated the authors' sample size.</p><p>8) It is simply stated by the authors that model selection was carried out based on AIC. If model selection is to be carried out tables of AIC values should be reported for all fitted models and details of the model selection process need to be given. However, I don't believe model selection is appropriate here. It is well known that model selection based on AIC leads to inflated type I error rates via cryptic multiple hypothesis testing (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-010-1038-5). Statistical results should probably simply be reported from the full model.</p><p>9) The authors use negative binomial mixed effects models to analyse their data on proportions of resistant bacteria. This appears an odd choice, as a negative binomial distribution is typically used to model abundances. For analysing proportions given from counts a binomial model would be more appropriate. The authors either need to clarify exactly why they have used a negative binomial distribution or re-run these as binomial models.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) In these experiments, the resistant clones persisted to day 14, so, further studies are needed to test whether this strategy can interrupt stable colonization, which may be a more relevant end-point than preventing enrichment. However, it should be mentioned in the Discussion that some studies have shown <italic>E. faecium</italic> outgrowth in the gut precedes clinical infections, as this is pertinent to this strategy and gives this study more merit and relevance.</p><p>2) Given the authors show they can generate de novo resistance in the gut and identify the resistant clones, this study would be greatly enhanced by testing whether cholestyramine could prevent the emergence of these de novo resistant clones when the mouse is inoculated with only a daptomycin-susceptible strain. This is a more relevant model for this particular bug-drug combination (see comment #4). The authors should briefly comment why they instead chose the mixed R+S inoculation strategy for the experimental design.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An adjunctive therapy prevents enrichment of antibiotic-resistant clones of a colonizing opportunistic pathogen&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The preventative effect they measured was limited to a narrow range of conditions (Figure 6) and the effect was inconsistent (Supplementary figure 2). First, in the absence of cholestyramine, a relative enrichment of the resistant strain was observed in 4 of the 6 dose-strain combinations (Figure 6A and C), but with an inconsistent dose-response (for Strain PR00708-14, in the absence of cholestyramine, relative enrichment was observed at a daptomycin dose of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, but not 150 mg/kg). There is significant variability in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antibiotics in humans too, so the narrow dose-effect range observed in this study may be limiting. Also, it may differ substantially for every bug-drug combination. The etiology of this narrow effect window is not known and was not investigated. The authors should discuss this finding as a possible major limitation of the model and potentially to the future application of this overall strategy.</p></disp-quote><p>A paragraph addressing these limitations has been added to the Discussion. However, we note that analyzing the data together, as suggested in comment #3 shows that the overall result is robust to many of these details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additionally, when cholestyramine was administered on the same day as daptomycin, no effect, or perhaps even the opposite effect, was observed (Supplementary figure 2). The data in Supplementary figure 2 is not discussed in the manuscript and is cited in the Materials and methods section with the sentence, &quot;Preliminary experiments were preformed to determine the timing of experimental conditions (Supplementary figure 2)&quot;. However, the data presented in Supplementary figure 2 contradicts the main conclusion of the manuscript. The authors should provide further clarity because if one considers all of the data provided, the reproducibility of the major finding described in the manuscript might be significantly diminished.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by reviewers, the experiment from Supplementary figure 2 has been moved to the main text and included for analysis with the data in Figure 5. Our main findings still hold true in this revised analysis. On the specific issue of timing of cholestyramine administration, we have yet to test that in a single experiment. Formally we have only a difference between Experiments A-C and D, and so cannot attribute that to timing, though that certainly is a factor we need to test going forward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data in Supplementary figure 2 should be combined with the data in Figure 6, so that the reader can assess all of the data in aggregate. In fact, given bacterial densities were found to not correlate with daptomycin dose (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), it would be reasonable, for each bacterial strain, to combine all doses of daptomycin into a single group. This aggregate data should be presented in the main text and presented with a statistical evaluation of the effect size (comparing “standardl” vs. “chol”) at each time point. This evaluation of the data would be more logical and greatly simplify its presentation. The parsed-out data of individual daptomycin doses could still be presented in the supplemental data section.</p></disp-quote><p>This figure (now Figure 5) and the corresponding analysis have been revised as suggested in subsection “Adjunctive cholestyramine therapy prevents emergence of daptomycin-resistance”. The parsed-out data are reported in Figure 5—figure supplements 1-5. This excellent suggestion has really simplified the overall presentation, thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The genome sequencing results are unacceptably vague and the requisite data do not appear to be available. You state &quot;We confirmed that the isolated clone (PR00708-14-R) had an increased daptomycin MICc relative to PR00708-14 by broth microdilution (MICc = 12.0). Genome sequencing revealed that PR00708-14 and PR00708-14-R differed by several mutations in hypothetical proteins and noncoding regions, which to our knowledge have not previously been associated with daptomycin-resistance.” Please be specific. Further, this one limited example does not show that daptomycin-resistance evolved in vivo consistently. One could argue that the populations were uncontrolled at some concentrations and grew steadily to higher levels because of some physiological tolerance. Although this is unlikely, it would not be hard to pick a few more clones and confirm in fact that they evolved heritable resistance and identify the causative mutations, which you would report.</p></disp-quote><p>Further details have been added to the sequencing results. We have reported MIC data for additional clones from the experiment with PR00708-14, as suggested (subsection “Generation of daptomycin-resistant VR <italic>E. faecium</italic> in the mouse GI tract”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The distinction between preventing de novo emergence of a resistant pathogen and enrichment of a resistant colonizer is important and mechanistically distinct.
