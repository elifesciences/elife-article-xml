sound amplification in the cochlea and adjusting vascular smooth muscle tone. Therefore, the mechanisms that regulate K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel function are of interest. Here, we study the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on human K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 channels expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. We report that PUFAs facilitate activation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 by shifting the V<sub>50</sub> of the conductance <italic>versus</italic> voltage (G(V)) curve toward more negative voltages. This response depends on the head group charge, as an uncharged PUFA analogue has no effect and a positively charged PUFA analogue induces positive V<sub>50</sub> shifts. In contrast, PUFAs inhibit activation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 by shifting V<sub>50</sub> toward more positive voltages. No effect on V<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 is observed by an uncharged or a positively charged PUFA analogue. Thus, the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel’s response to PUFAs is analogous to the one previously observed in hK<sub>V</sub>7.1–7.3 channels, whereas the hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channel response is opposite, revealing subtype-specific responses to PUFAs. We identify a unique inner PUFA interaction site in the voltage-sensing domain of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 underlying the PUFA response, revealing an unconventional mechanism of modulation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 by PUFAs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In order to carry out their roles in the body, cells need to send and receive electrical signals. They can do this by allowing ions to move in and out through dedicated pore-like structures studded through their membrane. These channels are specific to one type of ions, and their activity – whether they open or close – is carefully controlled. In humans, defective ion channels are associated with conditions such as irregular heartbeats, epileptic seizures or hearing loss.</p><p>Research has identified molecules known as polyunsaturated fatty acids as being able to control the activity of certain members of the K<sub>V</sub>7 family of potassium ion channels. The K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and K<sub>V</sub>7.2/7.3 channels are respectively present in the heart and the brain; K<sub>V</sub>7.4 is important for hearing, while K<sub>V</sub>7.5 plays a key role in regulating muscle tone in blood vessels. Polyunsaturated fatty acids can activate K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and K<sub>V</sub>7.2/7.3 but their impact on K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 remains unclear.</p><p>Frampton et al. explored this question by studying human K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 channels expressed in frog egg cells. This showed that fatty acids activated K<sub>V</sub>7.5 (as for K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and K<sub>V</sub>7.2/7.3), but that they reduced the activity of K<sub>V</sub>7.4.</p><p>Closely examining the structure of K<sub>V</sub>7.4 revealed that the fatty acids were binding to a different region compared to the other K<sub>V</sub>7 channels. When this site was made inaccessible, fatty acids increased the activity of K<sub>V</sub>7.4, just as for the rest of the family.</p><p>These results may help to understand the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the body. In addition, knowing how these molecules interact with channels in the same family will be useful for optimising a drug’s structure to avoid side effects. However, further research will be needed to understand the broader impact in a more complex biological organism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>docosahexaenoic acid</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>KCNQ</kwd><kwd>lipid</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulations</kwd><kwd>omega 3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-02040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-04905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delemotte</surname><given-names>Lucie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-01885</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003748</institution-id><institution>Swedish Society for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Polyunsaturated fatty acids facilitate or impede Kv7 channel activation, depending on channel subtype and their dominant functional site(s).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>K<sub>V</sub>7 voltage-gated potassium channels are expressed in several tissues, where they serve to attenuate excitability by conducting an outward K<sup>+</sup> current. The five members of the family, K<sub>V</sub>7.1-K<sub>V</sub>7.5 (encoded by <italic>KCNQ1-KCNQ5</italic> genes), are important for human physiology, which is often emphasized in diseased states caused by dysfunctional channels. For instance, K<sub>V</sub>7.1 is predominantly expressed in cardiomyocytes, and mutations to this channel are a known risk factor for developing cardiac arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barhanin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brewer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tester and Ackerman, 2014</xref>). K<sub>V</sub>7.2 and K<sub>V</sub>7.3 are broadly expressed in neurons, where they form heterotetrameric K<sub>V</sub>7.2/7.3 channels, and mutations to these channels may give rise to epilepsy or chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biervert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nappi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). K<sub>V</sub>7.4 is of particular importance in the auditory system where it forms homotetrameric channels responsible for a K<sup>+</sup> conductance at the resting membrane potential of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kharkovets et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubisch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rim et al., 2021</xref>). Mutations that perturb the trafficking or function of K<sub>V</sub>7.4 in OHCs are associated with a subtype of progressive hearing loss known as DFNA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kharkovets et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubisch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rim et al., 2021</xref>). K<sub>V</sub>7.5 is more widely spread through the central nervous system and is particularly important in regulating excitability in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fidzinski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schroeder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tzingounis et al., 2010</xref>). K<sub>V</sub>7.1, K<sub>V</sub>7.4, and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 are also expressed in various smooth muscle cells, such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), suggesting that several K<sub>V</sub>7 subtypes, including heterotetrameric K<sub>V</sub>7.4/7.5 channels, may contribute to the hyperpolarizing K<sup>+</sup> current in VSMCs that promotes vasodilation by preventing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bercea et al., 2021</xref>). The modulation of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and K<sub>V</sub>7.2/7.3 channels by endogenous and pharmacological compounds has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miceli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu and Larsson, 2020</xref>). However, less is known about the modulation of K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5. Here, we studied the effects of a class of channel modulators, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), on K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5.</p><p>There is emerging evidence that suggests that PUFAs influence the physiology of tissues that express K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 channels. For instance, a number of studies have found an inverse relationship between hearing loss and the PUFA plasma concentration, suggesting that the risk of impaired hearing decreases with an increased dietary intake of ω–3 PUFAs such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curhan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dullemeijer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gopinath et al., 2010</xref>). Meta-analyses of randomized control trials have found that a multitude of beneficial cardiovascular outcomes, including antiinflammatory and hypotensive effects, are associated with an increased intake of PUFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">AbuMweis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). There are likely several mechanisms that contribute to these PUFA effects. For instance, the protective PUFA effect on hearing loss has been attributed to cerebrovascular effects, reasoning that PUFAs improve circulation to the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curhan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dullemeijer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gopinath et al., 2010</xref>). PUFA-induced vasodilation has in part been attributed to the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and ATP sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels by PUFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Limbu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bercea et al., 2021</xref>). However, little is known about the putative direct contribution of K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 channels to PUFA effects. We find this open question interesting because PUFAs have been shown to facilitate activation of both K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and K<sub>V</sub>7.2/7.3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohannon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larsson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor and Sanders, 2017</xref>). This PUFA-induced facilitation of activation is mediated through a lipoelectric mechanism in which the PUFA tail inserts into the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer adjacent to the channel, whereupon the negatively charged carboxyl head group of the PUFA interacts electrostatically with positively charged arginines in the upper half of the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>). This electrostatic interaction facilitates the outward movement of the S4 helix, causing a shifted voltage dependence of channel opening toward more negative voltages. However, the effect of PUFAs on K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 remains unstudied. In this study, we therefore aimed to characterize the response of human K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 channels (henceforth referred to as hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 or hK<sub>V</sub>7.4) to PUFAs, in order to expand our understanding of how the K<sub>V</sub>7 family of channels responds to these lipids.</p><p>We report that PUFAs facilitate activation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 by shifting the voltage dependence of channel opening toward more negative voltages. Surprisingly, we find that PUFAs inhibit activation of the hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channel by shifting the voltage dependence of channel opening toward more positive voltages. Thus, the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel’s response to PUFAs is largely in line with the responses that have previously been observed in hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.2/7.3, whereas the hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channel response is not. Providing a mechanistic explanation for this observation, we identify an unconventional inner PUFA site in the VSD of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 underlying PUFA-induced inhibition of the activation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4. Our study expands our understanding of how members of the hK<sub>V</sub>7 family respond to PUFAs and reveal subtype specific responses and sites to these lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The PUFA docosahexaenoic acid facilitates activation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5, but inhibits activation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4</title><p>We began with investigating the effects of the physiologically abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2014</xref>) PUFA DHA (molecular structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) on homotetrameric hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 or hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes.

Because 70 μM DHA induced significant shifts in V<sub>50</sub> of both hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.4, although in opposite directions, without affecting G<sub>max</sub> we will throughout the remainder of this study focus our analysis of PUFA effects on V<sub>50</sub>, and G(V) curves shown in figures reporting on PUFA effects will be normalized to visually emphasize V<sub>50</sub> shifts.</p><p>The DHA-evoked shift in the V<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 was significant at concentrations as low as 7 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, ∆V<sub>50</sub> = –8.5 ± 1.3 mV, p = 0.0002). The concentration-response curve for the DHA effect on hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 predicts a maximum V<sub>50</sub> shift of –25.3 mV, with 12 μM required for 50% of the maximum shift (EC<sub>50</sub> = 12 μM). The DHA effect on the V<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 was also significant at 7 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, ∆V<sub>50</sub> = +4.8 ± 1.6 mV, p = 0.01). The concentration-response curve for the DHA effect on hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 predicts a maximum V<sub>50</sub> shift of +13.8 mV, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 14 μM. The onset of the DHA effect was relatively fast for both the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels, reaching a stable level within about 6 min of application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The DHA effect proved difficult to wash out or reverse, as re-perfusion with control solution or control solution supplemented with 100 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) only partially restored baseline current amplitude for hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Altogether, the PUFA DHA induces a concentration-dependent <italic>facilitation</italic> of activation of the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel, and a concentration-dependent <italic>inhibition</italic> of activation of the hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 response, but not the hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 response, changes direction in an electrostatic manner</title><p>To further understand the molecular basis of the DHA response, we examined the importance of the charge of the DHA head group. Several previous studies identify electrostatic interactions between positively charged arginines in the upper half of S4 of the VSD and the negatively charged head group on PUFAs (and their analogues) as fundamental for facilitating the activation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.1, hK<sub>V</sub>7.2/7.3 and some other K<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Börjesson and Elinder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martín et al., 2021</xref>). This is seen as a shift in V<sub>50</sub> toward more negative voltages. The electrostatic PUFA effect on V<sub>50</sub> can be tuned, from inducing negative to positive shifts in V<sub>50</sub>, by altering the charge of the PUFA head group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Börjesson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liin et al., 2015</xref>). To investigate if the same electrostatic mechanism is at play in the responses of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.4, we compared the DHA response of the channels with: (1) a DHA analogue with an uncharged methyl ester head group (DHA-me), and (2) a DHA analogue with a positively charged amine head group (DHA+).</p><p>70 μM of DHA-me did not significantly shift V<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ∆V<sub>50</sub> = –0.2 ± 0.5 mV, p = 0.67). In contrast, 70 μM DHA+ brought on a small, but significant positive shift in V<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ΔV<sub>50</sub> = +4.5 ± 0.9 mV, p = 0.001). Thus, for hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 the negatively charged DHA facilitates activation, the uncharged DHA-me has no effect, and the positively charged DHA+ inhibits channel activation (effects summarized in bar graph of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This is in line with the lipoelectric mechanism that has been proposed to explain PUFA effects on the hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.2/7.3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The impact of PUFA head group charge for hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 effects.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Impact of the head group charge on the ability of DHA to shift V<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5, assessed by comparing the effect of negatively charged DHA, uncharged DHA-me, and positively charged DHA+ at 70 µM.

Thus, while the negatively charged DHA caused a positive shift in V<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4, neither the uncharged DHA-me nor the positively charged DHA+ altered the V<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 (effects summarized in bar graph of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Even though a negative charge of the head group seems to be important for the effect, the responses are not in line with the lipoelectric mechanism, making hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 unique among the hK<sub>V</sub>7 channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Both hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 respond broadly to PUFAs, although with varied magnitudes of responses</title><p>Next, we studied if the effects on hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 are specific to DHA or if they are shared among different PUFAs by testing a series of PUFAs, listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. These PUFAs vary in their molecular properties, such as the length of the tail and the number and position of double bonds in the tail. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows a plot of the magnitude of ΔV<sub>50</sub> following exposure of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 to PUFAs (at 70 μM) against the number of carbon atoms in each respective PUFA tail. All PUFAs, regardless of length (14–22 carbon atoms) significantly shifted V<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 toward more negative voltages, although to different extents. The magnitude of the PUFA-induced ΔV<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 followed a pattern of TTA &lt; LA = AA &lt; HTA ≤ EPA &lt; DHA. One observation is that the ω–6 PUFAs LA and AA induced smaller shifts than the ω–3 PUFAs HTA, EPA and DHA. Both AA and EPA are 20 carbon atoms long. However, while AA is an ω–6 PUFA, EPA is an ω–3 PUFA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows representative G(V) curves for hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 that highlight the larger shift in V<sub>50</sub> evoked by 70 μM of EPA (left) than by 70 μM of AA (right). On average, EPA induced a shift of –17.9 ± 2.4 mV, which was significantly larger than the shift induced by AA (ΔV<sub>50</sub> = –9.3 ± 1.7 mV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; p = 0.015). These results suggest that in PUFAs of equal length, the ω-number has an impact on the magnitude of the PUFA response of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5. We also compared the positively charged amine analogue DHA+ to an amine analogue of AA (AA+). The positive shift in V<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 by 70 μM AA+ was slightly smaller than that observed with DHA+, and did not differ significantly from a hypothetical shift of 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, AA+ ΔV<sub>50</sub> = +1.9 ± 1.4 mV, p = 0.2). However, there was also no statistically significant difference between the effects induced by DHA+ and AA+ (p = 0.13), which indicates that the importance of the ω-number for the amine analogues should be interpreted with caution. Altogether, these experiments show that many PUFAs activate the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel and suggest that the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel shows a preference toward ω–3 over ω–6 PUFAs.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The impact of PUFA tail properties for hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 effects.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Impact of PUFA tail properties for the ability of PUFAs to shift V<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5, assessed by comparing the response to 70 µM of indicated PUFAs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for molecular structures).

Notably, the F182L and S273A missense mutations in hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>), which are suspected to be linked to impaired hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), exchanges the native hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 residue for the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 counterpart.

Under control conditions, we found both mutants to behave fairly similar to wild-type hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The S273A mutant had a V<sub>50</sub> comparable to wild-type hK<sub>V</sub>7.4, whereas the V<sub>50</sub> of the F182L mutant was shifted about 10 mV toward more negative voltages compared to wild-type hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). However, both mutations impaired the inhibitory hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 response to DHA. 70 µM of DHA shifted V<sub>50</sub> of the F182L mutant by only +5.5 ± 2.2 mV and the S273A mutant by +4.7 ± 0.8 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, these experiments suggest that co-expression of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 subunits, or substitution of specific residues in hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 to the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 counterpart, alter the DHA response of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 to approach that of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5.

Thus, the extent of the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 shift induced by 70 μM DHA is greater than that of hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 or hK<sub>V</sub>7.2/7.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Our experiments indicated the necessity of a negatively charged DHA head group to elicit the activating effect on hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A negatively charged head group is promoted by alkaline pH, which triggers proton dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Börjesson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamilton, 1998</xref>). In a previous study, the apparent pKa of DHA when near hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 (i.e. the pH at which 50% of the maximal DHA effect is seen, interpreted as the pH at which 50% of the DHA molecules in a lipid environment are negatively charged) was determined to be pH 7.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liin et al., 2015</xref>). One possible underlying cause of the larger DHA effect on hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 is that the local pH environment at hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 promotes DHA deprotonation (i.e. inducing a lower apparent pKa of DHA), thus rendering a greater fraction of the DHA molecules negatively charged and capable of activating the channel. To test this, we assessed the effect of 70 μM DHA on hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 with the extracellular pH adjusted to either more alkaline (pH = 8.2) or acidic (pH = 6.5, or 7.0) values. Adjusting the extracellular pH had only minor effects on V<sub>50</sub> under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, the magnitude of the DHA-induced shift varied with pH. At pH 8.2, at which a majority of DHA molecules are expected to be deprotonated, DHA shifts of V<sub>50</sub> were almost two-fold greater than at physiological pH (pH 7.4 ΔV<sub>50</sub> = –21.5 ± 1.9 mV; pH 8.2 ΔV<sub>50</sub> = –44.4 ± 3.2 mV, p &lt; 0.0001, Student’s <italic>t</italic> test, representative example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The magnitude of the DHA effect was reduced as the pH was gradually titrated toward more acidic pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), with no shift in V<sub>50</sub> by 70 μM DHA observed at pH 6.5 (ΔV<sub>50</sub> = +0.1 ± 1.0 mV, p = 0.96). The pH dependence of ΔV<sub>50</sub> induced by DHA for the hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel is also plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, to allow for comparison between the two hK<sub>V</sub>7 subtypes. While there is a clear difference in the extrapolated maximum shifts for the two channels (hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 ΔV<sub>50,max</sub> = –26.3 mV with 95% CI [-18.4,–34.3]; hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 ΔV<sub>50,max</sub> = –57.9 mV with 95% CI [-47.6,–68.2]), the pH required to induce 50% of the maximum ΔV<sub>50</sub> (i.e. the apparent pKa values) are similar (inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 apparent pKa = 7.68 with 95% CI [7.26, 7.89]; hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 apparent pKa = 7.67 with 95% CI [7.52, 7.90]). This indicates that the difference in the DHA effect between hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 is a question of increased magnitude, rather than a matter of different apparent pKa of DHA at the channels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Extracellular pH tunes the DHA response of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of the V<sub>50</sub> shift of hK<sub>V</sub>7 subtypes in response to 70 µM DHA.

In order to determine the interaction sites for DHA on hK<sub>V</sub>7.4, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the channel, solved in an intermediate activation state, embedded in a membrane consisting of 75% POPC and 25% negatively charged DHA randomly distributed in both membrane leaflets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Analysis of the residence time of DHA showed overall prolonged interactions with residues on S1 (L91, Y101, and I105), on S2 (V142, F143, and D146), on S4 (R213) and at the top of the pore region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Out of the 13 interaction sites characterized by density-based clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the site at which DHA interacted with the channel the longest (2.156 µs, cluster #3) was comprised of residues located on the lower half of S4. This site was also occupied ~87% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting favorable interactions between the side chains of R213, R216, and R219 and the head group of DHA, as well as interactions with the backbone of M217. In the representative binding pose of that site, the head group of DHA is bound in the lumen of the lower portion of the VSD, close to the S4 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We will refer to this as an unconventional ‘inner VSD site’, in contrast to the conventional ‘outer VSD site’ described previously for K<sub>V</sub>7.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>). Because of its negative charge, DHA in the inner VSD site presumably prevents the outward motion of the positively charged S4 helix, rationalizing its inhibitory effect. The wedging of the tail between S1 and S2 suggests that the DHA head group accesses this interaction site via this lipid-exposed interface. Repeating these simulations with uncharged DHA changes the interaction pattern drastically. Indeed, neutral DHA shows a high propensity to localize close to the lower half of the S5 and S6 helix, at a considerable distance from the VSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

S4 is anticipated to move further downward when adopting a resting state and further upward when adopting an activated state. The lack of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 structure with S4 in a resting state prevents us from using simulations to assess DHA interaction with the inner VSD site in this conformational state. Therefore, to functionally assess the importance of the interactions predicted by the molecular dynamics simulations, we substituted each of the innermost arginines (R213, R216, and R219), one by one, with an uncharged glutamine. This generated mutant hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels with V<sub>50</sub> values shifted toward more positive (R213Q and R219Q) or negative (R216Q) voltages relative to the wild-type channel (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). However, in contrast to the positive shift in V<sub>50</sub> normally seen in wild-type hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 by DHA, each of these arginine mutants responded to 70 μM DHA with a negative shift in V<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>, R213Q ΔV<sub>50</sub> = –8.8 ± 0.9 mV; R216Q ΔV<sub>50</sub> = –5.7 ± 0.6 mV; R219Q ΔV<sub>50</sub> = –7.3 ± 0.6 mV). Thus, neutralization of any of these three arginines in the lower half of S4 endowed the hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channel with a DHA response typical of other hK<sub>V</sub>7 channels (that is, PUFA-mediated facilitation of channel activation), confirming the interaction site predictions from the molecular dynamics simulations. With this typical DHA response, the arginine mutants showed a response more in line with the lipoelectric mechanism, with a negative shift in V<sub>50</sub> induced by negatively charged PUFAs, no or minimal shift in V<sub>50</sub> induced by uncharged PUFA analogues, and a positive shift in V<sub>50</sub> induced by positively charged PUFA analogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As such, our study expands upon the understanding of the modulation of the hK<sub>V</sub>7 family of ion channels by this class of lipids. Importantly, we find that both hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 show surprising responses to PUFAs, compared to previously reported effects on other hK<sub>V</sub>7 subtypes. hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 is the only hK<sub>V</sub>7 subtype for which PUFAs induce channel inhibition, whereas ω–3 PUFAs induce unexpectedly large hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel activation. Experiments on co-expressed hK<sub>V</sub>7.4/7.5 channels and hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels carrying hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 mimetic disease-associated mutations indicate responses to PUFAs that are intermediate of the hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 homomers. In contrast, hKCNE4 co-expression did not alter the PUFA response of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4. The diverse responses of hK<sub>V</sub>7 subtypes to PUFAs demonstrate the importance of carrying out functional experiments on each of the channel subtypes to allow for an understanding of subtype variability in channel modulation.</p><p>What mechanistic basis may underlie PUFA-induced facilitation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 activation? We find that the pattern of how hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 responds to PUFAs conforms to the lipoelectric mechanism that has previously been described for the hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.2/7.3 channels, with a hyperpolarizing shift in V<sub>50</sub> induced by negatively charged PUFAs, a depolarizing shift in V<sub>50</sub> induced by a positively charged PUFA analogue, and no effect of an uncharged PUFA analogue. Therefore, we find it likely that PUFAs also facilitate activation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 through electrostatic interactions with positively charged gating charges in the upper half of the VSD (schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> <italic>left</italic>). However, ω–6 PUFAs are less effective than ω–3 PUFAs at activating the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel. This is different from the hK<sub>V</sub>7.1/KCNE1 channel, for which ω–6 or ω–9 PUFAs were identified as the best modulators of channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohannon et al., 2019</xref>). Although the role of the ω-numbering in determining the extent of PUFA effects on hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 should be interpreted with caution (for instance, because the PUFAs also vary in their number of double bonds, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), it is clear that hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.1/KCNE1 do not follow the same response pattern to different PUFAs. Work on hK<sub>V</sub>7.1/KCNE1 has proposed that the KCNE1 subunit impairs the DHA response of hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 by rearranging one of the external loops in hK<sub>V</sub>7.1, which alters the pH at the outer VSD site of the channel to promote DHA protonation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liin et al., 2015</xref>). This led us to test if the greater DHA response of the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel was caused by a lower apparent pKa of DHA at hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 compared to hK<sub>V</sub>7.1–7.3, which might promote DHA deprotonation. However, the similar apparent pKa values of DHA for hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 discards this hypothesis. Instead, we find a larger magnitude of the DHA effect on hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 at all pH values compared to hK<sub>V</sub>7.1. Interestingly, a residue at the top of S5 of hK<sub>V</sub>7.1, Y278, which was recently identified as an important ‘anchor point’ for binding the ω–6 PUFA LA near the VSD to allow for efficient shifts in V<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>), is instead a phenylalanine (F282) in hK<sub>V</sub>7.5. A phenylalanine mutation of this ‘anchor point’ in hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 (Y278F) led to a drastic decrease in apparent affinity of LA for hK<sub>V</sub>7.1, possibly by removing hydrogen bonding between the head group of LA and the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine side chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>). However, because the Y278F mutation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 also reduced the apparent affinity of DHA for hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>), and DHA was the most potent of the PUFAs we tested on hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 in this study, sequence variability at this specific position is not likely to underlie the relatively larger effect of DHA on hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 compared to hK<sub>V</sub>7.1. Thus, we conclude the nature of PUFA binding to hK<sub>V</sub>7 channels is more complex and there may be other stabilizing residues in the PUFA interaction site of the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel.</p><p>We find that the activity of the hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channel is inhibited by PUFAs, and that the direction of the effect is not reversed by reversing the charge of the PUFA head group. Therefore, the PUFA effect on hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 does not conform to the lipoelectric mechanism proposed for other K<sub>V</sub>7 channels. Additionally, we did not find any relationship between PUFA tail properties and the response of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 to PUFAs, other than that all PUFAs with significant effects shifted V<sub>50</sub> toward more positive voltages. A cryo-EM structure for hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 was recently reported (PDB ID – 7BYL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021</xref>), which reveals structural differences when comparing to the hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 structure (PDB ID – 6UZZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>). For instance, the entire VSD of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 is rotated 15° clockwise relative to the pore domain of the channel. In molecular dynamics simulations, we also identified an unconventional predicted DHA site in hK<sub>V</sub>7.4. Although the lack of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 structures in different conformational states limits the ability to simulate the state dependence of DHA interaction with different sites, our experiments validated the functional relevance of the unconventional predicted site. Taken together, our simulation and experimental data suggest that hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 is unique among hK<sub>V</sub>7 channels in harboring a functional PUFA site in the inner half of the VSD. The DHA-induced shift in V<sub>50</sub> toward positive voltages in wild-type hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 is compatible with DHA stabilizing a resting or intermediate state of S4 through interaction with arginines in the lower half of S4 (schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> <italic>right</italic>). Disruption of DHA interaction with this inner VSD site, through substitution of the innermost S4 arginines, endowed hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 with the typical PUFA response of a shift in V<sub>50</sub> toward negative voltages. We therefore suggest that hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 also harbors a conventional PUFA site at the outer half of the S4, the functional effect of which is unmasked upon disruption of the functionally dominant inner VSD site. In agreement with this, weak DHA interaction with the conventional outer VSD site is indeed observed in our simulations (corresponding to cluster #9, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, our experiments using PUFA analogues indicate that it is possible to charge-tune the PUFA response of the hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 arginine mutants from a negative to positive shift in V<sub>50</sub> by altering the charge of the PUFA head group, a feature which is in line with observations on other K<sub>V</sub> channels electrostatically modulated by PUFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Börjesson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liin et al., 2015</xref>). A structural alignment between the VSDs of hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 (PDB ID – 6UZZ) and hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 (PDB ID – 7BYL) revealed two possible molecular level reasons for the differential binding of DHA to these two channels: in hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 the binding site we uncovered indeed appears both larger, with the S4 helix pushed inwards in hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 relative to hK<sub>V</sub>7.4, and more accessible, as the cleft between S1 and S2 via which DHA appears to enter the cavity features a bulky, obstructing phenylalanine residue (F166) in hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 compared to a smaller valine residue (V142) in hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>What potential physiological implications may our findings have? Increased consumption of foods rich in PUFAs has long been associated with improved cardiovascular health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bang et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kagawa et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saravanan et al., 2010</xref>) and multiple mechanisms have been proposed, including those mediated by the immune system, the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Massaro et al., 2008</xref>). Several ion channels in both endothelial cells and VSMCs have been studied as the molecular correlates of PUFA-mediated vasodilatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bercea et al., 2021</xref>). Of note, PUFA-induced inhibition of L-type Ca<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engler et al., 2000</xref>) and PUFA-induced activation of large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels contribute to the vasodilation induced by PUFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Limbu et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Limbu et al., 2018</xref> observed an endothelium-independent residual relaxation of rodent arteries induced by ω–3 PUFAs despite pre-treatment with several K<sup>+</sup> channel inhibitors, suggesting there may be another mechanism underlying PUFA-mediated vasorelaxation that does not involve BK channels. Our finding that PUFAs facilitate activation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 raises the possibility that K<sub>V</sub>7.5 subunits contribute to the residual vasorelaxation observed by Limbu and colleagues.</p><p>Besides cardiovascular effects, an increased intake of ω–3 PUFAs has also indicated a potential protective role against hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curhan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dullemeijer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gopinath et al., 2010</xref>). While these studies propose the protective mechanism of PUFAs on hearing stem from vascular effects that improve cochlear perfusion, no direct mechanism of PUFAs on the hearing organ was investigated. Based on our findings, it would be unlikely that the decreased risk of hearing loss is due to direct actions of PUFAs on K<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels expressed in OHCs, given that we find the channel activity to be inhibited by PUFAs. However, PUFA-induced facilitation of the activity of other K<sub>V</sub>7 channels (e.g. K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5) in VSMCs could possibly contribute to improved cochlear perfusion. Of note, the two DFNA2-associated missense mutations in hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 we examined, F182L and S273A, showed intrinsic biophysical behavior comparable to that of wild-type hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This is in overall agreement with previous studies of these mutants performed in other expression systems showing voltage dependence of channel opening approximate to that of the wild-type channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Jung and colleagues found that the S273A mutant reduces the average whole-cell current densities to less than 50% of the wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2019</xref>), which indicates that S273A may be a risk factor for development of hearing loss through its limited ability to generate K<sup>+</sup> currents. However, whether F182L acts as a risk factor in DFNA2 hearing loss or should rather be considered a benign missense mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) remains to be determined. We find that both the F182L and S273A mutants display an impaired response to DHA, which, if anything, is expected to preserve channel function in the presence of PUFAs.</p><p>To conclude, we find that hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 and hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 respond in opposing manners to PUFAs. The hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel’s response is largely in line with the responses that have previously been observed in other hK<sub>V</sub>7 channels, whereas the hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channel response is not. Altogether, our study expands our understanding of how the activity of different members of the hK<sub>V</sub>7 family are modulated by PUFAs and demonstrates different responses explained by different PUFA sites in different hK<sub>V</sub>7 subtypes. Further studies are needed to evaluate putative physiological importance of the effects described in this study in more complex experimental systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">KCNQ4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Acc.No. NM_004700</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">KCNQ5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Acc.No. NM_001160133</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">KCNE4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Acc.No. NM_080671</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tetradecatrienoic acid (TTA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Larodan</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: 10–1403</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hexadecatrienoic acid (HTA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Larodan</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: 10–1603</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Linoleic acid (LA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: L1012</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Arachidonic acid (AA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: A3611</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: E2011</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: D2534</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Docosahexaenoic acid methyl ester (DHA-me)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: D2659</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Indomethacin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: I7378</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Test compounds</title><p>All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden, unless stated otherwise.

Note that representative G(V) curves have been normalized in figures to allow for better visualization of V<sub>50</sub> shifts.</p><p>To determine the concentration dependence or the pH dependence of ΔV<sub>50</sub>, the following concentration-response function was used:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>50</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>50</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>50</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where ΔV<sub>50,max</sub> is the maximum shift in V<sub>50</sub>, C is the concentration of the test compound, EC<sub>50</sub> is the concentration of a given test compound or the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> required to reach 50% of the maximum effect, and N is the Hill coefficient (set to 1 or –1).

The channel was embedded in a heterogenous bilayer consisting of 480 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine (POPC) molecules and 120 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) molecules (placed at random and distributed equally in both the leaflets) using the CHARMM-GUI MARTINI (Bilayer system) maker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qi et al., 2015</xref>). In one system, DHA with a negatively charged head group was used while in the other, DHA with a neutral head group was considered. The systems were then solvated by adding a~45 Å layer of water to each side of the membrane. Lastly, systems were ionized to reach a 150 mM KCl concentration. Martini 2.2 force field combined with ElNeDyn (Elastic network in dynamics) was used. The systems were minimized and equilibrated following the default CHARMM-GUI protocol. During equilibration, pressure was maintained at 1 bar through Berendsen pressure coupling; temperature was maintained at 300 K through velocity rescaling thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>) with the protein, membrane and solvent coupled. During production simulation, pressure was maintained at 1 bar through Parinello-Rahman pressure coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>). A time step of 20 fs was used. Finally, 19 µs production simulations were carried out for the system with neutral DHA, while eight 5 µs simulations were run for the system with negatively charged DHA. Simulations were performed using GROMACS version 2020.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>). The analysis of the coarse-grained simulations was carried out using PyLipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Song et al., 2022</xref>). Frames extracted every 20 ns were used for the analysis. A dual cut-off scheme (lower limit: –0.5 nm, upper limit: –0.7 nm) was used to determine the interactions between DHA and the protein. Interactions were averaged across all subunits of the protein. Binding regions were determined by identifying clusters of at least four residues that interact with the same DHA molecule at the same time. These residues were found by community analysis of residue interaction networks. The most representative bound pose for each binding site was extracted by a scoring of the bound poses based on a density based scoring function, where the probability density is calculated from the simulation trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Illustrations</title><p>For the structural images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the cryo-EM resolved structure of the hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channel (PDB ID - 7BYL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021</xref>]) was visualized using The Protein Imager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomasello et al., 2020</xref>).

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Subtype specific responses in hKv7.4 and hKv7.5 channels to polyunsaturated fatty acids&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. Although the work is of interest, we are not convinced that the findings presented have the potential significance that we require for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, upon reviewer consultation, the agreement was that the experimental design and execution are of very high quality and the findings are of interest, specially the seemingly non-electrostatic mechanism of modulation of the Kv7.4 channels by PUFAs, the manuscript lacks mechanistic insight into this new and potentially significant mode of modulation. The reviewers agree that if a set of experiments can be provided that probe the, presumably allosteric, mechanism of PUFA modulation of Kv7.4, a resubmission of a (new) manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> will be encouraged.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Modulation of some voltage-dependent potassium channels by unsaturated fatty acids seems to be mediated via an electrostatic mechanism by which the negative lipid head interacts with positive amino acid residues in the voltage-sensing domain or other amino acids responsible for producing a surface potential.</p><p>In this manuscript, Frampton et al. investigate the effect of omega-3 and 6 fatty acids on two Kv7 sub types, 7.4 and 7.5 for which data on modulation by these lipids was lacking.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present a series of interesting observations.</p><p>The main finding is that while Kv7.5 seems to be modulated by the established electrostatic mechanism, Kv7.4 is not modulated by a mechanism involving electrostatics. Rather, the authors find two unique phenylalanine residues in the S3 to be involved in the channel response to the fatty acid DHA, perhaps hinting at an allosteric effect.</p><p>While original, the findings are not further explored in terms of a mechanism, specifically the effects of fatty acids on Kv7.4.</p><p>For the most part, the experiments are well designed and executed. While the effects of DHA on Kv7.4 are robust, they are small and it remains to be seen if they have any physiological effect.</p><p>The new findings offer the possibility of studying new mechanisms of modulation of Kv7 channels mediated by unsaturated fatty acids.</p><p>1. Throughout the text, the authors refer to the effects of fatty acids (FAs) as activating or inhibiting. Have the authors shown that at negative voltages the channels (Kv7.5) can be opened by FAs? This result will justify calling FAs activators, otherwise, the effect should be called a modulation of activity. This is an important mechanistic distinction that in the absence of clear experimental evidence can be confusion.</p><p>2. The authors refer to a &quot;local pH&quot; on the channels that might account for the protonation state of DHA and thus its effect. It is not clear to me how the authors propose that the channel, which dos not conduct protons, can regulate local pH. Perhaps they want to say pKa?</p><p>3. While other experiments are well designed, the pH experiments intended to study the effect of charge on the modulation by DHA have a major flaw. There seem to be no controls for the effect of pH on channel gating (G-V curves). If this is the case, the measured effect of DHA is a combination of the possible effect of pH on DHA charge and the effect of pH on the GV of the channel.</p><p>4. The authors argue that the effects of FAs on Kv7 channels are mediated through the interaction of the negative charge of the head of FAs with gating charges in the VSD. But then, without any justification, carry out mutations of two (non-charged) phenylalanines present in the S3 of Kv7.4. The reference to gating charges should thus be removed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Frampton and colleagues provides a clear characterization of PUFA effects on the voltage dependence of Kv7.4 and Kv7.5 activation. The study finds interesting differences in PUFA's effects on these two Kv7 channels. PUFA shifts GV of Kv7.5 to left but of Kv7.4 to right; charges in the PUFA head are important to modulation of Kv7.5 but not so important to modulation of Kv7.4. The effect of PUFA on Kv7.5 G-V relation shows larger magnitudes than on Kv1-3 G-V relation at all pH values inspected. Mutations in Kv7.4 VSD, particularly F179 and F182 mutations in S3, alter PUFA effects. The data are of high quality and the description is clear. This study now adds to the literature on PUFA modulation of all Kv7 voltage dependence of activation. However, the manuscript provides a limited mechanistic insight on molecular interactions between the channels and the PUFA molecules. The study does not provide insights on how the modulation on Kv7 channels explains PUFA effects on physiology at the tissue level.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the present manuscript Damon J A Frampton et al. explore the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the hKv7.4 and hKv7.5 ion channels in a clear and well-presented manuscript. These subtype Kv7 channels, are found forming heterotetramers in vascular smooth muscle cells (Kv7.4/Kv7.5) or as homotetramers in cochlear outer hair cells (Kv7.4) their modulation by ligands or auxiliary KCNE subunits is of general physiological interest. Even though the effects of PUFAs have been extensively studied in other members of the Kv7 family (Kv7.1-3) hKv7.4 and hKv7.5 haven't been tested yet, therefore; the present manuscript fulfills that gap. These two Kv7 family subtypes are expressed as heterotetramers Kv7.4/7.5 in vascular smooth muscle cells, presumably as homotetramers (hKv7.4) in auditory cells Kv7.4. The results shown for hKv7.5 show a shift on the V50 of the G/V towards more negative potentials, and although the maximum conductance in presence of PUFAs seems to be unaffected, these results are compatible with a lipoelectric mechanism of interaction described previously for other members of the Kv7 family. The most novel and surprising finding of the present work is the inhibitory effect of PUFAs on hKv7.4, shifting the V50 of the G/V curves to more positive potentials, the opposite of what it has been observed in other members of the Kv7 family (including hKv7.5). Therefore, the mechanism for this effect is presumably different to the one described previously for other members of the family.</p><p>However, the authors have some hints about the effects of PUFAs on hKv7.4 in their data. The results modifying the charge of the DHA head group, suggest that a negative charge in the carboxy head group is important for the shift in the V50, and site directed mutagenesis highlight residues that modify discretely the PUFA effects on the V50shift. The double Phe mutations suggest a possible important site for PUFAs coordination by abolishing the PUFA V50 shift, reducing the current conductance, and slowing down the activation/deactivation kinetics (by visual inspection) moreover the double Phe mutant contains a disease associated mutation: F182L that on its own discretely affects the DHA effect on the V50 shift (still towards more positive potentials). However, it remains an open question what the effect of will be the second Phe, F179T on its own.</p><p>In these lines of trying to understand the PUFAs' mechanism of interaction in Kv7.4 there is some intriguing open questions for discussion, for example: is the coordination site for the PUFAs is still on the VSD involving the positive charges? are the two Phe in close proximity to any of these positive charges (located on S4 or S6) that have been shown to be important for Kv7.1 and conserved in 7.4 and 7.5?. Will the Tyr at the top of S5 mentioned by the authors in the Discussion (Yadzi et al. 2021) be also implicated in the PUFAs' effect?</p><p>I will encourage the authors to test F179T on its own to explore its effect on the PUFAs sensitivity.</p><p>Due to the intriguing effect of PUFAs and Kv7.4, and because KCNE subunits associate with Kv7 channels in multiple tissues, evaluating the effect of PUFAS in a Kv7.4-KCNE complex might be of interest. Specially since these auxiliary subunits affect the Kv7 channels response to PUFAs, as shown by the authors (Liin SI, Silverå Ejneby M, Barro-Soria R, et al. Polyunsaturated fatty acid analogs act antiarrhythmically on the cardiac IKs channel. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015;112(18):5714-5719. doi:10.1073/pnas.1503488112) where the KCNE1 presence in the Kv7.1/KCNE1 complex abolishes the V50 shift produced by DHA with Kv7.1 alone. I will suggest the authors to consider trying to express Kv7.4 together with a member of the KCNE family, to test the effects on PUFAs sensitivity.

The gating charges mutated at the bottom of S4 are non-specific of Kv7.4 so this effect seen in the MD simulations could be &quot;charge-driven&quot; instead of Kv7.4 specific. The authors should add to the discussion of why they think this effect is specific on Kv7.4 comparing the Kv7.1 and Kv7.4 structures.

I would also like to acknowledge their effort in providing a novel mechanism that can explain the fascinating subtype-specific effect of the PUFAS on Kv7.4. The newly added molecular dynamic (MD) simulations beautifully predict a putative PUFA binding site in the inner part of S4 that the authors further confirmed with a set of functional experiments. The results of the site-directed mutagenesis of the positive charge of the lower VSD suggests a conserved lipoelectric conventional PUFA binding site in Kv7.4 that is overruled by the unconventional &quot;inner VSD site&quot; one. This unique mechanism opens the door to new and exciting questions about its relevance and physiological role.</p><p>The latest additions to the Results section explain the uniqueness of the PUFAs effect on Kv7.4 and provide a mechanism. I have just a couple of suggestions to reinforce the specificity of the results. First, I wonder if the new arginine mutants are only modulated by negatively charged DHA or non-charged/positive charged PUFAS also modify the channel, as one could expect if they are acting through the conventional lipoelectric PUFA binding site. Additionally, to help support the particularity of the new &quot;inner VSD site&quot; Kv7.4, the authors could take advantage of the Kv7.1 structure and perform the same type of MD simulations to confirm further that the &quot;inner VSD site&quot; for negatively charged DHA found in Kv7.4 is specific as it is the shift of the G-V curves towards positive potentials.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77672.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Throughout the text, the authors refer to the effects of fatty acids (FAs) as activating or inhibiting. Have the authors shown that at negative voltages the channels (Kv7.5) can be opened by FAs? This result will justify calling FAs activators, otherwise, the effect should be called a modulation of activity. This is an important mechanistic distinction that in the absence of clear experimental evidence can be confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now adjusted the text to make clear that PUFAs modulate channel activity. We now refer to the effects as facilitation or inhibition of channel activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors refer to a &quot;local pH&quot; on the channels that might account for the protonation state of DHA and thus its effect. It is not clear to me how the authors propose that the channel, which dos not conduct protons, can regulate local pH. Perhaps they want to say pKa?</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously shown for Kv7.1 that the local pH environment in a PUFA binding site is altered upon Kv7.1 co-assembly with the KCNE1 subunit (Larsson et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2018). That alteration is not caused by protons conducted through the channel pore but rather through structural rearrangements that places one of the negatively charged extracellular loops of Kv7.1 closer to the PUFA head group. This structural re-arrangement is proposed to attract positively charged protons to the PUFA binding site, thereby promoting DHA protonation (and increasing the apparent pKa of the DHA head group). The functional outcome of KCNE1 co-assembly with Kv7.1 is a reduced DHA response. In a similar manner, we hypothesized that Kv7.5 might show an increased DHA response by instead having a local pH environment in the PUFA binding site that promotes DHA deprotonation. We envision that this could be caused by the presence of, for instance more positively charged residues near the DHA headgroup compared to in Kv7.1 and Kv7.2/7.3. However, as shown by the experimental data (Figure 5C), this was not the case as the apparent pKa of DHA was similar for both Kv7.1 and Kv7.5. We have adjusted the text in the Results section to rather refer to altered apparent pKa, to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While other experiments are well designed, the pH experiments intended to study the effect of charge on the modulation by DHA have a major flaw. There seem to be no controls for the effect of pH on channel gating (G-V curves). If this is the case, the measured effect of DHA is a combination of the possible effect of pH on DHA charge and the effect of pH on the GV of the channel.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that the design of the pH experiments was not clearly described. In all experiments, the extracellular pH of the external solution is similar in the control recording and the DHA recording. This is because the pH of the extracellular recording solution was set the day of experiments, and DHA was solved at the desired concentration in this extracellular recording solution. For example, in the experiment shown in Figure 5B, the pH of the extracellular solution was set to pH 8.2, and was used in both the control measurement (open circles) and DHA measurement (red circles) as DHA was solved in the pH 8.2 recording solution. Therefore, the measured effect of DHA reports only on the shift induced by DHA (and not by pH alone). We have now clarified this in the methods section and appropriate figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors argue that the effects of FAs on Kv7 channels are mediated through the interaction of the negative charge of the head of FAs with gating charges in the VSD. But then, without any justification, carry out mutations of two (non-charged) phenylalanines present in the S3 of Kv7.4. The reference to gating charges should thus be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that the justification was unclear. What we meant was that structural differences in the VSD of Kv7.4 compared to other Kv7 channels, induced for instance by bulky phenylalanines, may allosterically impair conventional PUFA interaction with the outermost gating arginines in the VSD. We have in the revised version of the manuscript removed this Results section and the data for the double phenylalanine mutant. Instead, we now show molecular dynamics and simulation data supporting a unique, unconventional, PUFA site in Kv7.4 underlying PUFA-induced inhibition of channel activation. Our new data suggest that PUFAs, like in Kv7.1 channels, have several putative interaction sites on Kv7.4. However, notably, we find a functionally dominating and unconventional site in Kv7.4 not previously observed in other Kv7 channels. This Kv7.4 PUFA site is in the inner half of the voltage-sensing domain and is characterized by interactions between the negatively charged PUFA head group and positively charged arginine residues in the lower half of S4 (the innermost gating charges). Experimental neutralization of these innermost arginines ablates the unconventional PUFA-induced inhibition of Kv7.4 and endows Kv7.4 with a conventional PUFA response (i.e. a shifted V50 towards more negative voltages). We propose that PUFA binding to the unconventional inner VSD site in Kv7.4 shifts V50 towards more positive voltages by stabilizing resting and/or intermediate S4 conformations (thus hindering channel opening), and that disruption of this site allows for PUFAs to instead facilitate Kv7.4 channel opening by acting from the conventional outer VSD site. Altogether, these new data presented in two new Results sections (rows 288-332), Figures 6-7 with Figure Supplements, and discussed in one new section (rows 389-406) provides a mechanistic basis for the unconventional PUFA response of Kv7.4.</p><p>Speculatively, the two phenylalanines assessed in the previous version of the manuscript contributes to the slightly altered packing of the VSD of Kv7.4 required to enable PUFA binding to the unconventional inner PUFA site.

The study finds interesting differences in PUFA's effects on these two Kv7 channels. PUFA shifts GV of Kv7.5 to left but of Kv7.4 to right; charges in the PUFA head are important to modulation of Kv7.5 but not so important to modulation of Kv7.4. The effect of PUFA on Kv7.5 G-V relation shows larger magnitudes than on Kv1-3 G-V relation at all pH values inspected. Mutations in Kv7.4 VSD, particularly F179 and F182 mutations in S3, alter PUFA effects. The data are of high quality and the description is clear. This study now adds to the literature on PUFA modulation of all Kv7 voltage dependence of activation. However, the manuscript provides a limited mechanistic insight on molecular interactions between the channels and the PUFA molecules. The study does not provide insights on how the modulation on Kv7 channels explains PUFA effects on physiology at the tissue level.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed molecular dynamics simulations paired with site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiology experiments to probe the mechanism of PUFA modulation of Kv7.4.

These experiments show that the DHA effect on Kv7.4 is not affected by the KCNE4 subunit, which responded to DHA with a positive shift in V50 comparable to that of Kv7.4 alone. Thus, the KCNE4 subunit did not alter the Kv7.4 response to DHA, which is different to what we have previously found for the KCNE1 subunit and Kv7.1.

Thus, for hKv7.5, titrating the pH of the control solution from 6.5 to 8.2 has no effect on V50.

I would also like to acknowledge their effort in providing a novel mechanism that can explain the fascinating subtype-specific effect of the PUFAS on Kv7.4. The newly added molecular dynamic (MD) simulations beautifully predict a putative PUFA binding site in the inner part of S4 that the authors further confirmed with a set of functional experiments. The results of the site-directed mutagenesis of the positive charge of the lower VSD suggests a conserved lipoelectric conventional PUFA binding site in Kv7.4 that is overruled by the unconventional &quot;inner VSD site&quot; one. This unique mechanism opens the door to new and exciting questions about its relevance and physiological role.</p><p>The latest additions to the Results section explain the uniqueness of the PUFAs effect on Kv7.4 and provide a mechanism. I have just a couple of suggestions to reinforce the specificity of the results. First, I wonder if the new arginine mutants are only modulated by negatively charged DHA or non-charged/positive charged PUFAS also modify the channel, as one could expect if they are acting through the conventional lipoelectric PUFA binding site. Additionally, to help support the particularity of the new &quot;inner VSD site&quot; Kv7.4, the authors could take advantage of the Kv7.1 structure and perform the same type of MD simulations to confirm further that the &quot;inner VSD site&quot; for negatively charged DHA found in Kv7.4 is specific as it is the shift of the G-V curves towards positive potentials.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words and their suggestions of how to reinforce our conclusions.</p><p>We have now performed experiments on the arginine mutants (R213Q, R216Q and R219Q) with the uncharged PUFA analogue DHA-me, and with two positively charged PUFA analogues (DHA+ and AA+) (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1). Our results indicate that the PUFA response of the arginine mutants can be electrostatically tuned. The response pattern was clearest for R213Q, which showed the largest negative shift induced by DHA and for which DHA-me had minimal effects on V<sub>50</sub> whereas DHA+ and AA+ shifted V<sub>50</sub> towards positive voltages. The response pattern showed a similar trend for R216Q and R219Q, however, with less robust effects induced by the positively charged compounds. The positive shifts induced by AA+ on the arginine mutants were larger than for hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 (Figure 3C) and those previously reported for the Shaker K<sub>V</sub> channel (Börjesson et al., 2010), comparable to the effect on WT hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 (Figure 3F), and slightly smaller than those previously reported for hK<sub>V</sub>7.1 (Liin et al., 2015). These data, provided in Figure 7 – Figure Supplement 1 and described at rows 334-349 and 423-427, further indicate that the PUFA responses of the Kv7.4 arginine mutants are more in line with the lipoelectric mechanism that has been proposed for other Kv7 channels.</p><p>In regards to why the unconventional inner VSD site may be specific to hKv7.4, we have now included a structural alignment of the VSDs of hKv7.4 and hKv7.1 (Figure 6 —figure supplement 3).
