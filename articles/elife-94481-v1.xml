The disease cases were obtained through electronic health data linkage. The Generation Scotland research team have made us aware of an error regarding the disease linkage data that was used in the original work. This affected the lung cancer disease codes, which were accidentally enriched for both breast and lung cancer traits. We have corrected this, with incident lung cancer cases falling from 201 to 100 in the corrected data. We also noticed an issue regarding the ranking of diagnosis dates for disease codes, which affected time-to-event calculations for a small proportion of disease cases. This has also been corrected. We now report 130 protein EpiScore associations with incident disease rather than 137. The type 2 diabetes EpiScore associations still replicate those observed in the literature, with highly similar results to those observed previously. Three of the original lung cancer associations remain (G-CSF, HGF and EN-RAGE), whereas five are no longer statistically significant and seven new associations are observed. The revised Figures 4 and 6 show the updated Cox PH association results. All corresponding tables in Supplementary file 1 have also been updated to reflect the change in the Cox PH analyses. As it is only the Cox PH association analyses in Generation Scotland that has been updated, the protein EpiScore weights remain unchanged and are usable in future research contexts without need for amendment. The central message of our study (that EpiScores are useful tools for disease prediction) also remains unchanged.</p><p>The necessitated changes to the Cox PH sections of the work are outlined below. <underline>Underline</underline> indicates where updates to the corrected text passages have been made, versus the original text.</p><p><bold>[Abstract]</bold></p><p>[Corrected text:]</p><p>we uncovered 13<underline>0</underline> EpiScore – disease associations</p><p>[Original text:]</p><p>we uncovered 137 EpiScore – disease associations</p><p><bold>[eLife digest]</bold></p><p>[Corrected text:]</p><p>revealed 13<underline>0</underline> connections</p><p>[Original text:]</p><p>revealed 137 connections</p><p>[Removed text:]</p><p>The following text has been removed due to the video no longer reflecting the updated results:</p><p>A video summarising this study and detailing how the 109 EpiScores can be calculated in cohorts with DNAm data is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://youtu.be/xKDWg0Wzvrg">https://youtu.be/xKDWg0Wzvrg</ext-link>.</p><p><bold>[Figure 1:]</bold></p><p>[Corrected figure:]</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94481-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p><bold>Figure 1.

When we restricted the time-to-event/censor period by each year of possible follow-up, there were minimal differences in the EpiScore - disease hazard ratios between follow-up periods that did not violate the assumption and those that did (<bold>Supplementary file 1L</bold>). The 137 associations were therefore retained as the primary results.</p><p>The 137 associations found in the fully-adjusted model comprised 78 unique EpiScores that were related to the incidence of 11 of the 12 morbidities studied. Diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) had the greatest number of associations, with 33 and 41, respectively. <bold>Figure 4</bold> presents the EpiScore-disease relationships for COPD and the remaining nine morbidities: stroke, lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), depression, bowel cancer, pain (back/neck) and Alzheimer’s dementia. There were 13 EpiScores that associated with the onset of three or more morbidities. <bold>Figure 5</bold> presents relationships for these 13 EpiScores in the fully-adjusted Cox model results. Of note is the EpiScore for Complement 5 (C5), which associated with five outcomes: stroke, diabetes, IHD, RA and COPD. Of the 29 SOMAscan-derived EpiScore associations with incident diabetes, 23 replicated previously reported protein associations (Elhadad et al., 2020; Gudmundsdottir et al., 2020; Ngo et al., 2021) with incident or prevalent diabetes in one or more cohorts (<bold>Figure 6 and Supplementary file 1M</bold>).</p><p><bold>[Figure 3:]</bold></p><p>[Corrected figure:]</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94481-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p><bold>Figure 3.
