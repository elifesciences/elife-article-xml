nascent mitochondrial proteins that are synthesized in the cytosol. These nascent mitochondrial proteins are aggregation-prone and can cause cytosolic proteostasis stress. The transcription factor-dependent transcriptional regulations and the TOM-TIM complex-dependent import of nascent mitochondrial proteins have been extensively studied. Yet, little is known regarding how these two steps of mitochondrial biogenesis coordinate with each other to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of these aggregation-prone nascent mitochondrial proteins. Here, we show that in budding yeast, Tom70, a conserved receptor of the TOM complex, moonlights to regulate the transcriptional activity of mitochondrial proteins. Tom70’s transcription regulatory role is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The dual roles of Tom70 in both transcription/biogenesis and import of mitochondrial proteins allow the cells to accomplish mitochondrial biogenesis without compromising cytosolic proteostasis. The age-related reduction of Tom70, caused by reduced biogenesis and increased degradation of Tom70, is associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mtDNA, and mitochondrial proteins. While loss of Tom70 accelerates aging and age-related mitochondrial defects, overexpressing TOM70 delays these mitochondrial dysfunctions and extends the replicative lifespan. Our results reveal unexpected roles of Tom70 in mitochondrial biogenesis and aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial biogenesis</kwd><kwd>Tom70</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>mitochondria defect</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Glenn postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qingqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5OD024598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Chuankai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG058742</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Brian K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03AG070478</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Chuankai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tom70 connects the mitochondrial import to the nuclear transcriptional activity of mitochondrial proteins and controls mitochondrial biogenesis defects during aging.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria play critical roles in a growing list of cellular activities, such as signaling, metabolism, and inflammation. A decline in mitochondrial function, both in quality and quantity, has been associated with normal aging and many age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gureev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Mitochondrial quality and quantity are determined by mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pickles et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shpilka and Haynes, 2018</xref>). More than 99% of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fox, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morgenstern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pagliarini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vögtle et al., 2017</xref>). The expression of mitochondrial proteins is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level by transcription factors that integrate cellular and environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Winde and Grivell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jornayvaz and Shulman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scarpulla, 2008</xref>). For example, in budding yeast, cells sense nutrients and regulate the expression of mitochondrial proteins through Hap4, a well-studied transcription activator of mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Forsburg and Guarente, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McNabb et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olesen et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pinkham and Guarente, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Santangelo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schüller, 2003</xref>). In addition to transcription activation, repressors such as Mig1 and Rox1 also play a critical role to set the balance and maintain optimal expression of mitochondrial proteins in response to different growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lowry and Zitomer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Santangelo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schüller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ter Linde and Steensma, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trueblood et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p>After completing transcription, these mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins are translated in the cytosol and imported by the TOM-TIM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wiedemann and Pfanner, 2017</xref>). Most mitochondrial proteins are selectively recognized and imported via Tom20 and Tom70, two major receptors of the TOM complex. The Tom20 pathway is known to import nascent mitochondrial proteins that contain an N-terminal signal peptide. A significant number of nascent mitochondrial proteins lack the typical N-terminal peptides and, instead, present the internal mitochondrial targeting signals (iMTS) that span the entire primary sequence and are imported via the Tom70 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sirrenberg et al., 1996</xref>). Another unique feature of the Tom70 pathway is that cytosolic chaperones, such as Hsp70, are involved in maintaining these mitochondrial proteins in unfolded states before being transferred to Tom70 for import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoseini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Young, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zanphorlin et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, mitochondrial import, especially the Tom70-mediated pathway, is integrated into the cytosolic proteostasis. Indeed, the accumulation of nascent mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol triggers cytosolic stress responses, known as UPRam and mPOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). Given the aggregation-prone nature of these nascent mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nowicka et al., 2021</xref>), a balance between the production and import of mitochondrial proteins is required to avoid the accumulation of these proteins in the cytosol.</p><p>Although the transcriptional regulations of mitochondrial proteins and the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial import have been extensively studied in the past, they were investigated separately, and little is known regarding how these two steps of mitochondrial biogenesis coordinate with each other to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of these aggregation-prone nascent mitochondrial proteins. In this study, we use budding yeast as the model to provide evidence that the mitochondrial import receptor Tom70 moonlights to regulate the transcriptional activity of mitochondrial proteins. This transcription regulatory role of Tom70 is conserved in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (fruit fly). Our results suggest that cells use the same molecule, Tom70, to regulate both the transcription/biogenesis and import of mitochondrial proteins so the nascent mitochondrial proteins do not compromise cytosolic proteostasis or cause cytosolic protein aggregation. Importantly, the Tom70 abundance is decreased during aging, which is associated with age-dependent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mtDNA, and mitochondrial proteins. While loss of Tom70 accelerates aging and age-related mitochondrial defects, overexpressing TOM70 delays these mitochondrial dysfunctions and extends the replicative lifespan. Therefore, the reduction of Tom70 is a key event contributing to the mitochondrial biogenesis and defects during aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tom70 regulates the transcriptional activity of mitochondrial proteins</title><p>As the abundance of TOM complex on the mitochondrial outer membrane determines how fast nascent mitochondrial proteins can be imported, we started out by examining if TOM proteins may also regulate the biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins so the biogenesis and import of nascent mitochondrial proteins can be coordinated with each other. We used the pGAL promoter to overexpress (OE) different TOM proteins and Hap4, which is known to drive mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2002</xref>). To examine their effects on mitochondrial biogenesis, we randomly selected four mitochondrial proteins to represent different sub-compartments of the organelle. The expression levels of representative mitochondrial proteins were visualized by endogenous C-terminal GFP tagging and expressed from their native promoters using the strains from the yeast GFP library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huh et al., 2003</xref>). This library has been extensively characterized against different proteomic results to show high accuracy and fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Newman et al., 2006</xref>). To quantitatively compare the GFP signals from different strains, we imaged the cells with an avalanche photodiode (APD), which is a single-photon sensitive detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruschini et al., 2019</xref>). As a single GFP protein emits ~21 photons in our imaging setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kubitscheck et al., 2000</xref>), this single-photon sensitive detector allowed us to accurately compare the abundance of these mitochondrial proteins across different conditions in live cells.</p><p>Compared to the wild-type cells cultured in the same medium, we found that HAP4 OE indeed could increase the expression of two out of these four randomly chosen mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is consistent with previous results that HAP4 OE increases the biogenesis of roughly 1/4 of the mitochondrial proteome (255 out of &gt;1000 mitochondrial proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2002</xref>). Among these TOM proteins, only TOM70 OE increased the abundance of these mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Compared to HAP4 OE, TOM70 OE has a similar but broader effect on these mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, Tom71, the paralog of Tom70, failed to induce the expression of any of these mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The effect of TOM70 OE on these mitochondrial proteins is not caused by or unique to galactose: (1) all strains, including wild type and HAP4 OE, were cultured in the same galactose medium while OE of Tom70, but not other TOM proteins, increased mitochondrial biogenesis; (2) similar results were observed when Tom70 was overexpressed from an artificial promoter Z3EV, which is inducible by the β-estradiol, in the glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McIsaac et al., 2013</xref>). We then expanded the list to cover more mitochondrial proteins from all four sub-compartments of the organelle and found TOM70 OE generally increased their abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tom70 regulates the transcriptional activity of mitochondrial proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images for proteins localized to different sub-compartments of mitochondria in cells overexpressing (OE) different TOM proteins and HAP4 from pGal promoter.

This indicates that the transcriptional activation of mitochondrial biogenesis upon TOM70 OE is not restricted to Tom70’s substrates. Consistent with its role in transcription activation, when Tom70 was selectively removed from mitochondria by TEV protease, the mRNA level of many mitochondrial proteins reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This transcription regulatory role of Tom70 is conserved as an enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis was observed in fruit fly larvae when UAS-TOM70 was overexpressed in muscles by Mef2-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As overexpressing Tom70’s cytosolic domain alone, which stay diffusively in the cytosol, did not activate the transcription of these mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), these results suggest that Tom70 has to be on the mitochondrial outer membrane to control the transcriptional activity of many mitochondrial proteins.</p><p>Which transcription factor(s) act downstream of Tom70? Retrograde signaling from mitochondria, marked by the increased nuclear-to-cytosol ratio of transcription factors Rtg1/3, is a known stress response toward mitochondrial stress and defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Butow, 2006</xref>). However, the nuclear/cytosol ratio of Rtg1/3-GFP in TOM70 OE cells is similar to the wild-type cells cultured in the same galactose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Additionally, knocking out Rtg3 failed to prevent the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis program in TOM70 OE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> F). These results suggest that Tom70 regulates the transcription of mitochondrial proteins through transcription factors (TFs) other than the well-known retrograde signaling pathway. To search for the TFs downstream of Tom70, <italic>in silico </italic>analysis was conducted to find common TFs that recognize/bind the promoters of these mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Monteiro et al., 2020</xref>). Some of these predicted TFs have expression changes upon TOM70 OE, indicating that Tom70 regulates these TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A few of these TFs are so far not known to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis or metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bähler, 2005</xref>). For example, Fkh1/2 are members of the Forkhead family transcription factor that are previously known to regulate the expression of G2/M phase genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bähler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Postnikoff et al., 2012</xref>). Among these TFs that responded to Tom70 OE, overexpressing some TFs, including Fkh1/2, can mimic the TOM70 OE effect and increase the abundance of mitochondrial proteins from different sub-compartments, such as Adh3, Qcr7, and Tim44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). We asked whether Fkh1/2 are required for the Tom70-related mitochondrial biogenesis program. When FKH1 or FKH2 are deleted, the induced expression of mitochondrial proteins in TOM70 OE cells is partially blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We noticed that none of the Fkh1/2 mutants completely blocked the effect of TOM70 OE, indicating that Tom70 can signal through multiple TFs to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. This is consistent with the observation that TOM70 OE has broader effects on mitochondrial biogenesis than OE of a single TF, such as HAP4 OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The transcription factors involved in the Tom70-dependent transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) mRNA abundance of different transcription factors (TF) quantified by RT-qPCR in TOM70 OE strain and normalized to control cells.

In contrast to TOM70 OE, knocking out TOM70 led to the reduction of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Therefore, Tom70 regulates the biogenesis of both mitochondrial proteins and mtDNA. DNA polymerase γ (Mip1 in yeast) is responsible for the replication and affects the abundance of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Foury, 1989</xref>). We noticed that Mip1 contains the iMTS which is known to use Tom70 for mitochondrial import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backes et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, the abundance of Mip1 protein was increased in TOM70 OE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which likely contributes to the observed increase of mtDNA. Consistently, MIP1 OE increased the abundance of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), albeit to a lesser extent than TOM70 OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that additional factors also contribute to the increase of mtDNA in TOM70 OE cells. Interestingly, when mtDNA was removed, TOM70 OE could not activate the transcription of these nDNA-encoded mitochondrial proteins (ρ<sup>0</sup>;TOM70 OE in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).This suggests that mtDNA is required for the Tom70-mediated transcriptional activation of nDNA-encoded mitochondrial proteins. Although TOM70 OE also increased the expression of basic mitochondrial transcription machineries, such as Rpo41 and Mtf1, upregulating their expressions could not increase the biogenesis of other mitochondrial proteins as TOM70 OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B,C</xref>). In contrast, we noticed that the mitochondrial translation is partially required for the biogenesis of some mitochondrial proteins in TOM70 OE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

The protein level of Tom70 is determined by its biogenesis and degradation.We first checked the biogenesis of Tom70 during aging.

Cells use the same molecule, Tom70, to regulate the transcriptional activity and import of mitochondrial proteins. These dual roles of Tom70 connect two main steps of mitochondrial biogenesis that have been studied separately in the past, namely the transcriptional regulations of mitochondrial proteins and the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial import. The imbalance between import and biogenesis of nascent mitochondrial proteins leads to their cytosolic accumulation, which causes cytosolic proteostasis stress and the formation of cytosolic protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Samluk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Topf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that Tom70’s dual roles in both biogenesis and import of mitochondrial proteins allow the cells to accomplish mitochondrial biogenesis without compromising cytosolic proteostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This interdependence between cytosolic proteostasis and mitochondrial biogenesis is consistent with the observations that mitochondrial dysfunction and protein aggregation are two closely related hallmarks of aging and age-related diseases.</p><p>Nascent mitochondrial proteins synthesized in the cytosol are transferred from Hsp70 to Tom70, which then transfers the nascent proteins to Tom40 for translocation into the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). When mitochondrial import is perturbed, such as Tim23 inactivation, the transfer of nascent mitochondrial protein to Tom40 and translocation are halted. These unimported nascent mitochondrial proteins stay on the surface of mitochondria and associate with upstream factors, such as Tom70. Such mitochondrial import defect activates the stress response that represses the biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins in order to relieve the cytosolic accumulation/aggregation of nascent mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). Our results show that such repressive program requires Tom70, as the mitochondrial import defect failed to repress the mitochondrial biogenesis and caused cytosolic accumulation/aggregation in the absence of Tom70. Together with the transcriptional activation of mitochondrial biogenesis upon TOM70 OE, these results are consistent with the model that the ratio/balance between Tom70-nascent mitochondrial protein, which represents the capacity of mitochondrial import, regulates the biogenesis activity of mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Retrograde signaling, such as the one mediated by Rtg1/2/3 in yeast and many forms of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shpilka and Haynes, 2018</xref>), has been described for mitochondria to mitigate the proteostasis defect <italic>inside</italic> mitochondria. In contrast, this Tom70-dependent transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial biogenesisis probably evolved to maintain proteostasis <italic>outside</italic> of mitochondria. Consistent with this view, our results showed that this Tom70-nucleus communication is independent of the classic retrograde signaling via Rtg1/2/3 that responds to the mitochondrial defects. Instead, several other TFs are required in this Tom70-dependent transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Some of these TFs, such as the Forkhead family transcription factor Fkh1/2, could be the missing TFs that mediate the increase of mitochondrial activity in response to certain longevity cues. For example, it was shown that CR activates mitochondria biogenesis independent of Hap4, the well-studied TF of mitochondrial biogenesis in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2002</xref>). Mining the published dataset, we found that Fkh1 is increased in CR-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2017</xref>). The orthologs of these Forkhead family transcription factors, such as Daf-16/FOXO, are integrators of different signal pathways to regulate longevity and aging.</p><p>Our results also provide a new explanation for the mitochondrial defects in aged cells as the reduction of Tom70 correlates with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, many mitochondrial proteins, and mtDNA, which can be rescued by overexpressing Tom70. Mechanistic dissection of this conserved Tom70 reduction in old cell suggests that age-associated loss of transcriptional activity and increased degradation of Tom70 contribute to its reduction during aging. Many studies showed that loss of proteostasis is an early event during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Zvi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). The loss of proteostasis may inactivate some TFs required for the expression of Tom70 and other mitochondrial proteins as many TFs contain low complex domains that are sensitive to proteostasis impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti and Hyman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vecchi et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, the increased level of Dnm1 during aging could further promote the degradation of mitochondrial Tom70. The reduction of Tom70 and mitochondrial biogenesis could lead to the previously observed age-dependent mitochondrial defects. The fact that loss of Tom70 accelerates aging and age-related mitochondrial defects, while TOM70 OE extends the RLS and delays these mitochondrial dysfunctions, highlights that Tom70 is a key molecule in mitochondrial aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model details</title><p>All <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp3">Supplementary files 1 and 3</xref>.

As we described in the manuscript, we think multiple TFs receive input from Tom70 (line 184-188).</p><p>We also tested how Tom70 affects the basic mitochondrial transcription machineries. Similar to other mitochondrial proteins we tested, Tom70 OE can transcriptionally up-regulate the yeast homologs of POLRMT, TFB2M and TFAM (Rpo41, Mtf1, and Abf2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). However, up-regulating individual mitochondrial transcription machinery proteins did not have much effect in the biogenesis of other mitochondrial proteins compared to TOM70 OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B, C</xref>), indicating that they are not the key mechanism behind Tom70’s effect. In fact, the overexpression of individual mitochondrial transcription machinery proteins causes reduction of other mitochondria proteins, consistent with other data in Figure 1 that Tom70 has a unique function in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis. Although these mitochondrial transcription machinery proteins are likely not important in Tom70-mediated biogenesis, we found that the mitochondrial translation is partially required to increase the biogenesis of some mitochondrial proteins in Tom70 OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) .

We also tested whether reactive oxygen species (ROS) could mediate the downstream signaling of TOM70 OE as low levels of ROS were proposed to have important roles in mitochondrial retrograde signaling and mitochondrial hormesis (Kim and Koh, 2017; Ristow and Schmeisser, 2014). Similar to Fkh1/2 in Figure 2E, treating cells with ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) partially affected the mitochondrial biogenesis induction in TOM70 OE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).

Disrupting one factor at a time only affects a specific pathway and TF, and therefore, has a limited effect on some, but not all, mitochondrial proteins (Figure 2E). As we described in the manuscript, each TF is responsible for regulating a subset of the mitochondrial proteome. For example, the well-studied Hap4 regulates ~1,089 genes, but only ~237 of them are mitochondrial proteins (which by itself consists of &gt;1,000 proteins) and the other ~ 852 genes are related to Golgi, cytosolic ribosomes, cell wall etc. (Monteiro et al., 2020). After trying many hypotheses, we think it will be a long-term goal for us to fill the missing steps between Tom70 and these multiple identified TFs, such as an unbiased screen for the secondary messengers that relay the signals from Tom70 to these TFs. This will be beyond the scope of current manuscript and we think it is important to share our current discoveries with the field and allow researchers to connect Tom70 to their favorite signaling pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

What happens if import is perturbed independently from Tom70 function? Then, Tom70 should still promote transcription/biogenesis, leading to an imbalance of synthesis and import.</p></disp-quote><p>Nascent mitochondrial proteins synthesized in the cytosol are transferred from Hsp70 to Tom70, which then transfers the nascent proteins to Tom40 and Tim23 for translocation into the mitochondria. When mitochondrial import is perturbed independently of Tom70, such as Tim23 inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>), the transfer of nascent mitochondrial protein to Tom40 and translocation is stopped. These unimported nascent mitochondrial proteins stay on the surface of mitochondria and associate with upstream factors, such as Tom70. This mitochondrial import defect, such as the one caused by Tim23 inactivation, is previously known to activate a stress response that represses the biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins (Wang and Chen, 2015; Wrobel et al., 2015). This stress response allows the cell to rebalance the biogenesis with import and prevents cytosolic accumulation/aggregation of nascent mitochondrial proteins. Our results showed that Tom70 is required for such stress response: in the absence of Tom70, Tim23-inactivated cells could not rebalance the synthesis with impaired mitochondria import and cause cytosolic protein aggregation (Figure 4). Therefore, we think the ratio/balance between Tom70-nascent mitochondrial protein, which represents the capacity of mitochondrial import, regulates the biogenesis activity of mitochondrial proteins (summarized in Figure 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Consistently, when Tom70 is overexpressed in the presence of Tim23 inactivation, there is more Tom70 than nascent mitochondrial proteins, so signals are sent to the nucleus to increase the biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins. This causes an imbalance between biogenesis and import resulting in protein aggregation in the cytosol (Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Detailed description can be found in our manuscript between line 226-260.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Schematic of mitochondrial import steps involve Hsp70 and Tom70.</title><p>In yeast, Hsp70 binds and maintains nascent mitochondrial proteins in unfolded states before transferring them to Tom70 for import (Young et al., 2003).

For example, the well-studied Hap4 regulates ~1,089 genes, but only ~237 of them are mitochondrial proteins (which by itself consists of &gt;1,000 proteins) and the other ~ 852 genes are related to Golgi, cytosolic ribosomes, cell wall etc. (Monteiro et al., 2020). This is because most of the TF-regulated biogenesis programs are integrated into other cellular metabolisms in order to orchestrate different cellular functions. Similarly, these TFs (e.g., Fkh1/2 and Hap4) that responded to Tom70 are known to regulate multiple different aspects of cell biology. Therefore, it is expected that some other genes will be co-regulated along with the mitochondrial proteins studied here. The authors appreciate this question but feel it does not affect the current focus of our story.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data in Figure 4 suggest that Tom70 acts to repress mitochondrial protein biogenesis, while the data in the previous figures suggest that Tom70 acts to promote it (this is then also suggested by the aggregation observed in the OE).

The broad regulatory effect of Tom70 in mitochondrial biogenesis is consistent with a model that while each metabolic signal regulates a unique subset of mitochondrial proteomes, Tom70 sets the bandwidth for the expression levels of these mitochondrial proteins activated by metabolic signals due to Tom70’s role in mitochondrial import (see model in Figure 4A). This is probably achieved by sending signals to multiple TFs (e.g., Fkh1/2, Hap4, Snf1 in Figure 2A) to finetune the expression level of most mitochondrial proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional insight into how Tom70 coordinates transcription as a function of mitochondrial protein import &quot;rate/flux&quot; is required to substantiate the author's claims.</p></disp-quote><p>The role of Tom70 in mitochondrial import is well-studied.

Collectively our data show that the amount of Tom70 on mitochondrial surface signals to nucleus to regulate the biogenesis activity of mitochondrial proteins: overexpression of TOM70 increases the amount of Tom70 on mitochondrial membrane, which shifts the balance between Tom70-substrates (nascent mitochondrial proteins) and induces the transcriptional activity of mitochondrial proteins in the nucleus (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We also showed that TOM70 OE increases the amount of other TOM subunits (Figure 1C). This increases the mitochondrial import capacity to match the increased biosynthesis of nascent mitochondrial protein, explaining the lack of protein aggregation in TOM70 OE cells.</p><p>In the case of reduced mitochondrial import rate, such as in Tim23 inactivation, the unimported nascent mitochondrial proteins accumulate on mitochondrial surface and Tom70. This is because nascent mitochondrial proteins synthesized in the cytosol are transferred from Hsp70 to Tom70, which then transfers the nascent proteins to Tom40 and Tim23 for translocation into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). When mitochondrial import is perturbed in Tim23 inactivation, the transfer of nascent mitochondrial protein to Tom40 and the downstream translocation is stopped, and these unimported nascent mitochondrial proteins stay on the surface of mitochondria and associate with upstream factors, such as Tom70. Previous studies have shown that these unimported nascent mitochondrial proteins cause the stress response that represses the biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins in order to relieve the cytosolic accumulation/aggregation of nascent mitochondrial proteins (Wang and Chen, 2015; Wrobel et al., 2015). Our results show that this repressive program requires Tom70, as the mitochondrial import defect failed to repress the mitochondrial biogenesis and caused cytosolic accumulation/aggregation in the absence of Tom70 (Figure 4C). Detailed description can be found in our manuscript between line 226-260 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to quantifying mtDNA via imaging, relative quantities should be determined by qPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantitative imaging approach is an established method to measure DNA (Gomes et al., 2018). In fact, our single-photon sensitive APD brings this quantification to a new level of sensitivity and accuracy with single cell resolution. The basic principle behind quantitative imaging and qPCR is similar: detect the amount of fluorescent dye that bind the DNA. The difference is that qPCR requires purification of DNA from millions of cells and many runs of amplification before the detector can quantify the signal. The single photon counting detector (APD) in our quantitative imaging removes the requirement of DNA purification and amplification steps and directly counts the DNA content <italic>in situ</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Several proteins are increased to ~1.5 fold (Figure 1B). How significant are the increase in these protein levels?</p></disp-quote><p>The statistical analysis is given in the result already and color-coded in Figure 1B. The ~1.5 fold induction of some proteins are statistically significant and comparable to the well-studied HAP4 OE results both here and published by other groups (Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) (Lascaris et al., 2003). For example, a previous study using spectral absorption analysis found that the cytochrome c and c1 increased by ~1.66 times, cyto b increased ~1.51 times, upon HAP4 OE (Lascaris et al., 2003). In fact, most literature on mitochondrial biogenesis measured the mRNA abundance of mitochondrial proteins. The increase of mRNA abundance upon TOM70 OE in Figure 1C is comparable or higher than the cells with HAP4 OE published by other groups (Lin et al., 2002). The color scale of heatmap in Figure 1C may cause underestimation of the mRNA fold increase in TOM70 OE cells. We annotated the fold change on top of the current heatmap to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can this be verified with other standard techniques like western blots?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained at the beginning of our <italic>Result</italic> section, the quantitative imaging method we used here is capable of detecting single GFP with single cell resolution. In contrast, traditional Western blot requires protein extraction from millions of cells and use regular CCD detector (e.g., ChemiDoc Imaging Systems from Bio-Rad Laboratories), which is much less sensitive. Therefore, compared to the basic techniques such as Western blots, the single photon counting detector (APD) allowed us to see statistically significant expression difference <italic>in situ</italic> even for proteins with limited fold changes. In response to reviewer’s request, we randomly chose a few proteins from the list that showed ~1.5-fold changes (Put2, Yta10, Ahd3) and ran WB for them. Compared to Tim23 and Tom7, which showed &gt;1.5-fold increase in Figure 1B, we can see the difference, although not dramatic due to the sensitivity of WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>) .</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Representative WB of WT and TOM70 OE strains.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75658-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Towards the end, the authors also explore the effect of proteostasis defect on TOM70 expression and mitochondrial biogenesis. This section seems like an off shoot of this study. Further exploration is required for this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is unclear regarding the mechanistic details of how proteostasis defects contribute to the reduction of Tom70 during aging. This limitation has been stated in the manuscript (line 334-336 of the original manuscript). However, we think this is not a critical point in our manuscript and we removed this section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. With the overexpression of TOM proteins and Hap4, is the level of expression of basic mitochondrial transcription machinery like POLRMT, TFB2M and TFAM increased?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, these basic mitochondrial transcriptional machineries are increased in TOM70 OE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>).

From Figure 1C, the authors conclude that 'Tom70 levels on the mitochondrial outer membrane control the transcriptional activity of many mitochondrial proteins.' This reviewer is not convinced that the cytosolic domain has no contribution. The conclusion might be a bit more nuanced here than presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Tom70 has most of its molecular mass facing the cytosol (aa 39-617, or cytosolic domain in the manuscript). When we express Tom70’s cytosolic domain in the cytosol, we see very limited induction of mitochondrial biogenesis (Figure 1C) compared to the overexpression of full length Tom70 which is anchored on mitochondrial outer membrane. We think the cytosolic domain of Tom70 must be anchored on the mitochondrial in order to regulate the biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins. Therefore, our original description does not conclude that cytosolic domain has no contribution (line 159-162). In fact, we concluded that Tom70 has to be on the mitochondrial membrane in order to regulate the mitochondrial biogenesis program. We apologize for not making this point clear. We have modified the related text to clarify this point further in line 159.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The effect of proteostasis defect on TOM70 expression and mitochondrial biogenesis is a little unclear. How pervasive is the effect in context of LCD-containing TFs?
