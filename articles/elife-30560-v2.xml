We have previously developed a novel DNA template strand sequencing technique, called Strand-seq, that can be used to map sister chromatid exchange (SCE) events genome-wide in single cells. An increase in the rate of SCE is an indicator of elevated recombination activity and of genome instability, which is a hallmark of cancer.

HR is characterized as a major pathway to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and can occur between any two homologous sequences, such as sister chromatids, homologous chromosomes, or homologous sequences located at different genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jasin and Rothstein, 2013</xref>). HR results in a unidirectional transfer of genetic information from one DNA molecule to another (i.e. gene conversion) and/or a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between the two DNA molecules (i.e. a crossover). A crossover involving two homologous chromosomes can cause loss of heterozygosity, which is a common occurrence in cancer, while a crossover involving homologous sequences located at different genomic loci will result in chromosomal rearrangements, such as deletions, inversions, and translocations, which have been linked to a variety of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kong et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, in mitotic cells, HR is biased towards noncrossovers, and HR involving identical sister chromatids, referred to as sister chromatid recombination (SCR), is preferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kadyk and Hartwell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nassif et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson and Jasin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Virgin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stark and Jasin, 2003</xref>), in part because a crossover during SCR should not lead to a change in DNA sequence.</p><p>However, studying SCR has been difficult, precisely because it does not normally result in a change in DNA sequence. Nevertheless, an SCR event that leads to a crossover, referred to as a sister chromatid exchange (SCE), can be detected. The mechanistic details of SCE and HR have been best studied using genetic assays in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Symington et al., 2014</xref>), though these assays are limited in several ways. First, perfect, or ‘equal’, chromosomal SCE events cannot be detected genetically, so most SCE assays measure ‘unequal’ SCE events, requiring recombination between misaligned sister chromatids. However, using a plasmid-based assay that creates a DSB on one of the two sister plasmids after DNA replication, equal SCE was found to occur much more frequently than unequal SCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">González-Barrera et al., 2003</xref>). Second, an often-used approach for detecting unequal SCE involves using two overlapping segments of a reporter gene in a tail-to-head configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fasullo and Davis, 1987</xref>). The generation of a full-length reporter gene can result from an unequal SCE event, but it can also result from a long-tract gene conversion event, which does not involve a crossover. These two outcomes can be distinguished by analysis of sectored colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kadyk and Hartwell, 1992</xref>), but this additional analysis is often not performed. Third, these assays measure recombination at a single genetic locus by introducing genetic markers at the locus. Introduction of such ‘reporter cassettes’ may disrupt the native chromatin environment, which could affect HR at the locus. Assaying recombination only at a single locus also ignores the rest of the genome. Some proteins important for HR may only affect specific regions of the genome, so these assays would not be useful to elucidate their functions. Lastly, most genetic assays rely on the outgrowth of a recombined cell. Thus, recombination events that lead to a reduction in cell proliferation capacity will be underrepresented, or left uncharacterized.</p><p>To alleviate these limitations, we previously developed a DNA template strand sequencing technique, called Strand-seq, which is capable of detecting SCE events genome-wide in single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Falconer et al., 2012</xref>). In Strand-seq, cells are allowed to divide once in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a synthetic analogue of thymidine. BrdU gets incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA strands. Single daughter cells are isolated and the nascent DNA strands are selectively degraded to isolate parental template strands for the construction of directional sequencing libraries. Multiple single-cell libraries containing unique index sequences are pooled and sequenced on an Illumina platform. Aligned reads are binned into non-overlapping segments and plotted as coloured horizontal lines along an ideogram of each chromosome. An SCE is revealed by a switch in reads mapping to the Watson strand to reads mapping to the Crick strand, or vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Strand-seq was originally developed for use with mammalian cells. However, since most mammalian cells are diploid, it is not easy to differentiate between an SCE from an interhomolog recombination event. Yeast, on the other hand, can be studied in both haploid and diploid states, and the molecular details of HR are best known from studies in yeast. Thus, we have adapted the Strand-seq approach to work with yeast cells. We observe that 23% of wild-type cells have at least one SCE—the first time spontaneous SCEs have been measured and mapped genome-wide in yeast. Interestingly, our findings suggest that most spontaneous SCE events are not due to the repair of DSBs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30560.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Detection of SCE events using Strand-seq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An SCE can occur as a result of DSB repair. Two sister chromatids, one of which has a DSB, are shown. The parental template DNA strands are depicted with solid lines, while the newly synthesized strands containing BrdU are depicted with dashed lines. The Watson and Crick strands are shown in orange and blue, respectively. DSB repair by SCR can lead to the formation of a double Holliday junction (dHJ). Resolution of the dHJ by structure-specific endonucleases will result in either a noncrossover (not shown) or a crossover. The resulting sister chromatids are then segregated to two different daughter cells. In the current Strand-seq protocol, only one daughter cell is isolated and analyzed. The BrdU-containing strands are nicked during library preparation, resulting in the sequencing of only parental strands. Sequence reads are mapped to either side of a chromosome ideogram. An SCE results in a switch from Watson to Crick reads along the chromosome. Note: the small gap between the parental strands in daughter cell #1 and the small overlap of the parental strands in daughter cell #2 are too small to be detected with Strand-seq.

Orange and blue lines correspond to reads aligning to the Watson and Crick strands, respectively. This cell inherited either the parental Watson strand or the parental Crick strand for each chromosome, except chromosome XII. A switch from Watson to Crick reads can be seen for chromosome XII (black arrowhead), indicating that an SCE event has occurred. (<bold>C</bold>) A second example of a wild-type Strand-seq library.

When grown in the presence of BrdU, these strains do not show any cell cycle delay or DNA damage checkpoint activation during the first cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vernis, 2003</xref>). In addition, we see no significant difference in Rad52 focus formation, a sensitive indicator of recombination activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lisby et al., 2001</xref>), after 90 min of growth in BrdU-containing medium, suggesting that BrdU does not stimulate SCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that BrdU incorporation causes DNA damage that induces SCE in a manner that does not elicit a DNA damage checkpoint response or Rad52 focus formation, these findings are in line with our recently reported observation that BrdU incorporation also does not induce SCE in human cells, at least during the first two cell divisions, as varying the concentration of BrdU in the culture medium does not affect the frequency of SCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Wietmarschen and Lansdorp, 2016</xref>).

The evolutionarily conserved Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complex is thought to suppress SCE by dissolving a recombination intermediate known as the double Holliday junction (dHJ; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in a manner that would result in a non-crossover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu and Hickson, 2003</xref>).

Using previously reported Strand-seq data from mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Falconer et al., 2012</xref>) and human fibroblasts and lymphoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Wietmarschen and Lansdorp, 2016</xref>), we find that spontaneous SCE events per cell is about an order of magnitude greater in human and mouse cells than in wild-type yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the human and mouse genomes are much larger than the yeast genome. By plotting the number of SCE events per gigabase of DNA, it is apparent that SCE activity is about 20-fold higher in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). It is generally thought that yeast is more recombinogenic than mammals, but a direct and quantitative comparison has not been available until now.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sister chromatid exchange at the ribosomal DNA locus</title><p>Currently, we are only able to map SCE events to a resolution of approximately 30 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which, combined with the modest number of SCE events we have detected so far (57 total from 218 wild-type Strand-seq libraries; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), prevents us from mapping SCE events to specific genomic loci or features. However, multiple SCE events were seen at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus, which is located on chromosome XII and consists of approximately 150 rDNA repeats, each of which is 9.1 kb in size (the SCE event in the Strand-seq library shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> maps to the rDNA locus). Since the repeats are identical in sequence, we cannot determine where within the ~1.4 Mb rDNA locus an SCE event occurs. Therefore, we only report whether or not an SCE has occurred somewhere within the rDNA locus. Of the 57 spontaneous SCE events we observed in our wild-type Strand-seq libraries, 14 were found at the rDNA locus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We find that the rate of spontaneous SCE per gigabase of DNA in the rDNA locus is about threefold higher compared to the rest of the genome. This result was observed both in the presence and absence of Sgs1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and is likely due to the presence of the replication fork barrier within each rDNA repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Labib and Hodgson, 2007</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30560.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mapping SCE events.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mapping resolution of SCE events in all yeast Strand-seq libraries and by genotype.

First, Rad52 mediates the exchange of replication protein A (RPA) for Rad51 on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to promote Rad51-catalyzed strand invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sung, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">New et al., 1998</xref>). Second, Rad52 facilitates the annealing of complementary RPA-coated ssDNA, a function that is independent of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mortensen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shinohara et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sugiyama et al., 1998</xref>) and augmented by Rad59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petukhova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis and Symington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). To determine which function of Rad52 is important for SCE, we performed Strand-seq on <italic>rad51∆</italic> and <italic>rad52-Y66A</italic> mutant cells. <italic>rad52-Y66A</italic> belongs to a class of <italic>rad52</italic> mutants, class C mutants, that are mutated in the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal domain and share a similar phenotype of being proficient for mitotic recombination, but defective in the repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mortensen et al., 2002</xref>). An in vitro study of one of the class C mutant proteins, rad52-R70A, indicated that these mutants are defective in strand annealing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2009</xref>). We find that SCE is reduced 1.7-fold in <italic>rad51∆</italic> cells and 4.5-fold in <italic>rad52-Y66A</italic> cells (p=0.058 and p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup> for <italic>rad51∆</italic> and <italic>rad52-Y66A</italic>, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that both functions of Rad52 are important for spontaneous SCE, with the strand annealing function being more so. This observation is in agreement with previous work indicating that the strand annealing activity of Rad52 is important for DSB-induced SCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muñoz-Galván et al., 2013</xref>). Using a genetic assay that detects unequal SCE, it was previously reported that Rad51 is not required for spontaneous SCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fasullo et al., 2001</xref>). However, this study did not assess the contribution of long-tract gene conversion in their assay, which may have obscured an actual decrease in unequal SCE in the <italic>rad51∆</italic> mutant.</p><p>Interestingly, the effect of <italic>rad51∆</italic> and <italic>rad52-Y66A</italic> on SCE is restricted to outside of the rDNA locus (3.2-fold [p=0.002] and 15-fold [p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>] reduction, respectively, compared to wild type; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Within the rDNA locus, SCE in <italic>rad51∆</italic> and <italic>rad52-Y66A</italic> is not significantly altered (p=0.48 and p=0.71, respectively). This observation is consistent with a previous study showing that spontaneous Holliday junction formation within the rDNA locus is dependent on Rad52, but not Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zou and Rothstein, 1997</xref>). Taken together, the evidence suggests that Rad52 may have a function independent of Rad51 and strand annealing at the rDNA locus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Double-strand breaks are not the main cause of spontaneous sister chromatid exchange</title><p>It is often thought that SCE events are the result of the repair of DSBs (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate the role of DSBs in the generation of spontaneous SCE events in yeast, we compared the rate of spontaneous SCE in wild-type cells to the rate of DSB formation. Spontaneous DSB rate can be estimated by the rate of cell death in a <italic>rad52∆</italic> mutant, which cannot repair DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coïc et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mehta and Haber, 2014</xref>). A single unrepaired DSB is sufficient to kill a <italic>rad52</italic> mutant cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weiffenbach and Haber, 1981</xref>). Thus, we used the mortality rate of our <italic>rad52∆</italic> strain to estimate the rate of spontaneous DSB formation, which we found to be 12% per cell division (see Materials and methods). Using direct-repeat recombination assays to detect unequal SCR events, one quarter of spontaneous (two of eight recombinants) and one third of X-ray-induced (four of 12 recombinants) SCR events were found to be accompanied by a crossover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson and Fink, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kadyk and Hartwell, 1992</xref>). Therefore, if all spontaneous SCE events are the result of DSB repair, the rate of spontaneous SCE should be 3–4%. This rate represents an upper limit, because if Rad52 repairs other types of DNA damage that could lead to cell death if unrepaired, we would have overestimated the rate of spontaneous DSB formation. In contrast to this 3–4% upper limit, we find that 20% (43 out of 218, 95% CI [15%, 26%]) of wild-type Strand-seq libraries have at least one SCE not at the rDNA locus. We exclude SCE events that map to the rDNA locus because a DSB in the rDNA locus can be repaired by single-strand annealing in the absence of Rad52 due to the highly repetitive nature of the locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozenberger and Roeder, 1991</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that the majority of spontaneous SCE events are not the result of DSB repair.</p><p>Spontaneous HR initiated by non-DSB damage has been reported before, so we investigated whether the same lesion could be responsible for spontaneous SCE. For example, cells lacking both Sgs1 and the structure-specific endonuclease Mus81 are inviable, but this lethality can be suppressed by mutations in the <italic>RAD52</italic> epistasis group (i.e. <italic>RAD51</italic>, <italic>RAD52</italic>, <italic>RAD54</italic>, <italic>RAD55</italic>, and <italic>RAD57</italic>), indicating that <italic>mus81∆ sgs1∆</italic> synthetic lethality is due to a toxic recombination intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fabre et al., 2002</xref>). Since Rad52 is required for the repair of DSBs, Fabre and colleagues argued that the toxic recombination intermediate cannot be initiated by a DSB. Similarly, cells lacking Top3 or Rmi1 grow very poorly, but this slow growth can be suppressed by mutations in <italic>SGS1</italic> or the members of the <italic>RAD52</italic> epistasis group, supporting a model where Rad52 and Sgs1 function in a pathway to repair a spontaneous non-DSB lesion, in the process creating a toxic recombination intermediate requiring Top3 and Rmi1 to resolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gangloff et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mullen et al., 2005</xref>).

While the strand annealing activity of Rad52 is important for spontaneous SCE, it is not in the other noted instances of spontaneous HR, indicating that there must be at least two types of endogenous non-DSB lesions processed by HR.

Rad59, which augments the strand annealing function of Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petukhova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis and Symington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2006</xref>), is required for spontaneous recombination of inverted repeats in the absence of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai and Symington, 1996</xref>). It has been proposed that these events occur by template switching during DNA replication in a manner involving strand annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mott and Symington, 2011</xref>). Poly-ubiquitylation of PCNA by the Mms2-Ubc13-Rad5 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme complex promotes repair through the error-free post-replication repair pathway, which is thought to involve template switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Rad5 and Rad18 were found to have only a minor role in inverted-repeat recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mott and Symington, 2011</xref>), and the rates of spontaneous SCE in <italic>mms2∆</italic>, <italic>ubc13∆</italic>, and <italic>rad5∆</italic> mutants are similar to wild type, as measured by an unequal SCE assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fasullo and Sun, 2017</xref>). However, template switching has been proposed to occur differently depending on whether the DNA lesion is on the leading strand template or the lagging strand template, with lesion bypass on the leading strand utilizing Rad5 while lesion bypass on the lagging strand mediated by Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gangavarapu et al., 2007</xref>). Aside from the rDNA locus, we have so far been unable to map spontaneous SCE events to specific genomic features so further work will be needed to determine whether inverted repeats replicated by the lagging strand machinery are a source of spontaneous SCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>We were able to map multiple spontaneous SCE events to the rDNA locus because of its large size (approximately 10% of the genome). Due to its repetitive nature, the rDNA locus has been an excellent substrate for studying HR. Recombination within the locus is important to maintain repeat homogeneity and copy number homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi, 2011</xref>). Consistent with the importance of HR at the rDNA locus, we observe that SCE is threefold higher at the rDNA locus compared to the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Nevertheless, an SCE event occurs at the rDNA locus in only 6.4% (14 out of 218) of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Considering that it has been estimated that a single cell has on average 3.6 Holliday junctions and one DSB within the rDNA array per cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zou and Rothstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sasaki and Kobayashi, 2017</xref>), our data indicate that the vast majority of HR events at the rDNA locus do not result in crossovers, in agreement with previous work showing that HR at the rDNA locus is largely rearrangement-free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zou and Rothstein, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In addition to SCE, Strand-seq could in theory be used to detect break-induced replication (BIR) events involving sister chromatids. BIR occurs when one end of a DSB invades an intact homologous DNA sequence to generate a replication fork that can potentially proceed to the end of the chromosome. Unlike canonical DNA replication, which is semi-conservative, BIR occurs by conservative DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donnianni and Symington, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saini et al., 2013</xref>). With Strand-seq, a chromosomal region synthesized by BIR could either have no Watson or Crick reads (i.e. both Watson and Crick strands are newly synthesized) or both Watson and Crick reads (i.e. both Watson and Crick strands consist of the original parental template strands). Application of Strand-seq in yeast will be particularly advantageous to address questions about various types of DNA lesions and replication stress-inducing barriers at specific locations in the genome. These and other potential applications of Strand-seq offer intriguing new possibilities to study HR, complimenting more traditional assays to yield a better picture of HR activity genome-wide at the level of single cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and are all <italic>RAD5</italic> derivatives of W303 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thomas and Rothstein, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 1998</xref>).

The cells were then washed once with 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, resuspended in 300 µl of 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1.5 µM SYTOX Green, and incubated overnight at 4°C. Cell suspensions were briefly sonicated and analyzed by flow cytometry. Newly divided daughter cells can be identified by having 1C DNA content and without ConA labeling, since yeast daughter cells bud off from the original mother cells, synthesizing a new cell wall that is not stained with ConA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The single daughter cells were then sorted with a MoFlo Astrios cell sorter (Beckman Coulter) into separate wells of a 96-well plate for Strand-seq library preparation.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30560.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Yeast Strand-seq via the 'single cell sorting' approach.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the ‘single cell sorting’ approach for yeast Strand-seq. (<bold>B</bold>) Representative flow cytometry scatter plots corresponding to the scheme depicted in (<bold>A</bold>).

Cell cycle progression was monitored by flow cytometry. Cells that had progressed through one cell cycle were incubated 0.17 mg/ml zymolyase for 1 hr at 37°C. The resulting spheroplasts were washed in PBS and those with 1C DNA content were sorted with a FACSJazz cell sorter (BD Biosciences) into separate wells of a 96-well plate for Strand-seq library preparation. Without the ConA-labeling, we cannot distinguish newly divided cells from cells that remain arrested in G1 without having progressed through the cell cycle. However, the arrested cells will not have incorporated BrdU, resulting in Strand-seq libraries that will have both Watson and Crick reads for every chromosome. These libraries can be easily identified and discarded. Moreover, we find that the occurrence of such libraries is very rare.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Strand-seq library preparation and sequencing</title><p>Strand-seq libraries were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>), with a few modifications. Sorted single yeast cells were first treated with zymolyase, followed by incubation with MNase to fragment the DNA. Several zymolyase reaction conditions were used in an attempt to optimize the procedure. In the end, we found that 0.175 mg/ml zymolyase for 30 min at 30°C worked best. Sorted single spheroplasts were directly subjected to MNase treatment. Adapter ligation was performed in the presence of PEG 6000, using the Quick Ligation Reaction Buffer (New England Biolabs) and 10 nM adapters to promote efficient ligation of adapters to DNA templates and reduce adapter dimer formation. After ligation and PCR, DNA clean-up with magnetic AMPure XP beads (Agencourt AMPure, Beckman Coulter) was performed twice using a 1.2 vol of beads. Single-end 50 bp sequencing reads from the Strand-seq libraries were generated using the HiSeq 2500 or the NextSeq 500 sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Reads were aligned to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> EF4 reference genome using Bowtie2 (version 2.0.0-beta7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) and analyzed using the BAIT software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hills et al., 2013</xref>) for data selection and visualization purposes. Only libraries with an average read count greater than 20 per megabase of DNA were included in the analyses. SCE events were detected using an R-based package called HapSCElocatoR (publicly available through GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/daewoooo/HapSCElocatoR">https://github.com/daewoooo/HapSCElocatoR</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Porubský and Sanders, 2017</xref> ; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/HapSCElocatoR">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/HapSCElocatoR</ext-link>). HapSCElocatoR uses circular binary segmentation (implemented in the R package fastseg; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klambauer et al., 2012</xref>) to localize SCE events in haploid Strand-seq libraries as a change in read directionality from Watson (negative strand) to Crick (positive strand) or vice versa. Only non-duplicate reads with a mapping quality greater than or equal to 10 were analyzed. We considered only strand state changes with at least three directional reads on both sides of the putative SCE site as an SCE event. Single directional reads embedded within an extended region with the opposite directionality were considered as errors and their directionality was flipped. Computationally localized SCE events were further manually verified by visual inspection of chromosome ideograms (obtained from BAIT; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Comparisons of SCE rate between different genotypes were assessed for statistical significance using a <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Live cell imaging of cells expressing Rad52-GFP</title><p>Strains CCY232 and CCY234 were inoculated in the morning in 2 mL of synthetic medium supplemented with 100 µM thymidine and grown at 25°C. In the evening, the cultures were diluted into 50 mL of synthetic medium supplemented with thymidine to reach an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2–0.4 in the following morning. Cells were then washed twice with synthetic medium and placed either into 25 mL of synthetic medium supplemented with 100 µM thymidine (for CCY232 and CCY234) or 25 mL of synthetic medium supplemented with 200 µM BrdU (for CCY232) and grown for 90 min at 25°C—instead of 30°C, to allow the GFP chromophore to fold more efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lim et al., 1995</xref>). Cells were then mounted onto agar pads for imaging, which was performed using a Zeiss LSM 800 or a DeltaVision Image Restoration Microscope. Images were scores for cells with or without foci by two people independently.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Estimation of spontaneous DSB rate</title><p>Freshly grown E17 (wild type) or CCY193 (<italic>rad52∆</italic>) were spread onto one side of a YPGal +100 µM thymidine plate. Cells were micromanipulated to designated locations on the plate and allowed to divide once. If a cell failed to divide at this stage, it was discarded from further analysis. This step ensured that we would look at healthy and newly divided cells. From the cells that do divide, each daughter cell was then micromanipulated away from its mother cell to a new location on the same plate, which was then incubated for 2–3 days at 30°C to allow the isolated mother and daughter cells to form colonies. The number of mother or daughter cells that were unable to form a colony was recorded. Incidences where both the mother and the daughter did not form a colony were excluded from the analysis because these mother-daughter pairs may have resulted from the division of an arrested cell with unrepaired DNA damage as a result of DNA damage checkpoint adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clémenson and Marsolier-Kergoat, 2009</xref>). In total, 408 E17 and 338 CCY193 cells were examined (i.e. 204 E17 and 169 CCY193 mother-daughter pairs). 13.3% (95% CI [9.9%, 17.4%]) of CCY193 cells and 1.7% (95% CI [0.7%, 3.5%]) of E17 cells failed to form a colony. E17 mortality is unlikely due to unrepaired DSBs, and possibly due to death caused by the micromanipulation process, so subtracting this 1.7% ‘background’ mortality rate from the 13.3% mortality rate of CCY193 cells yields an estimated spontaneous DSB rate of 11.6%. This mortality rate is similar to the 8.3% previously reported for <italic>rad52∆</italic> of a different strain background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozenberger and Roeder, 1991</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Phil Hieter and Jan Stoepel (Michael Smith Laboratory, UBC, Vancouver), and the UMCG Central Flowcytometry Unit, for technical assistance with the sorting of yeast daughter cells; Peter Thorpe for providing the E17 strain; Niek van Wietmarschen, Karina Hoekstra-Wakker, and Jorn Staal for technical assistance with Strand-seq library preparation; and Peter Stirling and Rodney Rothstein for constructive comments on the manuscript.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Double-strand breaks are not the main cause of spontaneous sister chromatid exchange in wild-type yeast cells&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers recognize the importance of sister chromatid exchange and the potential of Strand-seq to measure the number and distribution of these events genome wide. The two main concerns identified by the reviewers are: (1) could the high frequency of SCEs result from the method used to detect them; and (2) validity of the argument regarding the source of the initiating lesion of SCEs.</p><p>Essentially, the concern is that the conditions used to incorporate BrdU into the genome are non-physiological and could result in DNA damage that then leads to sister chromatid exchange. Reviewer 2 suggests specific experiments that could be used to address this concern. In particular, determining viability of rad52 cells under the same conditions used for Strand-seq. Activation of the DNA damage and/or replication checkpoint could also be assessed under these conditions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this study, the authors apply a method called Strand-seq to determine the number and distribution of spontaneous sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in the yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The advantage of this method over previously described assays in yeast, is that it measures events genome wide in a single generation, and reports on equal sister chromatid recombination in contrast to genetic assays that are usually designed to detect unequal recombination between repeated gene segments at a single locus. Yeast is an ideal system for Strand-seq because of the stable haploid state, which avoids complications due to inter-homolog recombination, and plethora of mutants available to investigate the role of genes in known DNA repair pathways in regulating sister chromatid recombination.</p><p>The authors found that 23% of wild type daughter cells analyzed had at least one SCE and these events were dependent on RAD52, and only partially dependent on RAD51. Interestingly, the <italic>rad52-Y66A</italic> allele, anticipated to be defective in the strand annealing function of Rad52, exhibited a greater decrease in SCEs outside of the rDNA than the <italic>rad51</italic> mutant. As expected, the number of spontaneous SCEs was significantly increased in the <italic>sgs1/blm</italic> mutant. The authors then speculate on the initiating lesion for SCEs and from indirect assays infer that most of the events must initiate from a lesion other than a double-strand break (DSB). While I agree with the view that most SCEs probably arise from a single-stranded gap formed during replication, I don't think this is such an unusual standpoint. Most of the <italic>E. coli</italic> recombination community is well aware of the importance of recombination initiated at gaps, and fission yeast labs studying recombination at stalled replication forks have long argued that the events studied do not go through a DSB intermediate. Furthermore, the 2002 study by Fabre and colleagues (cited here) made a strong case that most spontaneous recombination must initiate from ssDNA gaps. I suggest the authors tone done the section stating it is generally assumed recombination initiates from DSBs.</p><p>Subsection “The strand annealing activity of Rad52 is important for sister chromatid exchange”, last paragraph: I found the section on Rad52 requirement for SCE in the rDNA confusing. If Rad52 is required for Holliday junction formation in the rDNA, but not Rad51, it would suggest the Rad52 strand annealing activity is important. Yet <italic>rad52-Y66A</italic>, which is supposedly defective for the strand annealing function is proficient for rDNA recombination.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: The <italic>rad52</italic> null should also be shown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Claussin et al. apply a novel and fairly sensitive assay for crossing-over between sister chromatids (a.k.a. SCE) to the scoring of inter-sister crossovers in single budding yeast cells. They provide evidence that these crossovers occur in about 1 in 4 cell cycles, and that most occur within the ribosomal DNA. They also show that these intersister crossovers require Rad52, with a partition between rDNA and single copy sequences in terms of the dependence on Rad51 and on the annealing activity of Rad52. They also claim to show, based on death rates in <italic>rad52Δ</italic> cells, and on the failure of <italic>rad52</italic> class C mutants (which lack annealing activity) to suppress the synthetic lethality of <italic>mus81 sgs1</italic> double mutants and the slow growth of <italic>rmi1</italic> mutants. This paper is interesting because it provides the first detection of intersister exchange in &quot;normal&quot; genomes, and provides evidence in further support of a partition between the rDNA repeats and the rest of the genome, in terms of recombination biochemistry. However, there is some question as to whether the frequencies of intersister crossovers reflect what happens in normal cells, and the argument regarding the relationship between double strand breaks and intersister crossovers is invalid.</p><p>1) Assay conditions might impact the frequency of recombinogenic lesions. In the strand-seq assay, cells are shifted from thymidine-containing medium into medium where BrdU is the only source of &quot;T&quot;. Under these conditions, there are many non-physiological sources for induced damage. These include inefficient uptake or inefficient phosphorylation leading to decreased dNTP pools and subsequent fork stalling, recognition of incorporated BrU as a damaged base, removal by BER and subsequent post-replicative repair by recombination, or photolytic damage followed by repair by recombination. These are, of course, quite difficult to control for, and all might increase the observed frequency of intersister crossing-over beyond what occurs in the absence of BrdU. The only remedy that I can think of would be to incorporate one of the previously published assays for unequal sister chromatid exchange into the strains used, and compare rates of exchange genetically in cells grown in thymidine, cells subjected to BrdU as for the strand-seq protocol, and in otherwise isogenic CDC21 (i.e. wild-type) cells whose growth is independent of exogenous thymidine.</p><p>2) Cell inviability assays compare rates of death in cells grown in thymidine with rates of SCE in cells grown in BrdU.

The advantage of this method over previously described assays in yeast, is that it measures events genome wide in a single generation, and reports on equal sister chromatid recombination in contrast to genetic assays that are usually designed to detect unequal recombination between repeated gene segments at a single locus. Yeast is an ideal system for Strand-seq because of the stable haploid state, which avoids complications due to inter-homolog recombination, and plethora of mutants available to investigate the role of genes in known DNA repair pathways in regulating sister chromatid recombination.</p><p>The authors found that 23% of wild type daughter cells analyzed had at least one SCE and these events were dependent on RAD52, and only partially dependent on RAD51. Interestingly, the rad52-Y66A allele, anticipated to be defective in the strand annealing function of Rad52, exhibited a greater decrease in SCEs outside of the rDNA than the rad51 mutant. As expected, the number of spontaneous SCEs was significantly increased in the sgs1/blm mutant. The authors then speculate on the initiating lesion for SCEs and from indirect assays infer that most of the events must initiate from a lesion other than a double-strand break (DSB). While I agree with the view that most SCEs probably arise from a single-stranded gap formed during replication, I don't think this is such an unusual standpoint. Most of the E. coli recombination community is well aware of the importance of recombination initiated at gaps, and fission yeast labs studying recombination at stalled replication forks have long argued that the events studied do not go through a DSB intermediate. Furthermore, the 2002 study by Fabre and colleagues (cited here) made a strong case that most spontaneous recombination must initiate from ssDNA gaps. I suggest the authors tone done the section stating it is generally assumed recombination initiates from DSBs.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have removed instances where we state that it is generally assumed spontaneous SCE events are initiated by DSBs. Also, we have cited the relevant <italic>E. coli</italic> and fission yeast studies (see first paragraph of the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The strand annealing activity of Rad52 is important for sister chromatid exchange”, last paragraph: I found the section on Rad52 requirement for SCE in the rDNA confusing. If Rad52 is required for Holliday junction formation in the rDNA, but not Rad51, it would suggest the Rad52 strand annealing activity is important. Yet rad52-Y66A, which is supposedly defective for the strand annealing function is proficient for rDNA recombination.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this section needs more clarity. We find that neither Rad51 nor Rad52-mediated strand annealing are important for SCE at the rDNA locus. Our observation is consistent with that of Zou and Rothstein, who found that neither Rad51 nor Rad59 are important for the formation of spontaneous Holliday junctions at the rDNA (as we noted in our manuscript). Together, the evidence suggests that Rad52 may have a function independent of Rad51 and strand annealing.</p><p>We have now revised the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: The rad52 null should also be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Rescue of <italic>rmi1∆</italic> slow growth by <italic>rad52∆</italic> has been previously reported (Chang et al., 2005).</p><p>This reference has now been included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Claussin et al. apply a novel and fairly sensitive assay for crossing-over between sister chromatids (a.k.a. SCE) to the scoring of inter-sister crossovers in single budding yeast cells. They provide evidence that these crossovers occur in about 1 in 4 cell cycles, and that most occur within the ribosomal DNA. They also show that these intersister crossovers require Rad52, with a partition between rDNA and single copy sequences in terms of the dependence on Rad51 and on the annealing activity of Rad52. They also claim to show, based on death rates in rad52Δ cells, and on the failure of rad52 class C mutants (which lack annealing activity) to suppress the synthetic lethality of mus81 sgs1 double mutants and the slow growth of rmi1 mutants. This paper is interesting because it provides the first detection of intersister exchange in &quot;normal&quot; genomes, and provides evidence in further support of a partition between the rDNA repeats and the rest of the genome, in terms of recombination biochemistry. However, there is some question as to whether the frequencies of intersister crossovers reflect what happens in normal cells, and the argument regarding the relationship between double strand breaks and intersister crossovers is invalid.</p><p>1) Assay conditions might impact the frequency of recombinogenic lesions. In the strand-seq assay, cells are shifted from thymidine-containing medium into medium where BrdU is the only source of &quot;T&quot;. Under these conditions, there are many non-physiological sources for induced damage. These include inefficient uptake or inefficient phosphorylation leading to decreased dNTP pools and subsequent fork stalling, recognition of incorporated BrU as a damaged base, removal by BER and subsequent post-replicative repair by recombination, or photolytic damage followed by repair by recombination. These are, of course, quite difficult to control for, and all might increase the observed frequency of intersister crossing-over beyond what occurs in the absence of BrdU. The only remedy that I can think of would be to incorporate one of the previously published assays for unequal sister chromatid exchange into the strains used, and compare rates of exchange genetically in cells grown in thymidine, cells subjected to BrdU as for the strand-seq protocol, and in otherwise isogenic CDC21 (i.e. wild-type) cells whose growth is independent of exogenous thymidine.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now measured Rad52 focus formation in the Strand-seq strain in the presence and absence of BrdU and found no significant difference (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The goal of the assay is to determine the percentage of <italic>rad52∆</italic> cells that die because of damage occurring during a single cell division. We could have isolated individual cells and asked how many of them could form a colony. However, if done this way, we would have included cells that may have inherited irreparable damage from the previous cell cycle (e.g. they were the products of checkpoint adaptation). This would have inflated the mortality rate. Thus, we instead dissected mother-daughter pairs to ensure that we were looking at healthy cells that had just divided. If a mother or daughter then acquires an irreparable DSB (because <italic>RAD52</italic> is deleted), it will not form a colony and this would be recorded.
