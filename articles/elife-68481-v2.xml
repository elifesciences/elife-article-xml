In contrast to hormone receptor positive breast cancer (luminal subtype), targeted therapy towards TNBC still lacks and conventional chemotherapy remains the standard care for TNBC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wahba and El-Hadaad, 2015</xref>). TNBC targeted therapies have been actively developed and approved by FDA, including PARP inhibitors for BRCA-1 mutated breast cancer, perbrolizumab-based immunotherapy, and Sacituzumab for Trop-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vagia et al., 2020</xref>), but new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to tackle this aggressive tumour for TNBC patients.</p><p>Unfortunately, the pathogenesis underlying the aggressive behaviour of TNBC is poorly understood. Epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) induces epithelial cells to acquire mesenchymal phenotypes, resulting in tumour progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sikandar et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies have proven that progression of EMT is critical for aggression of TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, understanding potential molecular mechanisms will be of great significance to uncover new therapeutic targets for the management of patients with TNBC.</p><p>It is well known that invasive cancer cells adhere to extracellular molecules and disrupt the extracellular matrix (ECM) to initiate the metastatic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishaque et al., 2018</xref>). TLNs are cytoplasmic adapter proteins essential for integrin-mediated cell adhesion to the ECM. Moreover, TLNs are responsible for the activation of integrins via linking integrins to cytoskeletal actin and coordinating recruitment of microtubules to adhesion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gough and Goult, 2018</xref>). Loss of TLNs can impair EMT and the acquisition of cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thapa et al., 2017</xref>). There are two isoforms of TLNs: TLN1 and TLN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gough and Goult, 2018</xref>). TLN1 is expressed in almost all tissues, while TLN2 is usually expressed mainly in the heart, brain, testis, and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Debrand et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manso et al., 2013</xref>). Most of attention on TLNs has focused on TLN1 due to its essential role in mediating cell adhesion. TLN1 is located in focal adhesion (FA), which regulates integrin signalling and promotes metastasis in different cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desiniotis and Kyprianou, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoshino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klapholz and Brown, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seguin et al., 2015</xref>), including prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2015</xref>), colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bostanci et al., 2014</xref>), and oral squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai et al., 2011</xref>). However, the biological effect of TLN1 deletion on the malignancy of TNBC as well as the underlying molecular mechanism remains vague.</p><p>Recent studies have reported that the auto-inhibition of TLN1 controls cell-ECM (CEM) adhesion, migration, and wound healing in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haage et al., 2018</xref>), and disrupting this auto-inhibition leads to more mature and stable FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haage et al., 2018</xref>). Other studies have also shown that the rapid transition between the active and inactive conformations of TLN1 regulates FA turnover, a critical process for cell adhesion and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dedden et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, a previous study found higher <italic>TLN1</italic> transcripts in TNBC than in other clinical breast cancer subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singel et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, disruption of TLN1 might be a potential strategy for cancer therapy.</p><p>Herein, we first explored the role of TLN1 in the pathogenesis of TNBC. We investigated the expression of TLN1 in TNBC cells and studied the effects of silencing <italic>TLN1</italic> on TNBC cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration in vitro and in vivo. In addition, for the first time, we identified a small-molecule compound through a novel computational screening approach by targeting protein-protein binding interface (CSTPPI) to block the interaction between TLN1 and integrin β1. Moreover, we assessed the interference of small-molecule inhibitors with FAs formation and migration in vitro, as well as the inhibition of tumour size and lung metastasis in vivo. Our findings suggest TLN1/integrin β1 binding as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

These experiments inspired us to verify whether TLN1 could bind integrin β1 or β3 in TNBC. Firstly, we validated the interactions between TLN1 and integrin β1 or β3 in MDA-MB-231 cells by immunoprecipitation and found that there was a significant interaction between TLN1 and integrin β1 but not between TLN1 and integrin β3, though a non-specific band was seen in the TLN1 pull-down of integrin β3, which was probably a trace left by electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Subsequently, immunofluorescence showed that TLN1 and integrin β1 were scattered in the cytoplasm while co-located in FAs at both poles of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

In brief, the conformational ensembles of TLN1 and integrin β1 were first generated via 20 ns molecule dynamics simulation. Subsequently, the dynamic binding pockets of TLN1 and integrin β1 were used for further computational screening. Structurally, the TLN1 ‘head’ is comprised largely of an FERM domain, which contains F0, F1, F2, and F3 domains (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, and moesin) (PDB ID: 3IVF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goult et al., 2013</xref>). As the S1 and S2 chains of the PTB F3 domain are crucial for integrin binding and activation, the F3 domain of TLN1 was targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Based on the scores of the corresponding docking conformation and the pocket mode of action, we firstly selected the top eight small molecular compounds (named C1-C8) with the highest affinity score to test the drug sensitivity in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Due to the poor solubility of C1, C3, C5, C7, and C8, we only verified the drug sensitivity of the remaining C2, C4, and C6 (C67399) compounds to MDA-MB-231 cells.

TLN1 is an integrin-activated, tension-sensitive FA component that directly links integrins in the plasma membrane to myosin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haage et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2015</xref>). Beyond the FA component, TLN1 is also associated with chemosensitivity to cancer therapy. Loss of TLN1 function was reported to significantly enhance chemosensitivity in TNBC cell lines, but not in hormone positive cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singel et al., 2013</xref>). They concluded that TLN1 is a regulator of response to docetaxel and a potential therapeutic target for TNBC, but not in other types of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singel et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to its role in chemosensitivity, we found that TLN1 has a carcinogenic effect independent of chemosensitivity in TNBC, and TLN1 initiates the growth and migration of TNBC. Therefore, we developed a specific molecule that more effectively inhibits the oncogenic effect of TLN1, which may be developed as a promising clinical treatment for TNBC, while potentially increasing chemotherapy sensitivity.</p><p>In this study, we revealed that high expression of TLN1 in TNBC was associated with poor prognosis and malignant behaviour, including proliferation, cell adhesion, EMT, invasion, and migration. These data indicate that TLN1 promotes TNBC malignancy as an oncogenic gene, which is in accordance with previous observations in prostate cancer, colon cancer, and oral squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bostanci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai et al., 2011</xref>). Given that it is very challenging to predict survival for TNBC patients after surgical resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brockwell et al., 2019</xref>), our data indicated that higher TLN1 expression could be a prognostic factor for TNBC patients. However, further validation of these findings is needed.</p><p>Our findings also highlight that TLN1 is a potential therapeutic target for TNBC. Specifically, TLN1 expression in TNBC cells is much higher than in other subtypes of breast cancer cell lines, and silencing <italic>TLN1</italic> significantly attenuated the malignancy of MDA-MB-231 cells, reducing TNBC tumour growth and lung metastasis. Mechanically, it is hypothesized to inhibit cancer metastasis through suppressing EMT. These data were consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thapa et al., 2017</xref>) and support the notion that TLN1-related signalling is crucial for TNBC malignancy.</p><p>It is well known that malignant TNBC cells can adhere to the ECM by activating integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bays and DeMali, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosch-Fortea and Martín-Belmonte, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hynes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lock et al., 2008</xref>) and the activation of integrin-related signalling promotes EMT and metastasis in TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wen et al., 2019</xref>). Major insights into TLN1 demonstrated that its ‘head’ can bind the cytoplasmic tails of integrin β through its PTB domain, resulting in integrin β activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>). This activation links integrins to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Critchley and Gingras, 2008</xref>) by activating FAK and Src and further promotes downstream PI3K/AKT signal transduction to promote cancer malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klapholz and Brown, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). In our results, TLN1 interacts with integrin β1 and silencing <italic>TLN1</italic> alters many proteins expression and significantly reduces FAs dynamic formation in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is similar to observations in fibroblasts and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kopp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nader et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, silencing <italic>TLN1</italic> was found to significantly reduce integrin β1 levels as well as the levels of phosphorylated FAK. The reduction in integrin might be a result of <italic>TLN1</italic> silencing-mediated integrin degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chinthalapudi et al., 2018</xref>). These data suggest that TLN1 is crucial for FA dynamic formation, adhesion, and invasion in TNBC cells, as well as tumour growth and metastasis. Additionally, silencing <italic>TLN1</italic> significantly attenuated AKT phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells, demonstrating the mitigation of TLN1/integrin β1 signalling in TNBC cells.</p><p>The actin cortex is a thin layer of filamentous actin that lies beneath the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Litschko et al., 2019</xref>). During EMT, actin reorganizes from a mostly cortical arrangement into stress fibres and lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalut and Paluch, 2016</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that silencing <italic>TLN1</italic> induces thickening of the actin cortex in TNBC cells, which may initiate cell surface contractile tension and result in local contractions and drive cell deformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chugh et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings indicated that loss of TLN1 led to actin redistribution, resulting in changes in membrane dynamics, and this loss may interfere with the efficient assembly or turnover of FAs, which is required for directional migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcin and Straube, 2019</xref>). Therefore, TLN1 may regulate the dynamic formation of FAs by reducing cortical actin, and then promote cell migration in TNBC cells.</p><p>In this study, for the first time, we identified a novel small-molecule compound, C67399, which blocks TLN1 binding to integrin β1, through a novel computational approach named as CSTPPI against the binding interface of TLN1 with integrin β1. The advantage of this CSTPPI is that conformational ensembles of TLN1-integrin β1 interfaces were used as targets for the computational screening via our in-housed developed docking tool. Therefore, the flexibility of protein-protein interface was given full consideration in our CSTPPI to improve the accuracy. This is the first study of identifying small-molecule compounds by targeting dynamic protein-protein binding interface and this may be extended to other PPI study. Remarkably, we found that C67399 could significantly ablate the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells and suppress the lung metastasis in vivo. These novel findings suggest that TLN1 is a promising therapeutic target and C67399 is a valuable candidate compound for TNBC intervention. C67399 is the first small-molecule inhibitor of its kind that interfere in the binding interface of TLN1 with integrin β1.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that TLN1 is significantly upregulated in TNBC cells and TLN1 interacts with integrin β1 to activate downstream signalling pathways including PI3K/AKT and FAK pathways. Furthermore, the interaction of TLN1 with integrin β1 facilitates the formation of FAs and cell adhesion, leading to the malignancy and metastasis of TNBC by enhancing EMT. Hence, TLN1 could be a valuable prognostic factor and a promising therapeutic target for TNBC. Moreover, we identified a small-molecule compound C67399 via computational screening and we demonstrated that genetically downregulating <italic>TLN1</italic> expression or blocking the binding of TLN1 with integrin β1 by C67399 could inhibit the aggressiveness and metastasis of TNBC.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Project administration, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients, and this study was approved by the institutional research ethics committee of China Medical University.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The current study was approved by the institutional research ethics committee of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University (Project identification code: 2018PS304K, date on 03/05/2018), and each participant signed an informed consent before being included in the study.

The authors used IHC on patient samples and concluded that high TLN1, but not TLN2 and other integrins expression is an independent prognostic marker for BrCa. It is important to note that TLN2/integrin expression was studied in TCGA dataset and not on the same set of samples and the conclusions on TLN2/integrins should be re-considered. The authors presented strong data on effect of TLN downregulation on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, stemness, EMT and in vivo tumor growth and metastasis. Their data suggest all aspects of tumor progression are impacted by TLN1 downregulation. Mechanistically, TLN1 downregulation impacted LATS/YAP/TAZ pathway as well as EMT proteins. The authors concluded that TLN1 silencing reduced tumor growth through Hippo/Yap signaling, which is not justified as there was no data presented, where activation of YAP/TAZ rescued stemness/tumor growth in TLN1 ablated cells. Presented data is just correlational. Same is true regarding their conclusion on EMT and Metastasis. Next, the authors confirmed the effect of TLN1 alteration on focal adhesions formation as well as other integrin signaling pathways. In the last part of the manuscript, the authors described the development and characterization of small molecule, which can inhibit interaction between beta1 integrin and TLN1. This inhibitor, C67399, affected viability, adhesion, migration, tumor growth and metastasis. However, it is important to point that all these effect on malignancy can be explained by the viability. Since cells were less viable, it is likely that non-viable cells will not adhere, migrate, form tumor or mets. This is an interesting article, but text needs to be re-worded to justify conclusions based on the data presented.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. Figure 1: To invalidate the role of TLN2/integrins, the authors should either use same patient samples with IHC for TLN2 or use TCGA for TLN1 comparisons. Considering that beta1 integrin expression is not significantly different between various subtype, would it be possible to conclude that beta1 signaling is independent of TLN1 in the subsets, where TLN1 is not amplified.</p><p>2. TNBC samples with high TLN1: are they mesenchymal type? The authors should check the correlation between TLN1/EMT/Hippo pathways, this will strengthen their hypothesis.</p><p>3. Figure 2: the conclusion that TLN1 affect stemness, needs to be supported by tumor initiation data. Is there any difference in tumor onset in figure 2E? Also, CSC are slow growing, which is in contrast to the current data, which suggest TLN1 promoted cell proliferation.</p><p>4. Figure 2: To validate the role of YAP/TAZ, the authors need to perform rescue experiment using constitutively active YAP/TAZ.</p><p>5. Figure 3: Are the effects on EMT proteins mediated by YAP/TAZ patwhays or this is an independent signaling from beta1 integrin.</p><p>6. Figure 3: Effect on TNBC cell adhesion and metastasis can be a consequence of reduced cell proliferation; the conclusions needs re-wording.</p><p>7. Figure 4: Conclusions on cell adhesion and migration should take viability into considerations. If the cells are dead, they will not adhere or migrate.</p><p>8. Figure 4J: western blots are of very poor quality. Bands were cropped too close, should show full blots. Also, inhibitors impacted the expression of beta1 integrin (4I), it will be hard to conclude that reduced association is not due to reduced expression.</p><p>9. To further strengthens the conclusion, it is suggested to include cell lines from non-TNBC subtype or normal epithelial in some of their experiments as a control.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The article started with bioinformatic and pathological analysis of TCGA and/or breast cancer tissues related to focal adhesion molecules and identified talin-1 (TLN-1) as a worse prognostic marker in breast cancer in particular TNBC. Talin is known to be a component within focal adhesion and binds to the intracellular tail of integrins. Using shRNA-based silencing of TLN-1, the group found that TLN-1 is important in promoting different properties of TNBC cells – including the cell cycle progression, migration/invasion, and cancer-stem cell properties – by reducing integrin-β-mediated intracellular signaling transduction. Most importantly the group found that silencing TLN-1 reduces both primary tumor growth and metastasis, supporting the critical role of TLN-1 in TNBC progression. Using computer-based screening/docking approach, the group further identified the interface blocker compound C67399 that can interfere with the interaction between TLN-1 and integrin and reduce tumor growth and metastasis. The article is well-formulated in general to articulate the critical and new roles of TLN-1 in TNBC and the small inhibitor has potential for further translational studies.</p><p>This is in general well-written article that may generate interest in developing TLN-1/integrin inhibitors for TNBC therapy. At the current stages, however, there are some major concerns related to the evidence that can fully support the claims.</p><p>1) The justification for TNBC is not supported by the data. Both TNBC and luminal cancer have &gt; 40% positivity and overall DFS showed trend of poor prognosis. The Figure 1D for TNBC DFS should be removed. With such limited number (n=12 low 16 high), I don't think the statistics mean much and only one outlier will damage the statistics.</p><p>2) The claims about cancer stem cells are not necessary nor sufficiently supported. Cancer stem cells should be based on in vivo experiments rather than in vitro experiments to look at serial dilutions (cancer forming efficiency) in mouse and calculate tumor forming efficiency. Mammosphere is not accurate assay for cancer stem cell activity, nor CD24 and CD44 double staining. The spheroid structures are not mammospheres (real mammospheres should have compact morphology and nicely arranged ball like structures). Figure 2G looks like more of cell aggregate. The numbers are ranging from 4-7 and there is no description of any related methods anywhere in the article.</p><p>3) All the IP experiments are critical to show the interaction between TLN1 and integrin beta1, but most of these western blotting showed very fuzzy bands that could be just non-specific protein blotting, including Figure 4A; Figure 5J.</p><p>4) The quality of immune fluorescence in Figure 4 is in very poor quality and it doesn't seem like a co-focal image. There is no visible co-localization based Figure 4B.</p><p>5) Figure 4C looks like stress fiber formation after TLN1 is reduced. Rho family GTPases should be checked for activity.</p><p>6) shRNA to TLN1 did not show signs of cell death, and yet there is significant reduction in cell viability by the C67399. This raises the question of specificity. C67399 should be used to treat shRNA expressing cells for viability to confirm whether this is on target effect. The same goes to animal studies. This is the biggest issue of this paper to claim the effect of C67399 is through TLN1. The interruption of TLN1 and integrin-b1 is not significant in Figure 6J. There is no explanation why the inhibitor will reduce integrin-b1 expression. There is no biological experiments to show whether C67399 has any effect on TLN1-null or silenced cells.</p><p>7) There is no other critical control for the impact of C67399 on different integrins. There are quite several integrin inhibitors available. There are also antibodies that can detect activated integrins. To the least, the paper should address whether C67399 has direct impact on integrin activity and should be compared with other integrin inhibitors for different effect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors present here a manuscript detailing the effect of TLN1 gene silencing in breast cancer, and its effects on tumour biology and growth. The authors utilize a combination of in vitro assays and animal models of breast cancer (although limited in number). Further, they expand their efforts using an in-silico analysis of a large drug library to identify a lead compound that can impair TLN1 gene function (with integrin β 1) and provide preliminary evidence of its utility to affect TNBC cell and tumour growth.</p><p>The data are well presented, however the manuscript (in its current form) requires more detail to support their hypotheses and conclusions; specifically, in terms of expanded methodology, grammatical review, reanalysis of tumour growth rate, and an increased volume of cell line and patient data that can better delineate whether TLN1 is truly overrepresented in TNBC (compared to other molecular subtypes, or TNBC subtypes), and whether TLN1 biology is similar amongst these subtypes (which would increase the relevance of this paper), or if it is selective to TNBC (which would still be of importance as this is aggressive class of breast cancer with limited therapeutic options).</p><p>To bolster the strength of this manuscript, please consider the following:</p><p>Figure 1A Only 3 of 26 known integrin genes were involved in the analysis. This makes the current finding vague and low powered. Consider expanding the analysis to all 26 integrin genes, since the data should be available in publicly accessible gene expression data sets. Would be of interest to correlate gene expression with, not only molecular subclasses, but also survival metrics including relapse-free, distant metastasis and overall survival. Further, combining TLN1+/- expression with various segregation of integrin expression may yield supportive data.</p><p>Figure 1C Only 4 TNBC samples used for validation; no other breast cancer subtypes. Expand to be more inclusive of ER+ and HER2+ tumours.</p><p>Figure 1D Please show DFS in all molecular subclasses (ER+ and HER2+) of breast cancer. Provide insight into whether this is a TNBC-only phenomenon, or potentially similarly effective in all subclasses. Without this, it is not clear why the Authors would be selective only for TNBC.</p><p>Sup Figure 1A. Does TLN2 mRNA similarly stratify DFS in all breast cancer molecular subtypes, as TLN1 does? Again, without this data it is not clear why the Authors would be selective only for TLN1, and also TNBC.</p><p>Figure 2 Should incorporate a more extensive panel of breast cancer cell lines. Only 4 are shown which severely limits the correlation that TLN1 is overrepresented in TNBC. Expand panel to include at least 10 TNBC and minimum 5 ER+ and 5 HER2+ cell lines. Potentially also include mRNA gene expression within cell lines and their molecular subtypes (see Neve et al., 2006; accessible through http://co.bmc.lu.se/gobo/); which does seem to suggest TLN1 overexpression in TNBC in a panel of 50+ cell lines. A further point would be to stratify TLN1 expression across subtypes of TNBC according to Lehman et al., 2011; (https://www.jci.org/articles/view/45014). IS TLN1 predominantly expressed in TNBC subtypes that are more mesenchymal (and that inherently have a more &quot;stem-like&quot; phenotype). A better understanding of the background of where TLN1 is overexpressed will improve this manuscript, in terms of its relevance and importance.</p><p>Figure 2E a statistical evaluation of tumour growth rates should be performed using regression analysis, and not measured based on tumour volume size between groups at each time point. It is important to establish that the loss of TLN1 leads to a reduction in tumour growth rate, and not just tumour size at independent time points (as this could be affected by differences in tumour inoculation). What about spontaneous lung metastasis?</p><p>Figure 2. What are the effects of TLN1 silencing in other TLN1+ TNBC cell lines (or ER+ cell lines?) Are similar effects observed in cell-cycle, growth, and stem-like properties. As 231 cells are largely all &quot;stem like&quot;, it would be important to assess this in other cell lines where &quot;stem-like&quot; phenotype is less extensive.</p><p>Figure 2. Does restoration of Hippo/Yap signalling pathway lead functionally restore TLN1-mediated growth inhibition in TNBC cell lines?</p><p>Figure 3 Effect on lung metastasis could just be due to reduced growth rate of modified 231 cell lines. Very little information is given in this manuscript about the experimental tail vein experiment shown in Figure 3E. How many cells were inoculated into the tail vein? How long did the experiment go for? Was routine bioluminescent imaging performed so that a true evaluation of metastatic growth rate could be determined? Do lung metastases form in animals inoculated with 231-shRNA-TLN1? If they didn't, can the experiment be extended until they do? A Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of time to metastasis combined with bioluminescent imaging is the gold standard for experimental lung metastasis assays. Without it, no inference on metastasis can be made (and is also there is no data on metastasis shown from the orthotopically-implanted animal experiment in Figure 2). Please clarify.</p><p>Figure 4 Does TLN1 biology (interactions with beta1 integrin) similarly occur in ER+ breast cancer, or other TNBC cell lines? Does it lead to similar effects on cell localization and changes in phosphor AKT, FAK, etc? Or is it a specific TNBC effect?</p><p>Figure 5 Does C67399 similarly affect cell stemness by flowcytometry with CD24/CD44 or ALDH1+? Does it affect mammosphere formation? Does C67399 similarly affect YAP/TAZ/Oct4 signalling? Or is it just killing cancer cells, with no link to stemlike actions of TLN1? What are the effects of C67399 in vitro in TLN1 negative breast cancer cell lines?</p><p>Figure 6 Please separate out the results of the two animal experiments; it is unclear whether the lung metastasis is spontaneous (from the mammary gland injected cancer cells), or from the experimental metastasis tail vein assay. Again, the details for the experimental metastasis tail vein assay are lacking, please see my comments above. Since TLN1 is associated with chemosensitivity, would a combination of C67399 with standard of care chemotherapy drugs be more effective in the in vivo studies? Is C67399 similarly effective on TNBC xenografts (and/or other molecular subtypes of breast cancer) that do not express TLN1?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68481.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors established TLN1 as a potential therapeutic target for triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive subtype, with very few treatment options.

TLN1 is expressed in almost all tissues, while TLN2 is usually expressed mainly in the heart, brain, testis and muscle (23266827; 19220457). TLNs are located in a complex between adherent cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM) and regulate integrative and adhesive signaling. Previous analysis revealed that TLN1 wast the most highly expressed integrin cytoskeleton cross-linker that can trigger integrin activation (21547905). TLN1 overexpression promotes tumor invasion and metastasis via focal adhesion (20160039). A key event is binding to the integrin β cytoplasmic tail by TLN (14526080; 17627302; 18086863), a 270 kDa protein (capable of forming homodimers) with an N-terminal head domain (comprising F0, F1, F2, and F3 subdomains) and a C-terminal rod domain that binds to vinculin and actin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/emboj.2009.287#embj2009287-bib-0016">18434644</ext-link>). Binding of the F3 domain to integrin β tails is sufficient for integrin activation (11932255), although other head domains contribute to activation (18165225). Furthermore, TLN1 phosphorylation activates β1 integrins to promote prostate cancer bone metastasis (24793790).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1.

We would like to comment on this from two folds. (1). We first compare the AA sequence of F3 domain ring-region between TLN1 and TLN2. Please see the superimposition <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, (TLN1: aa 324-370; TLN2: aa 327-373).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68481-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Moreover, please see a more detailed superimposition between TLN1 and TLN2 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> (Sci Rep. 2017;7:41989),</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68481-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Therefore, we conclude that there is a rather significant difference between F3 domain ring-region of TLN1 and TLN2, where beta1 integrin interacts with TLN subtypes. We agree with the referee that it is possible that beta1 signaling is independent of TLN1 in the subsets, where TLN1 is not amplified. (2). Next, we compute and examine the binding affinities of C67399 small-molecule compound with TLN1 and TLN2, respectively. Our calculation results implicate that c67399 small-molecule compound binds more strongly with TLN1 F3 domain as compared to the binding with TLN2 F3 domain. Noteworthy, there is a nearly 1kal/mol energy difference (corresponding to more than 10-fold in terms of binding constant) and therefore c67399 small-molecule compound selectively binds with TLN1 F3 domain. Moreover, our results suggest that c67399 small-molecule might be a selective inhibitor which interrupts the interaction of TLN1 F3 domain with beta1 integrin.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68481-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Furthermore, although the expression of integrin β1 is not significantly different between various subtype, the correlation between TLN1 and integrin β1 by GEPIA showed a significant positive correlation (p&lt;0.01, R=0.34).

We are not sure if all TNBC samples used in IHC are of the mesenchymal types. However, it has been shown that the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway is upregulated in TNBC mesenchymal types, that this subtype has higher expression of JAK1 and IL6, which are important drivers of JAK/STAT3 activation, and that activation or tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3) gene signature scores (26234940) are higher in mesenchymal types than in other subtypes. Therefore, we analyzed the correlation of TLN1 with key regulators in the JAK/STAT3 pathway by GEPIA (gene expression profiling interactive analysis, http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/) and found that TLN1 was positively correlated with JAK1, IL6 and STAT3 were positively correlated (p&lt;0.01 for all, R=0.23 for JAK1 and STAT3, and R=0.1 for IL6), suggesting that TLN1 high expression is largely a TNBC mesenchymal type.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68481-sa2-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In addition, we also analyzed the correlation between TLN1 and key regulators in the EMT/Hippo pathway with the help of GEPIA, and found that TLN1 was negatively correlated with CDH1 (p&lt;0.01, R=-0.11), positively correlated with CDH2 (p=0.12, R=0.048), VIM (p&lt;0.01, R=0.51), VCL(p&lt;0.01, R=0.31) and SNAI1 (p&lt;0.01, R=0.27). Moreover, TLN1 was positive correlation with YAP1 (p&lt;0.01, R=0.28) and TAZ (p&lt;0.01, R=0.17), thus indicating the positive correlation of TLN1 with EMT/Hippo pathway.

In addition, stem cells grow rapidly in specific stem cell medium, which is enriched with cytokines that maintain stem cell growth, and our current data show a significant downregulation of the proportion of CD44+CD24- CSCs after knockdown of TLN1 and a slowed proliferation and reduced sphere-forming ability in stem cell medium.

The effects of EMT proteins have been reported in the literature to be regulated both by YAP1/TAZ patwhays (31927328, 33421513) and by integrin β1 (27836001). YAP1/TAZ proteins can then receive regulatory input from tight junctions and polar complexes, as well as proteins from adherens junctions (22075429). In this study, we focus on the fact that TLN1 binding to integrin β1 activates both focal adhesion to regulate cell-ECM adhesion and integrin downstream signaling pathways, as well as cell-cell contacts, ultimately leading to cell migration and tumor metastasis in concert.

With such limited number (n=12 low 16 high), I don't think the statistics mean much and only one outlier will damage the statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the referee for the critical comments. Triple-negative breast cancer lacks effective targets, while hormone receptor-positive breast cancer has anti-endocrine therapeutic targets, so we prioritize the study of triple-negative breast cancer. To strengthen the credibility of the data, we expanded the cases of triple-negative breast cancer to 171 cases and statistically found that TLN1 in TNBC still showed a poor survival prognosis (Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The claims about cancer stem cells are not necessary nor sufficiently supported. Cancer stem cells should be based on in vivo experiments rather than in vitro experiments to look at serial dilutions (cancer forming efficiency) in mouse and calculate tumor forming efficiency. Mammosphere is not accurate assay for cancer stem cell activity, nor CD24 and CD44 double staining. The spheroid structures are not mammospheres (real mammospheres should have compact morphology and nicely arranged ball like structures). Figure 2G looks like more of cell aggregate. The numbers are ranging from 4-7 and there is no description of any related methods anywhere in the article.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the referee for the critical comments. After taking into account the referee' s suggestions, we decided to remove the cancer stem cell content, including mammospheres and double staining for CD24 and CD44.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) All the IP experiments are critical to show the interaction between TLN1 and integrin beta1, but most of these western blotting showed very fuzzy bands that could be just non-specific protein blotting, including Figure 4A; Figure 5J.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the referee for the critical comments. Since IP is essential to show the interaction between TLN1 and integrin β1, we supplementally show the full membrane results of all IP experiments, including Figure 4A and Figure 5J (Figure 4-source data 1 and Figure 5-source data 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The quality of immune fluorescence in Figure 4 is in very poor quality and it doesn't seem like a co-focal image. There is no visible co-localization based Figure 4B.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the referee for the critical comments. Per the referee’s comment, we re-conduncted the staining and showed new confocal results in Figure 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4C looks like stress fiber formation after TLN1 is reduced. Rho family GTPases should be checked for activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the referee for the critical comments. The reduction of stress fibers after TLN1 knockdown is consistent with previous literature descriptions (32273388, 27043085), but Rho family GTPases and stress fibers are not the argument of interest in this study, we are more concerned with the effect on focal adhesion after TLN1 knockdown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) shRNA to TLN1 did not show signs of cell death, and yet there is significant reduction in cell viability by the C67399. This raises the question of specificity. C67399 should be used to treat shRNA expressing cells for viability to confirm whether this is on target effect. The same goes to animal studies. This is the biggest issue of this paper to claim the effect of C67399 is through TLN1. The interruption of TLN1 and integrin-b1 is not significant in Figure 6J. There is no explanation why the inhibitor will reduce integrin-b1 expression. There is no biological experiments to show whether C67399 has any effect on TLN1-null or silenced cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the referee for the critical comments. Figure 2C-F and shows that shTLN1 affects cell proliferation ability, apoptosis and tumor grouth, while C67399 causes a significant decrease in cell viability, indicating that C67399 is able to inhibit TLN1 expression exerting an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. In Fig5J, C67399 was able to inhibit the expression of TLN1, while TLN1 was able to affect the expression of intergrin β1, so C67399 inhibited the expression of intergrin β1. For TNBC cells that do not express TLN1, C67399 did not have a significant inhibitory effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There is no other critical control for the impact of C67399 on different integrins. There are quite several integrin inhibitors available. There are also antibodies that can detect activated integrins. To the least, the paper should address whether C67399 has direct impact on integrin activity and should be compared with other integrin inhibitors for different effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the referee for the critical comments. As added in the Discussion section, C67399, an inhibitor against TLN1-integrin β1 in this study, showed inhibition of TLN1 and thus tumor growth and metastasis, and it has been reported in the literature that TLN1 phosphorylation activates integrin β1 to promote bone metastasis in prostate cancer (24793790). However, the inhibition of TLN1 phosphorylation and activation of integrin b1 by C67399 is not known.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors present here a manuscript detailing the effect of TLN1 gene silencing in breast cancer, and its effects on tumour biology and growth. The authors utilize a combination of in vitro assays and animal models of breast cancer (although limited in number). Further, they expand their efforts using an in-silico analysis of a large drug library to identify a lead compound that can impair TLN1 gene function (with integrin β 1) and provide preliminary evidence of its utility to affect TNBC cell and tumour growth.</p><p>The data are well presented, however the manuscript (in its current form) requires more detail to support their hypotheses and conclusions; specifically, in terms of expanded methodology, grammatical review, reanalysis of tumour growth rate, and an increased volume of cell line and patient data that can better delineate whether TLN1 is truly overrepresented in TNBC (compared to other molecular subtypes, or TNBC subtypes), and whether TLN1 biology is similar amongst these subtypes (which would increase the relevance of this paper), or if it is selective to TNBC (which would still be of importance as this is aggressive class of breast cancer with limited therapeutic options).</p><p>To bolster the strength of this manuscript, please consider the following:</p><p>Figure 1A Only 3 of 26 known integrin genes were involved in the analysis. This makes the current finding vague and low powered. Consider expanding the analysis to all 26 integrin genes, since the data should be available in publicly accessible gene expression data sets. Would be of interest to correlate gene expression with, not only molecular subclasses, but also survival metrics including relapse-free, distant metastasis and overall survival. Further, combining TLN1+/- expression with various segregation of integrin expression may yield supportive data.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for the helpful and critical comments.

Only 4 are shown which severely limits the correlation that TLN1 is overrepresented in TNBC. Expand panel to include at least 10 TNBC and minimum 5 ER+ and 5 HER2+ cell lines. Potentially also include mRNA gene expression within cell lines and their molecular subtypes (see Neve et al., 2006; accessible through http://co.bmc.lu.se/gobo/); which does seem to suggest TLN1 overexpression in TNBC in a panel of 50+ cell lines. A further point would be to stratify TLN1 expression across subtypes of TNBC according to Lehman et al., 2011; (https://www.jci.org/articles/view/45014). IS TLN1 predominantly expressed in TNBC subtypes that are more mesenchymal (and that inherently have a more &quot;stem-like&quot; phenotype).

Very little information is given in this manuscript about the experimental tail vein experiment shown in Figure 3E. How many cells were inoculated into the tail vein? How long did the experiment go for? Was routine bioluminescent imaging performed so that a true evaluation of metastatic growth rate could be determined? Do lung metastases form in animals inoculated with 231-shRNA-TLN1? If they didn't, can the experiment be extended until they do? A Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of time to metastasis combined with bioluminescent imaging is the gold standard for experimental lung metastasis assays. Without it, no inference on metastasis can be made (and is also there is no data on metastasis shown from the orthotopically-implanted animal experiment in Figure 2). Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the referee for the critical comments. To rule out that the effect on lung metastasis was only due to the reduced growth rate of the modified 231 cell line, in this manuscript we used tail vein alone experiments to see if knockdown of TLN1 affects lung metastasis, with specific methods added to the methodology. Bioluminescence imaging was not performed in this study, so that lung metastasis could only be determined after final execution of the sampling. Due to the rapid growth of submammary fat pad inoculated MDA-MB-231 cells, it was too late to observe spontaneous lung metastasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 Does TLN1 biology (interactions with beta1 integrin) similarly occur in ER+ breast cancer, or other TNBC cell lines?
