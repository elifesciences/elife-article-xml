However, the extent of mRNA transfer at the transcriptome-wide level (the ‘transferome’) is unknown. Here, we analyzed the transferome in an in vitro human-mouse cell co-culture model using RNA-sequencing. We found that mRNA transfer is non-selective, prevalent across the human transcriptome, and that the amount of transfer to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) strongly correlates with the endogenous level of gene expression in donor human breast cancer cells. Typically,&lt;1% of endogenous mRNAs undergo transfer. Non-selective, expression-dependent RNA transfer was further validated using synthetic reporters. RNA transfer appears contact-dependent via TNTs, as exemplified for several mRNAs. Notably, significant differential changes in the native MEF transcriptome were observed in response to co-culture, including the upregulation of multiple cancer and cancer-associated fibroblast-related genes and pathways. Together, these results lead us to suggest that TNT-mediated RNA transfer could be a phenomenon of physiological importance under both normal and pathogenic conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell-cell RNA transfer</kwd><kwd>tunneling nanotubes</kwd><kwd>RNA trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1461-412.13/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landthaler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerst</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>US-Israel Binational Science Foundation-National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015846</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singer</surname><given-names>Robert H</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerst</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Joel and Mady Dukler Fund for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerst</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jean-Jacques Brunschwig Fund for the Molecular Genetics of Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerst</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Moross Integrated Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerst</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kekst Family Institute for Medical Genetics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerst</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The RNA transferome comprises full-length mRNAs and lncRNAs that undergo non-selective and expression-dependent transfer between mammalian cells in culture via actin-based tunneling nanotubes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA molecules can act as mediators of intercellular communication in plants and animals during normal growth and development, as well as different pathologies such as viral infections or cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dreux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Haimovich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">O’Brien et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ramachandran and Palanisamy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>). Although initial evidence of the intercellular transfer of RNA was found in the early 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kolodny, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kolodny, 1972</xref>), the mechanism of transfer gained attention much later. The prevalent mechanism by which RNAs are thought to be transferred is through extracellular vesicles (EVs), which include apoptotic bodies, microvesicles and exosomes. Best studied are exosomes, which are vesicles of endocytic origin with sizes ranging from 40 to 100 nm and can transfer information in the form of proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">O’Brien et al., 2020</xref>). Released by numerous cell types (e.g. immune cells, neuronal and cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mittelbrunn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>), they are secreted into extracellular media and body fluids (e.g. saliva, blood plasma, breast milk, and urine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zhang et al., 2019b</xref>). Profiling of their RNA content using DNA microarrays or RNA sequencing has revealed that while multiple species of RNAs are present in exosomes (e.g. snoRNA, siRNA, Y-RNA, lncRNA, and vault RNA), work has mainly focused on microRNAs (miRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>). Exosomes have also been suggested to transfer mRNA (or at least fragments of mRNA). One report found that GFP mRNA in exosomes was taken up by a colon cancer cell line and translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). However, exosomes may not be the sole agent by which RNAs transfer from one cell to another. In fact, multiple studies show that only small sized RNAs (e.g. miRs) and fragments of mRNA are likely to be enriched in the exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Batagov and Kurochkin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pérez-Boza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, exosomes may not be the preferred mode of full-length mRNA transport between cells. Interestingly, ARC and PEG10 mRNAs encode proteins that can form retroviral-like capsids and package their own mRNAs for transfer to neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pastuzyn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Segel et al., 2021</xref>). However, this form of transfer is probably limited to a small set of mRNAs encoding retroviral-like capsid proteins.</p><p>Our lab has shown that full-length messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules can transfer between mammalian cells, but do so via tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haimovich and Gerst, 2019</xref>). TNTs are cytoplasmic connections extending between cells that are thinner and longer than other dynamic cellular protrusions, such as lamellipodia and filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cordero Cervantes and Zurzolo, 2021</xref>). TNTs have been shown to differ significantly from filopodia in both actin architecture and overall structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Korenkova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ljubojevic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sartori-Rupp et al., 2019</xref>).

TNTs have been reported to be involved in a multitude of biological processes, such as stem cell differentiation, immune response, and neurodegenerative diseases, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abounit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Reichert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). TNT-mediated RNA transfer has been demonstrated in only a few physiological contexts (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Haimovich et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to our work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haimovich and Gerst, 2019</xref>), published RNA-sequencing data and qPCR analysis were used to detect exosome-independent transfer of keratinocyte-specific mRNAs to Langerhans cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Su and Igyártó, 2019</xref>), and GFP and GNAT1 mRNAs were shown to transfer in vivo in a photoreceptor transplantation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ortin-Martinez et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we used a simple 2D co-culture model of donor and acceptor cells along with single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) to quantitatively study TNT-mediated mRNA transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haimovich and Gerst, 2019</xref>). Using this approach, we found that several full-length endogenous or ectopically expressed mRNAs undergo intercellular transfer between a variety of cell types, including immortalized cells, primary cells, and even human-mouse cell co-cultures. While the level of transfer was often &lt;1% of the endogenously expressed message in donor cells, the most abundantly transferred mRNA was that of β-actin mRNA, which transferred at a level of up to 5% in some experiments. Initial analyses showed that transfer is influenced by the identity of the donor cell, by the expression level of the RNA in donor cells and by stress conditions. We further found that the transfer of mRNAs is inhibited by both cytoskeletal and small GTPase inhibitors, as well as by the binding of multiple MS2 coat proteins (MCPs) to a 24xMS2 stem-loop aptamer sequence in the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>). Inhibition by the MS2 system could be explained by extensive MCP binding and hindrance to transfer or by interference with a yet-to-be-identified protein that may coat the transferred mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haimovich and Gerst, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used human MCF7 breast cancer cell-line and immortalized mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells grown in co-culture to define the extent of the RNA transferome and the effect of co-culture upon the native transcriptome in vitro. By employing deep sequencing, we found that nearly all mRNAs transfer and in a manner that strongly correlates with the donor cell expression level. Moreover, by increasing gene expression using reporter mRNAs we could verify that increased expression results in increased transfer. Similar to our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>), the overall level of transfer was found to be &lt;1% of the expression level in the donor cells and was dependent upon cell-cell contact. To explore the mechanism of mRNA transfer, we used two approaches aimed at identifying <italic>cis</italic> RNA elements that might be required. First, we searched for previously identified EV-targeting motifs or novel unique elements present in transferred RNAs using bioinformatics and second, we fused short segments of β-actin mRNA to a reporter mRNA to test if they were able to increase transfer. However, neither approach revealed the presence of an element that enhances RNA transfer, indicating that the process is inherently non-selective. We used imaging and a Transwell-like system (<italic>i.e</italic>. quadrapod), to show that RNA transfer is likely to be contact-dependent via TNTs, as shown for a few example mRNAs. Lastly, we detected significant differential changes in the native transcriptome of the MEF cells in response to co-culture with MCF7 cells, including the upregulation of multiple cancer- and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-related genes and pathways. Together, these results lead us to suggest TNT-mediated RNA transfer could be a phenomenon of physiological importance under both normal and pathogenic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An antigen-based cell sorting method to separate human and mouse cells after co-culture</title><p>In order to study genome-wide RNA transfer, it is essential to separate the two cell types after co-culture and prior to RNA extraction and downstream analysis (schematic shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We previously demonstrated using smFISH that up to 2% of β-actin mRNA (<italic>e.g</italic>. ~30 copies/cell) can undergo transfer from MEFs to human MCF7 cells within 12 hr of co-culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dasgupta and Gerst, 2020</xref>). As in that study, here we used mouse MEFs tagged with 24 repeats of the MS2 coat protein (MCP)-binding sequence (MBS) between the ORF and 3′ UTR of both endogenous alleles of β-actin (referred to hereafter as ‘MBS-MEFs’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haimovich and Gerst, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lionnet et al., 2011</xref>) and human MCF7 cells. MCF7 cells specifically express a cell surface molecule, CD326 or Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM). Thus, we employed magnetic beads conjugated to anti-CD326 antibodies in order to separate heterologous cell populations of MBS-MEF and MCF7 cells to a high degree of purity. It is critical to have complete cell separation (~100%), since even a small contamination (e.g. 0.1–0.3%) of donor cells in the isolated acceptor cells can lead to a high background relative to the transferred RNA signal, particularly when the level of RNA transfer is expected to be low. To eliminate background signals originating from incomplete cell separation, we compared our co-culture samples to MEFs and MCF7 single cultures that were grown separately, harvested, mixed after cell harvest, and immediately separated (referred to hereafter as the ‘Mix’). Singlecell cultures were used as controls to determine endogenous gene expression levels before co-culture, as well as to eliminate background signals originating from downstream RNA sequencing procedures. Once separated, we checked the efficiency of cell sorting from the Co-culture, Mix, and Single cell culture samples by flow cytometry. Based on the purity of human and mouse cell fractions, as determined by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we found that the mouse MEF-enriched fractions were much better sorted, as compared to the human MCF7 cell-enriched fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 -table 1</xref>). We found that the MEF population was essentially free from MCF7 cells in both the Co-culture (0%) and Mix-derived populations (0.025% on average), whereas the MCF7 fractions contained an average of 0.035% MEFs from the Co-culture samples and an average of 0.22% MEFs from the Mix samples, after sorting.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Affinity purification of single populations of MCF7 and MEF cells following mix/co-culture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the magnetic bead-based sorting and RNA sequencing to identify mRNAs transferred between two cell types.

Following the trimming of adaptors and filtering for low-quality reads, the reads were aligned to human reference genomes. Reads that were paired-end and showed unique alignment with human genome were again realigned with mouse reference genome to discard genes with 100% homology. The resulting clean human reads were finally identified based on status of alignment of ends and mismatches with human and mouse genomes.

We first considered how to treat the raw reads with respect to the length and type of fragment (e.g. single or paired-ends) to obtain the best results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Due to regions with a high degree of homology between the human and mouse transcriptomes, using sub-optimal length reads may lead to the mapping of human reads to the mouse genome and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Based on a previous in silico simulation of mapping 25, 50, 75, and 100 bp long single- and paired-end reads from the human transcriptome to the mouse transcriptome, we observed that short (25 bp), single-end reads have a very high (&gt;85%) non-specific alignment with the mouse genome, which was drastically reduced by using longer (&gt;100 bp) and paired-end reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dasgupta and Gerst, 2020</xref>). We also noted that using suboptimal sequencing depth (i.e. &lt;25 million reads per sample) can lead to missing rare transcripts (data not shown). Hence, we chose to sequence the samples to obtain maximal depth (e.g. &gt;100 million reads per sample) and using 2x150 base-pair paired-end reads. We obtained between 94–281 million reads per sample at an average of 168 million paired-end reads per sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 1</xref>). Between 90–92% of the reads were uniquely aligned to the respective reference genomes, which is an indicative of the high quality of library preparation and it was either at par or better than typical unique alignment rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mortazavi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sarantopoulou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). More than 14,000 mouse and 16,000 human genes were annotated to their respective RefSeq database. Such high depths of sequencing ensure that low levels of mRNA transfer could be detected.</p><p>Initial analysis of mouse-derived RNA in the human transcriptome revealed that more mouse RNA was present in MCF7 cells obtained from the Mix than from MCF7 cells in Co-culture (the percentage of unique mouse-aligned reads in the Mix samples was actually greater than that of the Co-culture; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 1</xref>). This result is probably due to the high level of MBS-MEF contamination (e.g. 0.17–0.27%) in the Mix samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 - table 1</xref>). In contrast, the level of human MCF7 cell contamination in the MEF fraction was very low in the Mix (<underline>&lt;</underline>0.05%; e.g<italic>.</italic> 0% in one replica and 0.05% in the second replica) and essentially absent in the Co-culture samples (e.g. 0% in both replicas). In addition, we found small sub-populations of double-stained and unstained cells within the purified populations that we suspect are mostly MEFs (see Materials and methods). These sub-populations were greater in the replicas of Mix-derived MEFs vs. the Co-culture-derived MEFs (i.e. 0.08% and 0.03% double-stained, and 2.8% and 2.67% unstained in Mix samples vs. 0% and 0.03% double-stained, and 1% and 1.9% unstained in the Co-culture samples). As a consequence, if these double-stained and unstained cells had contributed to the background of human reads in the MEFs, we would have expected to have many more human reads in the Mix-derived MEFs. However, the percentage of unique human-aligned reads in Co-culture samples (versus the Mix samples) was substantially greater (e.g.~1.55% [1.71% and 1.39%] versus 1.13% [1.11% and 1.15%]), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 1</xref>). This difference becomes more apparent after subtraction of the background (arising from library preparation and RNA sequencing), which is reflected in the single culture MEF-enriched samples and constituted 1.055% (e.g. 1.04 and 1.07% for both replicas). Thus, the true proportion of unique human reads in the Mix versus the Co-culture samples was 0.075% and 0.495%, respectively, giving a read ratio that was 6.6-fold higher for MEFs in Co-culture versus MEFs in the Mix. The background in the single cell mouse cultures likely arises from index hopping, due to the use of single-index adaptors in library preparation and next generation sequencing, which leads to read misalignment.</p><p>Given the high degree of purity of the MEF cell population after co-culture and sorting, we focused only on human RNAs present in the mouse-derived transcriptome samples (i.e. human-to-mouse RNA transfer). In total, 10,566 transcripts of human genes were detected in Co-culture-derived or Mix-derived mouse-enriched samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 2</xref>). Of those, 7,504 genes had RPM counts of more than 10 in both co-culture replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 2</xref>), of which 7501 genes had a fold-change (FC) of &gt;1 (<italic>i.e</italic>. more reads in the Co-culture vs Mix), and 6827 genes had FC of <underline>&gt;</underline>2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 2</xref>). As a positive control for the experiment, we first confirmed the transfer of human β-actin mRNA by both RT-PCR and qRT-PCR of the mouse-derived RNA using human β-actin-specific primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, respectively). Both detection methods revealed a significant enrichment of human β-actin mRNA in the MBS-MEFs after co-culture.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Analysis of human RNAs present in mouse-enriched fractions and identification of transferred mRNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat map analysis showing the transferred human RNA in mouse samples.

Principal Component Analysis of these samples indicated that Co-culture samples have a similar profile of human-aligned genes and were different from control Mix and Single culture samples, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Note that the difference between the two Co-culture samples on the Y-axis shows a small variation of 6.7%. This difference likely results from small differences in the individual Co-culture samples (as such differences are often observed within replicas of RNA-seq experiments) and not via large differences in the measured transferomes. This indicates that the Co-culture samples were quite similar overall. The number of cross-species reads is expected to be higher in Co-culture samples (due to the transfer of RNAs) than Mix samples (assuming the number of residual cells after sorting is similar). Comparison of the results from two biological replicates of Co-culture, Mix and Single culture samples revealed that most transcripts of human genes are able to transfer to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 2</xref>).</p><p>As RNAs from most human genes are transferred, the distribution of these RNAs in the mouse cells is globally shifted to the right, <italic>i.e</italic>. the average number of reads per human gene in mouse samples is much higher in Co-culture samples as compared to the Mix samples (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001 for all genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). By employing a single-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, we found that 283 mRNAs robustly transferred from human (MCF7) cells to mouse (MBS-MEF) cells with a fold-change of more than 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 3</xref>). Many of the identified mRNAs included cytoskeletal components (ACTB, ACTG), translation factors (EEF1A1, EEF2), ribosomal proteins (RPL8, RPL4, RPL7) and other ‘housekeeping’ genes (GAPDH, PABPC1). Among this group we also identified mRNAs encoding multiple types of keratins (e.g. KRT8, 18, 19, and 80), similar to those reported to transfer from keratinocytes to epidermal-resident Langerhans cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Su and Igyártó, 2019</xref>). It should be noted that this statistical test is underpowered due to the low number of replicates and, hence, likely underestimates the number of mRNAs undergoing robust transfer. Essentially, these 283 genes represent the most abundantly transferred mRNAs in terms of absolute number. We note that amongst the 7 endogenously expressed mRNAs previously shown by us to transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>), only ACTB and CCND1 underwent robust transfer. This may also be due to the lower endogenous expression levels of these genes (e.g. BRCA1 [3252 RPM], HER2/ERBB2 [25,690 RPM], MITF [436 RPM], MT2A [4383 RPM] and SERP2 [undetected]) in MCF7 cells in comparison to CCND1 (108670 RPM) or ACTB (320214 RPM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 4</xref>). Indeed, BRCA1 and ERBB2 gene expression levels in MCF7 cells are respectively 1.5-fold and ~45-fold lower than in the HEK293 and SKBR3 cells (Human Protein Atlas; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>) in which we already observed low levels of transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>). This further implies that low gene expression can affect the detection of transfer of these mRNAs by RNA-seq.</p><p>Since the 283 abundantly transferred mRNAs were endogenously expressed at high levels in MCF7 cells, we wondered if transfer is dependent upon the level of expression. To determine if the level of mRNA transfer correlates with endogenous RNA expression in donor cells, we performed linear regression analysis of the human reads found in Co-culture samples with those of the Mix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and in human Single cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Human reads from the MEF-enriched fraction of the ‘Mix’ sample can be attributed to the residual presence of MCF7 cells after magnetic bead sorting, whereas those in MCF7 single cultures are representative of the initial mRNA expression levels prior to co-culture. We found that the number of transferred human RNAs strongly correlated with their expression levels (Pearson and Spearman coefficients &gt;0.9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), most falling within the 99% confidence interval of the regression. This indicates that the level of gene expression prior to co-culture can be a dominant predictor of RNA transfer. A similar correlation is also seen between the level of transferred human RNAs and their endogenous expression in MCF7 cells after co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This is in agreement with our previous observation, which showed that the transfer of MS2-tagged human Cyclin D1 (CCND1-MBS) mRNA from HEK293 cells to MEFs is enhanced upon increased gene expression in the donor cells (i.e. using a stronger promoter). Likewise, a strong correlation was observed between ACTB-MBS expression levels and ACTB-MBS mRNA transfer when comparing between immortalized and primary donor MBS-MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Next, we looked at the relationship between the endogenous expression in the donor MCF7 cells and the fold-change (FC) of transfer (i.e. the fold increase of RPM counts in Coculture samples divided by the Mix samples). When looking at the whole transcriptome, we found no correlation between endogenous RNA expression in donor cells to the log<sub>2</sub>FC of human RNAs in co-cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, Pearson coefficient = 0.07). We noted that unlike the 283 robustly expressed and transferred RNAs described above, mitochondria-encoded RNAs (e.g. 13 mRNAs and 2 rRNAs) showed poor transfer (log<sub>2</sub>FC = 0.03–0.45) despite their high expression. This result further strengthens our confidence that we measure actual RNA transfer and not contamination. Most of the genes with log<sub>2</sub>FC &lt;0 (i.e. presumably RNAs that do not transfer) and log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt;3 (i.e. presumably highly transferred RNAs) have values of less than 10 RPM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 4</xref>). Thus, we cannot determine if these log<sub>2</sub>FC values are accurate or artifacts relating to the low number of reads.</p><p>We further observed that the median percentage of transfer for all human RNAs was low [0.34%, log<sub>10</sub> (percentage of transfer)=–0.44] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 4</xref>). Although the absolute number of transferred RNAs (using RPM as a measure) depended on gene expression level in the donor cells, the percentage of RNA transfer did not correlate linearly with gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 4</xref>). This result indicates that only a low proportion of RNAs from the mammalian transcriptome is likely to undergo transfer to neighboring cells. Next, we examined whether the percentage transfer of mRNA correlates with mRNA stability. To check this, we compared the percent transfer data with a recently published genome-wide analysis of half-lives of mRNAs in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blumberg et al., 2021</xref>). In total, 4972 genes were correctly annotated between the two datasets. We found that the percentage of transfer of the total RNA population, as well as that of the group of 283 robustly transferred mRNAs, was largely independent of mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 5</xref>). Interestingly, we could also detect the transfer of mRNAs from 12 primate-specific genes (<italic>e.g</italic>.

These genes are highly expressed in cortical regions of primate brains and are not reported to have any mouse orthologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Florio et al., 2018</xref>).

In full agreement with the RNA-seq results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the robust transfer of RNAs shown by sequencing could also be verified using qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Donor MCF7cells could be readily distinguished from acceptor MEFs, due to the high levels of query mRNA expression, often presence of transcription sites, and morphological differences between the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement with the RNA-seq and qRT-PCR data, we could detect robust transfer of these three genes from human MCF7 cells to mouse MBS-MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As expected, the transfer of KRT8 mRNA was noticeably higher than that of CCND1 or PSAP, which might be attributed to the higher expression of KRT8 in MCF7 cells.

We reasoned that if there was a transfer-promoting element, it could enhance transfer of a reporter mRNA.

Thus, we could not identify a fragment of β-actin that promotes mRNA transfer, at least in the context of this assay, that is placed in the 3’UTR of tdTomato and expressed ectopically.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the 5’UTR, 3’UTR, and CDS RNA and encoded amino acid sequences of the ~280 most highly transferred mRNAs by MEME Suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>) to look for consensus motifs that might be connected to transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). While no such motif was detected at the level of amino acid sequences or in the UTRs, three different purine-rich motifs were enriched in the coding sequences of nearly all mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We therefore tested whether motifs found in EV-sorted mRNAs could be found in our robustly transferred mRNA cohort. However, we found that one motif is completely absent from this cohort, as well as from our three control cohorts described above.

More importantly, breast carcinoma cell lines such as the MCF7 cells used in this study have been shown to release exosomes and other EVs that can package RNAs and influence the physiology of acceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jafari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lau and Wong, 2012</xref>). In contrast to EV-mediated transfer, however, we demonstrated that mRNAs transfer via TNTs that confer direct cell-cell contact, and not by diffusion through the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haimovich and Gerst, 2019</xref>). The transfer of both β-actin and GFP mRNAs was completely abrogated when donor and acceptor cells were separated in space (e.g. using a tripod/transwell setup) or when the acceptor cells were treated with donor cell-derived conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we asked whether the human mRNAs detected in mouse acceptor cells were contributed by a contact-dependent mechanism (e.g. TNTs) or via contact-independent pathways (e.g. EVs). To test this, we co-cultured MCF7 donor cells and MBS-MEF acceptor cells on the same plate or physically separated several millimeters apart using a quadrapod plate setup (see <italic>Materials nd methods</italic>). Alternatively, we treated the MBS-MEF cells with conditioned medium derived from a MCF7 single culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then separated the cells and extracted RNA as described above and followed the transfer of select mRNAs by qRT-PCR. We chose four genes from the list of highly transferred genes identified by RNA-sequencing (e.g. ACTG, GAPDH, TRIM37, and KRT8), while using ACTB as a positive (TNT-dependent) control for the analysis. The transfer of mRNAs was found to be highest in the Co-culture samples as compared to the quadrapod or conditioned media-treated samples across two independent replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This indicates that the mRNAs did not transfer by diffusion (e.g. either by secreted vesicles or ribonucleoprotein complexes), but requires cell-cell contact. As the genes selected for this experiment encode diverse biological functions and do not belong to any common pathway, it suggests that contact-dependent transfer is likely to be the predominant mechanism for transcriptome-wide mRNA transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Intercellular mRNA transfer occurs via TNTs</title><p>We previously showed that mRNA transfer is mediated by TNTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haimovich and Gerst, 2019</xref>). In order to verify that TNTs are formed by the two cell types, MEFs and MCF7, we created stable cell-lines of MEFs and MCF7 expressing either palmytoilated GFP or TagRFP-T (GFP-ps or TagRFP-T-ps), which locate to cell membranes, and looked for TNTs formation by live imaging. We found that both cell types produce TNTs which connect between MEFs-MEFs, MCF7-MCF7 and MEFs-MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, we searched through our FISH images for TNTs. TNTs are fragile and are destroyed easily during the FISH protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haimovich and Gerst, 2019</xref>) and are therefore difficult to detect in FISH images.

This indicates that MBS-MEFs undergo stark changes in gene expression upon co-culture with MCF7 cells. We detected more than 4000 genes that are ≥2 fold differentially expressed, including ~1000 upregulated genes and ~3000 downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 9</xref>).

Among upregulated genes in the MEFs, multiple extracellular-matrix associated genes (e.g. ACTA1, ACTA2, COL6A3, ADAM12, ADAM19) were also upregulated in CAFs associated with metastatic lung cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Furthermore, mouse KRT8, which is frequently associated with apical CAFs (apCAFs) in the breast and pancreatic cancer microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elyada et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sebastian et al., 2020</xref>) was upregulated in MEFs in response to co-culture with MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 9</xref>).

Using a human-murine co-culture system, we developed a simple, comprehensive, and quantitative method to study RNA transfer that involves co-culturing heterologous cell populations, sorting them by antigen-based affinity purification, and performing deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that numerous RNAs undergo transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - tables 1 and 2</xref>) and that the number of transferred mRNAs strongly correlates linearly with the endogenous expression level in donor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). This, in turn, led to the discovery that most abundantly transferred RNAs are highly expressed genes such as β- and γ-actin, cytoskeletal components, translation factors, ribosomal subunits and other genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We found that the level of gene expression alone explains more than 90% of RNA transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This is in agreement with our previous finding that transfer of human Cyclin D1 mRNA and mouse β-actin mRNA correlates with the expression level in donor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>). Another study, that reported transfer of keratinocyte-associated mRNAs to Langerhans cells, mostly through a contact-dependent mechanism, also found that the amount of transferred RNAs (as quantified by PCR) positively correlated with gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Su and Igyártó, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Similar results have also been reported in plants, where the long-distance transport of mRNAs between non-contiguous cells is achieved via plasmodesmata and sieve elements that play a major role in development. An analysis of mRNAs exhibiting long-distance transport in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showed that was largely non-selective and dependent on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calderwood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hofmann, 2016</xref>). In case of RNA transfer between species, such as host-parasitic plants, a large proportion of host and parasite mRNAs were found in each other’s tissues in an expression-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Notaguchi et al., 2015</xref>). In an instance of cross-species grafting, no specific <italic>cis</italic> motif was found among <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mRNAs that were found in <italic>Nicotiana</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Notaguchi et al., 2015</xref>). However, a recent report found that RNA modification [5-methyl cytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C)] mainly in the proximal end of coding regions was responsible for transport of certain mRNAs from shoot to root of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, two works describe a tRNA-like structure or actual bi-cistronic mRNA-tRNA transcript that acts as a <italic>cis</italic>-acting element in plant mRNA transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huang and Yu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We did not detect any gene with a disproportionally high level of transfer with respect to endogenous expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>), indicating that the presence of other transfer promoting factors (e.g. RNA motifs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 - table 3</xref>) beyond gene expression is unlikely. Short motifs have been identified in EV-sorted miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garcia-Martin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Santangelo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Temoche-Diaz et al., 2019</xref>) and mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Batagov and Kurochkin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bolukbasi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Szostak et al., 2014</xref>). Insertion of one such motif into a reporter RNA even influenced its recruitment into EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Szostak et al., 2014</xref>). At this point, the issue of full-length mRNAs in EVs remains somewhat controversial and therein represent only a small fraction of the native transcriptome and are present at levels that do not correspond necessarily to their level of transcription (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Prieto-Vila et al., 2021</xref>). While such motifs may be functional, we could not identify any associated specifically with mRNA/lncRNA transfer using different approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 - table 3</xref>). On the other hand, we showed previously that the level of contact-dependent mRNA transfer can depend on cell type, as HER2 mRNA transfer from two human cell lines (e.g. NCI-N87 and SKBR3 cells) to MEFs was similar, although the expression level in SKBR3 cells was 2-fold higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, RNA transfer might correlate with endogenous expression levels within the same cell type, but not necessarily across different cell types. The existence of transfer-inhibiting or -promoting elements recognized by cell-type specific factors could provide a possible explanation why some cell types transfer certain mRNAs or lncRNAs better or worse than others, even when taking gene expression levels and growth conditions (e.g. stress conditions or presence of extracellular matrix proteins, like fibronectin) into consideration. These hypotheses should be further explored, since cell type-derived differences in RNA transfer efficiency could have different physiological outcomes.</p><p>Interestingly, a report characterizing the transcriptome of the EV populations derived from hepatic cancer cell lines identified 238 protein-coding mRNAs and 35 lncRNAs, in addition to numerous miRNAs and snoRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berardocco et al., 2017</xref>). Many of these mRNAs were found to be highly transferred here and included genes encoding ribosomal proteins, ACTG, ACTB, and EEF2, <italic>etc</italic>. Along with an earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">He et al., 2015</xref>), it implies that mRNAs or mRNA fragments might be transferred by hepatic EVs and that the loading of RNAs into such vesicles may be expression-dependent. However, in this study and in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>) we could not detect diffusion-based mRNA transfer. In contrast, we now provide strong evidence that transfer of a few example mRNAs is contact dependent and likely occurs via TNTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>).</p><p>Besides expression dependence, another hallmark of intercellular RNA transfer is the relatively low level of transfer (e.g. average of &lt;1% of endogenous gene expression; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This makes transfer difficult to detect by bulk RNA sequencing and even more so by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). scRNA-Seq platforms, such as DropSeq, have a low level of accuracy and the sensitivity drops further when analyzing low expressed genes (e.g. &lt;50 copies of mRNA per cell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Torre et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, data from scRNA-seq using low amounts of input RNA is noisy and, thus, is less reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brennecke et al., 2013</xref>). In an attempt to detect transferred RNAs from MCF7 to MBS-MEFs using a newly described scRNA-Seq process, BAG-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li et al., 2020</xref>), only ~2000 genes were identified, yet none of which (not even β-actin) could be detected as having undergone transfer (data not shown). Further improvements in scRNA-seq technology, in terms of sensitivity, might go far towards allowing exploration of this phenomenon especially in tissues. Alternatively, multiplex FISH approaches (e.g. MERFISH or seqFISH+ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Xia et al., 2019</xref>) might prove superior to scRNA-seq due to higher sensitivity. In fact, our smFISH results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>) suggest that RNA-seq undercounts RNA transfer. For example, the average percentage of transfer of ACTB, KRT8, PSAP and CCND1 mRNA as assayed using FISH is 5–10 fold higher than the estimate from RNA-seq (i.e. compare data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> to that in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 4</xref>). This difference could be either methodological or technical in origin, as smFISH measures the mRNA in unperturbed adherent cells, whereas for RNA-seq the cells are first detached from the surface by trypsin at 37 °C and then sorted (at 4 °C) prior to RNA extraction. We have observed that the trypsinization and re-plating of acceptor MEFs leads to a massive loss in transferred ACTB-MBS mRNA, possibly through degradation (data not shown). On the other hand, RNA-seq library preparation may introduce bias in the detection of high abundance transcripts versus lower abundance ones at the reverse transcription and/or amplification levels. Thus, there is an experimental bias towards the detection of endogenous mRNAs, as compared to transferred mRNAs, and multiplex FISH methods may eventually prove more accurate. We note that the duration of our co-culture experiments was 12 hr and it is possible that longer durations might reveal a higher percentage of transfer. Although the transfer of β-actin-MBS mRNA reached a maximum within 2.5 hr, and was maintained at the same level for at least 24 hr when either immortalized or primary MBS-MEFs were co-cultured with immortalized or primary wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>), the transfer of β-actin-MBS mRNA continued to increase at least for up to 12 hr when MBS-MEFs were co-cultured with MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dasgupta and Gerst, 2020</xref>). Thus, greater levels of accumulation of transferred RNAs might occur depending upon cell type and growth conditions, as well as the RNA transfer rate and stability in the acceptor cells.</p><p>Our results imply that nearly all human mRNA species, as well as some lncRNAs, can undergo transfer, yet what parameters limit the level of transfer, aside from relative gene expression, is unknown. As mRNAs and lncRNAs are localized to specific regions/organelles in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buxbaum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cabili et al., 2015</xref>), it may depend upon the ability of an RNA to localize, diffuse, or be targeted along with organelles to TNT entrance sites. Although mitochondria were shown to transfer through TNTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rustom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sartori-Rupp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Zou et al., 2020</xref>), our RNA-seq results showed poor transfer of mitochondria-encoded RNAs relative to their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1 - table 4</xref>). It may be that TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer is limited using our experimental conditions or that it may not be an efficient vehicle for transfer. On the other hand, limited live imaging data suggests that transfer is motorized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>) and, thus, the RNA might require specialized packaging or modification for transfer and recognition by TNT-specific motor proteins. This packaging or modification may distinguish RNAs targeted for transfer from non-transferred RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haimovich and Gerst, 2019</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that RNA molecules may be co-transcriptionally ‘marked’ for transfer, especially since mRNA fate may be determined during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahan and Choder, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haimovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nair et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Slobodin and Dikstein, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Trcek and Singer, 2010</xref>). Alternatively, transfer could be isoform-specific. However, the low read counts of transferred RNAs in our RNA-seq experiment may have prevented us from determining if they are enriched for specific transcription start sites, alternative poly-adenylation sites, or alternatively spliced isoforms. Understanding the mechanism of mRNA transfer will be key to further explore its physiological importance.</p><p>We validated several examples of transferred mRNAs that transfer via a contact-dependent mechanism, likely TNTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>), and extrapolate from them to the entire transcriptome. Although it is possible that some or many mRNAs transfer by means other than TNTs, we think it unlikely, since the results on TNT-mediated cell-to-cell transfer in both this and our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haimovich, 2017</xref>), as well as by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ortin-Martinez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Su and Igyártó, 2019</xref>), tested a variety of mRNAs from different families and which localize to various sub-cellular localizations. This indicates that the pathway we have uncovered is more general than the few examples presented here. Of note, our key findings were recently recapitulated in a different human-mouse co-culture system. In this <italic>bioRxiv</italic> pre-print (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Yingying et al., 2023</xref>), the authors co-cultured human pluripotent stem cells with mouse epiblast stem cells. The cells were then FACS-sorted to human and mouse populations and either bulk RNA-seq or scRNA-seq was performed. In both cases, the authors found a contact-dependent human-to-mouse mRNA transfer, at levels ranging from 0.33% to 1.3% for bulk RNA-seq and 1.2% for scRNA-seq, similar to our findings presented here. Likewise, mRNA transfer was found to be non-specific and the rate of transfer correlated to the level of gene expression in the human donor cells. Although these experiments did not include a ‘Mix’ control, which is essential to remove background, nor validated by FISH, these independent results, if true, strengthen our findings.</p><p>The findings of this study will enable us to answer if TNT-mediated RNA transfer plays a role in key biological processes, such as tumor growth, tissue differentiation and development as investigated for EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Prieto-Vila et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Raulf et al., 2018</xref>). Our experimental system can be considered to be a simplistic recapitulation of a two dimensional human xenograft cancer model, where the human tumor cells (MCF7s) are in close proximity with mouse fibroblasts (MEFs). Based on our results, we speculate that fibroblasts in vivo could potentially acquire CAF-like phenotypes upon co-culture, as indicated by the transfer of prooncogenic RNAs to the MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), as well as dramatic changes to the MEF transcriptome incurred upon co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). While at the moment we cannot exclude the possibility that the latter changes result from additional signaling pathways (e.g. paracrine, adhesion-dependent signaling, <italic>etc</italic>.), the idea that TNT-mediated RNA transfer could play a significant role should be considered. Although performed in vitro, our findings with immortalized cells may translate to in vivo systems, whereby tumorigenic or other signal-inducing RNAs transfer from cancer cells to surrounding stromal cells, CAFs, or immune cells. TNTs have been detected in multiple cancer types, such as bladder carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, breast cancer, cervical carcinoma, colon cancer, glioblastoma, etc. (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Roehlecke and Schmidt, 2020</xref>). TNTs can then transport cargo to other cancer cells, which can increase intra-tumor heterogeneity or connect with cells in the tumor microenvironment to induce tumorigenic pathways. It is well known that RNAs derived from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells make the bone marrow niche more permissive to tumor growth and evade chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hornick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, TNTs were shown to transport mutant forms of KRAS to induce ERK signaling in colorectal cancer cells and multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein in multiple cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambudkar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desir et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Aside from the tumor microenvironment, TNT-mediated RNA transfer probably has physiological functions under other conditions. We and others previously found that cellular stress conditions modulate TNT formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariazi et al., 2017</xref>) and mRNA transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, TNTmediated RNA transfer may have a role in maintaining tissue homeostasis or signaling under stress conditions. A particular example is the role of TNT in ocular homeostasis and pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chinnery and Keller, 2020</xref>), and the recent discovery of TNT-mediated mRNA transfer in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ortin-Martinez et al., 2021</xref>). However, more work is needed to establish the role of TNT-mediated RNA transfer in vivo. Key to understanding the significance of this process is to determine the fate of transferred mRNAs, in terms of their translation, stability, and impact upon cell physiology.</p><p>Finally, it has not escaped our imagination that contact-dependent RNA transfer mechanisms could eventually be used as a novel strategy to deliver mRNA-based drugs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kowalski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sahin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Van Hoecke and Roose, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Weng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zhang et al., 2019a</xref>).

Briefly, the UBC promoter was replaced by a TRE3GV promoter (taken from Addgene plasmid # 85556; gift from Eric Lander, Broad Institute, MA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fulco et al., 2016</xref>), the KRAB-dCas9-EGFP was replaced by tdTomato, and the U6-sgRNA cassette was replaced by a rTet cassette under an UBC promoter (taken from Addgene plasmid # 50917; gift from Rene Maehr and Scot Wolfe, University of Massachusetts Medical School, MA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kearns et al., 2014</xref>). All modifications were done by RF cloning.</p><p>Lentivirus particles were produced by transiently transfecting the expression plasmid with packaging plasmids VSVG, RRE and Rev (Addgene plasmids # 12259, 12251, and 12253, respectively; gift from Didier Trono; EPFL, Switzerland) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dull et al., 1998</xref>) into HEK293T cells using TransIT-Lenti transfection reagent (Mirus Bio) and allowed to grow for 72 hr. The virus-containing media were harvested and concentrated with Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Virus particles were resuspended in complete DMEM, aliquoted, and stored in –80 °C.</p><p>MCF7 cells were obtained from ATCC. Immortalized MEFs and MBS-MEFs cell lines were derived from mice as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lionnet et al., 2011</xref>. All cell lines tested Mycoplasma negative by PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dasgupta and Gerst, 2019</xref>).</p><p>For all stable cell line generations (e.g. MBS-MEFs expressing either tdTomato-β-actin fragments or tdTomato expressed under the doxycycline-inducible promoter, MEFs and MCF7 expressing either TagRFP-T-ps or GFP-ps), 50,000 MBS-MEFs or MCF7 cells were seeded in ix-well plates and exposed to the virus particles mentioned above in serum-free media supplemented with 6 µg/ml polybrene (Sigma). Cells with high or low expression of tdTomato were selected by FACS (BD Biosciences Aria III).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell sorting using magnetic microbeads</title><p>We used an antigen-based cell sorting protocol slightly modified from the one we described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dasgupta and Gerst, 2020</xref>). Culture plates (15 cm) were coated with 10 µg/mL of Fibronectin (FN) (Sigma) in PBS for 20 min before plating the cells. For the Mix and Single culture samples, MBS-MEF and MCF7 cells were cultured for about 15–18 hr on FN-coated plates before harvesting. For the Co-culture samples, MCF7 cells were plated first. Between 8 and 10 hours later, the MBS-MEF cells were plated, and co-culturing was maintained for additional 12 hr. At the time of harvesting, cells were trypsinized using 3 ml of 0.25% Trypsin (Sigma) and resuspended in 500 µl of cold DMEM (supplemented with FBS). In order to have good cell separation, we noted that the optimum amount of antibodies and incubation times differ for MEF and MCF7 cells. For each biological replicate we used duplicate ‘Mix’ and ‘Co-culture’ samples – one used to enrich for MCF7 cells and the other to enrich for MEFs. Cells were incubated on ice with magnetic bead-conjugated anti-CD326 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec GmBH), as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 - table 1</xref>.</p><p>Thereafter, an additional 1 ml of cold, complete DMEM (with FBS) was added to the cell suspension and sorted using MACS LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec GmBH). The columns were washed two times with 1 ml of cold DMEM each. The flow-through contains the CD326-negative MBS-MEF fraction, while the CD326-positive MCF7 fraction remains attached to the magnetic bead column. The MCF7 fraction was eluted with 3 ml of cold DMEM using the supplied plunger. To increase the purity of the MCF7 or MEF fraction, the flow-through (MEFs) or eluate (MCF7s) was sorted again using a fresh MACS LS column, as described above. A small aliquot (~1/10<sup>th</sup>) of the sorted MBS-MEF and MCF7 cell populations was then counterstained with Alexa-488-labeled anti-human CD326 (Biolegend; Cat #: 324210) and PE-labeled anti-mouse CD321 antibody (BD Biosciences, Cat #: 564908). For both antibodies, 5 µl of antibody per million cells were used and the sorting efficiency was checked using a flow cytometer (Attune NXT, Thermo Scientific). Samples belonging to replicate experiments were collected at the same time to reduce the batch effect. To evaluate the contamination in MEF-enriched samples, only the CD326-high and CD321-low quadrant was considered as contaminating MCF7 cells in MEF enriched fractions. To evaluate the level of MEF contamination in the MCF7-enriched sample, the CD326-low and CD321-high quadrant was considered as contaminant. These numbers are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 - table 1</xref>. Note that there is a low percentage of double CD321-CD326 positive-stained cells (upper right quadrant) which is probably due to non-specific staining with the antibodies, as it appears in single cultures as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 - table 1</xref> ‘% False positive’). There is also a small percentage of unstained cells (lower left quadrant). These are probably MEFs, since these are relatively abundant in MEF-enriched populations (0.1–2.8%), but rare events in the MCF7-enriched populations (0–0.08%).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA extraction, quality control, library preparation, and sequencing</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA Mini kit (Macharey Nagel) and RNA integrity checked using an Agilent Tapestation 2100, while the RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop microvolume spectrophotometer and Qubit 2.0 BR assay. Transfer of human β-actin from MCF7 to MBS-MEF was verified by RT-PCR and RT-qPCR using oligos specific for human β-actin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> – PCR primers). Poly-A(+) RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs). Two µg of RNA per sample were processed in two separate reactions (separate technical replicas) to increase depth. Libraries were amplified by 8 PCR cycles and sequenced on a Novaseq 6000 SP1 flowcell using 2x150 bp paired-end reads. The processed files have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database under the accession number GSE185002 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185002">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185002</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Post processing and alignment to reference genomes</title><p>Identification of human-specific reads was done in multiple sequential steps (Figure S1B).

The alignment was done without soft clipping (<italic><monospace>--alignEndsType EndToEnd</monospace></italic>) and using <italic><monospace>--outFilterMismatchNoverLmax</monospace> 0.0</italic>. Second, the alignment was filtered to contain only paired-end reads with unique alignment. Third, uniquely-aligned reads were re-aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using the same criteria. Finally, for every read the number of differences to the human genome was compared to the number of differences to the mouse genome. Only the reads that aligned to the human genome with zero mismatches and aligned to mouse with &gt;2 differences were considered as <italic>bonafide</italic> human reads and were considered for further analysis. The same approach was applied to identify mouse-specific genes in human-enriched samples. HTseq was used to count the number of reads per gene. The read count was normalized to the library size of each sample (reads per million, RPM). All fastq data and raw read count data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database under the accession number GSE185002.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis to detect transferred genes and differential gene expression</title><p>Exploratory analysis (hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis) of the count data was done using the base functions in R. To detect the most abundantly transferred human mRNAs we compared the normalized read count of the Co-culture samples to that of the Mix samples using an unpaired, one-tailed t-test, followed by multiple testing correction (Benjamini, Krieger, &amp; Yekutieli procedure). Genes with a FC <underline>&gt;</underline>2 and False Discovery Rate (FDR)&lt;5% were considered as enriched in the co-culture samples. Other statistical packages, such as DESeq2 or edgeR, which average the dispersion of the same gene across different samples are not useful here as we compared samples of different RNA content. Indeed, DESeq2 did not detect any significantly transferred genes between the Mix and Co-culture samples. We also performed a non-parametric rank analysis to check if the relative ranks of certain genes are different between Co-culture and Mix. Using this test, we failed to detect the transfer of β-actin as a significant observation (not shown), in contrast to our previous FISH results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dasgupta and Gerst, 2020</xref>).</p><p>To estimate the proportion of the donor mRNAs that undergoes transfer, we defined the per gene ‘percentage transfer’ as: Percentage transfer = [[Avg.

To minimize the noise from the low-expressed genes, genes with RPM &lt;100 for the Single culture and &lt;10 for the Co-culture and FC &lt;2 were not considered.</p><p>To estimate the gene expression level of the native mouse transcriptome, and to test the differential expression between the different conditions, the HTseq counts were processed using DEseq2 for normalization and differential expression testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Love et al., 2014</xref>).

The 5’ UTR, CDS and the 3’ UTR of the genes were then analyzed separately using the “Motif Discovery” mode of MEME Suite using the following inputs: Mode: Classic; Input Type: DNA/RNA; Zero or one occurrence per sequence (zoops); maximum width: 15; return top 3 motifs. No motifs were identified among the two UTRs, while the top three motifs in the coding sequence are shown. As a comparison, similar analysis were done on groups of 280–300 genes among the pool of less transferred genes and the top three motifs of each group were identified. To scan for the presence of previously reported EV-targeting RNA motifs in the set of highly transferred RNAs, FIMO software (Find Individual Motif Occurrences) was used with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grant et al., 2011</xref>). Three sets of least transferred RNAs, as used to discover transfer-promoting motifs by MEME analysis, were used as controls.

Briefly, outlines of both the cell and nucleus for all cells were demarcated by the ‘Define Outlines’ functions. In co-culture samples, donor cells were easily distinguished from acceptor cells due to the great number of endogenously expressed query RNA spots in the cytoplasm, as well as the oft presence of transcription sites in the nucleus. In addition, nuclear DAPI labeling was also used as a means to differentiate cells in human-mouse co-cultures: the human nucleus appears less granular and more elongated, whereas the murine nucleus appears granular and more rounded/ovular (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). tdTomato donor cells were also distinguishable from acceptor cells due to their high level of tdTomato protein fluorescence. Thereafter, FISH spots were characterized from the donor cells (as the positive control) and detection settings were then applied to all cells in the same batch of analysis. Typically, one donor cell is filtered for background removal (typical parameters for filtering in FQ were Kernel BGD XY, Z=6, 5; Kernel SNR XY, Z=0.5, 1) and the individual spots were approximately determined by fitting them to a 3D Gaussian function. Due to high background in the nucleus, spots were only detected in the cytoplasm. Apparent non-specific spots were discarded by adjusting for the intensity and the width of Gaussian function. The detection settings thus obtained were applied to all cells (e.g. other donor cells, acceptor cells only, and the acceptor cells in co-culture) using the ‘batch processing’ tool. Once FQ preliminarily counted the number of spots in all the cells, the image parameters (e.g. Sigma XY, Sigma Z, Signal Amplitude and Background) were adjusted so as to have as minimum number of spots as possible in cells that do not express the relevant mRNA (i.e. acceptor cells alone). The modified detection settings were then re-applied to all cells to determine the number of spots in each cell. For image presentation, representative images from each condition are presented as maximum projection and were minimally adjusted for brightness and contrast in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) and a RGB picture was generated by assigning an appropriate Look Up Table (LUT) to each channel. For TNT in FISH images, brightness was increased so the cell body appears over-exposed, to allow visualization of the thin TNTs. We used FIJI’s bandpass filter (large structures down to 40 pixels, small structures up to 3 pixels, tolerance of direction 5%) for improved representation of the TNTs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quadrapod and conditioned media experiments</title><p>To check for mRNA transfer from MCF7 cells to MBS-MEFs via EVs, MBS-MEFs and MCF7 cells were either spatially separated (i.e. the quadrapod experiment) or MBS-MEFs were cultured in conditioned media derived from MCF7 cells.

Four Perspex legs (~2 mm in height) per disk were set in a square arrangement, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. Disks were perforated with 1 mm-wide holes to allow proper aeration and avoid formation of bubbles. All disks were washed in 70% EtOH for minimum of 24 hr before use.

Second, 3x10<sup>6</sup> MBS-MEF cells were seeded onto a separate 12 cm fibronectin-coated disk and cultured in a 15 cm plate. After 10 min of MBS-MEF cells attaching to the fibronectin-coated disk, the disk containing MCF7 cells was then placed over the disk containing MBS-MEF cells, so that the two cell types face each other, and were cultured for an additional 14 hr.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christel Brou (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this paper, the authors show that tunneling nanotubes or TNTs are used by cells to transfer full-length mRNAs. The data show that as much as 1% of the endogenous mRNA are passed between cells by this procedure. The transferred mRNA affect the transcriptome of the acceptor cells thus highlighting the significance of this nanotube-mediated trafficking of mRNA between cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The identification of transferred RNAs relies heavily on the purity of the isolated cell populations and while the reviewers recognized that the authors did a good job, the isolated MEF samples may have uncharacterized components of MCF7 cells. Given the low level of detectable transferred RNAs it's really crucial to clarify the confidence of the measurements, with also more replicates. The purity of the sorted populations could be strengthened by qPCR-based assessments as suggested by one of the reviewers.</p><p>2) The authors should tone down the generality of the findings, as the results here on cell-to-cell contact in co-culture cells for 5 RNAs may not be valid transcriptome-wide. Furthermore some statements about the potential significance of these changes to cancer/immunity may be speculative.</p><p>3) Aspects of image acquisition and TNT characterization need to be improved to more convincingly correlate cell contact-dependent transfer of mRNA and transfer through TNTs. Also, two cell types beyond nuclear morphology need to be better identified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects of image acquisition and TNT characterization need to be improved to more convincingly correlate cell contact-dependent transfer of mRNA and transfer through TNTs (Figure 6). TNT should be better characterized as being membrane protrusions supported by actin and running above the substratum. Also, it would be better to clearly identify the two cell types beyond nuclear morphology that is not visible in this figure.</p><p>Regarding the differential changes in mouse transcriptome after coculture with MCF7 cells, the authors should better correlate these transcriptional changes to mRNA transfer and show that they do not result from other events (signaling pathways, transfer of organelles…). Are the transferred mRNAs translated, are the transcriptomes of receiving cells affected if the cocultures are performed in the presence of translation inhibitors?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The purity of the sorted populations could be further strengthened by a quantitative PCR-based assessment to determine the relative copy number of human versus mouse nuclear DNA in the isolated MEFs, as well as by expressing a fluorescent protein within MCF7 cells and assessing the presence of fluorescent cells by flow cytometry of the isolated MEF preparations.</p><p>It could also be informative to analyze the sorted populations by forward scatter as a measure of relative cell size. This might help to identify to what extent clusters of cells or cell fragments are present (especially as it relates to the 'double stained' and 'unstained' cells observed in the lower left and upper right quadrants of the profiles shown in Figure 1B and S1A).</p><p>As stated above, increasing the number of replicates might be helpful in revealing specific patterns of transferred RNAs.</p><p>Figures 4B, 4C, 5B, 5C, and S5C seem to present quantifications of multiple cells from a single experiment. The inclusion of at least another replicate would be useful.</p><p>The plots in Figures 2D, 2E, 2F, 2G, 3B, and 3C highlight specific RNAs by name, but the highlighted sets are only partly overlapping between plots, with some RNAs being pointed out in some plots but not others. It would be useful to either highlight the same RNAs in all plots or explain the rationale behind the current selections.</p><p>It seems to me that the results of Figures 6 and S8 indicate that mRNA transfer could at least partly occur via TNTs. The statements &quot;we conclude that mRNA transfer in our co-culture system occurs predominantly via TNTs&quot; (lines 426-427) and &quot;we now provide strong evidence that transfer is via TNTs&quot; (lines 529-529) sound overstated. For the same reason, I would suggest rewording the last sentence of the Abstract and Introduction.</p><p>The n value for the experiment of Figure 1D is not indicated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83584.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The identification of transferred RNAs relies heavily on the purity of the isolated cell populations and while the reviewers recognized that the authors did a good job, the isolated MEF samples may have uncharacterized components of MCF7 cells.

However, we would like to emphasize that the results of cell-cell transfer in this and our previous publication did test a wide variety of mRNAs from different families and having various sub-cellular localizations. This indicates that the pathway we uncovered is more general than the few examples we present in our study. In addition, we now cite in the Discussion (lines 609-620 in the revised manuscript) a new pre-print recently posted to <italic>bioRxiv</italic> that show similar results of mRNA transfer in a human-mouse cell co-culture model. In relation to the statement about the significance of our findings to cancer/immunity, we actually used the term “speculate” in the text (lines 429, 577 in the original manuscript; lines 458, 627 in the revised manuscript). Thus, it should be clear that these statements are speculative until further research is performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Aspects of image acquisition and TNT characterization need to be improved to more convincingly correlate cell contact-dependent transfer of mRNA and transfer through TNTs.

Figures 4B [KRT8], and 5A). In the case of experiments performed with tdTomato RNA, donor cells could be clearly identified by tdTomato protein fluorescence. The delineation between donor and acceptor cells used in the smFISH experiments was described in the Methods (Lines 790-797 in the original manuscript; lines 844-851 in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the differential changes in mouse transcriptome after coculture with MCF7 cells, the authors should better correlate these transcriptional changes to mRNA transfer and show that they do not result from other events (signaling pathways, transfer of organelles…).</p></disp-quote><p>We note that we did not claim that the changes in endogenous mRNA expression levels arise solely due to RNA transfer. Our only claim was that these changes arise upon conditions of cell co-culture and when TNT formation occurs. Future co-culture studies measuring transcriptome-wide RNA transfer using the quadrapod co-culture system (which prevents cell-cell contact under co-culture conditions) versus co-culture conditions that allow cell-cell contact could eventually be performed, yet are currently beyond the scope of this paper. To make a clear distinction between TNT-dependent and -independent effects upon the endogenous transcriptome also requires further mechanistic knowledge of TNT-mediated mRNA transfer as well as the contribution of signaling pathways to the transcriptional control of co-cultured cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the transferred mRNAs translated.</p></disp-quote><p>The translation of transferred RNAs is an important question currently under investigation in the lab, but is beyond the scope of this paper which aimed solely to document the transferome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the transcriptomes of receiving cells affected if the cocultures are performed in the presence of translation inhibitors?</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous publication (Haimovich <italic>et al.</italic> 2017), we demonstrated that short-term (<italic>e.g.</italic> 3hrs) translation inhibition does not inhibit mRNA transfer, but we did not try it for longer periods and did not examine the phenotype of acceptor cells in the presence of translation inhibitors. We suspect that such an experiment will not be conclusive, since long-term (<italic>e.g.</italic> 12-24hr) translation inhibition will likely result in pleiotropic changes that can affect many cellular pathways and alter cell viability. In the future, we aim to inhibit transfer of a specific mRNA (<italic>e.g</italic>. by co-expressing an MS2 aptamer-tagged RNA and the MS2 coat protein in the donor cells; Haimovich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017) or its ability to undergo translation (<italic>e.g.</italic> by eliminating the start codon or adding a riboswitch to control translation) in order to test the phenotypic consequence of the transfer of individual RNAs on acceptor cells. However, this is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The purity of the sorted populations could be further strengthened by a quantitative PCR-based assessment to determine the relative copy number of human versus mouse nuclear DNA in the isolated MEFs, as well as by expressing a fluorescent protein within MCF7 cells and assessing the presence of fluorescent cells by flow cytometry of the isolated MEF preparations.</p></disp-quote><p>We used end-point DNA PCR in our previous publication (Dasgupta and Gerst, 2020) to show the purity of the sorted cells, although it was not done for the cells collected for this paper. In this paper we used semi-quantitative and quantitative PCR to show the purity of the populations after purification, and mitochondrial RNA as another measure of purity. Importantly, our co-culture samples are compared to the “Mix” control. Indeed, the RNA-seq data in the opposite direction (<italic>i.e.</italic> mouse-to-human transfer) showed the expected increase in Mix-derived samples vs the Co-culture-derived samples, in direct correlation with the small contaminations detected by the FACS analysis (lines 161-165 in the original manuscript, lines 167-171 in the revised manuscript). Thus, we believe that the efforts we invested in validating the purity of our separated populations are more than sufficient (but see also our response to the next comment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It could also be informative to analyze the sorted populations by forward scatter as a measure of relative cell size. This might help to identify to what extent clusters of cells or cell fragments are present (especially as it relates to the 'double stained' and 'unstained' cells observed in the lower left and upper right quadrants of the profiles shown in Figure 1B and S1A).</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated above, it is unlikely that these populations contributed to the human mRNA signal in the MEFs, since the percentage of these populations was much higher in the Mix-derived samples than in the Co-culture-derived samples (lines 174-181 in the revised manuscript). Nevertheless, for due diligence, we took another look at the original FACS files of the isolated MEF populations. Looking at “large” particle sizes (<italic>e.g.</italic> 1-3% of all particles) showed these were exclusively single-stained for MEFs. The very small particles were distributed between single-stained for MEFs and unstained, with a minor population (~0.6% in Co-culture and ~1.6% in Mix and single MEF cultures) stained by the MCF7 antibody. So, it seems unlikely that any of these populations contributed to a “contamination” of the Co-culture-derived samples beyond that of the Mix-derived samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As stated above, increasing the number of replicates might be helpful in revealing specific patterns of transferred RNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, unfortunately, we lack the resources to perform additional replicates of the RNA-seq experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 4B, 4C, 5B, 5C, and S5C seem to present quantifications of multiple cells from a single experiment. The inclusion of at least another replicate would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, these experiments were done in two replicates. This is now indicated in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The plots in Figures 2D, 2E, 2F, 2G, 3B, and 3C highlight specific RNAs by name, but the highlighted sets are only partly overlapping between plots, with some RNAs being pointed out in some plots but not others. It would be useful to either highlight the same RNAs in all plots or explain the rationale behind the current selections.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good idea and we updated Figure 2E-G to show the same gene names. As for 2D, 3B and 3C: these plots show different properties and we highlighted a few example RNAs from the top and/or bottom of each plot. Therefore, we do not think highlighting the same RNAs is required in these cases. For interested researchers, the data is available in the supplementary excel files.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems to me that the results of Figures 6 and S8 indicate that mRNA transfer could at least partly occur via TNTs. The statements &quot;we conclude that mRNA transfer in our co-culture system occurs predominantly via TNTs&quot; (lines 426-427) and &quot;we now provide strong evidence that transfer is via TNTs&quot; (lines 529-529) sound overstated. For the same reason, I would suggest rewording the last sentence of the Abstract and Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised paper we added more experiments that show the presence of mRNAs in <italic>bona fide</italic> TNTs (new Figure 6 and related movies). Clearly, we are unable to test each and every mRNA, but likely the simplest explanation is correct, <italic>i.e.</italic> that most if not all mRNAs transfer via TNTs.
