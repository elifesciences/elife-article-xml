Classic brown adipocytes contain a high density of mitochondria that contain Uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), which uncouples respiration from ATP synthesis and generates heat instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farmer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>). In addition, beige/brite adipocytes in WAT depot are recruited upon cold exposure or β<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang and Seale, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sanchez-Gurmaches et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cypess et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lichtenbelt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Virtanen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chondronikola et al., 2014</xref>). Based on several cross-sectional studies, adult human brown fat or brown fat-like tissue is inversely correlated with body mass index and visceral fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lichtenbelt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hibi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jimenez et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, unraveling the mechanisms underlying the thermogenic gene program has drawn growing attention in obesity research as a promising avenue to combat obesity and associated metabolic diseases.</p><p>One of the major advances in BAT biology has been understanding the transcription network that governs the thermogenic gene program and finding critical factors that activate the <italic>Ucp1</italic> gene. A multitude of transcriptional regulators have been implicated in the transcription of <italic>Ucp1</italic>, including transcription factors, Zfp516, Irf4, and Ebf2, and transcriptional coregulators, Prdm16, Ppargc1a, and Lsd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rajakumari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dempersmier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Puigserver et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sambeat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kong et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, we identified a BAT-enriched and cold-induced transcription factor, Zc3h10 that activates <italic>Ucp1</italic> and other target genes, such as <italic>Tfam</italic> and <italic>Nrf1</italic> for mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yi et al., 2019</xref>). Zc3h10 activates the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter by directly binding to the −4.6 kb region. Upon sympathetic stimulation, Zc3h10 is phosphorylated at S126 by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to increase binding to this distal region of the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter. Consequently, Zc3h10 ablation in mice impairs the thermogenic gene program, while Zc3h10 overexpression in adipose tissue enhances the thermogenic capacity and energy expenditure, protecting mice from diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>As in most biological processes, BAT as well as beige fat, rely heavily on environmental cues for its full activation of the thermogenic gene program. Integrating epigenetic effectors into the thermogenic network may provide a comprehensive understanding in the regulation of thermogenic gene program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yi et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we identify Dot1l (disruptor of telemetric silencing 1-like) as an interacting partner of Zc3h10 and a critical coactivator of thermogenic genes. Dot1l is the only known methyltransferase that catalyzes the sequential mono-, di- and tri-methylation of H3K79, which, unlike major epigenetic sites, is located at the globular domain of nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Min et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Leeuwen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frederiks et al., 2008</xref>). Differing from other histone methyltransferases, Dot1l does not contain a SET domain but uniquely has an AdoMET motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Leeuwen et al., 2002</xref>). Dot1l is broadly known to play roles in telomere silencing, cell cycle regulations and is particularly well studied in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-related leukemogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schulze et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okada et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nguyen and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ng et al., 2002</xref>). However, not much is known about Dot1l recruitment to specific sites by specific transcription factors. Nor the role of Dot1l is thermogenic gene program is known.</p><p>We show here that Dot1l is recruited to the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter region via its direct interaction with Zc3h10 for Zc3h10-mediated transcriptional activation of <italic>Ucp1</italic> and other target genes. By using the specific chemical inhibitor of Dot1l-H3K79 methyltransferase activity, pinometostat (EPZ-5676), we demonstrate that Dot1l methyltransferase activity is required for thermogenic gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Dot1l ablation in brown adipocytes impairs, while ectopic Dot1l expression enhances, thermogenic gene program and that Dot1l requires Zc3h10 for its function in thermogenesis. Dot1l ablation in <italic>Ucp1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in mice impairs the thermogenic capacity and lowers oxygen consumption, leading to weight gain. In this regard, the GWAS database reveals multiple SNPs of Dot1l associated with a waist-hip ratio and body mass index, further supporting a potential role of Dot1l in human obesity (GWAS Central identifier: HGVPM1111, HGVPM1114).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dot1l directly interacts with Zc3h10 for its recruitment and activation of <italic>Ucp1</italic> and other thermogenic genes</title><p>We previously reported Zc3h10 as a BAT-enriched transcription factor that promotes the BAT gene program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yi et al., 2019</xref>). Most transcription factors do not work alone but rather form a complex to recruit other cofactors for transcription. Thus, as a DNA-binding protein, Zc3h10 may interact with coregulators to activate BAT gene transcription. Therefore, we searched for potential interacting partners of Zc3h10. The Zc3h10 with the streptavidin- and calmodulin-binding epitope-tag were incubated with nuclear extracts from BAT and the Zc3h10 complex after sequential purification were subjected to mass spectrometry. We identified multiple potential Zc3h10 interacting proteins, among which were methyltransferases and chromatin remodelers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For further studying as a Zc3h10 interacting protein, we selected Dot1l (disruptor of telemetric silencing 1-like), the H3K79 methyltransferase, as it directly interacted with Zc3h10 and was the only BAT-enriched gene out of the candidates tested.</p><p>First, for validation of interaction between Dot1l and Zc3h10, we performed Co-IP experiments with lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with HA-<italic>Dot1l</italic> and Flag-Zc3h10 by using FLAG and HA antibodies. Indeed, we detected FLAG-Zc3h10 upon immunoprecipitation with HA antibodies. Conversely, HA-Dot1l was detected upon immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). We then tested an interaction of the two endogenous proteins using BAT from mice. Again, we detected the presence of endogenous Zc3h10 when nuclear extracts of BAT from mice were immunoprecipitated with Dot1l antibody. By reverse Co-IP, we confirmed the interaction between endogenous Dot1l and Zc3h10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). We previously showed that Zc3h10 is recruited to thermogenic gene promoters by p38 MAPK in response to cold exposure/β<sub>3</sub> stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yi et al., 2019</xref>). To test if cold exposure/p38 MAPK can increase the interaction of Dot1l and Zc3h10, we took BAT lysates from mice housed at room temperature or 4°C and immunoprecipitated with either IgG or Dot1l and immunoblotted with Zc3h10. However, the interaction of Dot1l and Zc3h10 did not change between conditions, and cold exposure does not modulate the Zc3h10-Dot1l interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We next asked whether Dot1l can directly bind Zc3h10, by using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to Dot1l, expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Incubation of GST-Dot1l fusion protein immobilized on glutathione beads with in vitro transcribed and translated [<sup>35</sup>S]-Zc3h10, but not control GST-alone, detected the presence of Zc3h10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that Dot1l directly interacts with Zc3h10. We next examined domains of Dot1l for its interaction with Zc3h10. We generated three <italic>Dot1l</italic> truncated constructs; N-terminal Dot1l (1-500aa) containing the catalytic domain, the middle fragment (501-1000aa) containing the coiled-coil domain, and the C-terminal domain (1001-1540aa); All constructs were N-terminally tagged with HA. We then cotransfected these constructs with full-length Flag-tagged <italic>Zc3h10</italic>. By Co-IP, we detected the middle fragment (501–1000) of Dot1l, that contains coiled coil motifs, interacting with Zc3h10, but not the other two regions of Dot1l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We conclude that the middle fragments of Dot1l contains the Zc3h10 interacting domain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dot1l directly interacts with Zc3h10 for its recruitment and activation of BAT gene program.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left) CoIP using αFlag for Zc3h10 or αHA for Dot1l after immunoprecipitation with either αHA- or αFlag, respectively, using lysates from HEK293FT cells transfected with Flag-<italic>Zc3h10</italic> and HA-<italic>Dot1l</italic>.

Indeed, tissue expression profiling by RT-qPCR and immunoblotting showed that Dot1l was enriched in mouse BAT compared to other tissues tested, such as WAT, liver, and kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We next compared <italic>Dot1l</italic> mRNA levels between the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) that contains preadipocytes with adipocyte fraction of BAT from 10-wk-old wild-type (WT) mice. As expected, <italic>Ucp1</italic> was enriched in the adipocyte fraction, whereas <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression was higher in the SVF fraction. We found <italic>Dot1l</italic> to be enriched in the brown adipocyte fraction by over 2-fold compared to the SVF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left). Moreover, similar to <italic>Zc3h10</italic>, expression of <italic>Dot1l</italic> in BAT was induced upon cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right). We next examined <italic>Dot1l</italic> expression during BAT cell differentiation in vitro. During the course of brown adipocyte differentiation, as expected, <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression was induced, whereas expression of preadipocyte gene, <italic>Pref-1 (Dlk1)</italic>, was suppressed. More importantly, similar to <italic>Zc3h10</italic>, <italic>Dot1l</italic> mRNA level was increased during BAT cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Overall, we conclude that Dot1l expression pattern is similar to Zc3h10 in terms of enrichment in mature brown adipocytes and induction by cold exposure, which may allow potential a cooperative function of Dot1l and Zc3h10 for the BAT gene program.</p><p>Next, to examine the functional significance of Dot1l and Zc3h10 interaction in the activation of the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter, we performed the luciferase (Luc) reporter assay using the −5.5 kb <italic>Ucp1</italic>-Luc promoter. Along with the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter-Luc construct, <italic>Zc3h10</italic> and <italic>Dot1l</italic> were cotransfected into HEK293 cells. As expected, compared to empty vector control, Zc3h10 alone activated the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter over 3-fold. Dot1l alone could not activate the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter. When co-transfected with Zc3h10, Dot1l was able to synergistically activate the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter, resulting in a robust 11-fold increase in the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, left). To test whether its enzymatic activity of Dot1l is required for activation of the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter, we generated a <italic>Dot1l</italic>-M55L construct, mutated of a critical residue in the catalytic core, located at its substrate, histone binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). WT-<italic>Dot1l</italic> and <italic>Dot1</italic>-M55L were co-transfected with <italic>Zc3h10</italic> and the <italic>Ucp1</italic>-luc promoter into HEK293 cells. Cotransfection of WT-<italic>Dot1l</italic> along with <italic>Zc3h10</italic> increased the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter activity as expected. However, cotransfection of <italic>Dot1l</italic>-M55L along with <italic>Zc3h10</italic> and the <italic>Ucp1</italic>-luc significantly reduced the increase in the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter activity compared to WT-<italic>Dot1l</italic> with <italic>Zc3h10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, right). Furthermore, we also treated HEK293 cells cotransfected with WT-<italic>Dot1l</italic> and <italic>Zc3h10</italic> with EPZ5676, a specific inhibitor of Dot1l H3K79 methyltransferase known to bind at the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daigle et al., 2013</xref>). We detected significantly decrease in the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter activation by Dot1l and Zc3h10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, right). These results demonstrate that catalytic activity of Dot1l is required for the cooperative function of Dot1l and Zc3h10 in the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter activation. Next, because Dot1l interacts with Zc3h10 to enhance the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter activity, we predicted that Dot1l should occupy the same <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter region where Zc3h10 binds. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using BAT cells transduced with adenovirus containing Flag-tagged <italic>Zc3h10</italic> and HA-tagged <italic>Dot1l</italic>. By using Flag (for Zc3h10) and HA (for Dot1l) antibodies, we detected strong enrichment of both Zc3h10 and Dot1l at the - 4.6 kb region of the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter, a region corresponding to the Zc3h10-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, left). We next performed a Re-ChIP experiment using Zc3h10 antibody and Dot1l antibody sequentially. Indeed, we observed significant enrichment of Dot1l for the −4.6 kb region of the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter as well as +50 bp <italic>Tfam</italic> promoter region, similar to Zc3h10 enrichment alone. However, there was no enrichment observed in the control, <italic>Gapdh</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, right). This illustrates the co-occupancy of Dot1l and Zc3h10 at the same regions of <italic>Tfam</italic> and <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoters. Collectively, we demonstrate that Dot1l, as an interacting partner of Zc3h10, is a critical coactivator of the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dot1l is critical for the thermogenic gene program, and its action is dependent on Zc3h10</title><p>We next tested whether Dot1l is required for BAT gene program in cultured BAT cells.

Transduction of sh<italic>Dot1l</italic> adenovirus in BAT cells caused a decrease in <italic>Dot1l</italic> mRNA levels by approximately 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left).

We predicted that if Dot1l is required for the transcriptional activation of <italic>Ucp1</italic> and other BAT genes, inhibition of Dot1l activity should prevent BAT gene expression. Dot1l inhibition resulted in a significant reduction in mRNA and protein levels for Ucp1 by 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), while not affecting Dot1l protein stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Expression of other BAT-enriched Zc3h10 target genes, such as <italic>Tfam</italic>, <italic>Nrf1</italic>, <italic>Cox7a</italic>, and <italic>Cox8b</italic>, was decreased by 40–80%, whereas <italic>Pparg</italic> expression was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In order to confirm that the decrease in thermogenic gene expression is due to the enzymatic activity of Dot1l, we overexpressed Dot1l in differentiated BAT cells and treated with Dot1l inhibitor (10 uM), then performed ChIP-qPCR for H3K79me3. EPZ5676 treated cells had significantly decreased H3K79me3 at −4.6 kb <italic>Ucp1</italic> region as well as <italic>Tfam</italic> and <italic>Nrf1</italic> promoter regions, while having no difference at the <italic>Gapdh</italic> promoter region as compared to the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, we overexpressed WT-Dot1l or M55L-Dot1l mutated of a critical residue in the catalytic core, in BAT cells and performed ChIP-qPCR. Dot1l-M55L mutant significantly reduced occupancy of H3K79me3 at the promoter regions of <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Tfam</italic> and <italic>Nrf1</italic>, compared to WT-Dot1l, while not affecting <italic>Gapdh</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results show that Dot1l methyltransferase activity is required for thermogenic gene expression and other Zc3h10 target genes for the BAT gene program.</p><p>To investigate whether Dot1l's function is dependent on its recruitment by Zc3h10 to thermogenic genes, we performed adenoviral overexpression of <italic>Dot1l</italic> (Dot1l OE) and knockdown of <italic>Zc3h10</italic> (Zc3h10 KD) alone or in combination in BAT cells on Day 2 of differentiation. We verified that <italic>Dot1l</italic> was overexpressed by over 6-fold, and <italic>Zc3h10</italic> was knocked down by 50% at the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). As expected, Dot1l overexpression significantly increased thermogenic gene expression including <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Cox8b</italic>, <italic>Cidea</italic>, while Zc3h10 KD significantly decreased these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To examine the functional changes of thermogenic capacity in these BAT cells, we utilized a small molecule thermosensitive fluorescent dye, ERthermAC in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kriszt et al., 2017</xref>). Corresponding to an increase in temperature, ERthermAC can accumulate in the ER to decrease fluorescence and, thus, fluorescence and thermogenesis are inversely correlated. Upon forskolin treatment, the population of ERthermAC<sup>+</sup> cells in Dot1l OE cells was decreased by 10%, which indicated that the cell population with higher temperature was increased by approximately 2.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, Left), calculated by the percent decrease from ERthermAC<sup>+</sup> population in control cells. In contrast, ERthermAC<sup>+</sup> cells in Zc3h10 KD cells were significantly increased by 10%, indicating that <italic>Zc3h10</italic> ablation decreased heat production in BAT cells. Moreover, Zc3h10 KD in Dot1l overexpressing cells showed low ERthermAC<sup>+</sup> cells that were similar to control cells, indicating that <italic>Zc3h10</italic> ablation prevented Dot1l-induced thermogenesis. Furthermore, when we measured OCR by using Seahorse, Dot1l overexpression in Zc3h10 KD BAT cells had the uncoupled OCR comparable to that of Zc3h10 KD, which was significantly lower than the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, Right). These results are in accord with the concept that Dot1l activation of thermogenic genes is dependent on Zc3h10.</p><p>Next, we asked whether Dot1l is required for Zc3h10-induced thermogenesis. To induce Dot1l ablation in vitro, we used <italic>Dot1l</italic> knockout (Dot1l KO) pools generated by the CRISPR-inducible Cas9 system. We then overexpressed Zc3h10 in both control and the Dot1l KO pool and differentiated them. We verified that <italic>Dot1l</italic> was reduced at the mRNA levels and protein levels by approximately 50% in the Dot1l KO pool, and Zc3h10 was overexpressed by more than 80-fold. We found that Dot1l KO pool had significantly decreased <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Dio2</italic>, <italic>Elov3</italic>, <italic>Cox8b</italic>, and <italic>Nrf1</italic> mRNA levels by more than 50% compared to the control BAT cells, while Zc3h10 overexpression increased thermogenic gene expression as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Importantly, Zc3h10 overexpression in Dot1l KO pool did not rescue the decreased BAT- gene expression, remaining in significantly reduced thermogenic gene expression, an evidence that Dot1l is critical for Zc3h10-induced thermogenic gene program. We also utilized ERthermAC to test heat generation in these cells. Zc3h10 OE significantly reduced ERthermAC<sup>+</sup> population in compared to control; while two independent Dot1l KO pools had increased ERthermAC<sup>+</sup> population, indicating decreased thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Notably, Zc3h10 OE did not affect ERthermAC<sup>+</sup> population in Dot1l KO pools. Altogether, these data further show that Dot1l is required for activation of thermogenic genes by Zc3h10.</p><p>We then tested the ability of Dot1l to induce <italic>Ucp1</italic> and other thermogenic genes by gain of function experiment using 3T3-L1 cells. We overexpressed Dot1l or Zc3h10 alone or together via adenoviral transduction in 3T3-L1 cells and the cells were induced to browning by forskolin treatment. We first verified Zc3h10 and Dot1l overexpression by RT-qPCR and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, Dot1l overexpression alone increased <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA levels over two-fold, probably due to the presence of endogenous Dot1l in 3T3-L1 cells. Co-overexpression of both Dot1l and Zc3h10 resulted in a further increase in <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA levels by three-fold and Ucp1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of Dot1l and Zc3h10 together in differentiated 3T3- L1 cells further increased mRNA levels for <italic>Tfam</italic> and <italic>Nrf1</italic> in comparison to Dot1l or Zc3h10 alone. Expression of a terminal adipose gene, FABP4, was not significantly different in all conditions. With increased expression of <italic>Ucp1</italic> and other BAT-enriched genes upon overexpression of Dot1l and Zc3h10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we next assessed the functional consequence of the oxygen consumption. Indeed, forskolin-treated Dot1l alone overexpressing cells had somewhat increased OCR. Co-overexpression of both <italic>Dot1l</italic> and <italic>Zc3h10</italic> further increased the total OCR as well as uncoupled OCR, suggesting cooperative function of Dot1l and Zc3h10 in browning of 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Hence, we performed ChIP-qPCR, to assess methylation status of H3K79 methylation at the Zc3h10 binding region of the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter using BAT of mice. Indeed, we detected a 50% reduction in di-methylation and a 70% reduction in tri-methylation of H3K79 at the −4.6 kb <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, the decreased <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA level upon Dot1l ablation in BAT was correlated with decreased di-methylation and tri-methylation H3K79 at the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter region. Similar to the −4.6 kb <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter region, H3K79 methylation status at the −200 bp <italic>Nrf1</italic> promoter region and at the +50 bp <italic>Tfam</italic> region was also decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We previous reported these regions to contain Zc3h10-binding sites. The reduced H3K79 methylation at Zc3h10 binding sites in BAT of Dot1l-BKO mice suggest that the recruitment of Dot1l by Zc3h10 to the target genes is important for BAT gene expression. Moreover, these observations support the notion that Dot1l participates in the transcriptional activation of <italic>Ucp1</italic> and other Zc3h0 target genes by modifying H3K79 methylation status.</p><p>To examine the effect of Dot1l deficiency on the thermogenic capacity, we subjected these Dot1l-BKO mice to an acute cold exposure at 4°C. While body temperatures of mice were similar initially, Dot1l-BKO mice were severely cold intolerant as their body temperature started to drop significantly after 2 hr of cold challenge. After 3 hr of cold exposure, the body temperature of Dot1l-BKO mice was 5°C lower than that of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), an in vivo evidence of the requirement of Dot1l for cold-induced thermogenesis. Considering such lower thermogenic gene expression and decreased thermogenic capacity, we assessed the metabolic effect in the Dot1l-BKO mice by measuring whole body OCR using CLAMS. Indeed, the Dot1l-BKO mice had significantly reduced VO<sub>2</sub> compared to WT littermates at room temperature and at 4°C in particular, while locomotor activity and food consumption were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To examine the contribution of BAT to the altered energy expenditure in Dot1l-BKO mice, by Seahorse assay, we measured OCR in BAT dissected out from these mice. We found OCR in BAT from Dot1l-BKO mice to be decreased by 20%. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, right). In line with these results, we then asked whether decreased energy expenditure and impaired BAT function in Dot1l-BKO mice would be reflected in changes in adiposity. The body weights of mice started to diverge starting on week 10, then they were maintained on a high-fat-diet (HFD) from week 11 to week 13 of age. By 13 weeks, the Dot1l-BKO mice were approximately 8 g heavier relative to the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), and the Dot1l-BKO had significantly larger iWAT and pWAT depots, which primarily accounted for the higher total body weights of Dot1l-BKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). There were no differences in food/energy intake between the two genotypes despite differences in body weights. In addition, blood glucose levels of Dot1l-BKO mice on HFD were significantly higher during the course of glucose tolerance test (GTT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, Left), and they had significantly impaired insulin sensitivity when subjected to an insulin tolerance test (ITT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, Right). Collectively, these results establish a defective BAT function and impaired thermogenic capacity that affects adiposity and consequently insulin sensitivity in Dot1l-BKO mice and that Dot1l is required for the BAT thermogenic program in vivo.</p><p>Next, to test the in vivo relevance of Dot1l-Zc3h10 interaction to thermogenesis, we overexpressed Zc3h10 in WT and in Dot1l-BKO mice by direct injection of <italic>Zc3h10</italic> adenovirus into BAT. We detected a four-fold increase in <italic>Zc3h10</italic> mRNA levels in BAT of <italic>Zc3h10</italic> adenovirus-injected mice (Zc3h10 OE). As expected, Dot1l-BKO mice showed a 60% reduction in Dot1l mRNA levels in BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). As we previously have reported that overexpression of Zc3h10 in adipose tissue enhances thermogenic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yi et al., 2019</xref>), Zc3h10 overexpressing mice by injection had increased expression of BAT-enriched genes, such as <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Cox8b</italic>, and <italic>Cidea</italic>, compared to the control mice. More importantly, expression BAT-enriched genes remained significantly reduced in Dot1l-BKO even upon Zc3h10 overexpression, while adipogenic markers, such as <italic>Pparg</italic>, remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Moreover, when these mice were subjected to cold exposure, Zc3h10 OE mice had higher core body temperature compared to the control mice after 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). However, Dot1l-BKO Zc3h10 OE mice were severely cold sensitive as their body temperature was significantly lower than the control and Zc3h10 OE mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate the requirement of Dot1l-Zc3h10 interaction, both in vitro and in vivo for activation of the thermogenic program in brown adipose tissue.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Genome wide analysis for Dot1l effect on chromatin accessibility for thermogenic gene program.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ATAC-seq using BAT from WT and Dot1l-BKO mice after 4 hr cold exposure n = 2 per group. (Left) Heatmaps showing open chromatin regions focused at the transcription start site (TSS).

To study the underlying mechanism of how Dot1l ablation in BAT decreases H3K79me2/3 to decrease chromatin accessibility, thereby decreasing gene transcription, we used nuclei isolated from cold exposed Dot1l-BKO mice and their littermates to assess the chromatin landscape during thermogenesis by Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq). Strikingly, our analyses found approximately 20,000 peaks per condition (WT and Dot1l-BKO). We detected a high number of peaks in the aggregate plot (upper) and high ATAC-seq read distributions concentrated at the TSS in the heatmap for the WT (lower), while Dot1l-BKO had significantly reduced peaks near the transcription start sites (TSS), signifying reduced open chromatin regions, as H3K79 methylation has been reported as an activation marker. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left). To gain comprehensive understanding of the genome wide chromatin structure changes, we examined the pathways that are affected by Dot1l ablation in BAT using Gene Ontology. The most affected pathways were cell cycle, chromatin organization, mitochondrion organization, thermogenesis etc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, middle). With our primary interest in assessing Dot1l’s role in the regulation of thermogenesis, we compared relative ATAC-seq peaks for thermogenic genes, such as <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Cox8b</italic>, and <italic>Cox7a</italic>, in response to Dot1l ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, middle). Dot1l-BKO mice had much smaller peaks around promoters of <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Cox8b</italic>, and <italic>Cox7a</italic> compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right), consistent with significantly decreased thermogenic gene expression in the Dot1l-BKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These data suggest that H3K79me2/3 by Dot1l is important for creating a chromatin landscape permissive to transcription in BAT upon cold stimulation.</p><p>Next, to examine gene expression changes upon Dot1l ablation in <italic>Ucp1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells as a result of chromatin compaction, we performed RNA-seq using BAT from Dot1l-BKO mice and their littermates. Gene ontology of genes that were at least two-fold downregulated in Dot1l-BKO mice revealed that mitochondrion organization, oxidative phosphorylation and cold-induced thermogenesis were some of the most affected processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right). Notably, the downregulated thermogenic genes include <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Cox8b</italic>, <italic>Elovl3</italic>, and <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> as well as those related to mitochondrion organization and oxidative phosphorylation such as <italic>Nrf1</italic>, <italic>Cox20</italic>, <italic>Tomm13</italic>, and <italic>Immp21</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left). Also, we found Dot1l-BKO had decreased expression of <italic>Aifm2</italic>, a recently reported BAT-specific enzyme that converts NADH to NAD to sustain robust glycolysis to fuel thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, regulation of triglyceride and carbohydrate catabolism were compromised by Dot1l ablation. Conversely, chromosome organization, negative regulation of telomere maintenance, response to DNA damage were upregulated in the Dot1l knockout. In fact, we detected upregulated genes involved in chromatin compaction and gene repression, such as <italic>Hdac3</italic>, <italic>Hdac4</italic>, and <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, further supporting that Dot1l increases chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right). With ATAC-seq results, these data suggest a mechanistic link between Dot1l-mediated chromatin remodeling and the global landscape of genome accessibility in brown fat for thermogenic gene expression.</p><p>We then compared RNA-seq data to ATAC-seq obtained to identify common downregulated pathways found at lower levels using ATACs upon Dot1l ablation in <italic>Ucp1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, and we found about 82% of the total of downregulated genes were also detected from the ATAC-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left). Some of similar processes between the two datasets include regulation of cold-induced thermogenesis, mitochondrial transcription and membrane organization, oxidative phosphorylation, and lipid catabolic process, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, right). Remarkably, the cluster of shared genes included thermogenic genes, such <italic>as Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Ppargc1a, Cox8b</italic>, <italic>Nrf1</italic>, and <italic>Cidea</italic>, further underscoring the importance of Dot1l in brown adipose tissue. This demonstrate that Dot1l ablation results in reduced chromatin accessibility, leading to downregulated gene expression for those specific pathways. Altogether, we conclude that H3K79me2/3 by Dot1l plays a critical role in thermogenic gene activation by increasing chromatin accessibility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Numerous studies have supported the concept that a network of transcription factors and epigenetic coregulators must work together to fine-tune thermogenic program in response to environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sambeat et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we identify Dot1l, the only known H3K79 methyltransferase, as an interacting partner of Zc3h10, a transcriptional factor that activates <italic>Ucp1</italic>, as well as <italic>Tfam</italic> and <italic>Nrf1</italic>, for thermogenesis. We show that Dot1l is recruited by Zc3h10 to the <italic>Ucp1</italic> and other thermogenic genes. We demonstrate that Dot1l directly interacts with Zc3h10 to co-occupy the same region of the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter. Zc3h10 binds to Dot1l via the 501-1000aa fragment, which is largely composed of coiled coil domains, evolutionarily conserved and widely known for protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mier et al., 2017</xref>). This same coiled coil domain has been reported to interact with some of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) oncogenic fusion proteins, such as AF10, to induce H3K79 methylation and constitutively activate a leukemic transcription program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we show that Dot1l is required for Zc3h10's function for thermogenic gene program. In fact, Zc3h10 overexpression could not rescue the decreased thermogenic gene expression upon Dot1l ablation in mice, demonstrating that Dot1l is critical in Zc3h10-mediated activation of thermogenesis.</p><p>We establish that H3K79me2/3, catalyzed by Dot1l, as an activation mark for thermogenic gene program. In this regard, previous studies reported that H3K79 methylation is strongly associated with active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Steger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wood et al., 2018</xref>). Our Dot1l-BKO mice showed a markedly less open chromatin regions in promoter regions of thermogenic genes. The ATAC-seq data showed significantly reduced peaks genome-wide near the transcription start sites (TSS) in BAT of Dot1l-BKO mice, compared to control mice that had concentrated open chromatin regions at TSS upon cold exposure. In addition, studies reported that H3K79me2/3 may be active enhancer marks and may even be required for enhancer-promoter interactions to increase transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gilan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Godfrey et al., 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Godfrey et al., 2019</xref> found H3K79me2/3 to be abundant at a subset of super-enhancers in MLL-related leukemia cells and that a loss of H3K79me2/3 by DOT1L inhibition led to significantly reduced enhancer-promoter interaction coupled with a decrease in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Godfrey et al., 2019</xref>). We show that Dot1l is recruited by Zc3h10 to the −4.6 kb upstream region of <italic>Ucp1</italic>, a region suggested to be one of so-called super enhancers (SEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harms et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, Dot1l ablation in BAT of mice resulted in a significantly reduction of H3K79me2/3 at the −4.6 kb <italic>Ucp1</italic> region, correlating with decreased expression of <italic>Ucp1</italic>. It is possible that H3K79me2/3 catalyzed by Dot1l may be important in maintaining enhancer/promoter association for transcriptional activation.</p><p>Due to limited accessibility of the H3K79 residue, located in the nucleosome core, how H3K79 methylation promotes gene activation is not clearly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Leeuwen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). Several studies support the concept that H3K79me2/3 and other well-profiled gene activation marks are interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Steger et al., 2008</xref>). Steger et al. demonstrated that H3K79me2/3 at gene promoters highly correlates with H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K36me3, known gene activation marks in mammalian cells. Furthermore, Chen et al. reported that DOT1L may inhibit the localization of SIRT1 and SUV39H1, a H3K9ac demethylase and a H3K9me2 methyltransferase, respectively, at MLL fusion target genes correlating with elevated H3K9ac and low H3K9me2, to maintain an open chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). These authors proposed that H3K79me2/3 mark, in part, may function by inhibiting the histone deacetylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kang et al., 2018</xref>). In line with these findings, Dot1l probably works with other histone modifiers to maintain activation marks or to suppress repressive marks. Regardless, we establish that H3K79me2 and H3K79me3, in particular, function as activation marks for thermogenic gene program.</p><p>Overall, we demonstrate that Dot1l is critical for thermogenic program through H3K79 methylation and the requirement of Dot1l-Zc3h10 interaction for brown adipose thermogenesis in vitro and in vivo. With combined ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data, we provide molecular evidence that the decreased thermogenic gene expression is due to decreased H3K79me2/3 on promoter regions of thermogenic genes, as well as genes involved in chromatin remodeling. Consequently, our mouse line of <italic>Dot1l</italic> ablated in Ucp1<sup>+</sup> cells show significantly decreased expression of thermogenic genes, including <italic>Ucp1</italic>, resulting in cold intolerance with decreased oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–G</xref>), leading to increased adiposity as well as insulin insensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Dot1l</italic></td><td>GenBank</td><td>ID: 208266</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21(DE3)</td><td valign="top">NEB</td><td valign="top">C2527H</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ES cell line Dot1ltm1a(KOMP)</td><td valign="top">KOMP Repository</td><td valign="top">MMRRC:054749-UCD</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Dot1l</italic>-G55L</td><td>This lab</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapien</italic>)</td><td>HEK293</td><td>UCB Cell Culture Facility</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0045">CVCL_0045</ext-link></td><td>Authenticated using STR analysis</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>3T3-L1</td><td>UCB Cell Culture Facility</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0123">CVCL_0123</ext-link></td><td>Authenticated using STR analysis</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>BAT cells</td><td>Shingo Kajimura <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohno et al., 2013</xref></td><td/><td>Harvard;

Two stable <italic>Dot1l</italic> sgRNA expressing cell lines were generated by transducing in inducible Cas9 cells with lentivirus containing two sgRNA with target sequences of <named-content content-type="sequence">GTCTCGTGCAGCATAACCAG</named-content>, or <named-content content-type="sequence">ACGCCGTGTTGTATGCATCT</named-content> (Abmgood) and were then selected by neomycin (400 μg/ml). These <italic>Dot1l</italic> KO pools were subjected to brown adipocyte differentiation. After 48 hr of induction, cells were treated with doxycycline (1 µg/ml).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Oxygen consumption measurement</title><p>BAT cells were differentiated in 12-well plates, trysinized, and reseeded in XF24 plates at 50 K cells per well at day 4 of differentiation and assayed on day 5 of differentiation. On the day of experiments, the cells were washed three times and maintained in XF-DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 17.5 mM glucose. Oxygen consumption was blocked by 1 μM oligomycin. Maximal respiratory capacity was assayed by the addition of 1 μM FCCP. Tissues were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C without CO<sub>2</sub> prior to analysis on the Seahorse XF24 Analyzer. Uncoupled respiration was calculated as OCR under oligomycin treatment minus OCR under antimycin A/rotenone treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RT-qPCR analysis and western blotting</title><p>Reverse transcription was performed with 500 ng of total RNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). RT-qPCR was performed in triplicate with an ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) to quantify the relative mRNA levels for various genes. Statistical analysis of the qPCR was obtained using the ΔΔCt (2^-ddCT) method with Eef1a1 or 18 s as the control. RT-qPCR primer sets are listed in Key resources table. Library generation for RNA sequencing was carried out at the Functional Genomics Laboratory at UC Berkeley.</p><p>For western blot analysis, total cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer and nuclear extracts were prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Thermo). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with the indicated antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Luciferase-reporter assay</title><p>HEK293 cells were transfected with 300 ng <italic>Zc3h10</italic> and/or <italic>Dot1l</italic> expression plasmid, together with 100 ng of indicated luciferase reporter construct and 0.5 ng pRL-CMV in 24-well plates. Cells were lysed 48 hr post-transfection and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>The HA-<italic>Dot1l</italic> expression vector was purchased from Genecopoeia. The <italic>Dot1l</italic> sequence was subcloned by PCR amplifying and inserting into CTAP vector from Agilent, as well as pGEX-4T-3 from GE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Coimmunoprecipitation</title><p>For Co-IP experiments using tagged constructs, HEK293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 to express FLAG-tagged <italic>Zc3h10</italic> and HA-tagged <italic>Dot1l</italic>. Cells were lysed in IP buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors. Total cell lysates were incubated 2 hr at 4°C with either anti-FLAG M2 for <italic>Zc3h10</italic> or anti-HA for Dot1l. For Co-IP in brown adipose tissue of wild-type mice, nuclear extraction was carried out using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Thermo). Equal amounts of nuclear extracts were incubated with specific antibodies and protein A/G agarose beads overnight at 4°C. Agarose beads were washed three times and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>ChIP-qPCR</title><p>ChIP was performed using ChIP kit (Cell signaling, 56383 s). Briefly, BAT cells overexpressing Dot1l or Zc3h10 were fixed with disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) at 2 mM concentration in PBS for 45 min at room temperature before cross-linking with 1% methanol-free formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. For ChIP experiments using BAT, tissues from 3 BATs were combined and minced on ice. The reaction was stopped by incubating with 125 mM glycine for 10 min. Cells or tissues were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for three times, and lysed in IP lysis buffer containing 500 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 140 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors for 10 min at 4°C. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Nuclei were released by douncing on ice and collected by centrifugation. Nuclei were then lysed in nuclei lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% SDS 10 mM EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitors, and sonicated three times by 20 s burst, each followed by 1 min cooling on ice. Chromatin samples were diluted 1:10 with the dilution buffer containing 16.7 mM Tris pH 8.1, 0.01% SDS 1.1% Triton X-100 1.2 mM EDTA, 1.67 mM NaCl, and proteinase inhibitor cocktail. Soluble chromatin was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm, and equivalent amounts of input DNA were immunoprecipitated using 10 μg of indicated antibodies or normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) and protein A/G magnetic beads (Thermo-Fisher). After the beads were washed and cross-linking reversed, DNA fragments were purified using the Simple ChIP kit (cell signaling). Samples were analyzed by qPCR for enrichment in target areas. The promoter occupancy for <italic>Ucp1</italic> and other indicated genes was confirmed by RT-qPCR. The fold enrichment values were normalized to input.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>WT and Dot1l-BKO mice were cold exposed for 4 hr. Total RNA from BAT was prepared using RNEasy kit (Qiagen). Strand-specific libraries were generated from 500 ng total RNA using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina). cDNA libraries were pair-end sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000. Using Partek software, reads were aligned to the mouse genome (NCBI38/mm10). A gene was included in the analysis if it met all the following criteria: the maximum RPKM reached four unit at any time point, the gene length was &gt;100 bp. Selected genes were induced at least +/- 1.8 fold, and the expression was significantly different from the basal (p&lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>ATAC-seq</title><p>For ATAC-seq, we used two mice per condition and processed nuclei extracted from BAT separately, thus each sample analyzed was a separate biological replicate. ATAC-seq was performed using Nextera DNA library Preparation kit (Illumina, 15028212) according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>. In all, 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> nuclei from tissues were collected in lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and 1% NP-40, and spun at 500 × g at 4°C for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in the transposase reaction mixture containing 25 μL 2 × Tagmentation buffer, 2.5 μL transposase, and 22.5 μL nuclease-free water, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The samples were purified using MinElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, 28006) and amplification was performed in 1 × next PCR master mix (NEB, M0541S) and 1.25 μM of custom Nextera PCR primers 1 and 2 with the following PCR conditions: 72°C for 5 min; 98°C for 30 s; and thermocycling at 98°C for 10 s, 63°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. Samples were amplified for five cycles and 5 μL of the PCR reaction was used to determine the required cycles of amplification by qPCR. The remaining 45 μL reaction was amplified with the determined cycles and purified with MinElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, 28006) yielding a final library concentration of ~30 nM in 20 μL. Libraries were subjected to pair-end 50 bp sequencing on HiSeq4000 with 4–6 indexed libraries per lane. Partek Flow Genomics Suite was used to analyze sequencing data. Reads were aligned to mm10 genome assembly using BWA-backtrack. MACS2 in ATAC mode was then used to identify peaks from the aligned reads with a q-value cutoff of 0.05 and fold enrichment cutoff of 2.0. Quantify regions tool was used to quantify the peaks identified by MACS2 from each sample to generate a union set of regions. Regions were then annotated to RefSeq mRNA database and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine significant peak differences between groups. Gene set enrichment and pathway analysis was used to highlight biological processes with the highest q-values among those identified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical comparisons were made using a two-tailed unpaired t-test using GraphPad Prism eight software (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA). For genome-wide analyses, we employed Partek Genomics Suite (Partek Inc, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) using ANOVA for ATAC-seq comparisons, and DESeq2 for RNA-seq differential expression comparisons, and subsequently used Gene set enrichment tool for gene ontology to identify the significantly affected pathways. Data are expressed as means ± standard errors of the means (SEM). The statistical differences in mean values were assessed by Student's <italic>t</italic> test. All experiments were performed at least twice and representative data are shown.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work was supported by NIH grant

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this article, the authors sought to identify interacting partner(s) of Zc3h10, a transcription factor that activates expression of UCP-1 and other brown-adipocyte-specific genes. They identified the H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1L as an epigenetic modifier that interacts with Zc3h10 and facilitates its action on UCP-1 and other brown-adipocyte-specific genes. The strength of the manuscript is that the hypotheses were examined by a wide range of approaches, including protein-protein interaction assays, cell culture studies, and animal models. The present data provide solid evidence for an important role of Dot1L in the regulation of brown-adipocyte-specific genes. At the same time, all of the reviewers believed that the mechanisms involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by Dot1L need to be investigated in more depth. Because the roles and the regulation of H3K79 methylation are still not fully understood, it would advance the field if the authors could provide additional data along these lines.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The protein expression of Dot1L appears disproportionally specific to brown adipose tissue compared with the mRNA expression. Is there a protein-gene difference? Is the identity of the band correct? Can the author see the loss of the band in the BKO tissues?</p><p>2) Most of the experiments appear to have been performed under basal conditions (e.g. unstimulated cells, room temperature mice). Dot1L expression increases with cold exposure and in their previous study that Zc3h10 is recruited to thermogenic gene promoters by p38 MAPK phosphorylation in response to adrenergic activation. The present study would benefit from additional experiments demonstrating a dynamic role for Dot1L in thermogenic gene transcription during cold exposure. Does cold exposure/adrenergic activation modulate Dot1L-Zc3h10 interaction, Dot1L recruitment to thermogenic gene promoters, H3K79 methylation, etc. in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner?</p><p>3) The authors conclude that &quot;these results show that Dot1L methyltransferase activity is required for thermogenic gene expression and other Zc3h10 target genes for the BAT gene program&quot; and that &quot;Dot1L enzymatic activity is critical for activating the thermogenic gene program in vivo&quot;. These statements are not yet strongly supported. The involvement of H3K79 methylation was implied through the use of a chemical inhibitor EPZ5676 (Figure 2C and Figure 3) and the reduction of H3K79me3 levels in whole-cell lysates (Figure 3B). Can the authors confirm the change of H3K79 methylation at brown-adipocyte-specific genes by conducting ChIP-qPCR in the experiments where they modulate either expression or enzymatic activity of Dot1L? In addition, the authors could compare the effect of the overexpression of wild-type Dot1L (Figure 2D) with a mutant Dot1L in which critical residue(s) are substituted in the enzyme catalytic core.</p><p>4) In Figure 4D, ChIP-qPCR shows the reduction of H3K79me2 and H3K79me3 enrichment on thermogenic gene promoters in Dot1L knockout BAT. It would be informative to examine changes in Dot1L and Zc3h10 binding on the same regions in BAT.</p><p>5) Although not absolutely required, it would be ideal to look at global epigenetic changes following induction or inhibition of Zc3h10 and/or Dot1L. Of particular interest is whether Zc3h10 plays any role in tethering Dot1L and modulating H3K79 methylation at brown-adipocyte-specific genes and whether the epigenetic changes induced by are specific to brown adipocyte function or not. The authors should consider performing ChIP-seq for H3K79me2/3 and Zc3h10. The use of tagged protein is an alternative if the antibody is not available for the latter. H3K79me2/3 reportedly marks a subset of enhancers (Godfrey et al., 2019). It is also of interest whether such H3K79me2/3-marked enhancers are enriched in the vicinity of the brown-adipocyte-specific genes.</p><p>6) The raw ATAC-seq data show very high background (Figure 5A). How many peak calls were obtained? Improvement is necessary to discuss the qualitative differences. Please consider the use of culture cells if the technical hurdle is caused by the use of tissue samples. Further, the pattern of the aggregate plots (Figure 5A left upper) does not obviously match that of the heatmaps (Figure 5A, left lower). Please describe exactly what is shown in the figure. Are the scales the same for each panel or the heatmaps zoom in the area indicated by the red dotted boxes in the aggregate plot? What do the red dotted boxes mean? What does color scale bar in the middle heatmap mean?</p><p>7) Also related the ATAC data, Figure 5C suggests that loss of Dot1L alters chromatin accessibility at far more genes than is represented in the &quot;Shared processes&quot; pathway analysis. It would be helpful to see a more comprehensive analysis of the ATAC-seq data (is thermogenesis one of the top pathways, what other pathways are affected, is the Zc3h10 binding motif overrepresented at sites of increased chromatin accessibility? etc.) and discussion about why the ATAC-seq changes might be more general/less specific than the RNA-seq changes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59990.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The protein expression of Dot1L appears disproportionally specific to brown adipose tissue compared with the mRNA expression.

We repeated the western blotting (Figure 1D). There was no significant discrepancy between protein and mRNA levels of Dot1L. We also quantified the intensity of the bands of western blot (Figure 1D), which showed protein levels of Dot1L relative to GAPDH protein levels, correlating with the mRNA expression. In order to verify that the Dot1L protein band in Figure 1D is specific, we performed western blot using lysates of BAT from WT and Dot1L-BKO BAT (conditional Dot1L KO in BAT) (Figure 4A, right). Indeed, Dot1L protein level was detected highly in WT, while it was greatly lower in Dot1L-BKO confirming that the detected band indeed represented Dot1L.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Most of the experiments appear to have been performed under basal conditions (e.g. unstimulated cells, room temperature mice).

We now made this point clear in the manuscript and figure legends. Furthermore, we examined the Dot1L-Zc3h10 interaction in cold-exposed mouse BAT by CoIP (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). BAT lysates from mice housed at room temperature or 4°C were immunoprecipitated with either IgG or Dot1L and immunoblotted with Zc3h10. We previously showed that the binding of Zc3h10 to the UCP1 promoter is increased in a cold exposure/p38 MAPK-dependent manner (Yi et al., 2019). However, as we did not detect any difference between conditions, Dot1L-Zc3h10 interaction is not dependent on cold exposure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors conclude that &quot;these results show that Dot1L methyltransferase activity is required for thermogenic gene expression and other Zc3h10 target genes for the BAT gene program&quot; and that &quot;Dot1L enzymatic activity is critical for activating the thermogenic gene program in vivo&quot;. These statements are not yet strongly supported. The involvement of H3K79 methylation was implied through the use of a chemical inhibitor EPZ5676 (Figure 2C and Figure 3) and the reduction of H3K79me3 levels in whole-cell lysates (Figure 3B). Can the authors confirm the change of H3K79 methylation at brown-adipocyte-specific genes by conducting ChIP-qPCR in the experiments where they modulate either expression or enzymatic activity of Dot1L? In addition, the authors could compare the effect of the overexpression of wild-type Dot1L (Figure 2D) with a mutant Dot1L in which critical residue(s) are substituted in the enzyme catalytic core.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already shown that decreased Dot1L expression in Dot1L-BKO mice significantly reduces H3K79me2/3 at thermogenic genes by ChIP-qPCR using chromatin from WT and Dot1L-BKO mice in Figure 4D. In order to confirm that the decrease of thermogenic gene expression is due to the enzymatic activity of Dot1L, we overexpressed Dot1L in differentiated BAT cells and treated with EPZ5676, Dot1L inhibitor (10uM), then performed ChIP-qPCR for H3K79me3. EPZ5676 is a highly selective Dot1L inhibitor as it occupies the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding pocket and inhibits the enzymatic activity of Dot1L (Diagle et al., 2013). EPZ5676 treated cells had significantly decreased H3K79me3 at -4.6kb UCP1 region as well as Tfam and Nrf1 promoter regions, while having no difference at the GAPDH promoter region as compared to the control cells (Figure 2D).</p><p>Moreover, as the reviewer proposed, we generated M55L-Dot1L mutated of a critical residue in the catalytic core. M55 is located at the N-terminal domain reported to be critical for histone substrate binding site and affects demethylase catalytic activity (Zhu et al., 2018). We overexpressed WT-Dot1L as well as the Dot1L mutant in BAT cells and performed ChIP-qPCR (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Dot1L-M55L mutant significantly reduced H3K79me3 at the promoter regions of UCP1, Tfam and Nrf1, compared to WT-Dot1L, while not affecting GAPDH (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Taken together, based on ChIP-qPCR in the experiments in which expression or enzymatic activity of Dot1L is modulated using both the inhibitor and the mutant, the enzymatic activity of Dot1L is critical for increasing H3K79 methylation at thermogenic genes, thereby increasing thermogenic gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 4D, ChIP-qPCR shows the reduction of H3K79me2 and H3K79me3 enrichment on thermogenic gene promoters in Dot1L knockout BAT. It would be informative to examine changes in Dot1L and Zc3h10 binding on the same regions in BAT.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. In order to show that Dot1L and Zc3h10 bind on the same regions of thermogenic genes, we performed reChIP-qPCR using Zc3h10 and Dot1L antibodies sequentially (Figure 1H, right). We observed significant enrichment of Dot1L for -4.6 kb region of the UCP1 promoter when we first used Zc3h10 antibody followed by Dot1L antibody, and this enrichment was similar to that of Zc3h10 alone. There was no enrichment observed in the control, GAPDH promoter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Although not absolutely required, it would be ideal to look at global epigenetic changes following induction or inhibition of Zc3h10 and/or Dot1L. Of particular interest is whether Zc3h10 plays any role in tethering Dot1L and modulating H3K79 methylation at brown-adipocyte-specific genes and whether the epigenetic changes induced by are specific to brown adipocyte function or not. The authors should consider performing ChIP-seq for H3K79me2/3 and Zc3h10. The use of tagged protein is an alternative if the antibody is not available for the latter. H3K79me2/3 reportedly marks a subset of enhancers (Godfrey et al., 2019). It is also of interest whether such H3K79me2/3-marked enhancers are enriched in the vicinity of the brown-adipocyte-specific genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done ChIP-seq for Zc3h10 in our previous paper and have shown that Zc3h10 binds to -4.6 kb UCP1 promoter region as well as Tfam and Nrf1 (Yi et al., 2019). Although it would be interesting to examine the global epigenetic changes H3K79 methylation by Dot1L, we showed by reChIP-qPCR that Dot1L and Zc3h10 occupy the same regions of thermogenic genes, such as -4.6 kb UCP1 and +50 bp Tfam (Figure 1H). In addition, we showed a decrease of H3K79me2/3 in Dot1L-BKO mice in the same regions of theses thermogenic gene promoters, indicating that Dot1L is recruited by Zc3h10 to the vicinity of the brown-adipocyte-specific genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The raw ATAC-seq data show very high background (Figure 5A). How many peak calls were obtained? Improvement is necessary to discuss the qualitative differences. Please consider the use of culture cells if the technical hurdle is caused by the use of tissue samples. Further, the pattern of the aggregate plots (Figure 5A left upper) does not obviously match that of the heatmaps (Figure 5A, left lower). Please describe exactly what is shown in the figure. Are the scales the same for each panel or the heatmaps zoom in the area indicated by the red dotted boxes in the aggregate plot? What do the red dotted boxes mean? What does color scale bar in the middle heatmap mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our ATAC-seq data had high background. During this revision, we re-performed ATAC-seq with WT and Dot1L-BKO BAT. At this time, we cold-exposed mice for 4 hrs, longer than the previous time to demonstrate an obvious difference in the chromatin structure between samples. Our analyses found approximately 20,000 peaks per condition (WT and Dot1L-BKO). For the WT sample, we detect a high number of peaks in the aggregate plot (upper) and high ATAC-seq read distributions concentrated at the TSS in the heatmap for the WT (lower), while Dot1L-BKO had significantly reduced peaks near the transcription start sites (TSS), signifying reduced open chromatin regions. The pattern of the aggregate plots now match that of the heatmaps. Scales within each panel are the same, for the ATAC-seq heatmaps the color scale indicates the number of individual genes associated with the peaks identified. With our primary interest in assessing Dot1L’s role in the regulation of thermogenesis, we compared ATAC-seq peaks for thermogenic genes, such as UCP1, Cox8b and Cox7a1 in response to Dot1L ablation (Figure 5A right). The dotted boxes were used to point out the difference in peak intensity in WT and Dot1L-BKO, and nothing is modified or zoomed in.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Also related the ATAC data, Figure 5C suggests that loss of Dot1L alters chromatin accessibility at far more genes than is represented in the &quot;Shared processes&quot; pathway analysis. It would be helpful to see a more comprehensive analysis of the ATAC-seq data (is thermogenesis one of the top pathways, what other pathways are affected, is the Zc3h10 binding motif overrepresented at sites of increased chromatin accessibility? etc.) and discussion about why the ATAC-seq changes might be more general/less specific than the RNA-seq changes.</p></disp-quote><p>To gain comprehensive understanding of the genome wide chromatin structure changes, we now examined the pathways that are affected by Dot1L ablation in BAT using Gene Ontology, instead of picking out individual genes. Some of the most affected pathways are cell cycle, chromatin organization, mitochondrion organization, thermogenesis etc. (Figure 5A middle). Thermogenesis is not one of the top pathways, however, it is one of the significant. Based on the motif analysis, a number of motifs are CC doublets or GC rich similar to the Zc3h10 binding motif, TYCCNG, that we identified from SELEX data and ChIP-seq data in the WT samples (Yi et al., 2019). While this motif is not yet present in the Partek flow database, there are several similar motifs, such as that for E2F8 (TTTCCCG) and TEAD3 (TWCCD), that are overrepresented in open chromatin regions in the WT and not the Dot1L-KO. In fact, we detected a significant difference in CC doublets or GC rich, which are similar to the Zc3h10 binding motif, between the WT and KO samples. ATAC-seq demonstrates open chromatin regions which can help predict increased transcription because it creates an environment permissive to transcription factor recruitment while RNA-seq actually shows the transcripts being produced.</p></body></sub-article></article>
