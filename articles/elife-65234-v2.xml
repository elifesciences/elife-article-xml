cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinoma (Hastings et al., 2020). Here, we advanced this model system and identified a non-genetic mechanism of resistance that drives recovery and regrowth in a subset of cells. Using RNAseq and a suite of biosensors to track single-cell fates both in vitro and in vivo, we identified that early S phase cells have a greater ability to maintain proliferative capacity, which correlated with reduced DNA damage over multiple generations. In contrast, cells in G1, late S or those treated with PARP/RAD51 inhibitors, maintained higher levels of DNA damage and underwent prolonged S/G2 phase arrest and senescence. Combined with our previous work, these data indicate that there is a non-genetic mechanism of resistance in human lung adenocarcinoma that is dependent on the cell cycle stage at the time of cisplatin exposure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>53BP1</kwd><kwd>PARP1</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>BRCA1</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001026</institution-id><institution>National Breast Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IIRS-18-103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burgess</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tour de Cure</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSP-230-2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burgess</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001171</institution-id><institution>Cancer Institute NSW</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10/FRL/3-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burgess</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001171</institution-id><institution>Cancer Institute NSW</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013/FRL102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Croucher</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001171</institution-id><institution>Cancer Institute NSW</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15/REG/1-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Croucher</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Platinum chemotherapy resistance is a complex process involving multiple signalling pathways and a novel, non-genetic, cell cycle-dependent mechanism that promotes tumour regrowth and highlights potential complications for combination therapies in human lung adenocarcinoma.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common form of lung cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death in Australia. Less than 15% of patients have a targetable driver mutation and therefore cannot benefit from targeted therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herbst et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, the overwhelming majority of LUAD patients receive platinum-based chemotherapy as standard of care. The anti-tumour abilities of platinum compounds were first identified over 50 years ago with the discovery of cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelland, 2007</xref>). Since then, cisplatin and its derivatives have become one of the most successful groups of chemotherapeutics ever developed. Platinum therapy is essentially curative in testicular cancer, with survival rates &gt; 90%, and is also a frontline treatment for small-cell lung cancer, ovarian, head and neck, bladder, and cervical cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez-Rajal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelland, 2007</xref>). Unfortunately, response rates to platinum in LUAD are below 30%, due primarily to innate resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herbst et al., 2018</xref>). Nearly 150 different mechanisms of platinum resistance have been identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stewart, 2007</xref>). The vast majority of these mechanisms have been derived from preclinical models that utilise continuous, high-dose-exposure models, well above what is physiologically achievable in patients. Unsurprisingly, the majority of these models have failed to translate into improved clinical outcomes. To overcome this, we recently demonstrated that analysis of an in vitro assay that accurately models the in vivo drug exposure kinetics for cisplatin could provide therapeutically relevant insights into the signalling dynamics associated with innate resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2020</xref>). Cisplatin is given to patients as a single bolus dose, reaching a peak plasma concentration of ~14 µM (5 µg/ml), which is then rapidly cleared by the kidneys within 2–4 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Urien and Lokiec, 2004</xref>). We therefore mimicked this in vitro by pulsing cells for 2 hr with the maximum plasma concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Once inside cells, platinum compounds can bind to DNA, RNA, and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez-Rajal et al., 2020</xref>); however, the binding to DNA, which forms platinum-DNA adducts, is thought to be the primary mechanism for their tumour-specific killing. Intra-strand DNA-platinum adducts are repaired by base excision and nucleotide excision repair during G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Slyskova et al., 2018</xref>). Inter-strand crosslinks (ICLs) are removed largely by the Fanconi anaemia (FA) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smogorzewska, 2019</xref>), which generates single- and double-strand breaks that are resolved by either the high-fidelity homologous recombination (HR) pathway during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karanam et al., 2012</xref>) or by the error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway during G1 and G2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Enoiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Slyskova et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, targeting DNA repair pathways has become a major focus for enhancing platinum chemotherapies. For example, cells with defective HR repair have been shown to be highly sensitive to combination therapy with cisplatin and PARP inhibitors in a number of cancer types, including ovarian and breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tutt et al., 2018</xref>). However, correlation between cisplatin sensitivity and impaired DNA repair has often failed to translate clinically in LUAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mamdani and Jalal, 2016</xref>). In contrast, we have recently identified TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marini et al., 2018</xref>) and P70S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2020</xref>) as key mediators of innate platinum resistance in LUAD. We now build upon these previous results and identify in this research advance that a sub-population of cells are capable of continued proliferation despite exposure to pulsed cisplatin. Using a combination of cell cycle, DNA damage, and replication biosensors together with real-time single-cell fate tracking, we identified that these proliferative cells were enriched in late G1/early S phase at the time of cisplatin exposure and were able to sufficiently repair their DNA over multiple generations and rounds of replication. These results increase our understanding of the complexities underlying non-genetic resistance and recovery mechanisms in LUAD, while also highlighting mechanistic issues with a number of current clinical trials focused on combination therapy with cisplatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cells remain equally sensitive upon re-exposure to pulsed cisplatin</title><p>In our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2020</xref>), we identified several targetable signalling pathways that were associated with resistance to cisplatin in LUAD cells. In this work, our goal was to analyse the innate mechanisms that enable cell survival after the initial exposure to cisplatin. To assess this, we analysed how cells respond to a subsequent dose of cisplatin, following recovery from an initial exposure event. To do this, we pulsed cells with cisplatin (5 µg/ml) and followed their response by time-lapse imaging. Cells were allowed to recover for 21–42 days (depending on their base rate of proliferation), before being challenged again with cisplatin, which equates to the approximate time patients normally receive a second dose in the clinic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We utilised three LUAD cell lines: A549 (wild-type p53), NCI-H1573 (p53<sup>R248L</sup> mutant), and NCI-H1299 (p53 null), which were all engineered to stably express histone H2B fused to mCherry, allowing real-time quantitation of cell number and nuclear size. The initial pulse of cisplatin blocked the proliferation of A549 and NCI-H1573 cells, and significantly reduced NCI-H1299 cell numbers over a 3-day period. This was mirrored in colony formation assays, with both A549 and NCI-H1573 showing strong suppression of colony outgrowth, while p53-null H1299 cells were impacted to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, there was a less noticeable effect on cell confluence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Subsequent visual and quantitative analysis of cells by immunofluorescence revealed a corresponding two- to sixfold increase in total cell and nuclear area across all three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>), accounting for the reduced impact on confluence. Over the following 7–21 days of recovery (42 days for NCI-H1573 due to slower rate of proliferation), cells eventually recovered to their pre-pulse size and normal cell cycle distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In all three cell lines, subsequent cisplatin pulse of recovered cultures resulted in a near identical response to the initial pulse, both in terms of inhibition of cell number, reduced confluence, and increased cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Based on these results, and our previous observation that all cells contained significantly increased levels of cisplatin-DNA adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2020</xref>), we concluded that cells surviving the first exposure remained equally sensitive to cisplatin and were therefore unlikely to have acquired resistance or arisen from an intrinsically resistant sub-clonal population within each cell line.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rechallenging lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells with cisplatin results in similar response profiles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of rechallenging experiments.

In support, a significant increase in senescence associated beta-galactosidase (β-gal) staining was observed both visually and by flow cytometry (C12FDG) in A549 and to a lesser extent H1573 and H1299 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16, which is commonly linked with senescence, was associated with larger cells in NCI-H1573 and H1299 cells, while in A549 cells, which are null for p16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawabe et al., 2000</xref>), p21 was similarly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Briefly, each cell line was co-transfected with three different lentiviral vectors containing either a red, green, or blue fluorescent protein. Each cell randomly received a variable amount of each plasmid resulting in a unique colour code for each cell. Quantitative colour analysis of untreated control cells revealed that up to 64 unique colours could be detected in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells and up to 46 colours in NCI-H1573 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). After pulsed exposure to cisplatin, single-colour colony outgrowths were clearly visible in all three cell lines at 3–7 days post exposure, which was maintained at 21 for A549 and NCI-H1299 or 42 days for NCI-H1573 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Colour diversity in cisplatin-recovered cells correlated with the colony formation assay data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), with NCI-H1299 (p53 null) cells displaying a greater variability in recovered clonal colours compared to A549 (p53 wt) and NCI-H1573 (p53 mutant) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that repopulation of the culture after the initial pulse exposure is primarily driven by a small fraction of cells, with the total number of clones impacted by p53 status.</p><p>To confirm these results in vivo, we injected A549, NCI-H1573, or NCI-H1299 cells subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice and allowed establishment of tumours (150 mm<sup>3</sup>) before administering a single treatment of carboplatin (60 mg/kg). Mice harvested at 3 days post treatment were analysed by imunohistochemistry (IHC) for cell size and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive staining, with all cell lines showing a significant increase in cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Similar to the in vitro results, active proliferation (PCNA positivity) in A549 cells was strongly suppressed after carboplatin exposure, indicating that the majority of cells were not proliferating. In p53 mutant NCI-1573, there was no significant reduction in PCNA in vivo despite significant reduction in cell numbers in vitro cells. In contrast, NCI-H1299 cells, which lack p53, did not show any significant decrease in PCNA staining in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). BrdU pulse labelling of in vitro-treated cells showed similar results, with strong suppression of active BrdU incorporation in A549 cells, with partial and no significant inhibition seen in NCI-H1573 and NCI-H1299 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In summary, these in vitro and in vivo data suggest that in LUAD cells exposure to pulsed cisplatin results in a significant proportion of cells increasing in size, with presence of functional p53 correlating with increased senescence and reduced active replication in enlarged cells. Interestingly, in all three lines, a sub-population of cells remain at a normal (stable) cell size, maintained their proliferative capacity, and drove repopulation of the cell culture. Despite this, these proliferative cells remained equally sensitive to subsequent cisplatin treatment, indicating a non-genetic mechanism of resistance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>In vivo validation of cisplatin effects on cell size and proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A549 and NCI-H1299 cells were injected subcutaneously with 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells into the flanks of nude mice (n = 5).

Briefly, A549 cells were pulsed with cisplatin, harvested at 72 hr, and sorted into stable or enlarged cells based on size. This was determined by forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) parameters, with gates established based on the size of untreated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Pre- and post-sorted cells were then processed for RNAseq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Two-way hierarchical clustering indicated that there were clear differences in gene expression between cisplatin-treated cells that maintained a stable size compared to untreated control and enlarged cisplatin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). To better understand these effects, we undertook a more detailed bioinformatic analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Strong upregulation of the CDK inhibitor p21 was present in both pre-sorted cisplatin-treated and post-sorted enlarged cells, matching the early flow data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This corresponded with upregulation of <italic>p53</italic>, <italic>CHK,</italic> and G2/M cell cycle checkpoint signalling, and a corresponding reduction in DNA replication and increase in senescence pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>), correlating with the increased β-gal and reduced proliferation observed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, stable (size) cisplatin-treated cells were significantly different from untreated controls, indicating that these cells were impacted by cisplatin exposure, similar to our previous reports where all cells contained detectible cisplatin-DNA adducts post-pulsed exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, these stable cells displayed a decrease in <italic>EIF2</italic>, <italic>mTOR,</italic> and <italic>p70S6K</italic> signalling, with a corresponding increase in <italic>TREM1</italic>, <italic>GP6,</italic> and <italic>IL-17F</italic> signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary files 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). Four-way comparative analysis further highlighted key differences between each sub-population, with stable cells all showing strong upregulation of <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>ATM,</italic> and DNA replication signalling pathways, which were heavily suppressed in non-proliferative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

Briefly, asynchronous A549 cells stably expressing FUCCI were pulsed with or without cisplatin and then followed by time-lapse microscopy for 72 hr.

Treatment with cisplatin significantly reduced the number of overall divisions in H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>); however, compared to A549 cells, this reduction was not as pronounced, in line with the cell proliferation data observed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Tumours were allowed to establish before mice were given a single dose of carboplatin. Individual mice were then repeatedly imaged over 7 days post treatment. Notably, prior to cisplatin treatment, approximately 70–80% of cells from each line were in G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>).

We combined these synchronisations with pulsed exposure to cisplatin at various points following release to target G1, early or late S phase populations, which were then monitored by time-lapse microscopy. To target G1, cells were pulsed with cisplatin upon release from palbociclib (Cis at G1). This resulted in the majority of cells undergoing a prolonged S/G2 phase and then exiting back into a G1-like state without undergoing mitosis (G2-exit; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), a state we described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2020</xref>).

Finally, nearly all cells targeted in late S phase (Cis at S) completed the first mitosis and then underwent prolonged S/G2 arrest and G2-exit, with only 4 out of 50 cells completing two divisions within the 72 hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>).

We therefore hypothesised that cells in late G1/early S phase were able to repair cisplatin-induced DNA damage during the first cell cycle more efficiently than cells in early G1 or late S phase, thereby allowing them to continue proliferation. To test this, we engineered A549 cells to stably co-express a truncated form of 53BP1 fused to mApple (Apple-53BP1trunc), which has previously been shown to bind double-strand break sites co-marked with γH2A.X but lacks any of the functional domains of 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). We combined this with a PCNA chromobody, where we replaced GFP with mNeonGreen, to mark sites of active DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, inset). Cells were synchronised with thymidine and pulsed with cisplatin 2 hr prior to release to enrich for early S phase-targeted cells (as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and then tracked by 4D live*cell imaging. Individual cells were divided into either those in G1, early S, or mid/late S based on the pattern of PCNA foci (cyan), and then tracked through time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgess et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charrasse et al., 2017</xref>). In control cells, a small number (&lt;20) of 53BP1-positive foci (red hot) were observed as cells underwent the first round of replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>). Daughter and grand-daughter cells then displayed several (&lt;5) large foci during G1 (up to 5 µm<sup>2</sup>), which were resolved as cells entered S phase and began replicating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, white arrow). Cells that were in G1 at the time of cisplatin exposure entered S phase and rapidly accumulated a large number (~100) of 53BP1-positive foci; these slowly reduced over the remainder of the time lapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>), which corresponded with an increase in the average size of the foci (~1 µm<sup>2</sup>). In contrast, cells that were in early S phase and completed multiple (two or more) divisions within the 72 hr timeframe showed a rapid rise in foci number (~100), which then decreased at the conclusion of S phase, correlating with an increase in foci size. A small number of larger foci were present in the following G1 cell, although the size of these foci was smaller than those observed in control daughter cells (~1 µm<sup>2</sup>). Interestingly, in grand-daughter and great grand-daughter cells, the size of G1 foci increased (&gt;2 µm<sup>2</sup>), in line with G1 foci observed in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Finally, cells in mid-late S phase also showed a large number of 53BP1 foci, which increased in size as cells progressed through the first G2 phase. Interestingly, the average number of 53BP1 foci in mid-S were higher and were removed later, just prior to mitotic entry compared to cells from early S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the quality of mitosis was often reduced in cells from mid-S phase, with cells displaying chromatin bridges, micronuclei, and/or failed cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), correlating with the increase in death during or after mitosis we observed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The subsequent daughter cells from those exposed in mid-S phase then showed a rapid rise in the number of foci (&gt;100) as they began replication. In contrast, the number of 53BP1 foci in early S phase cells only increased mildly during replication and was notably lower than the numbers observed in the first round of replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Based on these results, we concluded that early S phase cells were able to either partially repair double-strand breaks during the first round of DNA replication and/or mark damage for efficient repair in the subsequent daughter and grand-daughter cells. In contrast, cells in G1 had much greater levels of damage and remained arrested in the first G2 phase. Cells in mid/late S phase completed the first division while acquiring damage but were unable to sufficiently repair the damage before mitosis. Consequently, daughter cells with unrepaired damage had increased rates of mitotic induced breaks as they attempted the second round of DNA replication, leading to a strong S/G2 phase checkpoint arrest, similar to cells initially exposed during G1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Dual DNA replication and damage biosensor analysis of cisplatin-treated cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative maximum image projections of A549 cells co-expressing a mNeonGreen tagged PCNA chromobody (cyan) and a truncated version of 53BP1 tagged with mApple (trunc53BP1-mApple; red-hot LUT).

To test this, we utilised the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, to trap PARP at single-strand break sites, leading to increased rates of replication fork stalling and reduced capacity to repair double strand breaks (DSBs) by HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murai and Pommier, 2018</xref>). We hypothesised that this would increase the rate of damage in all cells and reduce the ability of early S phase cells to repair during the first cell cycle. To test this, A549 FUCCI cells were targeted in G1/S phase with cisplatin by synchronising with palbociclib or thymidine, as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). Cells were then treated with or without olaparib (PARPi) for 1 hr prior to pulsed cisplatin exposure and monitored by time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In cells treated with cisplatin, co-treatment with PARPi significantly reduced the total number of divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), indicating that cells were unable to continue proliferating. This correlated with a trend toward G1 delay in palbociclib and significant G1 delay in thymidine-synchronised cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Interestingly, although co-treatment with PARPi decreased the percentage of proliferative (two or more divisions) cells, there was only a small increase in death observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), indicating that PARPi alone is not sufficient to drive increased toxicity to cisplatin in A549 cells. Importantly, inhibition of PARP did increase the rate of 53BP1 foci formation compared to cisplatin alone in asynchronous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Furthermore, this correlated with a significant increase in both the amount of γ-H2AX staining and the size of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). We further validated these results by inhibiting RAD51 with RI-1, to target HR-mediated repair. RAD51 inhibition (RAD51i) had no significant effect on cell growth compared to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Single-cell fate tracking of FUCCI expressing A549 cells revealed a small but significant decrease in the number of divisions completed by early S phase cells treated with RI-1 and cisplatin compared to cisplatin alone. This correlated with a reduction in percentage of cells completing two or more divisions (proliferative) and an increase in the percentage of cells undergoing a G2-exit phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that targeting DNA repair pathways during the first replication cycle results in more DSBs and pronounced S/G2 cell cycle checkpoint arrest leading to G2-exit, likely due to a reduced ability to repair DNA damage. This in turn reduces the ability of cells to undergo further rounds of replication and division.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of PARP reduces ability of early S phase cells to maintain proliferative capacity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of palbociclib (Palbo) and thymidine (Thy) protocols used to synchronise FUCCI expressing A549 cells in G1, early and late S phase prior to olaparib (PARPi; 1 µM) and 2 hr cisplatin (5 µg/ml) pulse treatment.

These cells eventually outgrow the majority of arrested cells over the course of 3 weeks in vitro. However, upon re-exposure, they remained equally sensitive, indicating that the mechanism of resistance is not hard-wired, nor did cells acquire resistance after the first exposure. Quantitative single-cell fate tracking revealed that cells in late G1/early S phase at the time of exposure had a greater proliferative capacity after pulsed cisplatin exposure. This suggests that cell cycle stage at the time of exposure impacts how cells respond to cisplatin. Interestingly, cisplatin treatment of head and neck (UM-SCC-38) cancer cells resulted in similar heterogenous cell cycle and cell fate responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luong et al., 2016</xref>), implying that the non-genetic cell cycle-dependent mechanisms of resistance we observed here may translate to multiple cancer types beyond LUAD.</p><p>For cells that are in G1, which under normal physiological conditions represents the vast majority of cells (&gt;70%) both in vitro and in vivo, the predominate response is to arrest in S/G2 during the first replication cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Notably, intracellular pH is lowest during G1, and cisplatin DNA binding is markedly increased in acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stewart, 2007</xref>), hence cells in G1 phase at the time of exposure may have higher levels of cisplatin-DNA adducts. In support, as G1-treated cells entered S phase, we noted increased numbers and size of 53BP1 foci, indicating widespread DSBs. This in turn correlated with prolonged S/G2 delays, indicating activation of DNA damage checkpoint signalling. Furthermore, we previously observed strong phosphorylation and activation of the G2 checkpoint proteins Chk1/2 across all LUAD cell lines after pulsed cisplatin exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, RNAseq data from enlarged A549 cells showed consistent activation of G2/M checkpoint pathways. Notably, sustained S/G2 DNA damage has been shown to lead to ATR-mediated checkpoint signalling and sustained p21 expression, blocking CDK activity and preventing FOXM1-dependent G2 transcription required for mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saldivar et al., 2018</xref>). Prolonged p21 expression can lead to S/G2 checkpoint-arrested cells undergoing a G2-exit and senescence-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baus et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feringa et al., 2018</xref>). This provides an explanation for why cells with a functional p53/p21 pathway were more likely to undergo G2-exit, had higher rates of senescence, and reduced numbers of cell divisions compared to those lacking p53.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic outlining cell cycle dependence of cisplatin recovery.</title><p>Briefly, cells exposed in G1 undergo S/G2 phase arrest, marked by high levels of P70S6K, p53, and p21, which results in a stable and permanent cell cycle exit from G2 phase. Cells in late S phase likely receive platinum adducts in areas of already duplicated DNA, with error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) favoured over homologous recombination (HR). Combining this with an increase in cells undergoing aberrant division results in daughter cells displaying higher rates of damage during replication, further resulting in S/G2 arrest and senescence. In contrast, cells in late G1/early S phase have the opportunity to detect and repair damage by HR during the first cycle, thereby increasing chances that daughter cells will successfully complete and repair damage, allowing continued proliferation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65234-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In contrast, cells in mid-late S or G2/M phase at the time of exposure proceeded through the first division with minimal delays, although numerous chromatin bridges were observed between separating daughter cells, which correlated with increased rates of mitotic and post-mitotic death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Similarly, loss, mutation, or, as we demonstrated previously, suppression of p53 signalling through inhibition of P70S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2020</xref>) resulted in more cells entering mitosis and undergoing mitotic and post-mitotic death. This likely explains why cells that lacked p53 were more likely to undergo multiple aberrant divisions in vitro and maintain positive PCNA staining in vivo as they lacked the ability to instigate a stable S/G2 cell cycle checkpoint arrest. Notably, chromatin bridges are often indicative of decatenation failure and increased replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarlós et al., 2017</xref>), and are commonly formed after DNA damage caused by chemotherapies such as cisplatin. These bridges are often repaired by HR during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan and West, 2018</xref>), but if repair is not completed before mitosis, they can lead to increased rates of cytokinesis failure, chromosome instability, and cell death during or post-mitotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakhoum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgess et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayashi and Karlseder, 2013</xref>). Importantly, chromosome instability has been linked to cancer heterogeneity, metastasis, and acquisition of chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sansregret et al., 2018</xref>), with single chromosome gains sufficient to reduce cisplatin-mediated cell death by delaying cells in G1 and slowing proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Replogle et al., 2020</xref>), highlighting the complexity and inter-dependence between innate and acquired resistance mechanisms.</p><p>Thirdly, cells in late G1 and early S phase showed a greater propensity to undergo multiple divisions following exposure to cisplatin. This correlated with lower levels of 53BP1 foci during the first round of replication, which reduced further in subsequent daughter and grand-daughter cells. A likely explanation is that early S phase cells would encounter cisplatin adducts during the first replication cycle, initiate repair using high-fidelity HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), which peaks during mid-S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karanam et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, error-prone NHEJ, which is preferred during G1 and G2, is likely favoured by cells exposed during G1 and late S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karanam et al., 2012</xref>). In support, RNAseq analysis showed enrichment for HR-associated BRCA1-mediated signalling pathways in stable-sized cells compared to enlarged cisplatin-treated cells. It would be of interest to confirm this through future analysis of transcriptomes of cell cycle phase sorted cells. Consequently, cells exposed during early S phase likely have more time and capacity to detect and accurately repair damage, thereby avoiding chromatin bridges during mitosis compared to those treated later in S phase. In support, the 53BP1 foci resolved more quickly prior to the first mitosis in early S phase-treated cells. Post-mitotic G1 phase 53BP1 nuclear bodies increased in size from daughter to grand-daughter cells, indicating increased efficiency in identification and corralling of unrepaired DNA damage during the previous replication cycle. These G1 53BP1 nuclear bodies prevent daughter cells from encountering damaged DNA during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watts et al., 2020</xref>), thereby avoiding deleterious fork stalling. For under-replicated DNA, this provides the cell with a second chance at repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spies et al., 2019</xref>). The partial repair in the first cell cycle also likely ensures a pulsed p21 response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>) with lower levels preventing arrest in the following G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barr et al., 2017</xref>), helping promote continued proliferative capacity.</p><p>Finally, this work also indicates the potential for complications when co-administering platinum chemotherapies with other targeted and cell cycle altering therapies such as palbociclib. Specifically, pre- or co-administration of palbociclib with platinum may inadvertently synchronise cells in late G1/early S phase, resulting in a higher proportion of cells repairing the damage during the first cell cycle and maintaining proliferative capacity. In support, current clinical trials in head and neck cancer where both agents were given at the same time have resulted in no improvement to cisplatin therapy and resulted in significant treatment-related toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Swiecicki et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, administering palbociclib after cisplatin (and other chemotherapies) improves response and notably represses HR-dependent DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salvador-Barbero et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this work increases the understanding of the mechanisms driving recovery from cisplatin treatment and identifies the need for novel combination therapies that not only enhance cell death, but also prevent non-genetic, cell cycle-dependent resistance mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Cells were treated with/without cisplatin, and images were taken at 3 days and at 21 days (A549 and NCI-H1299) or 42 days (NCI-H1573) after cisplatin exposure. 100 images were taken per timepoint and per condition (three replicates), and the experiment was done twice. The total number of clones (unique colour cues) and the number of cells within each clone was determined. Briefly, images are opened and converted to 16-bit .tif files. An image is duplicated and converted to RGB overlay. The duplicate has background subtracted using a rolling ball at 250 considering colours separately and using a sliding parabaloid. The image is smoothed using a mean filter radius 5. Using the ‘find maxima’ function, a point within individual cells is identified and then enlarged to a circle radius of 5 pixels. These regions of interest (ROI) are then applied as a mask to the unprocessed, raw, image data and the average red, green, and blue values within these ROI collected and exported in .csv format. RGB values from each of the .csv files for each of the 100 images are compiled. Data from cells where an R, G, or B value is too high or too low are removed. 512 unique colours were identified, and cells were classified and assigned to each of the 512 colours. More than 90% of all cells were assigned to one of the 64 most represented colours, with analysis performed using these 64 groups and positive clonal colour assigned when the colour represented &gt;0.1% of the population.

Mice were kept in standard housing at a 12 hr daylight cycle and fed ad libitum. Cage enrichment refinement was undertaken with mice implanted with mammary optical imaging windows, supplying the fully plastic IVC cages with papier-mâché domes, feeding supplied in trays on the cage floor and soft tissues as nesting material. For in vivo xenograft models, A549 cells (2 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were resuspended in 100 μl PBS:Matrigel (1:1) and injected subcutaneously into the flanks of BALB/c-Fox1nuAusb mice (Australian BioResource). Tumour growth was assessed twice weekly by calliper measurement, and mice were randomised to treatment arms when tumours reached 150 mm<sup>3</sup> (using the formula: width<sup>2</sup>× length × 0.5). Carboplatin (60 mg/kg) was delivered by a single i.p injection. Tumours were harvest at 3–7 days post treatment and analysed by IHC for cell size and PCNA-positive staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Implantation of optical imaging windows</title><p>BALB/c-Foxn1nu/Ausb mice were injected with 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> A549-FUCCI subcutaneously near the inguinal mammary fat pad. Following the development of palpable tumours, mice were engrafted with titanium mammary imaging windows (Russell Symes &amp; Company) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gligorijevic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kedrin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nobis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ritsma et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, mice were treated with 5 mg/kg of the analgesic carprofen (Rimadyl) in pH neutral drinking water 24 hr prior and up to a minimum of 72 hr post surgery. Mice further received subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine (0.075 mg/kg, Temgesic) immediately prior to and 6 hr post surgery. The titanium window was prepared 24 hr prior to surgery by gluing a 12 mm glass coverslip (Electron Microscopy Science) using cyanoacrylate to the groove on the outer rim of the titanium window. Following anaesthetic induction at 4% isoflurane delivered via a vaporizer (VetFlo) supplemented with oxygen, mice were kept at a steady 1–2% maintenance anaesthesia for the duration of the surgery on a heated pad. The incision site was disinfected using 0.5% chlorhexidine/70% ethanol. A straight incision was made into the skin above the developed subcutaneous tumour and following blunt dissection of the skin surrounding the incision a purse string suture (5-0 Mersilk, Ethicon) placed. The windows were then inserted and held in place by tightening the suture, disappearing along with the skin into the groove of the window and tied off. Mice were allowed to recover for a minimum of 72 hr post surgery, actively foraging, feeding, and grooming within minutes from being removed from the anaesthesia respirator. A minimum of 24 hr prior to imaging and treatment mice were weaned off the carprofen analgesic in the drinking water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo imaging</title><p>Mice were imaged under 1–2% isofluorane on a heated stage (Digital Pixel, UK) prior to and 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, and 7 days after i.p. injection of 60 mg/kg carboplatinum (Sigma) or the saline vehicle. Multi-photon imaging was performed using a Leica DMI 6000 SP8 confocal microscope using a 25 × 0.95 NA water immersion objective on an inverted stage. For A549-FUCCI imaging the Ti:Sapphire femto-second laser (Coherent Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) excitation source operating at 80 MHz was tuned to 920 nm and the RLD-HyD detectors with 460/40, 525/50, and 585/40 bandpass emission filters used to detect the second harmonic generation (SHG) of the collagen I, mAzamiGreen, and mKO2, respectively.

For DNA content analysis, cells were stained with 1µg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and treated with 0.5mg/ml RNAaseA for at lease 1 h prior to analysis. Flow cytometry was performed using a Beckman CytoFlex S. For BrdU incorporation analysis, cells were incubated with BrdU at 10 µM for 2 hr before overnight ethanol fixation at −20°C. An antibody against BrdU coupled with FITC (BD-347583) was used for staining, and flow cytometry was done using a Beckman CytoFlex S. For senescence assays, we used ImaGene Green C12FDG lacZ Gene Expression Kit (Molecular Probes, I-2904). Three days after cisplatin exposure, cells were incubated for 30 min with Bafilomycin A1 (Sigma, B1793) in RPMI medium without phenol red (Gibco) supplemented with 1% FBS before adding C<sub>12</sub>FDG to the media at 20 µM final concentration.

For GSEA, a ranked gene list was prepared from proliferative versus arrest and analysed with GSEA 4.1.0 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp</ext-link>) using a curated gene set of canonical pathways (2868 gene sets) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp#C2">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp#C2</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). The enrichment map was generated using Cytoscape 3.8.2 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cytoscape.org/">https://cytoscape.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>), using p-value (&lt;0.005) and false discovery rate (FDR) (q &lt; 0.1) cut-offs. Volcano and dot plots were generated using GraphPad Prism (v9.1.0) and figures compiled using Adobe Illustrator Creative Cloud (v25).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Dr Atsushi Miyawaki (Riken, Japan) for provision of the mVenus-hGeminin(1/110) and mKO-hCdt1(30/120) constructs for FUCCI imaging.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors explore a non-genetic mechanism of resistance that drives recovery and regrowth in a subset of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with varying p53 status. The authors show that early S phase cells have greater resistance to cisplatin due to their increased capacity to repair double stranded breaks. Their findings demonstrate that combined treatment of cisplatin and a PARP inhibitor reduced resistance to cisplatin in A549 cells. The attempts to identify a non-genetic resistance mechanism to cisplatin in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines are interesting, relevant and compelling. The findings after extensive biosensor imaging and single-cell fate tracking suggest a cell-cycle dependent role in cisplatin resistance. Further development of these findings could one day help improve the timing of combination chemotherapies for greater cancer treatment efficacy and reduction of fractional cell killing. The paradigms established are likely to be of interest to the broad <italic>eLife</italic> audience, pending revisions. Many of the requested revisions deal with increased experimental and statistical clarity; there is also concern that the relevance of p53 status is initially addressed but that this question then loses focus, thus detracting from broad overall relevance of the findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. In Figure 2D, for the analysis of clonal outgrowth, I suggest quantifying the number of clones, perhaps by normalizing number of colors by number of cells for each of the lines. It looks like the NCI-H1573 p53248L cell line has a lower level of clonal variation than the other two cell lines, being dominated to a greater extent by a single clone. Does this hold true statistically with repeats of the experiment? Given the potential dependence on p53 status for the in vivo results in Figure 3, I would suggest performing the same in vivo analysis for NCI-H1573 cells as was done for the other two cell lines shown in Figure 3 to see what happens with a gain of function mutant form of p53.</p><p>2. The experiment in Figure 5 Supp 1, tracking the cell cycle in response to cisplatin without the use of a synchronization technique, is a cleaner experiment than that shown in Figure 5. Synchronization methods may perturb the general cell state in unforeseen ways – simply measuring the cell cycle stage without the need to enrich for a specific population already appears to be providing convincing evidence. I would recommend increasing the numbers of cells analyzed to improve statistical significance and moving those results to the main figure.</p><p>3. PARP inhibition potentially has many pleiotropic effects beyond inhibition of HR. It would be cleaner to validate their findings by looking at the cell cycle dynamics in response to cisplatin upon knockdown of HR-associated proteins, such as BRCA1/2. Similarly, given the off-target effects of PARP inhibitors, it would be useful to test other PARP inhibitors such as rucaparib.</p><p>4. The manuscript starts with a comparison between three different LUAD cell lines with noted different p53 statuses; however, by the end of the manuscript, the studies are only performed on p53 WT A549 cells. Given the importance of p53 status in lung cancer, and the fact that a large number of cancer cells are not wild-type for p53, interest in the findings would be improved if the connection between cell cycle stage at time of cisplatin treatment and the decision between proliferation / senescence were shown to be maintained in p53-mutant and p53-null cells as well, or alternatively could the authors show how the response is altered.</p><p>5. The authors show that a cell population that remains proliferative in response to an initial dose of cisplatin can, after a long time, generate a similar distribution of proliferative vs senescent cells in response to a second dose of cisplatin (Figure 1). This fits nicely with the model of cell cycle dependence on the proliferation / senescence bifurcation, as desynchronized cell cycle distribution would be re-established at some point following recovery from the initial cisplatin treatment. The model presented in this work would be further validated by considering different time points after the first cisplatin treatment, quantifying the cell cycle distribution, and then challenging cells with the second dose of cisplatin and determining the number of proliferative cells. This could potentially help inform better optimized cisplatin dosing regimens to decrease the percentage of cells that escape treatment.</p><p>6. It would be interesting, if possible, to analyze the transcriptome of cells in the different cell-cycle stage (G1, early S, late S, G2) either in sorted cells or in synchronized cells, in order to see whether they recapitulate the different transcriptome observed in cells proliferating or not proliferating after cisplatin pulse. If this is possible that would be ideal but if impossible, perhaps the authors can mention this in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65234.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

This includes addition of optical window based in vivo data for NCI-H1573 (p53 mutant) and NCI-H1299 (p53 null) cells. Additional cell fate mapping of FUCCI expressing NCI-H1299 cells, which lack p53, results in more cells undergoing multiple divisions. In our previous publication, we demonstrated that loss of p53 correlates with a failure to upregulate p21 (Figure 1D, (Hastings et al., 2020)), which correlated with much lower percentage of cells undergoing a G2-exit. The lack of strong p21 expression and compromised cell cycle checkpoint response, likely contributes to the overall higher rates of proliferation in p53 null cells. Interestingly, we still observed a trend towards more divisions in NCI-H1299 cells that were exposed during late G1 and early S phase. In addition, we have added additional analysis the p53 siRNA knockdown data from the original paper (Hastings et al., 2020) to show that knockdown of p53 increases the number of divisions in cisplatin treated cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the cell cycle specific resistance we report here is not dependent on p53, however, loss of p53/p21 reduces the ability of highly damaged cells undergo cell cycle arrest and exit, leading to a higher percentage of cells undergoing aberrant mitotic divisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
