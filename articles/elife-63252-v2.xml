lipid storage is a universal strategy to maintain organismal energy and membrane homeostasis. Cycles of building and mobilizing storage fat are fundamental in (re)distributing lipid substrates between tissues or to progress ontogenetic transitions. In this study, we show that Hormone-sensitive lipase (Hsl) specifically controls SE mobilization to initiate intergenerational sterol transfer in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Tissue-autonomous Hsl functions in the maternal fat body and germline coordinately prevent adult SE overstorage and maximize sterol allocation to embryos. While Hsl-deficiency is largely dispensable for normal development on sterol-rich diets, animals depend on adipocyte Hsl for optimal fecundity when dietary sterol becomes limiting. Notably, accumulation of SE but not of TG is a characteristic of Hsl-deficient cells across phyla including murine white adipocytes. In summary, we identified Hsl as an ancestral regulator of SE degradation, which improves intergenerational sterol transfer and reproductive success in flies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lipid metabolism</kwd><kwd>sterol</kwd><kwd>hormone-sensitive lipase</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>fecundity</kwd><kwd>adipocyte</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P28882-B21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schoiswohl</surname><given-names>Gabriele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR 2682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shevchenko</surname><given-names>Andrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR83 (TP17)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shevchenko</surname><given-names>Andrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>M 2706-B34</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pörnbacher</surname><given-names>Ingrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An ancestral enzyme tailors allocation of essential lipid resources to the progeny and connects maternal and embryonic sterol metabolism for reproductive success.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lipids fulfill essential functions as energy carriers, membrane components, and signal molecules. The constant supply and recycling of lipids are therefore fundamental for maintaining organismal vitality. However, chronic excess of lipids can also lead to lipotoxicity and numerous associated diseases in humans such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brookheart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greenberg et al., 2011</xref>). An evolutionarily successful strategy for coping with fluctuations in the availability of lipids is their conversion into neutral esters and storage for future need. In this form, lipids are deposited in so-called intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walther and Farese, 2012</xref>). If required, the stored lipids are released by enzymatic hydrolysis of the ester bonds, which makes them available for metabolism or transport processes. Triacylglycerol (TG) and steryl ester (SE) are the most common storage lipids in many cells and organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujimoto and Parton, 2011</xref>). TG constitutes a quantitatively significant energy reserve by providing a major reservoir of fatty acids (FAs) for β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frayn et al., 2006</xref>). Also, the formation of TG prevents lipotoxicity by sequestering excess FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Listenberger et al., 2003</xref>). Likewise, SE formation buffers excess sterols and generates storage reservoirs for hormonal precursors, particularly in steroidogenic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Cycles of lipid storage and mobilization are an integral part of the (re)distribution of lipid resources between tissues, ontogenetic stages, and from parents to offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arrese and Soulages, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babin and Gibbons, 2009</xref>). As the lipid storage capacity of most cell types is very limited, animals use specialized adipose tissues to build up and store substantial TG-rich LDs in times of nutrient excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azeez et al., 2014</xref>). Upon nutritional deprivation, mobilization of this storage lipid depots initiates transfer of FAs to non-adipose tissues for energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azeez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lafontan and Langin, 2009</xref>). During reproduction, many animals deposit LD-like structures in the milk or in the egg as a means of lipid transfer to the progeny. Effective transfer and subsequent breakdown of these lipids are essential for offspring vitality and also supports developmental transitions between ontogenetic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beigneux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grönke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lowe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Smith et al., 2000</xref>). By initiating mobilization of stored TG or SE, lipid hydrolases act as gatekeepers in lipid transfer processes associated with nutrient deprivation or development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grönke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haemmerle et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>Drosophila</italic>) shares many principles of metabolism and physiology with higher organisms and is gaining increasing popularity as a model organism for research in lipid metabolism and related metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Musselman and Kühnlein, 2018</xref>). Like mammals, <italic>Drosophila</italic> uses highly specialized tissues for absorption, transport, and storage of lipids and requires complex communication mechanisms between these tissues to maintain lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heier and Kühnlein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Musselman and Kühnlein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Song et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires both, de novo lipogenesis and dietary lipid sources for lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garrido et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sieber and Thummel, 2009</xref>). In particular, <italic>Drosophila</italic> is unable to de novo synthesize sterol lipids, which are important membrane constituents and precursors for protein modification and molting hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>). For efficient growth and development <italic>Drosophila</italic> thus requires molecular mechanisms that efficiently balance fluctuations in sterol availability.</p><p>To cope with fluctuations in nutrient availability, <italic>Drosophila</italic> deposits large amounts of storage lipids in the fat body, which shares many lipid metabolic functions with mammalian adipose tissue and liver, and serves as major nutrient reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arrese and Soulages, 2010</xref>). Fat body TG constitutes the quantitatively most important organismal energy reservoir upon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguila et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grönke et al., 2007</xref>). Fat body lipids may also support lipid anabolic processes in non-adipose tissues such as the ovary, which incorporates large amounts of SE and TG into vitellogenic oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parra-Peralbo and Culi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sieber and Spradling, 2015</xref>). A lipoprotein-based carrier system connects the fat body with non-adipose tissues via the hemolymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Palm et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, enzymatic hydrolysis of TG and SE and the subsequent incorporation of diacylglycerol (DG) and free sterol into hemolymph lipoproteins is a prerequisite for the transfer of stored lipids between <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues.</p><p>Two complementary enzymatic systems control the hydrolysis of TG in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heier and Kühnlein, 2018</xref>). Brummer (Bmm) lipase is the ortholog of mammalian adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and a major regulator of basal and starvation-induced TG lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grönke et al., 2005</xref>). Bmm activity is complemented by a second lipolytic system that is activated by the Adipokinetic hormone (Akh), a peptide with functional similarity to mammalian glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gáliková et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grönke et al., 2007</xref>). Akh binding to the G-protein-coupled Akh receptor triggers elevations in adipocyte cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which promote lipolysis via incomprehensively understood molecular events. In particular, the identity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Akh-dependent TG hydrolase(s) is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heier and Kühnlein, 2018</xref>). The enzymes controlling the degradation of SE in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are even more enigmatic. The acid lipase family member Magro has been shown to control SE hydrolysis in the enterocytes of the midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sieber and Thummel, 2012</xref>). However, the role of Magro and other SE hydrolases in sterol distribution between tissues is largely unknown.</p><p>A prime candidate enzyme for both, SE and TG hydrolysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is Hormone-sensitive lipase (Hsl). Metazoan Hsl enzyme family members, including human and fly Hsl, are characterized by a N-terminal Hsl_N domain (PF06350) and a C-terminal part composed of a α/β hydrolase fold three domain (PF07859) interspersed with a regulatory module. The α/β hydrolase fold three domain is a phylogenetically ancient catalytic domain also present in the prokaryotic enzymes of the bacterial Hsl (bHsl) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Langin and Holm, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lass et al., 2011</xref>). Substrate promiscuity covering a wide range of neutral lipids including TG and SE is a common feature of Hsl-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lass et al., 2011</xref>). However, Hsl enzymes from bacteria to mammals have been primarily associated with the degradation of acylglycerols like TG or DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haemmerle et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, Hsl is a TG and major DG lipase in mammalian adipocytes where it acts in parallel and downstream of ATGL to promote storage lipid breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lass et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, mouse Hsl acts as major SE hydrolase in several tissues including liver, intestine, testis, and adrenal gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kraemer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Obrowsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Osuga et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sekiya et al., 2008</xref>). Mammalian Hsl activity is stimulated by catabolic hormones such as glucagon or catecholamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lass et al., 2011</xref>). In an effort to understand how lipid hydrolases control inter-tissue lipid homeostasis, we characterized the molecular and physiological functions of the single Hsl ortholog of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We show that adult Hsl-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibit largely normal TG homeostasis, but accumulate excessive SE due to defective SE hydrolysis in their adipocytes. By initiating SE breakdown, Hsl promotes efficient sterol transfer from mothers to progeny and increases the embryonic sterol content during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development to support reproductive success.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila Hsl</italic> encodes a multifunctional lipid ester hydrolase</title><p>To address the molecular function(s) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hsl, we expressed a tagged version of the recombinant fly protein (His<sub>6</sub>-Hsl) in heterologous cultured cells and measured lipid hydrolase activities in cell extracts. Murine Hsl (His<sub>6</sub>-<italic>Mm</italic>Hsl) was expressed in parallel to serve as a positive control in these assays. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed the ectopic expression of recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-Hsl, His<sub>6</sub>-<italic>Mm</italic>Hsl, and of the His<sub>6</sub>-β-Galactosidase (His<sub>6</sub>-β-Gal) negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Expression of His<sub>6</sub>-<italic>Mm</italic>Hsl increased cellular hydrolysis rates toward monoacylglycerol (MG), DG, TG, and SE by 6-, 9-, 6-, and 66-fold, respectively, as compared to His<sub>6</sub>-β-Gal expressing control cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Expression of fly His<sub>6</sub>-Hsl elevated cellular hydrolysis rates toward MG, DG, TG, and SE by 14-, 16-, 10-, and 17-fold, respectively, as compared to His<sub>6</sub>-β-Gal expressing controls indicating a similar substrate spectrum of murine and fly Hsl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To confirm these results in vivo, we engineered transgenic flies and expressed Hsl via the UAS/Gal4 system using the ubiquitous <italic>Act5c-GAL4</italic> driver. Ectopic expression of Hsl increased DG, TG, and SE hydrolase activities of abdominal extracts by 7-, 2-, and 8-fold, respectively, when compared to control samples. In contrast, abdominal MG hydrolase activities were not significantly altered by Hsl expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, we assessed the subcellular localization of a fluorescently-tagged version of Hsl (Hsl-EGFP) in fat body cells of adult flies and found that Hsl-EGFP concentrated at the surface of LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The intensities of the Hsl-EGFP signal at individual droplets were highly variable suggesting enrichment of the protein at a subset of LDs, although this finding awaits confirmation via detection of endogenous Hsl. Taken together, our data show that Hsl is a LD-associated multifunctional lipid ester hydrolase, which implies a function of the enzyme in <italic>Drosophila</italic> storage lipid breakdown.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enzyme activities and subcellular localization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hsl.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblotting analysis of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged proteins in COS-7 cell extracts expressing His<sub>6</sub>-Hsl, His<sub>6</sub>-<italic>Mm</italic>Hsl, or His<sub>6</sub>-β-Gal.

To address SE turnover more directly, we labeled sterol lipids during the larval period by feeding either <sup>3</sup>H-cholesterol or <sup>14</sup>C-FAs and followed the turnover of labeled lipids after eclosion. <sup>3</sup>H-cholesterol is incorporated into free and esterified sterols and thus allows the simultaneous measurement of both sterol pools.

These findings imply an accumulation of SE in the fat body of <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant animals as this tissue is present in all body segments and enriched in carcass preparations. To more directly test this hypothesis, we restored <italic>Hsl</italic> expression in specific tissues of the <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant animals by means of the UAS/Gal4 system.

In line with this observation, ectopic expression of <italic>Hsl</italic> in the fat body of control flies decreased total body SE storage by 46% as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Since Hsl has been conserved during evolution, we next asked if an analogous pathway of sterol mobilization exists in mammalian adipocytes. To this end, we used mice with adipocyte-specific HSL-deficiency (AHKO) and analyzed storage lipid levels in the adipose tissue depots of these animals. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, AHKO mice lack detectable HSL immunoreactivity in subcutaneous (SCAT), perigonadal (PGAT), and perirenal (PRAT) white adipose tissue depots but not in liver, kidney, or muscle. AHKO animals had similar amounts of TG as controls in their SCAT, PGAT, and PRAT but accumulated 10-, 12-, and 14-fold more SE, respectively, in these adipose tissue depots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). SE accumulation in AHKO adipose tissue depots was associated with a 63% decrease in neutral SE hydrolase activity as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). To assess how disrupted SE hydrolysis affects sterol metabolic gene expression, we measured mRNA concentrations of genes involved in de novo synthesis, transport, and esterification of cholesterol.

SE catabolism in control embryos correlated with an increase in free sterol content from 12.4 to 20.7 pmol per animal between 0–2 hr and 18–20 hr AEL. <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant embryos had lower free sterol content than controls throughout embryogenesis and exhibited a blunted increase from 7.8 to 11.6 pmol per animal between 0–2 hr and 18–20 hr AEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggests that loss of Hsl causes impaired conversion of SE to free sterols during embryogenesis. Since embryonic SE catabolism was essentially dependent on the maternal genotype, we next asked if germline Hsl autonomously controls embryonic SE catabolism. To this end, we re-expressed <italic>Hsl</italic> specifically in the germline of mutant animals using the <italic>nos-GAL4</italic> driver.

An exception to this general trend was phosphatidylglycerol (PG), which exhibited a subtle decrease during embryogenesis (3% and 7% at 6–8 hr and 18–20 hr AEL, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The net increase in membrane lipid content was associated with distinct shifts in the molecular composition of each lipid class. PC, PE, PI, and PS shifted toward increased acyl chain length at 18–20 hr AEL when compared to 0–2 hr AEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). A similar shift was observed for Cer, CerPE, and PE O-, whereas PG shifted toward decreased acyl chain length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, PC, PI, Cer, CerPE, and PE O- pools remodeled toward decreased acyl chain saturation whereas PE, PS, and PG became slightly more saturated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although these general shifts in total level, acyl chain length, and saturation degree of each lipid class were often moderate, distinct lipid species including many polyunsaturated glycerophospholipids exhibited more dynamic changes. Examples include PC 36:4, PE 36:4, and PI 36:4, which increased by 169%, 125%, and 194%, respectively, between early and late embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). However, it should be noted that these species were low abundant and therefore contributed little to the overall saturation degree of each lipid class. When compared with control animals, <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants exhibited similar decreases in TG and increases in membrane lipid levels during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Total PC increased slightly less in <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> compared to control animals between early and late embryogenesis (16% vs 23%), which was largely due to lower amounts of medium-chain PC species containing 30 or less carbon atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Instead, increases in PC species with higher chain length and more double bonds were comparable between <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> and control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, Supplementary file 1). Likewise, the molecular composition of other phospholipids and ceramides changed with similar dynamics in control and <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

In both genotypes, the dietary switch to LDM was associated with a drastic time-dependent decline in egg hatchability reaching a plateau after 7 days. <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> females produced 37% and 25% less viable progeny than control females within 4 days and 7 days on LDM, respectively, indicating slightly higher developmental success of control embryos in the early period on LDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Indeed, hatching rates of <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant animals were 14% lower after 4 days on LDM as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). After dietary supplementation with exogenous cholesterol, <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> females showed 16% and 14% lower egg output than control females at 4 days and 7 days, respectively, suggesting that dietary cholesterol partially rescued the fecundity defect of <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Cholesterol addition to LDM rescued the decline in embryo hatchability in both genotypes. As a consequence of similar hatching rates in both genotypes, <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> females produced 17% and 14% less viable offspring than control females at 4 days and 7 days, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). To understand how defective SE catabolism in the maternal organism affects fecundity, we next assessed lipid transfer to control and <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant oocytes. Vitellogenic follicles of control but also <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> females produced numerous LDs at stage 10 of oogenesis suggesting that oocyte lipid loading is generally functional in <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). To more specifically monitor sterol transport, we followed the incorporation of labeled cholesterol into embryos produced by mothers of both genotypes and found that <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants transferred 20% and 24% less labeled cholesterol into the embryos laid at 3 days and 4 days after female mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This suggests that Hsl indeed promotes the mobilization and transfer of maternal sterols to the progeny. Since Hsl contributes to SE catabolism in both, maternal fat body and germline, we finally used genetic approaches to address nonautonomous contributions of maternal fat body Hsl to fecundity. Fat body-specific knockdown of <italic>Hsl</italic> expression by means of a <italic>Cg-GAL4</italic> driven <italic>Hsl shRNA</italic> transgene reduced cumulative egg and 1st instar numbers by 27–29% and 32–34%, respectively, after 4 days on LDM as compared to controls harboring either the <italic>Hsl shRNA</italic> or the <italic>Cg-GAL4</italic> only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Similar to complete Hsl-deficiency the fecundity defects induced by fatbody-specific Hsl knockdown were less pronounced after 7 days on LDM (25–27% less egg numbers, 14–24% less 1st instar larvae compared to controls, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In a complementary approach, we re-expressed <italic>Hsl</italic> in the fat body of the <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant animals via the <italic>FB-GAL4</italic> driver and assessed fecundity on LDM.

In this study, we present the first in vitro and in vivo analysis to identify Hsl as major SE hydrolase in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We complement these fly data with the analysis of adipocyte sterol metabolism using tissue-specific knockout mice to suggest an ancestral function of Hsl-related enzymes in sterol homeostasis of animals. In flies, this enzymatic activity is of physiological relevance since we demonstrate an intergenerational role of Hsl in sterol metabolism of the progeny.</p><p>Hsl belongs to a phylogenetically ancient family of lipid hydrolases implicated mainly in TG mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Langin and Holm, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). In mammalian adipocytes, Hsl acts as principal TG and DG hydrolase in parallel and downstream of ATGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haemmerle et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, Hsl-deficient mice cannot adequately increase adipose tissue TG lipolysis in response to starvation or exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernandez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haemmerle et al., 2002b</xref>). The loss of adipose tissue Hsl culminates in progressive lipodystrophy, liver steatosis, and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xia et al., 2017</xref>). A critical step in Hsl activation occurs post-translationally by signaling events induced by catecholamines and glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lass et al., 2011</xref>). These catabolic hormones augment adipocyte lipolysis in response to starvation or exercise via the concerted activation of ATGL and Hsl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lass et al., 2011</xref>). A similar molecular system operates in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body, which relies on Bmm/ATGL and Akh/Glucagon-activated lipase(s) for full lipolytic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grönke et al., 2007</xref>). The presence of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hsl ortholog has fostered the hypothesis that this enzyme acts as major effector of Akh in TG lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lehmann, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). However, two observations in our study argue against this notion. First, Hsl-deficient flies do not accumulate excessive TG, which is a common biochemical manifestation of defective TG lipolysis and a signature of <italic>Akh</italic> or <italic>bmm</italic> loss-of-function mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gáliková et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grönke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hofbauer et al., 2020</xref>). Second, unlike <italic>Akh bmm</italic> double-deficient mutants, combined deficiencies of <italic>Hsl</italic> with <italic>bmm</italic> or <italic>Akh</italic> do not abrogate TG mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grönke et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the energy homeostasis profile of <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants is remarkably normal with the exception of a mildly elevated glycogen content of unknown etiology, which deserves future research attention. Taken together, these findings provide unequivocal evidence for the existence of Hsl/Bmm-unrelated fat body TG lipase(s) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Biochemical studies in <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> implicated a TG lipase with homology to <italic>Drosophila</italic> PAPLA1 in Akh-mediated TG lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arrese et al., 2006</xref>). However, similar to <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants, <italic>PAPLA1</italic>-deficiency is compatible with normal starvation-induced TG catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gáliková et al., 2017</xref>). It remains possible that several enzymes including Hsl and PAPLA1 act in redundancy to execute Akh-induced TG lipolysis. In this scenario, genetic deficiencies of either enzyme would be compensated by the other. The relative significance of each lipase for TG lipolysis may also depend on specific environmental conditions or developmental stages. Previous studies identified Hsl and Lip3 as regulators of 3rd instar larval acylglycerol metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bülow et al., 2018</xref>). Together with our data this observation suggests that different ontogenetic stages use specific enzyme sets to execute TG lipolysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Our study supports a major and possibly ancestral function of Hsl in the degradation of SE. Sterol biosynthesis is an evolutionary invention of early eukaryotes but has been secondarily lost in various metazoan lineages including insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babin and Gibbons, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a sterol auxotroph, which requires robust molecular mechanisms for effective uptake and distribution of dietary sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut plays a central role in the perception, metabolism, and distribution of diet-derived sterols. In this tissue, the nuclear receptor Hr96 acts as a sterol sensor and orchestrates transcriptional responses to fluctuations in sterol supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bujold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Horner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sieber and Thummel, 2012</xref>). Hr96 facilitates SE catabolism by promoting expression of the SE/TG lipase Magro. Consequently, the loss of Hr96 or Magro leads to an accumulation of SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sieber and Thummel, 2012</xref>). Although this phenotype resembles Hsl-deficient animals, it most likely represents a selective disruption of SE catabolism in enterocytes. Conversely, our genetic analysis implies that Hsl acts mainly in fat body SE catabolism. This suggests the presence of tissue-autonomous SE pools in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that are controlled by specific subsets of enzymes. Substantial residual neutral SE hydrolase activities in <italic>Hsl</italic> mutant abdominal extracts argue for the presence of additional, yet unidentified, SE hydrolases in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. It is currently unclear, how these different enzymatic systems interact to coordinate organismal sterol homeostasis. However, increased concentrations of <italic>magro</italic> mRNA in Hsl-deficient animals indicate a crosstalk between different enzymes and tissues in the control of SE homeostasis.</p><p>Defective SE degradation in Hsl mutants correlates with reduced sterol transport into embryos. This indicates a preferred use of the maternal SE pool for vitellogenesis. <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues acquire specific sterol patterns during development and exchange their sterol pools at different rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carvalho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knittelfelder et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, specific transport routes may regulate the tissue distribution of sterols. Since the majority of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SE pool resides in the fat body, it is reasonable to assume that Hsl is part of a specific sterol transport route between adipocytes and vitellogenic follicles. Modulation of Hsl activity may thus be a mechanism of channeling sterols selectively toward ovaries. The loading of oocytes with lipids is essential for the survival of the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parra-Peralbo and Culi, 2011</xref>). It is regulated by a hierarchical system in which local ecdysone signaling promotes expression of ovarian lipophorin receptors via the transcription factor SREBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sieber and Spradling, 2015</xref>). Similar hormonal signals may also act on the fat body to communicate increased ovarian demand for lipid resources. Although egg production is tightly coupled to dietary nutrient supply, the fat body may act as an additional nutriostat for vitellogenesis. Lower egg laying capacity has been observed in genetically lean flies that fail to build up or maintain TG reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sieber and Spradling, 2015</xref>). Analogously, reduced egg laying in mutant females lacking adipocyte <italic>Hsl</italic> function provides evidence that egg production also depends on maternal SE reserves. During oogenesis, the maternal germline provides the embryos with Hsl function for early degradation of embryo SE and further amplification of embryonic free sterol levels. This observation illustrates an intergenerational coupling of sterol metabolism via temporally and spatially shifted waves of storage lipid breakdown.</p><p>Our analyses unravel dynamic changes in the membrane lipidome during <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis. Quantitative increases in most membrane lipid classes, especially sphingolipids and ether-linked glycerophospholipids, coincide with enrichments in polyunsaturated FA species with increased acyl chain length. These changes likely reflect maturation of biomembranes during cell differentiation and organogenesis. Hsl specifically contributes to this developmental maturation of the embryo lipidome by increasing free sterols through early SE hydrolysis. The formation of sterol-rich liquid crystalline microdomains is considered essential for distinct membrane functions such as signaling and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>). Consequently, membrane sterol content is tightly regulated in many eukaryotic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>Hsl</italic> mutants develop with normal success and speed despite lacking 50% of free sterol at the end of embryogenesis. Marginal differences between control and mutant lipidomes indicate a previously unexpected tolerance of the membrane to substantial fluctuations in sterol content and challenge the dogma that membrane sterol concentrations have to be maintained within a narrow range to allow for proper cellular function. Similarly, substantial variations in tissue sterol levels have also been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae raised on different diets indicating that <italic>Drosophila</italic> biomembranes may accommodate variable sterol levels without overt dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>). Although the sterol surplus provided by Hsl is not essential under artificial laboratory conditions, it will be interesting to learn whether Hsl function provides a fitness advantage under the more variable conditions of a natural environment.</p><p>Remarkably, SE accumulation is also a hallmark of mammalian Hsl-deficient adipocytes arguing for a conserved role of this enzyme in adipocyte sterol homeostasis. Mammalian Hsl is an established regulator of SE breakdown in multiple tissues including testis, adrenal tissue, intestine, and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kraemer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Obrowsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Osuga et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sekiya et al., 2008</xref>). While a function of Hsl in adipocyte SE breakdown has been previously suggested by in vitro assays and altered gene expression signatures, it has not yet been substantiated by correlating it with adipocyte SE levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Osuga et al., 2000</xref>). Mammalian adipose tissue is an important sterol sink as it contains between 25% and 50% of total body cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krause and Hartman, 1984</xref>). Adipocytes also actively participate in reverse cholesterol transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prattes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). However, the majority of adipocyte sterol is non-esterified due to low sterol-<italic>O</italic>-acyltransferase activities in this tissue. Thus, the relevance of adipocyte SE as intermediate for systemic sterol transport in mammals is unclear. SE have recently been implicated in adipocyte differentiation and the formation of functional microdomains at LDs suggesting that SE function in subcellular rather than systemic sterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Perturbed expression of <italic>Hmgcs1</italic> and <italic>Soat1</italic> mRNA in AHKO adipose tissue likewise argues in favor of a Hsl function in regulating local, tissue-autonomous sterol homeostasis. If and how these alterations in SE storage and sterol metabolic gene expression translate into altered cellular functions remains to be investigated. It is well established that hepatocytes rather than adipocytes act as major hub of cholesterol distribution in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, previous studies implicated mammalian Hsl in hepatic SE degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sekiya et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body may integrate liver- and adipose tissue-like functions as both, sterol sink and sterol transport center with Hsl contributing to the latter function. While our data indicate that adipocyte Hsl guarantees efficient lipid allocation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> progeny a similar function of mammalian Hsl has yet to be established. Male Hsl mutant mice are infertile due to azoo- or oligospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Osuga et al., 2000</xref>). However, this pathology and the accompanying SE accumulation result from a testis-autonomous manifestation of Hsl-deficiency and are unrelated to the adipose tissue phenotype of Hsl-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fortier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vallet-Erdtmann et al., 2004</xref>). Although Hsl-deficient female mice are not grossly infertile maternal reproductive health and offspring development have not been systematically analyzed in Hsl-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2001</xref>). Our study of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hsl indicates an important role of this enzyme in the crosstalk between adipose tissue lipolysis, reproduction, and development. In light of the remarkable functional conservation of adipocyte Hsl during evolution, we believe that our study exposes an exciting future avenue for lipid and developmental research on mammalian and invertebrate model systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic></td><td>Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Research Center (VDRC)</td><td>Cat#: 60000</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic></td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>UAS-Hsl</italic></td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>UAS-Hsl-EGFP</italic></td><td>This study</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>bmm<sup>1</sup></italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grönke et al., 2005</xref> <break/>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2005.04.003">10.1016/j.cmet.2005.04.003</ext-link></td><td>FLYB: FBal0195572</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Akh<sup>A</sup></italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gáliková et al., 2015</xref> <break/>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.115.178897">10.1534/genetics.115.178897</ext-link></td><td>FLYB: FBal0319563</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>FB-GAL4</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grönke et al., 2003</xref> <break/>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00175%E2%80%931">10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00175–1</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Act5c-GAL4</italic></td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (BDSC)</td><td>Cat#: 4414 <break/>FLYB: FBst0004414</td><td>backcrossed to a <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> strain</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Cg-GAL4</italic></td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (BDSC)</td><td>Cat#: 7011 <break/>FLYB: FBst0007011</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> )</td><td><italic>nos-GAL4</italic></td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (BDSC)</td><td>Cat#: 64277 <break/>FLYB: FBst0064277</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Hsl shRNA</italic></td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (BDSC)</td><td>Cat#: 65148 <break/>FLYB: FBst0065148</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Chlorocebus aethiops</italic>)</td><td>COS-7</td><td>American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)</td><td>Cat#: CRL-1651 <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0224">CVCL_0224</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Mouse IgG-Horseradish Peroxidase antibody;

Sequencing of the PCR products revealed the presence of 51 bp residual P element sequence in the <italic>Hsl<sup>1</sup></italic> allele. The same PCR reaction was routinely used for genotyping of the <italic>Hsl</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To this end, individual flies were crushed in 50 µl 10 mM Tris/HCl buffer pH 8.2 containing 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaCl, and 200 µg/ml proteinase K.

Lipid analysis by TLC was performed at least twice with 3–8 biological replicates per experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Radiolabeling and tracer studies</title><p>For radiolabeling experiments, standard food was melted, mixed with <sup>3</sup>H-cholesterol (0.05% final concentration and 50 µCi/ml final specific activity) or <sup>14</sup>C-palmitic acid (200 µM final concentration and 10 µCi/ml final specific activity), and transferred à 500 µl into 24-well plates. 1st instar larvae were collected on apple juice agar plates supplemented with yeast paste and 20 larvae per genotype were transferred into each well containing radiolabeled food. Adult flies were sampled either within 1 day after eclosion or reared on unlabeled food for the indicated time. For lipid extraction, single flies were crushed with a pipet tip in 500 µl MTBE/methanol (3:1, v/v) and incubated for 30 min at 25°C and 600 rpm. After the addition of 100 µl H<sub>2</sub>O, samples were vortexed and phase separation was induced by centrifugation at 16,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Upper phases were collected and lower phases were re-extracted with 150 µl artificial upper phase. The combined upper phases were evaporated in a stream of nitrogen and the extracts were applied onto Silica G TLC plates, which were developed as described above. For the detection of sterols and SE, samples were spiked with cholesterol and cholesteryl oleate. Lipid bands were detected by exposure to iodine vapor and the associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For the measurement of cholesterol transfer to embryos, individual females were mated with two males of the same genotype in vials containing 2 ml LDM. Flies were flipped daily to fresh food and their egg cohorts were harvested in 100 µl distilled water. Embryos were disrupted by sonication and lipids were extracted by incubating the embryo homogenates with 500 µl MTBE/methanol (3:1, v/v) at 25°C and 600 rpm for 30 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min the upper phases were collected and the lower phases were re-extracted with 150 µl artificial upper phase. Radioactivity in the combined upper phases was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Radiolabling experiments were performed at least twice with 4–5 biological replicates of adult flies and 9–10 replicates of embryos per assay. Individual flies or cohorts were excluded from analysis upon the following criteria: (1) complete sterility, (2) early death unrelated to the applied stress (e.g. squeezing or sticking to food), (3) early escape from experimental vial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>LC-MS analysis of TG composition</title><p>Four batches of 5 flies each were mixed with 700 µl MTBE/methanol (10/3, v/v) in 2 ml safe-seal micro tubes (Cat#: 72.695.500, Sarstedt, Nürmbrecht, DE) and disrupted with a metal bead (5 mm diameter; Cat#: 504942, Askubal Korntal-Münchingen, DE) in a Retsch MM 400 mixer mill (3 min, 30 Hz, 4°C) and lipids were extracted by shaking for 20 min at 1400 rpm and 4°C in a ThermoMixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, DE). After the addition of 200 µl H<sub>2</sub>O, samples were again incubated 20 min at 1400 rpm and 4°C. Phase separation was induced by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 x <italic>g</italic> and 4°C. The upper organic phase was collected and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Lipids were washed by dissolving in 500 µl chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v) and again dried under a stream of nitrogen and stored at −20°C or prepared immediately for LC-MS analysis. For MS analysis, lipid extracts were dissolved in 0.5 ml chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), 50 µl of the sample were diluted with 100 µl isopropanol and 10 µl were injected for analysis using UPLC-QTOF-MS as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knittelfelder et al., 2014</xref>). Data analysis was performed using the Lipid Data Analyzer (LDA) software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartler et al., 2011</xref>). The abundance of each TG species was normalized to the intensity of the internal standard TG 51:0 (Larodan, Solna, SWE) and to animal number.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Lipid extraction and quantification by shotgun mass spectrometry</title><p>A total of 100 embryos or five female flies were homogenized with 1 mm zirconia beads in a cooled tissuelyzer for 2 × 5 min at 30 Hz in 200 µl isopropanol. The embryo homogenate was evaporated in a vacuum desiccator to complete dryness and subjected to lipid extraction. In case of the fly homogenate, an aliquot corresponding to one fly was transferred to a new sample tube and vacuum dried. Lipid extraction was performed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sales et al., 2017</xref>. In brief, 700 µl internal standard mix in MTBE/methanol (10:3, v/v) was added to each sample and vortexed for 1 hr at 4°C. After the addition of 140 µl H<sub>2</sub>O, samples were vortexed for another 15 min. Phase separation was induced by centrifugation at 16,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. The organic phase was transferred to a glass vial and evaporated. Samples were reconstituted in 300 µl chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). To a new vial, 100 µl were transferred and used for lipidome analysis. To quantify sterols, 150 µl of lipid extract were evaporated and acetylated with 300 µl chloroform/acetyl chloride (2:1, v/v) for 1 hr at room temperature (modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liebisch et al., 2006</xref>). After evaporation, sterol samples were reconstituted in 150 µl isopropanol/methanol/chloroform (4:2:1, v/v/v) and 7.5 mM ammonium formate (spray solution). For sterol measurements, samples were 1:5 diluted with spray solution. For lipidome measurements, samples were 1:10 diluted with spray solution. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a Q Exactive instrument (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with a robotic nanoflow ion source TriVersa NanoMate (Advion BioSciences, Ithaca, NY) using nanoelectrospray chips with a diameter of 4.1 µm. The ion source was controlled by the Chipsoft 8.3.1 software (Advion BioSciences, Ithaca, NY). Ionization voltage was + 0.96 kV in positive and − 0.96 kV in negative mode; backpressure was set at 1.25 psi in both modes. Samples were analyzed by polarity switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schuhmann et al., 2012</xref>). The temperature of the ion transfer capillary was 200°C; S-lens RF level was set to 50%. All samples were analyzed for 10 min. FT MS spectra were acquired within the range of m/z 400–1000 from 0 min to 0.2 min in positive and within the range of m/z 350–1000 from 5.2 min to 5.4 min in negative mode at the mass resolution of R m/z 200 = 140,000; automated gain control (AGC) of 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> and with the maximal injection time of 3000 ms. <italic>t</italic>-SIM in positive (0.2–5 min) and negative (5.4–10 min) mode was acquired with R m/z 200 = 140,000; automated gain control of 5 × 10<sup>4</sup>; maximum injection time of 650 ms; isolation window of 20 Th and scan range of m/z 400–1000 in positive and m/z 350–1000 in negative mode, respectively. The inclusion list of masses targeted in <italic>t</italic>-SIM analyses started at m/z 355 in negative and m/z 405 in positive ion mode and other masses were computed by adding 10 Th increment (i.e. m/z 355, 365, 375, …) up to m/z 1005. Acetylated sterols were quantified by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) FT MS/MS in an additional measurement. FT MS spectra within the range of m/z 350–1000 were acquired from 0 min to 0.2 min and <italic>t</italic>-SIM ranging from m/z 350 to 500 were acquired from 0.2 min to 4 min with the same settings as described above. PRM spectra were acquired from 4 min to 10 min. For PRM micro scans were set to 1, isolation window to 0.8 Da, normalized collision energy to 12.5%, AGC to 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> and maximum injection time to 3000 ms. All spectra were pre-processed using repetition rate filtering software PeakStrainer and stitched together by an in-house developed script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schuhmann et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schuhmann et al., 2017a</xref>). Lipids were identified by LipidXplorer software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herzog et al., 2012</xref>). Molecular Fragmentation Query Language (MFQL) queries were compiled for acetylated sterols, PA, LPA, PC, PC O-, LPC, LPC O-, PE, PE O-, LPE, PI, LPI, PS, LPS, PG, LPG, CL, CerPE, Cer, TG, DG lipid classes. The identification relied on accurately determined intact lipid masses (mass accuracy better than 5 ppm). Lipids were quantified by comparing the isotopically corrected abundances of their molecular ions with the abundances of internal standards of the same lipid class. For acetylated sterols, the specific fragment (loss of acetyl group) was used for quantification. Shotgun lipidomics experiments were performed twice with 3–4 biological replicates and both datasets were pooled for analysis resulting in a total number of 7–8 biological replicates. Data were normalized to animal number.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Group differences were analyzed by Student’s unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests and one-way ANOVAs using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

More broadly, your paper will be of interest to fields of metabolism and reproduction and to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Hormone-sensitive lipase is a major adipocyte steryl ester hydrolase and couples intergenerational sterol metabolism to reproductive success&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by two Reviewing Editors and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Specifically, the authors need to emphasize in the discussion that their findings are novel in the fly. In particular, the authors need to temper their statements regarding novelty in the mouse studies. It should also be noted that it is already well appreciated that HSL is a cholesterol ester hydrolase. This is well documented and known for many years (e.g., https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-3-12). The manuscript makes it seem the authors discovered this fact and overstate the advance in this regard. For example, Figure 4E,F is not surprising at all based on this previous knowledge, and they didn't measure DAG which is also greatly increased just like CE is as shown. So the text should be more grounded in what is already known, which is that HSL is already a well know sterol esterase.</p><p>In addition, the authors should re-word &quot;Generation of transgenic animals…&quot; etc. to &quot;Generation of transgenic flies…&quot;, as they otherwise refer to &quot;fly strains&quot; and the reader might be confused that this is vertebrate (animal) study. Also, statements such as &quot;In summary, our study identifies an ancestral function of Hsl-related enzymes in sterol handling and illustrates how this enzyme orchestrates intergenerational sterol transfer to optimize reproductive success. &quot; should clearly indicate that the work was done in flies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63252.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>In this study, Heier and colleagues identify Hormone-sensitive lipase (Hsl) as a major regulator of steryl ester (SE) hydrolysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in mouse adipocytes. in vitro, Hsl has the ability to hydrolise many different classes of lipids, but in vivo Hsl mutants specifically have elevated SE levels. Quite impressively, knockout of HSL in mouse fat tissue causes SE levels to increase 15-fold in adipocytes. Physiologically, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Hsl activity in the fat body appears to be required to mobilize cholesterol for loading into eggs during vitellogenesis, for maximal viability of the eggs and ensuing embryonic development.</p><p>Overall this study is very solid and the data are beautiful. The interpretations of the results are in line with the data. The key conclusions are convincing, so I have no major suggestions relating to the main claims of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this very positive perception of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have only minor suggestions:</p><p>1) Title: it seems to me that one of the key findings of this manuscript is that Hsl is a major steryl ester hydrolase conserved from flies to mice, and this is not currently reflected in the title. This seems more important to me than the intergenerational aspect currently mentioned in the title (after all, there are probably many proteins, transcripts and metabolites that need to be loaded into the embryo during vitellogenesis for optimal embryonic development…). So I suggest the authors consider an alternative title such as &quot;Hormone sensitive lipase is the main steryl ester hydrolase in adipocytes in flies and mammals&quot;? This might also make the manuscript more obviously relevant for a broader audience when it shows up on pubmed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that functional conservation between mouse and fly Hsl is a major theme in our manuscript. However, due to character restrictions we are unable to include this important aspect in the title. As pointed out by Reviewer 2, the major novelty of our study is the impact of (adipose) Hsl on reproduction and thus we believe that the title should reflect this aspect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1A – it would be good to have a non-transfected negative control to show that the band in the 2nd lane (HIS6-Hsl) is not a background band. (Admittedly, this is unlikely to be the case given that HIS6-Hsl expression is increasing lipase activity, as seen in Figure 1B, however without a negative control Figure 1A is not very useful.)</p></disp-quote><p>We included transfections with murine Hsl in the experiments depicted in Figure1A-B.

Does this suggest that during larval development very little SE hydrolysis is going on and the animal mainly stores SEs?</p></disp-quote><p>Under our experimental conditions net SE formation occurs during metamorphosis likely as a strategy to sequester excess dietary and tissue sterol during histolysis.

The balance of steryl ester synthesis and hydrolysis is important for proper homeostasis. This manuscript makes the important discovery that Hsl is a steryl ester hydrolase in both flies and mice. The phenotype in Figure 4F is very impressive – it shows that HSL is actually a major regulator of SE breakdown in mammalian adipocytes. Hence even though other SE hydrolases have been identified in mammals, Hsl appears to be an important one in adipose tissue.</p><p>Overall, I think this is an important discovery for the metabolism field.</p><p>Reviewer background: <italic>Drosophila</italic> metabolism and development</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This study explores the functions of the single Hormone-sensitive lipase (Hsl) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> melanogaster. Hsl-like proteins are present from bacteria to humans and are generally believed to degrade a wide range of neutral lipid including triglyceride (TG).

The manuscript could be published in its current form with some minor amendments (listed below) that will improve data presentation and/or the manuscript's readability. But I have listed a couple of experimental suggestions that will increase the general interest of the manuscript and will strengthen its more novel findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for this very positive appreciation of our study and for the selective proposals for improvement, which we will largely follow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experimental suggestions (in order of importance)</p><p>1) The authors hypothesise, but do not demonstrate, that fat body SE catabolism may be &quot;upstream&quot; of the embryogenesis phenotypes. This could easily be tested by, for example, downregulating Hsl in fat body and assessing fecundity in a lipid depleted diet, and/or by testing whether the fecundity phenotype of Hsl mutants can be rescued. It would be important to do so because this intergenerational phenotype is novel and arguably one of the more interesting findings reported in the manuscript. Related to this, to shed further light on the Hsl mutant rescue from nos-Gal4, the authors could have established what exactly is transferred to the embryo (i.e. Hsl itself and/or only lipid species) through, for example, germline mutant clones.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestions we tested fecundity of (1) animals with fat bodyspecific downregulation of Hsl expression and (2) Hsl1 mutant animals with fat-body specific re-expression of transgenic Hsl. The experiments indeed argue in favor of the reviewer’s hypothesis that fat body Hsl is required for optimal fecundity in our setup. The presentation of these data in new Figures 7 panels E and F thus represents a major advance of our study. We did not generate Hsl mutant germline clones since our data are consistent with the conclusion that <italic>Drosophila</italic> mothers transfer Hsl function rather than Hsl-derived lipids to the embryos. This conclusion is illustrated in Figure 5C, which shows that nos-GAL4 driven Hsl expression restores defective SE hydrolase activity to Hsl1 mutant embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Mouse data. Previous studies have phenotyped both the adipose tissue of Hsl knockout mice (e.g. PMID: 11717312) and the metabolic phenotypes of mice with an adipose tissue-specific Hsl deletion (PMID: 29232702, which the authors should mention and discuss). In light of these studies, the value of the mouse data presented in this manuscript is rather limited. Given that the authors have access to these mice, it would have made more sense to explore possible effects of disrupted adipose SE catabolism in adipose tissue in vivo, including possible effects on the developing progeny. In this context, the spermatogenesis defects of whole body Hsl knockout mice is intriguing.</p></disp-quote><p>We added information about energy and sterol metabolism deficits of different Hsl mutant mouse models to the discussion including the spermatogenesis defects of Hsl mutant males. While the major focus of our manuscript is on <italic>Drosophila</italic> our mouse data, although limited, provide an important proof-of-concept regarding the evolutionary conservation of tissuespecific sterol storage and mobilization. To strengthen this concept, we extended our comparative approach by (1) comparing lipolytic activities of recombinant <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hsl and mouse Hsl in the same experimental setup (new Figure 1A, B), (2) assessing the contribution of murine Hsl to adipose tissue SE hydrolase activities (new Figure 4G), (3) assessing consequences of disturbed adipocyte SE catabolism by measuring gene expression of sterol metabolism genes in adipocyte-specific Hsl knockout mice (new Figure 4H).</p><p>We believe that our comparative approach is valuable as it more broadly attracts attention of researchers from different areas and motivate further investigations into the relationship between adipocyte lipolysis and reproduction in both, mammalian and invertebrate models. Assessing a potential intergenerational effect of adipocyte-specific Hsl knockout on mammalian progeny is an exciting future research question but certainly beyond the scope of the presented study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Analyzing endogenous Hsl expression would have been more informative than ectopically expressing it. If the authors are unable provide endogenous expression data, the claims about Hsl localization should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s concern. Since we are currently unable to detect endogenous Hsl by immunostaining we changed the wording in the Results section to better reflect the limitations of our over-expression approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>1) In Abstract, the wording &quot;directly equip embryos&quot; is unclear; one needs to read the manuscript to understand what it means.</p></disp-quote><p>The Abstract section has been rephrased for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Introduction extensively described two TG catabolism pathways (bmm and Akhmediated) when, at the end of the day, Hsl turns out not to be the elusive Akh target lipase. Overall, I felt that the authors did a good job at introducing Hsl from a <italic>Drosophila</italic> perspective, but I would have valued a broader introduction about what is (un)known about the Hsl family in other organisms. Similarly, in the discussion, a comparative discussion placing the findings in the context of mammalian literature, cholesterol auxotrophy in flies etc would have been helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the notion that the mentioned sections of the introduction and discussion are not well balanced. Accordingly, we included these proposed points in the Introduction and Discussion, respectively. In particular, we added more information about structural similarities of Hsl-related enzymes of different phyla and known physiological functions of mammalian Hsl.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In discussion: &quot;and highlight an ancestral function of Hsl-related enzymes in the intergenerational sterol homeostasis of animals.&quot; This is a bit misleading because the intergenerational phenotype is only shown in flies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the wording accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some discussion of possible roles for Hsl in males would have been interesting. Are Hsl levels sexually dimorphic/regulated by mating in females?</p></disp-quote><p>High-throughput expression data (modENCODE) suggest a moderate mating-dependent Hsl regulation in ovaries but no global sexually dimorphic expression levels. We assessed potentially sexually dimorphic Hsl expression in males, virgin females, and mated females by qRT-PCR but did not find noticeable differences between those groups (data not shown). In the light of the limited value of these results and our limited data on <italic>Drosophila</italic> males we will not further discuss possible sex-specific roles of Hsl.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please provide the dilutions used for the antibodies listed.</p></disp-quote><p>Dilutions are now provided in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please clarify how the mutant was validated (genomic PCR?).</p></disp-quote><p>Now we included the result of a representative PCR genotyping experiment in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and added the detailed sequence information regarding the molecular characterization of the allele to the Materials and methods section.

For clarification we added cartoons to Figure 3D-F indicating the labeled lipid moieties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In Figure 7 and related text it is worth clarifying that the LDM diet already contains some cholesterol prior to cholesterol supplementation.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the wording in the Results section, Materials and methods section, and figure legend to clarify this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please state melanogaster the first time the term <italic>Drosophila</italic> is used.</p></disp-quote><p>We now introduce <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in the Abstract and Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Please include references for the statement regarding lipid mobilisation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reference was included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Figure legend 2 states that starvation was monitored every 2-12h, whereas the Materials and methods section states 4-12h.

In particular, the authors need to temper their statements regarding novelty in the mouse studies. It should also be noted that it is already well appreciated that HSL is a cholesterol ester hydrolase. This is well documented and known for many years (e.g., https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-3-12). The manuscript makes it seem the authors discovered this fact and overstate the advance in this regard. For example, Figure 4E,F is not surprising at all based on this previous knowledge, and they didn't measure DAG which is also greatly increased just like CE is as shown. So the text should be more grounded in what is already known, which is that HSL is already a well know sterol esterase.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified several passages of the text including the abstract to clarify that our study was done in flies.

To avoid overstatements regarding our mouse data we repeatedly state that “Mammalian Hsl is an established regulator of SE breakdown in multiple tissues including testis, adrenal tissue, intestine, and liver.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors should re-word &quot;Generation of transgenic animals…&quot; etc. to &quot;Generation of transgenic flies…&quot;, as they otherwise refer to &quot;fly strains&quot; and the reader might be confused that this is vertebrate (animal) study.
