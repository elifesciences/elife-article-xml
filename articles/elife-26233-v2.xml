Phosphorylation by G1-CDK of Whi5/Rb inhibitors of SBF/E2F transcription factors triggers irreversible S-phase entry in yeast and metazoans, but why this occurs at a given cell size is not fully understood. We show that the yeast Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway, orthologous to Gwl-Arpp19/ENSA, is up-regulated in early G1 and helps promoting START by preventing PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> to dephosphorylate Whi5. <italic>RIM15</italic> overexpression lowers cell size while <italic>IGO1,2</italic> deletion delays START in cells with low CDK activity.

Rim15 activity increases after cells switch from fermentation to respiration, where Igo1,2 contribute to chromosome maintenance. Interestingly Cln3-Cdk1 also inhibits Rim15 activity, which enables homeostatic control of Whi5 phosphorylation and cell cycle entry.

Despite large differences in cell sizes within and between species, cells of a given cell type usually adopt a homogenous size suited to their nutritional environment, a property called cell size homeostasis. Even after stress-induced cell size variations, cells return to their original size within a few cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fantes, 1977</xref>). Such size correction mechanisms imply that cells have means to sense their size and to change their division rate accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ginzberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004</xref>). Budding yeast and mammalian cells coordinate cell growth and cell division mostly in G1 at a point called ‘START’ or ‘Restriction point’, respectively, after which they become committed to undergo cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Killander and Zetterberg, 1965</xref>). In fission yeast this size control operates mainly in G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nurse, 1975</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, a large body of evidence indicates that the earliest G1 cyclin, Cln3, fulfills the criteria required for a size sensor: it has a short half life and its abundance scales with protein synthesis rates; increased Cln3 dosage makes cells smaller, and conversely low Cln3 makes cells larger. Cln3-Cdk1 promotes START by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma (Rb) ortholog Whi5, thus activating the SBF transcription factor responsible for expression of the late G1 cyclins Cln1,2 and cell cycle entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cross, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jorgensen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nash et al., 1988</xref>). However, what precisely sets the right size for START is unclear because Cln3 concentration seems to remain constant during G1. Several models have been proposed to explain how Cln3 could trigger START at a specific cell size: (i) rise in nuclear Cln3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jorgensen et al., 2007</xref>), (ii) Cln3 sequestration in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vergés et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yahya et al., 2014</xref>), (iii) titration of Cln3 against fixed number of SBF sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) or (iv) dilution of the Whi5 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>). However each of these models has downsides and none fully explains how the critical cell size required for START is modulated by nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmoller and Skotheim, 2015</xref>). In particular, it is not known why yeast cells grown on poor nutrients, which have low Cln3 levels and little biosynthetic capacity, actually pass START at a smaller cell size.</p><p>START occurs when Cln3-Cdk1 phosphorylates Whi5 and Stb1, changing them from repressors to activators of SBF, which controls the transcription of ~200 genes important for G1 progression and DNA synthesis, including the <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Cln1,2 accumulation leads to further SBF activation through positive feedback, making the G1/S transition irreversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charvin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cross and Tinkelenberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dirick and Nasmyth, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skotheim et al., 2008</xref>). Full Cln1,2-Cdk1 activity then triggers degradation of Sic1, an inhibitor of S-phase CDKs (Clb5,6-Cdk1), which leads to the initiation of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nash et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schwob et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwob and Nasmyth, 1993</xref>). A similar pathway operates in mammalian cells with cyclin D-Cdk4 phosphorylating retinoblastoma family members (Rb, p107, p130) to relieve the inhibition of E2F, leading to synthesis of cyclin E, degradation of the p27<sup>Kip1</sup> CDK inhibitor and initiation of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertoli et al., 2013</xref>). The G2/M transition is also triggered by positive feedback, with M-CDK promoting degradation of its inhibitor Wee1 and stabilization of the counteracting Cdc25 phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pomerening et al., 2003</xref>). The mechanisms leading to the initial activation of these auto-regulatory, positive feedback loops controlling G1/S and G2/M are less well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kishimoto, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The phosphorylation state of target proteins depends not only on kinase activity but also on the balance with counteracting protein phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uhlmann et al., 2011</xref>). Hence inhibiting phosphatases is another way to promote CDK-driven cell cycle transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For example Cdc14, the main phosphatase counteracting M-CDK phosphorylation in budding yeast, is sequestered in the nucleolus away from its mitotic substrates and only released during anaphase when M-CDK sites need to be dephosphorylated for M exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Visintin et al., 1998</xref>). Another major phosphatase, PP2A, was considered constitutively active until it was found that the Greatwall/Mastl kinase transiently inhibits PP2A-B55 via phosphorylation of the endosulfines ENSA and Arpp19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mochida et al., 2010</xref>). This inhibition of PP2A is required for robust mitotic entry and progression. Recent data and mathematical modeling suggest that inhibition of PP2A by the Gwl pathway is key for irreversible, switch-like mitotic entry in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mochida et al., 2016</xref>). The Gwl signalling pathway is strikingly conserved on the biochemical level in yeast, with Rim15 kinase phosphorylating Igo1 and Igo2, which then inhibit PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bontron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Talarek et al., 2010</xref>). The function seems different however as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rim15-Igo1,2 play key roles in quiescence entry and gametogenesis, but only a minor role in mitosis upon cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sarkar et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, both Rim15 and its fission yeast ortholog Ppk18 are regulated by TORC1, thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell size in response to nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chica et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martín et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno-Torres et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pedruzzi et al., 2003</xref>). Recently, it was found that human cells depleted of ENSA have a longer S phase due to decreased levels of Treslin/TICRR, an essential replication initiation protein, indicating that Gwl does more than only regulating mitosis in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charrasse et al., 2017</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26233.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Rim15 pathway is activated and becomes essential when Cdc28 activity is low.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Rim15 pathway can potentiate CDK-dependent phosphorylation of target proteins by inhibiting the CDK-counteracting PP2A phosphatase.

We recently devised a flow cytometry method based on pulse incorporation of the thymidine analogue ethynyl-deoxyuridine (EdU) in yeast to precisely determine the fraction of cells in G1, S and G2+M phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Talarek et al., 2015</xref>).

This absence of phenotype might stem from CDK activation being strong enough, in regular laboratory conditions, to drive cell cycle transitions without the need to inhibit the CDK-counteracting PP2A phosphatases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since major cell cycle transitions are often controlled by multisite phosphorylation of key substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nash et al., 2001</xref>), we reasoned that the Rim15/Gwl phosphatase-regulating pathway might come into play only when CDK activity decreases below a threshold where unrestrained phosphatase activity would prevent CDKs to fully phosphorylate these key substrates.</p><p>To test this idea, we used the <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> Shokat allele of Cdk1 whose activity can be inhibited specifically and gradually with the bulky ATP analogue 1-NMPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bishop et al., 2000</xref>).

In contrast, the 1-NMPP1 hypersensitivity was not suppressed by <italic>SWE1</italic> deletion, suggesting that it is not due to delayed mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The fact that Rim15 and Igo1,2 become essential when Cdk1 activity is lowered could indicate that the pathway is hyperactive in these conditions. Indeed using Phos-tag gel analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kinoshita et al., 2006</xref>) to monitor Igo1 phosphorylation, we found that the pool of Igo1 phosphorylated at Ser64 raised from 32% to 65% upon Cdk1 attenuation with only 10 nM 1-NMPP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We conclude that decreasing Cdk1 activity causes an increase in Rim15 activity measured on Igo1.</p><p>We noticed that <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells were much larger (population median cell volume 98.5 fL) and had a longer doubling time (99 min) than <italic>CDC28</italic> cells (61.6 fL, 83 min), even in the absence of 1-NMPP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This is likely due to the lower ATP binding and turnover of the <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bishop et al., 2000</xref>). Using bivariate EdU-PI FACS analysis coupled to doubling time we found that the G1 and G2+M phases were lengthened, indicating that both the G1/S and G2/M transitions are affected by the <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Addition of 1-NMPP1 mostly delayed mitosis, however (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, Cln3 overexpression suppressed the large size and the long G1 of <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells grown without 1-NMPP1, indicating that the <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> protein likely has defects in the interaction with, or activation by G1 cyclins, with consequences on size control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Deletion of <italic>IGO1</italic> and <italic>IGO2</italic> further increased the median size and coefficient of variation of <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells grown in the absence of 1-NMPP1, without changing their doubling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Note that the apparent shorter G1 duration in <italic>cdc28-as1 igo1,2∆</italic> cells stems from them being born at a larger size, not because they pass START earlier. Conversely expression of <italic>RIM15</italic> from the strong <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter lowered the size of wild type, <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> and <italic>cln3∆</italic> cells, reinforcing the notion that the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway is involved in size control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To this end, we used asynchronous cultures of a <italic>cln1∆ cln2∆ GAL-CLN3 IGO1-myc</italic> strain in which the sole source of G1 cyclins (Cln3 in this case) is under control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter.

Importantly, these changes in Igo1 phosphorylation occurred in asynchronous cells and much faster than any change in cell cycle distribution, ruling out the possibility that they are linked to cell cycle position. This result indicates that Rim15 activity responds rapidly to variations in Cln3 levels at any position of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We conclude that Rim15 activity is highest in early G1 cells, and repressed when Cln3-Cdk1 activity rises at START. The idea that Cln3-Cdk1 represses Rim15 is consistent with Rim15 activity being highest in early G1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) when Cln3 is lowest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thorburn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zapata et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway promotes START by inhibiting PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup></title><p>What could be the function of Rim15 in early G1 cells?

To correct for any differences in cell synchrony between different strains and cultures, we scored the median cell volume of the population when it reached half-maximal budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), as in other studies of cell size at START (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jorgensen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thorburn et al., 2013</xref>). This size was only marginally increased, if at all, in <italic>igo1,2∆</italic> cells compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> left), as expected from the unchanged cell size, doubling time and cell cycle phase durations measured on asynchronous populations.

This indicates that the Rim15 pathway becomes important for proper chromosome maintenance when cells grow at a lower rate, likely by inhibiting PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> to set an optimal size for START, although we cannot rule out that PP2A targets other than Whi5-Stb1 are involved.

The fact that CDK activity is constantly opposed by phosphatases is witnessed by the rapid dephosphorylation of many target proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> when Cdk1 is chemically inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holt et al., 2009</xref>). Yet this balance between kinases and phosphatases has to be tipped over for cells to move from one metastable cell cycle state to the next. It has been well documented that the major cell cycle transitions are triggered by a sudden rise in CDK activity. In yeast, for example, cell cycle entry occurs when the Cln1,2-Cdk1 positive feedback loop leads to more <italic>CLN1,2</italic> transcription, S-phase entry when the Clb-Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1 is suddenly destroyed, and G2/M when mitotic kinases stimulate their own activation. However, it is less clear how these feedback loops are initiated in the first place. Here, we identify the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway, orthologous to metazoan Gwl-Arpp19/ENSA, as a new player in G1 progression in budding yeast. We show that Rim15-Igo1,2 transiently inhibits the phosphatase PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> in early G1 cells, helping them to tip the balance towards more pronounced phosphorylation of Whi5 by Cln3-Cdk1. Deletion of <italic>IGO1</italic> and <italic>IGO2</italic> has subtle phenotypes in wild type cells, such as a slightly larger size at START and heightened chromosome loss, but these phenotypes are exacerbated when G1 CDK activity is low, such as in <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells or wild type cells growing on poor carbon sources. Thus, decreased Cln3-Cdk1 activity combined to lack of PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> inhibition in <italic>igo1,2∆</italic> cells leads to delayed Whi5 phosphorylation and budding at a larger cell size. This larger size at budding is suppressed by ectopic <italic>CLN2</italic> or <italic>CLN3</italic> expression and by deletion of <italic>WHI5</italic> and <italic>STB1</italic>, which are known targets of Cln3-Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holt et al., 2009</xref>). This demonstrates that the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway promotes START by activating SBF-dependent transcription. That Rim15 does so by inhibiting PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> is supported by finding that the large size at budding of <italic>cdc28-as1 igo1,2∆</italic> cells is suppressed by deletion of <italic>CDC55</italic>, but not by an Igo1-S64A version that cannot inhibit PP2A. The inhibition of PP2A by Endosulfines/Igo1,2 proteins was demonstrated previously <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mochida et al., 2010</xref>), but also in yeast cells stressed by heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>), rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bontron et al., 2013</xref>) or nutrient deprivation at meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sarkar et al., 2014</xref>). We provide here the first evidence that Rim15 controls START during vegetative growth. It is tempting to speculate that analogous mechanisms might control G1 progression in mammals where Rb family members, like Whi5 in yeast, are dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kurimchak and Graña, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The Rim15 analogs Gwl, Mastl and Ppk18 have been shown to regulate entry, progression and exit of mitosis in flies, frog egg extracts, mammals and fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez-Fernández et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chica et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cundell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mochida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). In the absence of Gwl or ENSA/Arpp19, cells fail to reach or maintain the level of CDK phosphorylation required for an efficient mitosis. Recently, it was shown that PP2A-B55 and CycB-Cdk1 can promote M-phase entry by forming two bi-stable switches that are interlocked via their antagonistic effects on Gwl-ENSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mochida et al., 2016</xref>). A central tenet of this model is that Gwl is activated by CycB-Cdk1 to inhibit its counteracting phosphatase. However Gwl might also be active also outside of mitosis, as recently suggested by the severe S-phase progression defects following ENSA depletion in human cells, due to decreased half-life of Treslin/TICRR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charrasse et al., 2017</xref>). Gwl also plays a role in <italic>S. pombe</italic> sexual differentiation coupled to nutrient availability, by interfacing TORC1 and TORC2 activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martín et al., 2017</xref>). Altogether, it appears that transient inhibition of PP2A by the Gwl pathway can be used in various cell cycle stages and physiological situations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Rim15, a nutrient-controlled starter for START in budding yeast</title><p>In contrast to metazoans, inactivation of the Rim15/Gwl pathway has no obvious cell cycle phenotype in budding and fission yeasts grown in rich medium.

When nutrients are scarce or when TORC1 is inhibited by rapamycin, Rim15/Ppk18 is activated, Igo1,2 are phosphorylated and PP2A<sup>Cdc55/Pab1</sup> activity is down-regulated to favor cell differentiation programs such as gametogenesis or quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bontron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martín et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sarkar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Talarek et al., 2010</xref>). Rim15/Ppk18 also has an effect on the cell cycle by promoting precocious mitotic entry in fission yeast to adapt cell size to nitrogen availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chica et al., 2016</xref>), or to promote G<sub>0</sub> arrest by stabilizing the CDK inhibitor Sic1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno-Torres et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show that Rim15-Igo1,2 controls cell cycle entry (START) in budding yeast when cells are grown in conditions of low CDK activity. Accordingly, Rim15 activity measured by Igo1 phosphorylation increases upon Cdk1 inhibition and decreases when <italic>CLN3</italic> is overexpressed. Thus, Rim15 is negatively regulated by G1-CDK in yeast, consistent with the decreased Rim15 phosphorylation and increased Igo1,2 phosphorylation observed in <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells briefly exposed to 1-NMPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holt et al., 2009</xref>). At first glance, this finding seems at odds with the activation of Gwl by CDK at mitotic entry in metazoans, but can be explained by the multiple and partly overlapping regulation of Gwl in different organisms. The residues important for Gwl activation by M-CDK in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (T193, T206) and mammals and the auto-activation site (S883) are all missing in yeast Rim15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, Rim15 contains sites (T1075, T1565) that are phosphorylated by CDKs to regulate its nuclear exclusion and cytoplasmic retention. It has been shown that Rim15 and Igo1,2 concentrate in the nucleus after phosphate starvation, after the diauxic shift or when TORC1 is inactivated, as cells accumulate in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirisola et al., 2014</xref>). Upon phosphate re-addition Pho80-85 (a CDK-like kinase) phosphorylates Rim15 to take it out of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wanke et al., 2005</xref>). The same site phosphorylated by Pho80-85 is also phosphorylated by Cln2-Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breitkreutz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holt et al., 2009;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moreno-Torres et al., 2017)</xref>. We, therefore, propose that decreasing CDK activity in budding yeast causes Rim15 to accumulate in the nucleus, where it can phosphorylate Igo1,2 proteins and inhibit PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> against its nuclear targets.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that Rim15 activity and Igo1 phosphorylation increase markedly when yeast cells undergo the diauxic shift and rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This transition is accompanied by a stark reduction in Cln3 levels and associated kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parviz and Heideman, 1998</xref>). These cells also adjust their cell cycle to the poorer carbon source by lowering the Cln3 threshold required for START, which reduces their overall cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>). How cells growing in poor nutrients reduce their critical cell size for START despite reduced protein synthesis rates and low Cln3 levels has been a long standing mystery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004</xref>). We show here that Rim15 and Igo1,2 are required for the reduced START size of cells growing on non-fermentable carbon sources, by protecting Whi5 from being excessively dephosphorylated by PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Size homeostasis by negative feedback of Cln3-Cdk1 on Rim15</title><p>Homeostatic systems require a sensor that negatively feeds back to an effector mechanism controlling the output of a system, so to keep the variable being measured within an acceptable range. The early G1 cyclin Cln3 has attributes for a sensor that controls the critical size at START in yeast: its abundance is coupled to growth rate; it binds Cdk1, phosphorylates Whi5 and releases the inhibition of the SBF transcription factor responsible for cell cycle commitment. Here, we demonstrate that the Rim15 kinase also promotes SBF activation, by inhibiting the protein phosphatase (PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup>) that counteracts Cln3-Cdk1’s action on Whi5. But importantly, it does so only in conditions of low Cln3-Cdk1 activity. Indeed deletion of <italic>RIM15</italic> or <italic>IGO1,2</italic> has little or no effect on size when cells contain normal levels of Cln3 (WT cells grown in rich medium), but increases the size at budding in cells containing lower Cln3-Cdk1 activity (<italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells grown in rich medium, or WT cells grown on poor carbon sources). Furthermore, we show that the converse is also true: cells in which Cln3 expression is induced respond by rapidly shutting off Rim15 kinase activity on Igo1,2. Hence, Cln3-Cdk1, Rim15 and PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> form a homeostatic system correcting the size at START when Cln3 levels fluctuate, through negative feedback of Cln3-Cdk1 on Rim15: when Cln3 is high, Rim15 activity is low and PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> counteracts the effect of high Cln3; when Cln3 is low, Rim15 activity increases, PP2A is inhibited, thus lowering the Cln3 threshold for multisite Whi5 phosphorylation and START (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Besides negative regulation by Cln3-Cdk1, Rim15 is also repressed by the TORC1 and PKA pathways, which control cell proliferation in response to nutrient availability. TORC1 and PKA signaling decreases when nutrients are limiting, which activates Rim15 and facilitates START. The current ‘Cln3 only’ model of START control was unable to explain why cells growing on poor nutrients and containing little Cln3 do in fact pass START at a smaller, not larger cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turner et al., 2012</xref>). One advantage for starved cells to be smaller might be that small cells have a greater surface area to volume ratio, which optimizes the yield of cell surface nutrient transporters relative to cell volume. We propose that the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway is the missing component that facilitates START in poor nutrient conditions, compensating for low Cln3 activity in starved cells and making them pass START at a smaller size.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26233.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for homeostatic control of START by antagonism between Cln3-Cdk1 and Rim15, and cooperation for Whi5 phosphorylation.</title><p>TORC1, PKA and PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> have additional targets while Cln3-Cdk1 also targets Stb1, which are not shown here for simplicity. When nutrients are poor, TORC1 is down regulated leading to low Cln3 levels and higher Rim15 activity. High Rim15 then inhibits PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> to promote Whi5 phosphorylation and START despite low Cln3-Cdk1 activity. Conversely, when nutrients are rich, high TORC1 leads to Cln3 accumulation, Rim15 inhibition and high PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> activity. The regulatory network leading to START and cell cycle entry can be decomposed in two modules: the Starter module (on top) favours initial Whi5 phosphorylation by decreasing PP2A activity when Cln3-Cdk1 activity is low, is coupled to nutrient availability and provides cell size homeostasis; the Amplifier module (on bottom) brings in positive feedback by Cln1,2-Cdk1 for full Whi5 phosphorylation and irreversibility of the START transition.

However, none considered that Whi5 has to be phosphorylated on many sites to trigger START and that inhibition of the counteracting phosphatase could tip the balance towards full Whi5 phosphorylation. Our results suggest this is the case. We found that Rim15 activity is highest in early G1 cells, even when wild type cells are grown in rich medium, at a time when Cln3 levels are minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thorburn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zapata et al., 2014</xref>).

In early G1 cells Rim15 would promote the initial phosphorylation of Whi5 when Cln3 levels are low, and once SBF is activated Cln1,2 cyclins phosphorylate Whi5 further via positive feedback, triggering irreversible cell cycle commitment but also shutting off Rim15 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Our discovery that the Rim15/Gwl pathway regulates Whi5 phosphorylation in yeast in response to nutrient quality and Cln3 levels leads to a more complete model for cell size homeostasis at START.

10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL and grown overnight in 1–2 liters of YEPR at 30°C until 5.10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 400 ml of cold YEPRaff, and sonicated 30 s on VibraCell 72405 sonicator set at amplitude 60. Cells were kept on ice, loaded onto a Beckman J6-MC centrifuge (JE5.0 rotor) at 3600 rpm, with the pump (Masterflex, Cole Parmer, Barrington, IL) flow rate set at 20 mL/min until the 40 mL chamber was full, and left to equilibrate for 10 min with cold SC-D medium. Pump speed was then gradually increased by 0.02 increments until small daughter cells were elutriated (between 22 and 25 mL/min). Cells were collected until a sufficient amount was reached. For <italic>MET3p-CLN2</italic> cells were elutriated in SC-D in which the methionine was omitted and then released in SC-D with or without methionine. For <italic>GAL10p-CLN3</italic> cells were elutriated in SC-R and then released in SC-D, SC-R + G00.1% and SC-G. Modal cell volume was measured with a Cell Analyser System (CASY1 TTC, Schärfe System, Reutlingen, Germany).

Median cell volume and cell concentration were measured every hour for 10 hr using a cell counter (CASY1 TTC). To discard debris and cell clumps the median cell volume was determined from cells spanning 2.5 to 10 µm in diameter. Population doubling time was calculated by linear regression during exponential growth. The fraction of cells in G1, S and G2+M was determined as follows: every hour 1 mL of cells was pulsed for 10 min with 25 µM EdU. EdU incorporation was quantified using a Click reaction and FACS as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Talarek et al., 2015</xref>). The fraction of cells in G1, S and G2+M phases was determined from PI-EdU dot blots.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Andrea Musacchio (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael L Goldberg (Reviewer #2); Frank Uhlmann (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Talarek et al. investigate the contribution of the Greatwall-Endosulfine pathway to budding yeast cell size regulation. Greatwall-Endosulfines are inhibitors of the major cell cycle phosphatase PP2A-Cdc55 and they have so far mainly been studied as positive regulators of mitotic entry in metazoan cells. Being major phosphatase regulators, it is conceivable that their role extends beyond mitotic regulation, but this possibility has not been widely explored. This study demonstrates a role for the budding yeast Greatwall-Endosulfines, Rim15-Igo1/2, in regulating the duration of G1 and thereby cell size. The authors find that in rich growth medium, Rim15-Igo1/2 are only transiently active in small G1 daughter cells and have limited impact on cell cycle progression. In contrast, if nutrients are restricted, Rim15-Igo1/2 are activated to inhibit PP2A and thereby facilitate cell cycle entry at small cell size. This provides a molecular explanation for how nutrient signalling is linked to cell size control in budding yeast. Given the conservation of these components, this regulation likely applies to other organisms. This fundamentally extends our understanding of both the Greatwall-Endosulfine pathway and of cell size control. All three reviewers found the manuscript interesting and recommended publication in a revised form after attention is given to several issues.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Subsection “Lowering CDK activity reveals a cell cycle function for the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway”, last paragraph: The authors argue that overexpression of Cln3 suppressed the large size and the longer G1 of the <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells grown without 1-NM-PP1. The authors should clarify this claim. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> indicates that G1 phase of the <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> allele is not longer that in wild type cells in SCRaf+Gal medium. Rather, G1 seems accelerated in cells expressing CLN3 and mitosis appears to take longer. Furthermore, it appears that the combination of <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> and <italic>igo1,2</italic> delta makes G1 faster (and mitosis longer). Is this consistent with the authors' main hypothesis?</p><p>Is the median cell size measured specifically for the G1 population? From examining <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, it appears that the largest delay deriving from expression of the <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> allele takes place in mitosis, and that the size of cells correlates with the duration of mitosis (e.g. the smallest size is observed in cells with the fastest mitosis, the GAL-CLN3 (OFF) cells.</p><p>Introduction, third paragraph: the authors introduce the idea that the substrate phosphorylation status depends on the relative impact of both the kinase and phosphatase and cite a review article by Fisher et al. 2012. However, this concept was introduced in 2011, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2011) 366, 3572-3583, which should be cited.</p><p>Introduction: 'Gwl does more than simply regulating mitosis in mammals (Charrasse et al. in revision)'. Can the authors be more specific here, especially as this paper is not yet published?</p><p>Subsection “Lowering CDK activity reveals a cell cycle function for the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway”, last paragraph: '… cells were much larger… (98.5fL,…)…', as this is the first time that the cell volume measurements are introduced, it might be worth it to explain that median cell volumes are reported. The correct SI abbreviation for femtolitre is 'fl'.</p><p>Subsection “Lowering CDK activity reveals a cell cycle function for the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway”, last paragraph: 'Deletion of IGO1 and IGO2 further increased the median size…, which means that Rim15-Igo1,2 is involved in cell size homeostasis'. In this and several other cases throughout the manuscript, the authors should be careful with the use of the terms 'size homeostasis' and 'size control'. Deletion of IGO1,2 leads to larger cells that still maintain a constant, albeit larger, size. In this case, it can be concluded that IGO1,2 contribute to cell size control, but not to cell size homeostasis. Only if deletion of IGO1,2 results in a larger spread of the cell size distribution, relative to the mean, one could conclude on a role in size homeostasis.</p><p>The data are generally well presented and clear. In some gels the level of loading standards seem to vary substantially from lane to lane, an aspect that could be improved.</p><p>Subsection “The Rim15 pathway is hyperactive in early G1 cells and repressed by Cln3”, first paragraph: 'No shift was detected in the igo1-S64A mutant, indicating that phosphorylation is due to Rim15.' It is not clear how this experiment shows that phosphorylation is due to Rim15. To conclude this, Igo1 phosphorylation should be compared in a rim15 deletion strain.</p><p>Subsection “The Rim15 pathway is hyperactive in early G1 cells and repressed by Cln3”, last paragraph: '…Igo1-S64 phosphorylation… decreased 2-fold within 10 min of Gal re-addition'. This is surprising as the cells were shifted to glucose-containing medium. Galactose induction is usually slow and sluggish once cells have been repressed with glucose. Has the experiment rather been performed by shift from Raff+Gal to Raff, then back to Raff+Gal?</p><p>Subsection “The Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway promotes START by inhibiting PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup>”, last paragraph: '…expression of CLN2 from the MET3 promoter fully rescued the START delay of <italic>cdc28-as1 igo1,2Δ</italic> cells, indicating that the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway favours the transcription of CLN1,2 genes.' This conclusion is not the only possible scenario. Increased PP2A activity in <italic>igo1,2Δ</italic> cells might simply pose a greater requirement for Cln-Cdk activity to overcome PP2A to trigger start. While increased CLN2 expression is one way to override PP2A, this does not necessarily mean that Igo1,2 impacts on CLN1,2 transcription. If the authors want to conclude on CLN1,2 transcription, CLN1,2 transcription should be experimentally assessed.</p><p>Subsection “Rim15/Gwl disrupts the balance between kinases and phosphatases”, first paragraph: 'Cell lacking Igo1,2 are larger while keeping the same doubling time…', this disagrees with the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, showing that the cell size of Igo1,2 lacking cells (62.3 fl) is very close to wt (61.6 fl).</p><p>Stb1 is apparently a cofactor of Whi5, and the authors should clearly explain this relationship. Of greater concern, the authors sometimes seem to say or imply that this protein is also a target of PP2A-Cdc55, but they have never looked at this protein on Western blots. The authors' approach to this cofactor needs to be made less confusing.</p><p>For the data in this paper to be convincing, it is essential that roughly 2X changes in Igo1 phosphorylation have consequence. Because of the presumed very tight association between the inhibitor and phosphatase, this should only be true if the concentration of PP2A-Cdc55 is in excess of the amount of phosphorylated Igo1,2 (see <italic>eLife</italic>. 2014 Mar 11;3:e01695). Shouldn't one in theory be able to mimic these results in diploid cells simply by comparing wild type with PP2A-Cdc55 heterozygotes? Here is a case where quantitation would clearly help make the authors' case stronger.</p><p>In Western blots, Swi6 is apparently a loading control, but then is the normalization across a blot measuring cell number or cell volume or…?

The authors should clarify this claim. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> indicates that G1 phase of the cdc28-as1 allele is not longer that in wild type cells in SCRaf+Gal medium. Rather, G1 seems accelerated in cells expressing CLN3 and mitosis appears to take longer. Furthermore, it appears that the combination of cdc28-as1 and igo1,2 delta makes G1 faster (and mitosis longer). Is this consistent with the authors' main hypothesis?</italic> </p><p>We repeated the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> with <italic>GAL-CLN3</italic> strains grown for a longer time in SCD or in SCRaf+Gal media. These experiments are done on asynchronous cell populations and G1 duration is calculated by multiplying the fraction of 1C DNA cells (measured from EdU/PI bivariate FACS) by the population doubling time. Thus <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells, which have a START delay, will not spend proportionally more time in G1 compared to WT cells because they are also born at a larger size. In contrast, if G1 duration is measured from small elutriated cells it will be longer for <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> then for WT cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The same logic applies when comparing <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> and <italic>cdc28-as1 igo1,2∆</italic> cells: the latter appear to spend less time in G1 in this population-based assay, mainly because they are born larger. Our data clearly show that Cln3 overexpression lowers the mean size of <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells (60.8 fL vs. 74.9 fL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the fraction of G1 cells in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data also indicate, as noticed by the reviewer, that WT cells overexpressing Cln3 compensate their shorter G1 by spending more time in G2+M; we don’t know whether this reflects a cryptic size control in G2 or whether subtle defects in cell cycle progression activate checkpoint responses. These notions are now clarified in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Is the median cell size measured specifically for the G1 population? From examining <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, it appears that the largest delay deriving from expression of the cdc28-as1 allele takes place in mitosis, and that the size of cells correlates with the duration of mitosis (e.g. the smallest size is observed in cells with the fastest mitosis, the GAL-CLN3 (OFF) cells.</italic> </p><p>The median cell size is for the entire population, not solely for G1 cells. It is believed that <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells are delayed both at the G1/S and G2/M transitions, even in the absence of inhibitor, due to lower catalytic activity. It is true that the G2+M delay of <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells seems larger than that in G1, but caution is required since cells born larger will necessarily spend less time in G1 before reaching the critical cell size for START. Addition of 1-NM-PP1 mostly slows down mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as expected from the higher CDK activity required for mitosis. Interestingly S phase duration remains relatively constant (~30 min) in all strains tested. Data with <italic>GAL-CLN3</italic> (OFF) cells has been corrected, being now larger compared to WT, as expected.</p><p><italic>Introduction, third paragraph: the authors introduce the idea that the substrate phosphorylation status depends on the relative impact of both the kinase and phosphatase and cite a review article by Fisher et al. 2012. However, this concept was introduced in 2011, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2011) 366, 3572-3583, which should be cited.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We corrected this omission.</p><p><italic>Introduction: 'Gwl does more than simply regulating mitosis in mammals (Charrasse et al. in revision)'. Can the authors be more specific here, especially as this paper is not yet published?</italic> </p><p>This paper, now in press (Nature Commun), shows that ENSA depletion in human cells leads to severe S-phase extension through down regulation of Treslin/TICRR (a CDK target essential for the firing of replication origins), indicating that Gwl also plays roles for DNA replication.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Lowering CDK activity reveals a cell cycle function for the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway”, last paragraph: '… cells were much larger… (98.5fL,…)…', as this is the first time that the cell volume measurements are introduced, it might be worth it to explain that median cell volumes are reported. The correct SI abbreviation for femtolitre is 'fl'.</italic> </p><p>We now indicate that median cell volume is used to characterize asynchronous cell population. The internationally recommended abbreviation for liter is now L (not l) and thus femtoliter should be written fL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.convertunits.com/info/femtoliter">http://www.convertunits.com/info/femtoliter</ext-link>)</p><p><italic>Subsection “Lowering CDK activity reveals a cell cycle function for the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway”, last paragraph: 'Deletion of IGO1 and IGO2 further increased the median size…, which means that Rim15-Igo1,2 is involved in cell size homeostasis'. In this and several other cases throughout the manuscript, the authors should be careful with the use of the terms 'size homeostasis' and 'size control'. Deletion of IGO1,2 leads to larger cells that still maintain a constant, albeit larger, size. In this case, it can be concluded that IGO1,2 contribute to cell size control, but not to cell size homeostasis. Only if deletion of IGO1,2 results in a larger spread of the cell size distribution, relative to the mean, one could conclude on a role in size homeostasis.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for bringing up this relevant point. We now provide in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> a profile of cell size distributions for asynchronous populations of <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> and <italic>cdc28-as1 igo1,2∆</italic> cells grown in SC-D (left panel), where it can be seen that the latter strain has a larger mean but also wider spread of size distribution. We use the term “cell size homeostasis” also because we identified feedback mechanisms that buffer excessive cell size fluctuations by inactivating Rim15 (increasing PP2A activity on Whi5) when Cln3 is too high, and conversely. We agree however that “cell size control” and “cell size homeostasis” should be used more cautiously, something we tried to do in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>The data are generally well presented and clear. In some gels the level of loading standards seem to vary substantially from lane to lane, an aspect that could be improved.</italic> </p><p>We agree that protein loading is sometimes variable between lanes, but all quantifications are presented as ratio of protein over loading control or of phospho- and unphosphorylated bands to take into account these variations.</p><p><italic>Subsection “The Rim15 pathway is hyperactive in early G1 cells and repressed by Cln3”, first paragraph: 'No shift was detected in the igo1-S64A mutant, indicating that phosphorylation is due to Rim15.' It is not clear how this experiment shows that phosphorylation is due to Rim15. To conclude this, Igo1 phosphorylation should be compared in a rim15 deletion strain.</italic> </p><p>Targeting of Igo1-S64 by Rim15 and lack of Ser64 phosphorylation in <italic>rim15</italic>∆ cells has been demonstrated by the De Virgilio lab (Talarek et al., 2010; Bontron et al., 2013). The peptide phosphorylated is highly conserved in Igo1 orthologs from other species (Juanes et al., 2013) where direct phosphorylation by Rim15/Gwl has been shown (Chica et al., 2016). This is now clarified in the text.</p><p><italic>Subsection “The Rim15 pathway is hyperactive in early G1 cells and repressed by Cln3”, last paragraph: '…Igo1-S64 phosphorylation… decreased 2-fold within 10 min of Gal re-addition'. This is surprising as the cells were shifted to glucose-containing medium. Galactose induction is usually slow and sluggish once cells have been repressed with glucose. Has the experiment rather been performed by shift from Raff+Gal to Raff, then back to Raff+Gal?</italic> </p><p>No, cells were shifted from Raff+Glu to Raff+Gal, but using filtration and extensive washing with SC-Raff+Gal to remove all glucose from the medium. This allows for fast activation of the GAL promoter.</p><p><italic>Subsection “The Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway promotes START by inhibiting PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup>”, last paragraph: '…expression of CLN2 from the MET3 promoter fully rescued the START delay of cdc28-as1 igo1,2Δ cells, indicating that the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway favours the transcription of CLN1,2 genes.' This conclusion is not the only possible scenario. Increased PP2A activity in igo1,2Δ cells might simply pose a greater requirement for Cln-Cdk activity to overcome PP2A to trigger start. While increased CLN2 expression is one way to override PP2A, this does not necessarily mean that Igo1,2 impacts on CLN1,2 transcription. If the authors want to conclude on CLN1,2 transcription, CLN1,2 transcription should be experimentally assessed.</italic> </p><p>We agree that we have not shown directly that Rim15 activity favors <italic>CLN1,2</italic> transcription, yet the suppression of <italic>cdc28-as1 igo1,2∆</italic>’s larger size at START by <italic>whi5∆ stb1∆</italic> double deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) really suggests this might be the case. We have now toned down this point in the Results section to discuss it later.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Rim15/Gwl disrupts the balance between kinases and phosphatases”, first paragraph: 'Cell lacking Igo1,2 are larger while keeping the same doubling time…', this disagrees with the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, showing that the cell size of Igo1,2 lacking cells (62.3 fl) is very close to wt (61.6 fl).</italic> </p><p>We meant to say that <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells lacking Igo1,2 are larger. This is now clarified in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Stb1 is apparently a cofactor of Whi5, and the authors should clearly explain this relationship. Of greater concern, the authors sometimes seem to say or imply that this protein is also a target of PP2A-Cdc55, but they have never looked at this protein on Western blots. The authors' approach to this cofactor needs to be made less confusing.</italic> </p><p>We have now better explained the relationship between Whi5 and Stb1 in the text. We had performed Phos-tag analysis of Stb1 in <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells lacking or not Igo1,2, which indicates that Stb1 phosphorylation is also delayed in <italic>igo1,2∆</italic> cells (occurring at 73 fL instead of 57 fL).

Because of the presumed very tight association between the inhibitor and phosphatase, this should only be true if the concentration of PP2A-Cdc55 is in excess of the amount of phosphorylated Igo1,2 (see eLife. 2014 Mar 11;3:e01695). Shouldn't one in theory be able to mimic these results in diploid cells simply by comparing wild type with PP2A-Cdc55 heterozygotes? Here is a case where quantitation would clearly help make the authors' case stronger.</italic> </p><p>According to Ghaemmaghami et al. (2003) and the yeast database (SGD), there is ~2x more Cdc55 than Igo1,2 proteins, which would allow a two-fold change in Igo phosphorylation to have consequences. Monitoring START in diploids heterozygous for <italic>CDC55</italic> might be a way to test this. However subcellular localization, which is tightly regulated for Cdc55 and Rim15 should also be taken into account (Rossio et al., 2011; Wanke et al. 2005; Moreno-Torres et al., 2017). Thus, it is possible that nuclear Igo1,2 phosphorylation is reduced more than 2-fold in the nucleus at START.</p><p><italic>In Western blots, Swi6 is apparently a loading control, but then is the normalization across a blot measuring cell number or cell volume or…? For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, why do the signals for Swi6 and Igo increase with time of incubation in NMPP1? This is never explained. How can the authors quantitate the 90 min timepoint on the Phostag gel when there is no good resolution between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Igo1? The bar graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> is misleading because the y-axis does not show the full range; thus a 2-fold difference appears to be more significant than it actually is.</italic> </p><p>Normalization in western blots is done according to total protein amount (10 µg/lane). However, Bradford protein quantification can be inaccurate with the TCA extracts we use, explaining the differences between lanes. This is why our quantifications are always normalized to a loading control (e.g. Swi6, which is constant during the cell cycle), or directly as the% of phospho-Igo1 (phosphorylated/total Igo1). Because the 10 nM 1-NM-PP1 (90 min) point is hard to quantitate we added lanes with 50 nM 1-NM-PP1, where the 90 min time point is quantifiable. The Y-scale starts at 25% because it is more or less the level of background signal seen with the S64A non-phosphorylable mutant. This figure shows that the fraction of phospho-Igo1 increases ≥2-fold quickly following down regulation of Cdc28 activity with low amounts of a specific inhibitor.</p><p><italic>The experiments concerning chromosome loss shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are interesting and suggestive, but the effects of the Rim15/Igo1,2 pathway on chromosome maintenance could be due to other substrates of PP2A-Cdc55 other than Whi5 and these effects could be independent of cell size. Experiments could be conceived to address this point; in any case, the authors rather blithely assume a connection that their experiments do not show.</italic> </p><p>We fully agree. We have no direct evidence that the increased chromosome loss seen in <italic>cdc28-as1 igo1,2∆</italic> cells, or in <italic>igo1,2∆</italic> cells grown on glycerol/lactate, depends on Whi5. The fact that other PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> substrates might be involved is now stated. However, we present new data showing that Rim15 overexpression also increases chromosome loss in <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) while decreasing cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Knowing that size control mainly operates at START through Cln3 and Whi5 in yeast and that <italic>whi5∆</italic> mutants also lose chromosome (data not shown; Pan et al. 2006), it is tantalizing to speculate that deregulation of the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway affects chromosome maintenance through the Whi5/START module. This is now stated as such in the text.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> can be improved: Why is the arrow from SBF to Cln1,2-Cdk black and not green?

Crucially, we show that the Rim15 pathway regulates START in wild type yeast growing by oxidative phosphorylation (respiration), a condition that is highly relevant for the physiology of yeast and higher organisms.</p><p><italic>One of the most interesting facets of this manuscript is the idea that CDKs regulate Rim15 in the opposite fashion that CDKs regulate Gwl in multicellular eukaryotes.

Using Rps6 (ribosomal S6 protein) phosphorylation as a proxy for TORC1 activity, we obtained some evidence for TORC1 activity rising during G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which would be consistent with the concomitant decline in Rim15 activity. Unfortunately, our antibodies against total Rps6 were not good enough to detect Rps6 in early G1 cells, making difficult to correctly quantitate TORC1 activity. Since we cannot ascertain that TORC1 declines at START due to the lower surface-to-volume ratio of cells, we decided to fully remove this speculation from the manuscript, and leave it for future investigations.</p><p><italic>The last paragraph of the subsection “Size homeostasis by negative feedback of Cln3-Cdk1 on Rim15” talks about future experiments involving Rim15 overexpression possibly driving cells into passing START.

These data reinforce the notion that the Rim15-Igo1,2 pathway controls cell size in yeast, with hyper-activation or ablation leading to smaller or larger cell size, respectively.
