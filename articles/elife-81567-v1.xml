The ‘success’, or genome-wide abundance, of TEs differs widely between species. Deciphering the causes for this large variety in TE abundance has remained a central question in evolutionary genomics. We previously proposed that species-specific TE abundance could be driven by the inadvertent consequences of host-direct epigenetic silencing of TEs—the spreading of repressive epigenetic marks from silenced TEs into adjacent sequences. Here, we compared this TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks, or ‘the epigenetic effect of TEs’, in six species in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> subgroup to dissect step-by-step the role of such effect in determining genomic TE abundance. We found that TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks is prevalent and substantially varies across and even within species. While this TE-mediated effect alters the epigenetic states of adjacent genes, we surprisingly discovered that the transcription of neighboring genes could reciprocally impact this spreading. Importantly, our multi-species analysis provides the power and appropriate phylogenetic resolution to connect species-specific host chromatin regulation, TE-mediated epigenetic effects, the strength of natural selection against TEs, and genomic TE abundance unique to individual species. Our findings point toward the importance of host chromatin landscapes in shaping genome evolution through the epigenetic effects of a selfish genetic parasite.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>All the instructions required for life are encoded in the set of DNA present in a cell. It therefore seems natural to think that every bit of this genetic information should serve the organism. And yet most species carry parasitic ‘transposable’ sequences, or transposons, whose only purpose is to multiply and insert themselves at other positions in the genome.</p><p>It is possible for cells to suppress these selfish elements. Chemical marks can be deposited onto the DNA to temporarily ‘silence’ transposons and prevent them from being able to move and replicate. However, this sometimes comes at a cost: the repressive chemical modifications can spread to nearby genes that are essential for the organism and perturb their function.</p><p>Strangely, the prevalence of transposons varies widely across the tree of life. These sequences form the majority of the genome of certain species – in fact, they represent about half of the human genetic information. But their abundance is much lower in other organisms, forming a measly 6% of the genome of puffer fish for instance. Even amongst fruit fly species, the prevalence of transposable elements can range between 2% and 25%. What explains such differences?</p><p>Huang et al. set out to examine this question through the lens of transposon silencing, systematically comparing how this process impacts nearby regions in six species of fruit flies. This revealed variations in the strength of the side effects associated with transposon silencing, resulting in different levels of perturbation on neighbouring genes. A stronger impact was associated with the species having fewer transposons in its genome, suggesting that an evolutionary pressure is at work to keep the abundance of transposons at a low level in these species. Further analyses showed that the genes which determine how silencing marks are distributed may also be responsible for the variations in the impact of transposon silencing. They could therefore be the ones driving differences in the abundance of transposons between species.</p><p>Overall, this work sheds light on the complex mechanisms shaping the evolution of genomes, and it may help to better understand how transposons are linked to processes such as aging and cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transposable element</kwd><kwd>genome evolution</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>population genetics</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00GM121868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Yuh Chwen G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM14292</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Yuh Chwen G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ultimate driver for the substantial between-species difference in the success of transposable elements, the widely distributed genetic parasite, may lie in the overall chromatin environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transposable elements (TEs) are widespread genetic parasites that copy and insert themselves across host genomes. The presence and movement of TEs could impair host genome functions. TEs disrupt genes and functional elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Finnegan, 1992</xref>), introduce ectopic regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chuong et al., 2017</xref>), and trigger highly deleterious chromosomal rearrangements through nonhomologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Langley et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Montgomery et al., 1991</xref>). Nevertheless, the ability to self-replicate has allowed TEs to successfully occupy nearly all eukaryotic genomes surveyed (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Wells and Feschotte, 2020</xref>). Within a eukaryotic genome, TEs are prevalent in both gene-poor, repeat-rich heterochromatic and gene-rich euchromatic regions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kaminker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bergman et al., 2006</xref>). TEs in the heterochromatic genome are oftentimes fragmented, losing their ability to replicate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Hoskins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hoskins et al., 2015</xref>). On the contrary, euchromatic TEs, which could intersperse with functional elements, commonly retain the potential to replicate, making them active players for not only their own evolutionary dynamics, but also the function and evolution of the euchromatic genome. Because of that and the technical challenges associated with identifying TEs in the heterochromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Salzberg and Yorke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Treangen and Salzberg, 2011</xref>), studies have been largely focused on the evolution of TEs in the euchromatic genome. Intriguingly, the abundance of TEs in the euchromatic genome substantially varies across the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Elliott and Gregory, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Wells and Feschotte, 2020</xref>). For instance, in the assembled vertebrate genomes, which mostly consist of euchromatic regions, the proportion occupied by TEs ranges from only 6% in pufferfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Volff et al., 2003</xref>) to more than 65% in salamander (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Nowoshilow et al., 2018</xref>). Even within the same genus, genomic TE abundance differs widely (e.g., 2.5–25% of assembled genome sequences in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Rius et al., 2016</xref>). Deciphering the role of this prevalent parasite in shaping genome evolution has remained a central question in genomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Kazazian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Feschotte and Pritham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arkhipova and Kumar, 2018</xref>); however, the ultimate causes of such dramatic divergence in TE abundance in the euchromatic genome remain unclear.</p><p>Theoretical analyses proposed that, in panmictic host populations with unrestricted recombination, TE abundance is determined by how quickly TEs replicate and how fast they are removed from the populations by natural selection against their harmful fitness effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1983</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Lee and Langley, 2010</xref>). Under this model, divergent genome-wide TE abundance could be driven by between-species differences in the strength of selection against TEs. Currently available evolutionary models that address this possibility have focused on population genetic parameters that influence the <italic>efficacy of selection</italic> removing TEs, such as mating systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Wright and Schoen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Dolgin and Charlesworth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boutin et al., 2012</xref>) and effective population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Lynch and Conery, 2003</xref>). Yet, empirical support for such a hypothesis has been mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Dolgin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Lockton and Gaut, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">de la Chaux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arunkumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Mérel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Oggenfuss et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, between-species differences in the magnitude of harmful effects exerted by TEs, and accordingly the strength of selection against TEs, could also determine genomic TE abundance, a plausible hypothesis that is yet to have empirical investigations.</p><p>A new avenue for exploring how these genetic parasites shape the function and evolution of eukaryotic genomes was opened by the recently discovered host-directed silencing of TEs and the associated ‘inadvertent’ deleterious epigenetic effects (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Choi and Lee, 2020</xref>). To counteract the selfish increase of TEs in host genomes, eukaryotic hosts have evolved small RNA-mediated mechanisms to transcriptionally silence TEs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Czech et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Deniz et al., 2019</xref>). Host protein complexes are guided by small RNAs to TEs with complementary sequences, which is followed by the recruitment of methyltransferases that modify DNA or histone tails at TE sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Qi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aravin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Wang and Elgin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Le Thomas et al., 2013</xref>). Such a process results in the enrichment of DNA methylation or di- and tri-methylation on lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me2/3), both repressive epigenetic modifications that are typically found in heterochromatic regions and associated with repressed gene expression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Pikaard and Mittelsten Scheid, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allis and Jenuwein, 2016</xref>). This repressed transcription of TEs results in reduced RNA intermediates (for RNA-based TEs) and proteins (e.g., transposase and reverse transcriptase) necessary for TE replication, effectively slowing the selfish propagation of TEs.</p><p>While such epigenetic silencing of TEs should benefit their hosts, studies in various model species have found that repressive marks enriched at silenced TEs ‘spread’ beyond TE boundaries, leading to local enrichment of such marks at TE-adjacent sequences across the euchromatic genomes (i.e., <italic>Mus</italic>, <italic>Drosophila, Arabidopsis,</italic> and <italic>Oryza</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Rebollo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Pezic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Lee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Quadrana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Choi and Purugganan, 2018</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Choi and Lee, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, TEs with such effects were observed to have lower population frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Lee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>), suggesting that selection acts to remove them. These discoveries highlight the potential importance of TE-triggered epigenetic effects in shaping genome evolution. Interestingly, the strength of TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks substantially varies between distantly related taxa (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Choi and Lee, 2020</xref>). Investigations on pairs of closely related species further revealed that this ‘epigenetic effect of TE’ differs and is stronger in the species with fewer euchromatic TEs (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> vs. <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> vs. <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Hollister et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>). These observations spurred our previous hypothesis that, across species, different TE-mediated enrichment of repressive marks could result in varying functional consequences and thus differences in the strength of selection against TEs, eventually contributing to divergent TE abundance in the euchromatic genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>). We further postulated that this difference in TE-mediated epigenetic effects could have resulted from species-specific genetic modulation of the repressive chromatin landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>), which was shown to determine the spreading of repressive epigenetic marks from constitutive heterochromatin into adjacent euchromatic sequences (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Girton and Johansen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>).</p><p>To fully examine the hypothesis that varying host chromatin landscape drives between-species differences of TEs through epigenetic mechanisms, one needs to connect species-specific regulation of chromatin landscape, TE-mediated enrichment of repressive marks, the associated functional consequence and resultant selection against TEs, and genomic TE abundance. However, former analyses that compared TE-mediated epigenetic effects between species have limited sampling (two species) and thus lack sufficient statistical power for robust inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Hollister et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>). Also, support for key links of the hypothesis is lacking. For instance, selection against TE-mediated epigenetic effects was expected to result from the associated reducing effects on the expression of neighboring genes. Yet, investigations in multiple taxa reported weak or no associations between the epigenetic effects of TEs and neighboring gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Quadrana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Stuart et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Choi and Purugganan, 2018</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kelleher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Choi and Lee, 2020</xref>). These inconclusive observations cast doubt on the possibility that TE-mediated epigenetic effects impair host fitness by silencing neighboring genes and whether this particular deleterious consequence indeed shapes genome evolution. Furthermore, previous comparisons of population frequencies between TEs with and without epigenetic effects, an approach used to infer the strength of natural selection removing TEs, could not exclude the confounding influence of other harmful effects of TEs on their population frequencies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Lee, 2015</xref>). Accordingly, those analyses could not unequivocally support selection against TE-mediated epigenetic effects. Multi-species studies that span an appropriate evolutionary distance and connect the missing links in the proposed hypothesis would be needed to test the predicted importance of TE-mediated epigenetic effects in determining between-species differences of TEs.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the prevalence of TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks, or ‘TE-mediated epigenetic effects’, in the euchromatic genome of six species in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> subgroup (diverged around 10 MYR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Obbard et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These species are from the two well-studied species complexes (<italic>melanogaster</italic> and <italic>yakuba</italic> complexes), providing good phylogenetic resolution to address the role of TE-mediated epigenetic effects in genome evolution. While TE insertions in all species studied result in robust local enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks, the strength of such effects varies substantially within genomes, among species, and between species complexes. Our larger sample size allowed us to re-examine the still debated question about the impacts of TE-mediated enrichment of repressive marks on neighboring gene expression, which surprisingly revealed their complex interactions. Importantly, our multi-species analysis provides the power to test the predicted associations between TE abundance in the euchromatic genome, TE-mediated epigenetic effects, selection against such effects, and host chromatin environment, while uncovering the evolutionary causes for the wide variety of TE abundance between species.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enrichment of H3K9me2 around euchromatic transposable elements (TEs) across species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic relationship among species included in this study.

Previously, it was shown that TEs lead to a local enrichment of both of these two histone modifications in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> euchromatic genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>), and we chose to focus on one of them (H3K9me2) in this study. We performed spike-in controlled chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq targeting H3K9me2 using 16–18 hr embryos (see Materials and methods). We estimated histone modification density (HMD), which is the ratio of fragment coverage in ChIP samples to that in matching input samples, standardized by the ratio of spike-in fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Lam et al., 2019</xref>) (see Materials and methods). TE insertions in strains used for the ChIP-seq experiment were annotated by running Repeatmodeler2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Flynn et al., 2020</xref>) on genomes assembled using long-read PacBio sequencing. The high continuity of these genomes enables a more comprehensive identification of TEs than previous studies based on short-read sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Khost et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chakraborty et al., 2019</xref>). Because our analysis mainly focuses on the evolutionary dynamics of euchromatic TEs and their role in driving the evolution of the euchromatic genome, we excluded TEs in or near heterochromatic regions from our analysis (see Materials and methods).</p><p>Across all six species analyzed, we observed significant enrichment of H3K9me2 HMD around TEs, and this enrichment decreases to the background level within 10 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To exclude the possibility that this enrichment of H3K9me2 is due to TE preferentially inserted into regions that are already enriched with heterochromatic marks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dimitri and Junakovic, 1999</xref>), we collected H3K9me2 epigenomic data for two genomes of <italic>D. simulans and Drosophila yakuba</italic> and compared the enrichment of H3K9me2 for homologous sequences with and without a TE insertion. The H3K9me2 enrichment is observed in the vicinity of TEs in the genome where they are present, but not at homologous sequences in the other genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This observation expanded previous single-species observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Lee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>) and supported that the local enrichment of heterochromatic marks in the euchromatic regions is induced by TEs in multiple species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Strength of TE-mediated epigenetic effects depends jointly on TE attributes and host genetic background</title><p>In order to investigate biological factors associated with the strength of TE-mediated epigenetic effects, we quantified the ‘magnitude’ and ‘extent’ of local enrichment of H3K9me2 for <italic>individual</italic> TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We estimated the magnitude of TE-mediated epigenetic effects as the H3K9me2 enrichment in the 1 kb window immediately adjacent to a TE insertion. To identify the extent of TE-mediated enrichment of H3K9me2, we scanned from TE to locate the farthest 1 kb window in which H3K9me2 enrichment level is above that of the local background (see Materials and methods for details). For <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. yakuba,</italic> we also estimated the magnitude and extent of TE-induced H3K9me2 enrichment by comparing H3K9me2 enrichment at homologous sequences between strains with and without focal TEs (two-genome estimates; see Materials and methods). Estimates based on one genome or two genomes strongly correlate (<italic>Spearman rank correlation coefficient</italic> ρ=0.64–0.85 [magnitude] and 0.40–0.64 [extent], p<italic>&lt;</italic>10<sup>–10</sup> for all tests, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because an important aspect of our analyses is the comparison of TE-induced H3K9me2 across species, we reported analyses based on single-genome estimates henceforth.</p><p>The assembly of constitutive heterochromatin has been proposed to depend on the concentration of heterochromatic enzymes and structural proteins, which should be the highest at the nucleation site and gradually decrease, leading to the <italic>cis</italic> ‘spreading’ of repressive marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Locke et al., 1988</xref>). Under this model, the magnitude of the enrichment for repressive marks at the nucleation site should determine the extent of the enrichment for repressive marks. Yet, predictions of this model were found to be inconsistent with several empirical observations, including the discontinuous ‘spreading’ of repressive marks from constitutive heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belyaeva and Zhimulev, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Talbert and Henikoff, 2000</xref>) and the dependency of the extent of such effect on factors other than heterochromatin mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Sabl and Henikoff, 1996</xref>). If similar molecular mechanisms are also applicable to epigenetically silenced TE in the euchromatic genome, the magnitude and the extent of TE-mediated local enrichment of H3K9me2 would not perfectly correlate and should capture different aspects of such TE-mediated effects. While we have no a priori predictions for the relative importance of these two indexes in the questions that this study aims to address, we anticipate that the extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment should more likely be influenced by local genomic context than the magnitude of such effect. Nevertheless, we found that the magnitude and extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment strongly correlated within genomes (<italic>Spearman rank correlation coefficient</italic> ρ=0.58–0.75, p<italic>&lt;</italic>10<sup>–16</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>TE length was postulated to be an important factor determining the strength of TE-mediated epigenetic effects because silenced TEs that are longer in length are expected to represent larger heterochromatin mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Lee, 2015</xref>). Consistent with the prediction, we observed significant, though weak, positive correlations between TE length and the strength of TEs’ epigenetic effects within most genomes studied (<italic>Spearman rank correlation coefficient</italic> ρ=0.12–0.22, p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). It is worth noting that previous analysis on non-reference <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains was unable to test this prediction, due to the inability to assemble internal sequences of TEs with short-read resequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>). For the same reason, previous analysis could not study whether the epigenetic effects differed between full-length and truncated TEs that have different potential to be transcribed. This distinction between TE insertions could be important because TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks was mainly observed with transcriptionally active TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Pezic et al., 2014</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Sentmanat and Elgin, 2012</xref>). Consistently, we found that full-length TEs exert significantly larger magnitude and extent of H3K9me2 enrichment than truncated TEs in several genomes (<italic>Mann-Whitney U test,</italic> p&lt;0.05 for <italic>D. melanogaster, Drosophila mauritiana, Drosophila santomea</italic> (magnitude) and for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. santomea</italic> (extent); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We next compared TEs of different classes, which are classifications based on the transposition mechanisms of TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Wicker et al., 2007</xref>) and previously observed to associate with varying strength of epigenetic effects within <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Lee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>). While different classes of TEs showed similar levels of H3K9me2 enrichment, there is a very strong species-complex effect in which TEs in genomes of <italic>yakuba</italic> complex showed much larger <italic>magnitude</italic> of epigenetic effects than those in genomes of <italic>melanogaster</italic> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, an average 1.7-fold larger). On the other hand, the <italic>extent</italic> of H3K9me2 enrichment is more variable and does not show a similar trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, the extent and magnitude of H3K9me2 spreading vary substantially between TEs of different families within a class and between TEs of the same family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for <italic>D. simulans</italic> and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for other <italic>melanogaster</italic> complex species and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for <italic>yakuba</italic> complex species). Moreover, the rank order of the extent and magnitude of TE-induced H3K9me2 enrichment of TE families varies between species and even between strains of the same species. These observations strongly suggest that the strength of TE-mediated epigenetic effects depends on both TE family attributes and host genetic background. It is worth noting that the percentage of TEs with a family assigned is higher in the <italic>melanogaster</italic> complex than that in the <italic>yakuba</italic> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), and our analysis likely missed TE families that are highly divergent in and/or unique to the <italic>yakuba</italic> complex species.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Variation in the epigenetic effects of transposable elements (TEs) within genomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The mean magnitude (left) and extent (right) of TE-induced H3K9me2 enrichment for different types of TEs in eight genomes from six species are shown.

The enrichment of H3K9me2, a repressive histone modification, is generally associated with suppressed gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>). Accordingly, TE-mediated epigenetic effects were expected to lower neighboring gene expression. Yet, previous studies in several model species found limited effects of TE-induced enrichment of repressive marks on adjacent gene expression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kelleher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Choi and Lee, 2020</xref>).

If TE-mediated epigenetic effects could indeed lower gene expression, the associations should be more likely observed with TEs 5’ to genes. Analyzing TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes together could thus potentially obscure the signal. To test this possibility, we first investigated whether TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes have differential impacts on the epigenetic states of genes. We still observed significant positive associations between the magnitude and extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment and genic H3K9me2 enrichment for both TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes (<italic>Spearman rank correlation coefficient </italic>ρ=0.13–0.38 [TEs 5’ to genes] and 0.16–0.43 [TEs 3’ to genes], p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.05 for all tests except for the magnitude of the effect for TEs 5’ to genes, <italic>D. yakuba</italic> strain 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Also, there is no consistent trend on whether the correlation is stronger for TEs 5’ or 3’ to genes across genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The dependency of this association on TE-gene distance also generally holds for both TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes (p-value for interaction term &lt;0.05 for more than half of the genomes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). On the other hand, we still observed nearly absent associations between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and gene expression rank even when analyzing TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes separately, and the few significant associations are all for TEs 5’ to genes (<italic>Spearman rank correlation test,</italic> p<italic>&gt;</italic>0.05 for all tests except for TEs 5’ to genes, <italic>D. yakuba</italic> strain 1 [both magnitude and extent] and <italic>D. yakuba</italic> strain 2 [extent] <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Again, the associations between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and gene expression do not depend on TE-gene distance either for TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes for most of the cases (regression analysis interaction term<italic>,</italic> p<italic>&gt;</italic>0.05 for all genomes and for both TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes, except for the magnitude for TEs 5’ to genes [<italic>D. simulans</italic> strain 1] or for the extent for TE 3’ to genes [<italic>D. mauritiana</italic>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>The above analyses may have limited power because variation in gene expression levels within a genome could be due to intrinsic gene properties, instead of TE-mediated effects. To directly test the effects of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment on nearby gene expression, we compared the expression of homologous alleles with and without adjacent TEs in <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. yakuba,</italic> two species that we have epigenomic and transcriptomic data for two strains. We estimated z-scores, which compare H3K9me2 enrichment and expression rank between homologous alleles (see Materials and methods). A positive z-score indicates that the allele adjacent to TE insertions has higher H3K9me2 enrichment or expression rank (i.e., lower expression) than the homologous allele without a nearby TE. We again observed TEs with stronger epigenetic effects associated with higher z-scores of genic H3K9me2 enrichment, which confirms their impacts on genic epigenetic states (<italic>Mann-Whitney U test,</italic> p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.05 for all comparisons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref> for categorizing genes according to the magnitude and extent of TE-induced H3K9me2 enrichment, respectively). By analyzing TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes, we observed a consistent trend that z-scores for genes near TEs with epigenetic effects are larger, even though the comparisons are only significant for a subset of comparisons, probably due to the reduced sample size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>). On the contrary, there is no association between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and z-scores of gene expression rank (<italic>Mann-Whitney U test,</italic> p<italic>&gt;</italic>0.05 for all comparisons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref> for categorizing genes according to the magnitude and extent of TE-induced H3K9me2 enrichment, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref> for looking at TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes separately). Directly comparing the expression of homologous alleles with and without TEs reached similar conclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">Figure 3—figure supplement 9</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that, across genomes, TE-mediated epigenetic effects lead to robust enrichment of heterochromatic marks at neighboring genes, which, contrary to expectation, does <italic>not</italic> have a predominantly negative impact on the expression of neighboring genes. It is worth noting that our analyses focus on identifying the <italic>genome-wide average</italic> pattern; it is still plausible that the local enrichment of H3K9me2 induced by individual TEs occasionally lowers nearby gene expression (e.g., genes with positive z-scores in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> or genes with TE-mediated regulation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Ninova et al., 2020</xref>). In fact, many early examples of TE-mediated epigenetic effects were discovered by the phenotypic consequences of reduced neighboring gene expression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Choi and Lee, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The extent of local enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks for a handful of TE insertions was previously suggested to be influenced by the expression of neighboring genes in a mouse cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Rebollo et al., 2012</xref>). This observation suggests the possibility that the extent of TEs’ epigenetic effects is, in return, restrained by the expression of neighboring genes. If true, this phenomenon may explain our observed lack of negative associations between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and neighboring gene expression. To investigate this possibility on a genome-wide scale, we compared the H3K9me2 enrichment for a TE on the side that faces a gene with appreciable expression in 16–18 hr embryo (at least 10 RPKM; genic side) and the other side that does not face the gene (intergenic side; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We predict that the transcriptional effects of genes on TE-mediated enrichment of H3K9me2 should be the most prominent on the ‘genic side’ of a TE. Also, the differences between the two sides of a TE should be larger for TEs closer to genes.</p><p>To test these predictions, we estimated the normalized difference between TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment on the intergenic and genic sides by calculating a z-score. A positive z-score would mean that the magnitude or extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment is more restricted on the genic side than on the intergenic side. Consistent with these predictions, there is a general trend that the z-score for the extent of spread is positive for TEs close to highly expressed genes (RPKM &gt;10), although the comparisons are statistically significant only for a subset of the genomes (<italic>Mann-Whitney U test</italic>, p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.001 for <italic>D. simulans</italic> strain 1 and <italic>D. teissieri,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). On the other hand, z-scores for the extent of spread are not significantly different from 0 for TEs far from highly expressed genes (<italic>Mann-Whitney U test,</italic> p<italic>&gt;</italic>0.05 for all genomes<italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and are significantly larger for TEs close to highly expressed genes than for those far from highly expressed genes (<italic>Mann-Whitney U test,</italic> p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.05 for <italic>D. simulans</italic> strain 1, <italic>D. teissieri,</italic> and <italic>D. santomea</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We also found significant negative associations between the z-score of a TE and its distance to the nearest gene (<italic>Spearman rank correlation coefficient </italic>ρ=–0.17 [<italic>D. mauritiana</italic>], –0.13 [<italic>D. simulans</italic> strain 1], –0.11 [<italic>D. teissieri</italic>], and –0.10 [<italic>D. santomea</italic>], p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.01 for all tests), further supporting that the restricted extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment on the genic side depends on TE-gene distance. Curiously, comparisons based on the <italic>magnitude</italic> of TE-induced H3K9me2 enrichment did not find differences between the genic side and the intergenic side, nor between TEs that are close to or far from highly expressed genes (<italic>Mann-Whitney U test</italic> and <italic>Spearman rank correlation test</italic>, p<italic>&gt;</italic>0.05 for all comparisons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s10">Figure 3—figure supplement 10</xref>; also see Discussion).</p><p>If the restricted extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment on the genic side indeed results from the transcription activities of neighboring genes, this effect should mainly be observed with TEs near highly, but not lowly, expressed genes and would be stronger for TEs 5’ to genes (i.e., near promoters) than those 3’ to genes. Consistent with these predictions, z-score for TEs close to lowly expressed genes (RPKM &lt;10) are <italic>not</italic> significantly different from 0, nor do they differ between TEs close to or far from genes (<italic>Mann-Whitney U test,</italic> p<italic>&gt;</italic>0.05 for both comparisons in all genomes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s11">Figure 3—figure supplement 11</xref>). Interestingly, TEs 5’ to highly expressed genes are more likely to have z-scores significantly larger than 0 (for four out of eight genomes) than those of TEs 3’ to genes (for one out of eight genomes), suggesting a more restricted extent of H3K9me2 enrichment on the genic side for TEs near promoters (<italic>Mann-Whitney U test,</italic> p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.05 for <italic>D. simulans</italic> strain 1, <italic>D. teissieri, D. santomea,</italic> and <italic>D. yakuba</italic> strain 2 [TEs 5’ to genes] and for <italic>D. teissieri</italic> [TEs 3’ to genes], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s12">Figure 3—figure supplement 12</xref>). Similarly, the negative associations between the z-score of a TE and its distance to the nearest gene are significant for TEs 5’ to genes in four genomes (<italic>Spearman rank correlation coefficient </italic>ρ=–0.24 [<italic>D. mauritiana</italic>], –0.18 [<italic>D. simulans</italic> strain 1], –0.11 [<italic>D. teissieri</italic>], and –0.17 [<italic>D. santomea</italic>], p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.05 for all tests) but not for those 3’ to genes (<italic>Spearman rank correlation tests,</italic> p<italic>&gt;</italic>0.05 for all tests). Such observation is consistent with the idea that the distance-dependent effect of gene transcription on the extent of TE-mediated epigenetic effects only holds for TEs near promoters. Overall, our findings reveal a complex relationship between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and neighboring gene expression, and strongly suggest that the extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment is influenced by the expression of adjacent genes, especially on the side of a TE that faces the promoter of a nearby, highly expressed gene.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TEs with epigenetic effects are selected against across species</title><p>TEs exerting epigenetic effects were previously suggested to experience stronger purifying selection than other TEs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Choi and Lee, 2020</xref>). If TE-mediated epigenetic effects indeed impair host fitness and are thus selected against, such effects could play important roles in shaping the evolution of both TEs and their host genomes. Yet, previous analyses testing the presence of selection against TEs with epigenetic effects were restricted to few model species. More importantly, the confounding effects of other deleterious mechanisms of TEs (e.g., ectopic recombination; see below) on TE population frequencies could not be ruled out in those studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Lee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the fitness impacts of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment, we estimated the frequencies of TEs that are included in our analysis in four species, using previously published populations of genomes (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Lack et al., 2015</xref>]<italic>, D. simulans and D. yakuba</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Rogers et al., 2014</xref>]<italic>,</italic> and <italic>D. mauritiana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Garrigan et al., 2014</xref>]).

TE length was previously observed to negatively correlate with population frequencies of TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Petrov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Petrov et al., 2011</xref>), either because of the larger potential of long TEs in disrupting functional elements or their higher propensity to be involved in deleterious ectopic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Petrov et al., 2003</xref>). Because the strength of TE-mediated epigenetic effects also positively correlated with TE length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), our observed negative associations between TE frequencies and epigenetic effects could instead result from other harmful effects of TEs. To investigate this possibility, we performed logistic regression analysis to test the effects of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment on population frequencies while accounting for the influence of TE length (population frequency ~ length + TE epigenetic effects). Because of the co-linearity between predictor variables in the regression model (TE length and epigenetic effects, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), this analysis is expected to have restricted statistical power.

Accordingly, we studied the associations between TE-induced H3K9me2 enrichment and TE population frequencies among <italic>copies of the same TE family within species</italic>, aiming to exclude the potential confounding effects of family identity on TE population frequencies. We performed logistic regression analysis for individual TE families that have at least 10 insertions while accounting for the effects of TE length (population frequency ~ TE epigenetic effects + length). With collinearity among predictor variables (see above) and the small number of TEs included for each TE family (fewer than 30 copies for 19 out of 23 TE families, with a median of 19 of TEs included in the regression analysis), these analyses are again underpowered. For most of the TE families tested, we observed negative regression coefficients for the magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), which is more than expected by chance (18 out of 23 TE families tested, <italic>binomial test,</italic> p=0.0106).

Overall, our results revealed that, after controlling for the effects of TE length and family identity, we still found negative associations between the strength of TE-mediated epigenetic effects and TE population frequencies. By excluding the potential impacts of confounding factors on TE population frequencies, our observation strongly supports that TE-mediated enrichment of repressive marks is disfavored by natural

To test this prediction, we investigated the associations between euchromatic TE numbers and the average magnitude and extent of TE-induced local enrichment of H3K9me2. Because the assignment of TEs into families is biased against TEs in <italic>yakuba</italic> complex species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), all TEs, irrespective of whether we could assign their family identity, were included in this between-species analysis (see Materials and methods).</p><p>We found that TEs in species of the <italic>yakuba</italic> complex show a much larger magnitude of H3K9me2 enrichment than those in species of the <italic>melanogaster</italic> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>Mann-Whitney U test,</italic> p=0.029). After controlling for the strong impacts of species complex, we found significant negative associations between the number of euchromatic TEs and the average magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment across genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, TE abundance ~ species complex + epigenetic effects; regression coefficient for the magnitude of H3K9me2 enrichment: –1603.5; ANOVA F-value: 9.05, df = 1, p<italic>=</italic>0.030). Exclusion of <italic>D. simulans</italic> strain 2, a sample that shows lower H3K9me2 enrichment consistency between replicates (see Materials and methods) gave consistent results (regression coefficient: –1602; ANOVA F-value: 5.26, df = 1, p<italic>=</italic>0.080). On the other hand, the extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 spreading does not differ between species complexes (<italic>Mann-Whitney U test,</italic> p=0.89) nor associate with the number of euchromatic TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, regression coefficient for the extent of H3K9me2 enrichment [kb]: 925; ANOVA F-value: 0.03, df = 1, p=0.87; excluding <italic>D. simulans</italic> strain 2 – regression coefficient: 1028, F-value: 0.13, df = 1, p<italic>=</italic>0.78; see Discussion). This finding echoes our observations of the nearly absent associations between the extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment and TE population frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It is worth noting that the associations between the magnitude, but not the extent, of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment and genomic TE abundance was also documented in a much smaller study previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>). To account for the phylogenetic non-independence among species, we used phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Grafen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Martins and Hansen, 1997</xref>) to repeat the regression analysis and found consistent results (regression coefficient for the magnitude of H3K9me2 enrichment: –1948; ANOVA F: 7.49, df = 1, p<italic>=</italic>0.034; regression coefficient for the extent of H3K9me2 enrichment [kb]: 599; ANOVA F: 0.14, df = 1, p=0.72). Overall, the negative associations between the magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment and abundance of euchromatic TEs within species complex support our prediction that varying strength of TE-mediated epigenetic effects could drive between-species differences in genomic TE abundance on a short evolutionary time scale.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Transposable element (TE)-mediated epigenetic effects associate with genomic TE abundance and repressive chromatin landscape.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The associations between the mean magnitude (left)/extent (right) of TE-mediated enrichment of H3K9me2 and the number of estimated euchromatic TEs across species.

Consistent with this possibility, we observed that the strength of TE-mediated epigenetic effects strongly depends on the host genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The similarities between TE-mediated enrichment of repressive marks and the well-studied ‘position effect variegation’' (PEV, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Gowen and Gay, 1934</xref>) suggest a feasible path to narrow down the causes for variation in the epigenetic effects of TEs. Repressive epigenetic marks at constitutive heterochromatin are long known to spread to juxtaposed euchromatic genes, a phenomenon known as PEV (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>). Several genetic factors have been identified to modulate the strength and extent of PEV (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Girton and Johansen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>).

Also, it would be important to demonstrate that <italic>Su(var)s</italic> that regulate the spreading of heterochromatic marks from constitutive heterochromatin play a similar role in the epigenetic effects of TEs in the euchromatic genome. This is because, though both enriched with H3K9me2/3, heterochromatin is comprised of large blocks of repetitive sequences enriched for repressive epigenetic marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Riddle et al., 2011</xref>), whereas euchromatic TEs, though epigenetically silenced, are relatively short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Lee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>) and usually surrounded by sequences enriched for active epigenetic marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Kharchenko et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To test our hypothesis that species-specific differences in genetic factors contribute to varying epigenetic effects of TEs, we investigated whether there are positive associations between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and the dosage of <italic>Su(var)</italic> genes, which promotes the spreading of repressive marks from constitutive heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Girton and Johansen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Swenson et al., 2016</xref>). We used the expression of <italic>Su(var)</italic> genes in 16–18 hr embryos, a developmental stage matching our epigenomic data, as a proxy for the dosage of Su(var) protein products. Because we only found that the magnitude, but not the extent, of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment negatively associates with TE copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), our following analysis focused on the magnitude of TEs’ epigenetic effects, with the aim of identifying the ultimate cause for varying genomic TE abundance. We estimated the <italic>Spearman rank</italic> correlation coefficients <italic>(</italic>ρ) between the expression rank of a gene (rank from the highest expressed genes) and the average magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment across genomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> for an example, also see Materials and methods). A negative correlation indicates that a <italic>Su(var)</italic> gene has higher expression (and thus lower expression rank) in a genome with stronger epigenetic effects of TEs.

Upon further examination, we found that the expression of <italic>Ago2</italic> significantly differs between species in the two species complexes, which drives the positive correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Accordingly, we performed regression analyses that associate the magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment and gene expression rank while accounting for the effects of species complex (magnitude of TE-mediated epigenetic effects ~ gene expression + species complex). Similar to the analysis based on ρ (see above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), the regression coefficients are significantly smaller for <italic>Su(var)s</italic> than those for other genes (<italic>Mann-Whitney U test,</italic> p<italic>=</italic>0.063; <italic>Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,</italic> p<italic>=</italic>0.032; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), further corroborating our findings.

Consistent with the prediction that repressive chromatin landscape weakens with increased abundance of heterochromatic repeats, we found that the magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment is negatively associated with the abundance of H3K9me2-enriched repeats between species, though the comparison is not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <italic>Spearman rank correlation coefficient</italic> ρ<italic>=</italic>–0.595<italic>,</italic> p<italic>=</italic>0.13).

Yet, their ‘success’, or genomic abundance, drastically varies across the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Elliott and Gregory, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Wells and Feschotte, 2020</xref>) and between closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Rius et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Legrand et al., 2019</xref>), raising important questions regarding the evolutionary causes and functional consequences of varying genomic TE abundance. It is worth noting that most studies about the evolution of TE abundance, including ours, mainly concern insertions in the euchromatic genome. Although TEs are highly abundant in the heterochromatic genome, these TEs are typically fragmented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Hoskins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hoskins et al., 2015</xref>) and would no longer be part of the ‘life cycle’ of TEs. The role of euchromatic TEs in determining the abundance and evolutionary dynamics of TEs in the heterochromatic genome is still a largely unaddressed question, mainly due to the challenges associated with assembling TEs in repeat-rich heterochromatic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Salzberg and Yorke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Treangen and Salzberg, 2011</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Khost et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chang and Larracuente, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the large variation in euchromatic TE abundance. Phylogenetic signals may explain some of the differences between distantly related taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Wells and Feschotte, 2020</xref>) and, sometimes, between species within a taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Szitenberg et al., 2016</xref>). Variation in TE activities was also postulated to contribute to the wide variability of TE abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Wong et al., 2019</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ho et al., 2021</xref>). Still another plausible cause is systematic differences in the strength of natural selection removing TEs between species. Investigations of this hypothesis have been largely focused on population genetic parameters that influence the efficacy of natural selection, such as mating systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Wright and Schoen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Dolgin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boutin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arunkumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agren et al., 2014</xref>) and effective population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Lynch and Conery, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Mérel et al., 2021</xref>). Here, our multi-species study tested step-by-step yet another evolutionary mechanism by which the strength of selection removing TEs could differ—through differences in the epigenetic effects of TEs that are driven by species-specific host chromatin landscape.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the prevalence, variability, and evolutionary importance of ‘the epigenetic effects of TEs’—TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks—in the euchromatic genomes of six <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. These species come from two important and well-studied complexes within the <italic>melanogaster</italic> species subgroup (<italic>melanogaster</italic> and <italic>yakuba</italic> complexes), providing good phylogenetic resolution to decipher the evolutionary role of epigenetic mechanisms in shaping species-specific TE abundance. We observed that TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks is prevalent in all species studied and widely varies both within and between genomes. Interestingly, in addition to the intrinsic biological properties of TEs, our analyses revealed that host genetic background plays a critical role in determining the strength of TE-mediated epigenetic effects. These TE-mediated enrichments of repressive marks alter the epigenetic states of neighboring euchromatic sequences, including actively transcribing genes. Importantly, TEs exerting such epigenetic effects are selected against across multiple species, and the strength of this TE-mediated epigenetic effect negatively correlates with genomic TE abundance within species complex. Our findings extend previous studies based on few species and provide one of the first support for the importance of the inadvertent harmful effects of TE epigenetic silencing in shaping divergent genomic TE landscapes.</p><p>Curiously, we only found a negative association between genomic TE abundance and the <italic>magnitude</italic> of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment across species, but not the <italic>extent</italic> of the spreading, even though these two indexes of a TE significantly correlate within genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, the evidence for selection against TE-mediated epigenetic effects is stronger for the magnitude of TE-induced H3K9me2 enrichment than for the extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Previous empirical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belyaeva and Zhimulev, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Talbert and Henikoff, 2000</xref>) and theoretical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Erdel and Greene, 2016</xref>) studies have suggested that the spreading of repressive heterochromatic marks is a nonlinear process. Accordingly, the extent of the spreading of repressive marks from TEs could be sensitive to the genomic context and subject to substantial stochasticity. This echoes our observations that the transcription of genes influences the extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 spreading, but not the magnitude of H3K9me2 enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s10">Figure 3—figure supplement 10</xref>; also see below). The magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment, which is estimated in windows right next to TE boundary, may thus be a more direct measurement of the strength of TE-mediated epigenetic effects and more indicative of the associated harmful impacts.</p><p>One of our most surprising findings is perhaps the limited evidence in supporting that TE-mediated epigenetic effects reduce neighboring gene expression on a genome-wide scale. While TE-mediated epigenetic effects increase the enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks at adjacent genes, we found limited associations between such effects and gene expression within genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Comparing the expression of homologous alleles with and without TEs showing epigenetic effects also reached the same conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These observations echo previously reported lack of genome-wide associations between TE-induced enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks and the expression of neighboring genes in several model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Quadrana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Stuart et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Choi and Purugganan, 2018</xref>) and are consistent with the wider observation that TEs upstream or downstream to genes are <italic>not</italic> predominantly associated with reduced gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Goubert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Ullastres et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Rech et al., 2022</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kelleher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Choi and Lee, 2020</xref>). The limited impacts of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment on gene expression could have resulted from the complex relationship between repressive epigenetic modification and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">de Wit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Yasuhara and Wakimoto, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Riddle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Meng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caizzi et al., 2016</xref>), the varying sensitivity of genes to the enrichment of repressive marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Rudolph et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Vogel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Riddle et al., 2011</xref>), and the presence of other types of variants that also modulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Stranger et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, our findings suggested another possibility—the transcription of genes, in return, influences TE-mediated epigenetic effects across genomes. Specifically, we found a more restricted spreading of repressive marks from TEs on the side facing a gene than on the intergenic side, and this difference is mainly observed for TEs near the promoters of highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s12">Figure 3—figure supplement 12</xref>). It is worth noting that this difference in the extent of H3K9me2 spreading between the two sides of a TE is unlikely driven by the presence of insulator sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gaszner and Felsenfeld, 2006</xref>) because of the limited associations between the presence of insulator sequences and the reduction in TE-mediated H3K9me2 spreading on the genic side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s13">Figure 3—figure supplement 13</xref>). On the other hand, active histone modifications enriched at transcriptionally active genes could antagonize the assembly of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allshire and Madhani, 2018</xref>), potentially restraining the spreading of repressive marks from silenced TEs. Consistently, in mice, active histone modification was reported to spread from an actively transcribing candidate gene into an adjacent TE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Rebollo et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, active gene transcription at <italic>Drosophila miranda</italic> neo-Y chromosome was found to impede the formation of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). Future analysis of the distributions of active histone modifications may help reveal the mechanistic cause for our observed genome-wide dependencies of the extent of TE-mediated epigenetic effects on the transcriptional activities of adjacent euchromatic genes.</p><p>If not due to reducing the expression of adjacent genes, what functional consequences of TE-mediated epigenetic effects could have impaired host fitness and led to the observed selection against these TEs? Euchromatic TEs enriched with repressive epigenetic marks were reported to spatially interact with constitutive heterochromatin through phase separation mechanisms, a process observed to alter 3D structures of genomes and inferred to lower host fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, the epigenetic effects of TEs could shift the usual DNA repair process in the gene-rich euchromatic genome, perturbing the maintenance of local genome integrity. This is because double-stranded breaks happening in constitutive heterochromatin are repaired through a distinct cellular process from those in the euchromatic genome, owing to the enrichment of repressive epigenetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chiolo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Janssen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Janssen et al., 2019</xref>). Still, the variance of gene expression was shown to be shaped by natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Duveau et al., 2018</xref>). Given the variegating properties of the spreading of repressive marks (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>), TE-mediated epigenetic effects could have shifted the variance, instead of the mean, of neighboring gene expression, impacting host fitness.</p><p>Building upon our findings of the prevalence and variability of TE-mediated epigenetic effects and selection against such effects, our multi-species analysis provides strong support for the previously proposed role of TE-mediated epigenetic effects in determining genomic TE abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This interpretation is based on the assumption that TE copy number is at equilibrium and transposition rates of TEs are similar across species, leaving the strength of selection removing TEs being the major determinant of genomic TE abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1983</xref>). By combining transcriptomic analysis and <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics experiment, we further revealed that between-species differences in TE-mediated epigenetic effects could be driven by species-specific expression levels of host genetic factors that modulate heterochromatin. These findings connect the evolution of host genome (genomic TE abundance) with chromatin landscape through the inadvertent harmful effects of the epigenetic silencing of TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Curiously, the negative association between TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment and genomic TE abundance was only observed <italic>within species complex</italic>, pointing that the importance TE-mediated epigenetic effects in determining genomic TE abundance may be on a short evolutionary time scale. Specifically, even though we found stronger epigenetic effects of TEs in species of the <italic>yakuba</italic> complex than those in the <italic>melanogaster</italic> complex, TEs are more abundant in the former. This accumulation of TEs in the genomes of <italic>yakuba</italic> complex is in line with previously observed greater net gains of intron sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Presgraves, 2006</xref>) and duplicated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Hahn et al., 2007</xref>) in <italic>D. yakuba</italic> than those in the lineage leading to <italic>melanogaster</italic> complex, which could suggest a higher tolerance of <italic>D. yakuba</italic> genome with gained sequences. Such lineage-specific mechanism that shapes the gain and loss of sequences over the entire genome may also play an important role in determining genomic TE abundance and potentially override the influence of selection against varying TE-mediated epigenetic effects on a longer evolutionary time scale.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed role of the chromatin landscape in determining genomic transposable element (TE) abundance.</title><p>Our observations suggest that higher expression of <italic>Su(var)s,</italic> which promote a repressive chromatin environment, would result in stronger TE-mediated epigenetic effects (e.g., species on the left). With mechanisms that are yet to be revealed (see Discussion), the stronger epigenetic effects of TEs would reduce individual fitness, resulting in stronger selection against TEs and thus their lower population frequencies. Under the assumptions that the rate of TE increase through transposition is similar across species and the changes in TE copy number is at equilibrium, genomic TE abundance is determined by the strength of selection against TEs. Accordingly, the stronger epigenetic effects of TEs and the associated stronger selection removing them could drive an overall lower genomic TE abundance (e.g., species on the left). Observations made in this study are denoted with *.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81567-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>It is worth noting that teasing apart the causality of the observed associations between the epigenetic effects and genomic abundance of TEs is challenging. A reduction in effective population size and accordingly weakened effectiveness of natural selection at removing TEs could drive the accumulation of TEs in some of the species (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Mérel et al., 2021</xref>). Under this scenario, selection may favor epigenetic regulation that limits excessive inadvertent spreading of repressive marks from euchromatic TEs, which could also result in our observed weaker TE-mediated epigenetic effects in species with abundant TEs. Moreover, even if the difference in genomic TE abundance is indeed the ‘consequence’, varying efficacy of selection in purging deleterious TE insertions could also contribute to the observed between-species difference in TE abundance. Specifically, within species complex, estimated nucleotide polymorphism, an indicator for effective population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Charlesworth, 2009</xref>), largely follows a similar rank order to our observed magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment (nucleotide polymorphism, <italic>melanogaster</italic> complex: <italic>D. simulans &gt; D. mauritiana &gt; D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Langley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Meiklejohn et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>yakuba</italic> complex: <italic>D. tessieri &gt; D. yakuba &gt; D. santomea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bachtrog et al., 2006</xref>); the only difference in the rank order being the epigenetic effect of TEs is stronger in <italic>D. mauritiana</italic> than in <italic>D. simulans,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). More effective selection at removing TEs in species with larger effective population size (but also stronger epigenetic effects of TEs) is another plausible driver for varying TE abundance that our analysis could not rule out.</p><p>Our study focuses on late-stage embryos and would capture the averaged epigenetic effects of TEs across heterogeneous cell types at this developmental stage. If TE-mediated epigenetic effects vary minimally across tissues or cell types, our estimate serves as a good proxy to study the associated fitness consequence. Yet, if TE-mediated enrichment of repressive marks substantially varies between tissues and cell types that have different importance in shaping individual functions, our estimate could fail to capture the most relevant variation in TE-mediated epigenetic effects that determine individual fitness. Even though we did find evidence supporting selection against TE-mediated enrichment of repressive marks that was estimated from whole embryos, future investigation on the variability of such effects across tissues and cell types will be important for the finer dissection of the role of TE-mediated epigenetic effects in individual fitness and, thus, genomic TE abundance.</p><p>Proper maintenance of heterochromatin ensures genome function and integrity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Janssen et al., 2018</xref>).

The abundance and composition of heterochromatic repeats also rapidly turnover between genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Larracuente, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Wei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). While variation in these genetic factors was postulated to contribute to the evolution of heterochromatin functions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ferree and Barbash, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Helleu and Levine, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Mills et al., 2019</xref>), our discoveries further extend their evolutionary impacts from the gene-poor genomic dark matter into the gene-rich euchromatin. Heterochromatin modulators may not only determine the local epigenetic impacts of euchromatic TEs on flanking sequences, but also shape TE abundance and, accordingly, the structure and function of the euchromatic genomes. The evolution of euchromatin and heterochromatin, two genomic compartments usually presumed to function independently, may be more interconnected than previously thought by the inadvertent deleterious epigenetic effects of a widespread genetic parasite.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains used in this study include <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ORw1118 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>D. simulans</italic> w501 (Drosophila Species Stock Center, strain 1) and Mod6 (strain 2)<italic>, D. mauritiana</italic> w12<italic>, D. yakuba</italic> NY73PB (strain 1) and Tai 18E2 (strain 2), <italic>D. santomea</italic> AG01482<italic>,</italic> and <italic>D. teissieri</italic> GT53W gen14.

We ran Repeatmodeler2 with options ‘-engine ncbi -LTRStruct’ and selected the output repeats with class as LTR, LINE, DNA, or unknown as potential TE sequences. We required a TE to be at least 500 bp to be included in our analyses.</p><p>To assign family identity to identified TEs, we used an iterated blast approach. We first blasted the TE sequences (using blastn; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Camacho et al., 2009</xref>) to TEs annotated in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> reference genome (version 6.32) and ‘canonical’ TE sequences of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (retrieved from Flybase September 2019) with following parameters: -evalue 1e-5; -perc_identity 80 for the <italic>melanogaster</italic> complex and -perc_identity 60 for the <italic>yakuba</italic> complex. When an identified TE has blast hits to multiple TE families, we only assigned the TE to a family when at least 80% of the covered query belongs to one and only one family. We then added the annotated TEs to the ‘blast database’ and repeat the process three more times in order to allow the identification of TEs that are diverged from those in the reference <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome or canonical TEs annotated in various <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. TE insertions that are within 500 bp were merged if they are from the same TE family or excluded from the analysis if they belonged to different families. We excluded DINE-1, which are mostly fixed in the <italic>melanogaster</italic> complex species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2003</xref>) but underwent a recent burst of activities in <italic>D. yakuba</italic> and likely other closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Yang and Barbash, 2008</xref>). We also excluded telomeric TEs (HeT-A, TART, and TAHRE), which predominantly locate at the end of chromosomes that are largely heterochromatic. Because most of the TEs included in our blast database are from <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> it is plausible that our family assignment process is biased against assigning family identity to TEs in the species of the <italic>yakuba</italic> complex. Accordingly, except for analyses that require TE family identity (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, and the estimation of TE population frequencies, see below), we included all TEs that are at least 500 bp in the analysis, irrespective whether we could assign their family identities or not. To identify whether TEs were full-length or truncated, TE sequences were aligned to the annotated <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> canonical sequences for the respective families using MAFFT (v7.505, Katoh and Standley 2013). TEs whose length is at least 70% of the annotated <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> canonical sequences were considered intact while others were deemed truncated.

To determine the euchromatin-heterochromatin boundaries in each genome, we generated H3K9me2 fold-enrichment tracks using MACS v2.7.15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). We then visualized the H3K9me2 enrichment genome-wide using IGV (version 2.10.2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013</xref>) to identify the sharp transition in H3K9me2 enrichment and used positions that are 0.5 Mb ‘inward’ (toward the euchromatin) from the transition as the euchromatin-heterochromatin boundaries. These conservative euchromatin-heterochromatin boundaries are expected to minimize the influence of constitutive heterochromatin in influencing our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ChIP-seq analysis</title><p>In order to align reads originated from the spike-in control (SNAP-ChIP K-MetStat Panel, Epicypher), we combined PacBio genomes with DNA sequence barcode of the SNAP-ChIP K-MetStat Panel, which were serve as the ‘reference genome’ for Illumina sequence alignment. Raw reads were trimmed using <italic>Trimmomatic</italic> v0.35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) before aligning to the reference genome with bwa mem v 0.7.16a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). Read with low mapping quality (q&lt;30) and reads that mapped to multiple locations were removed using Samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Li, 2011</xref>). We used the abundance of reads corresponding to the spike-in H3K9me2 nucleosome to normalize the background level of H3K9me2, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Lam et al., 2019</xref>. Briefly, we calculated the enrichment of spike-in H3K9me2 nucleosome reads as: E<sub>si</sub> = (barcode fragments in ChIP)/(barcode fragments in input). We then used bedtools v2.25.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) to obtain read coverage across the genome for ChIP and input samples. For 25 bp nonoverlapping windows across the genome, we calculated the per-locus enrichment as E<sub>locus</sub> = (fragment coverage in ChIP)/(fragment coverage in input). The HMD for H3K9me2 in a particular 25 bp window was then estimated as E<sub>locus</sub>/E<sub>si</sub>. Windows with fewer than five fragment coverage in input samples were treated as missing data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Estimation of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment</title><p>For each TE, we normalized the local H3K9me2 HMD level in its flanking sequence by the median HMD for regions 20–40 kb upstream and downstream of each TE, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>. The reasons behind this approach come from the observations that TE-mediated spreading of repressive epigenetic marks is usually within 10 kb in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Lee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>). We then divided the 20 kb upstream and downstream from a TE into 1 kb nonoverlapping windows and, for each window, calculated the median of normalized H3K9me2 HMD among its 40 25bp-HMD units (see above, m-HMD); at least 10 HMD estimates are required to calculate m-HMD for a 1 kb window. To estimate the magnitude of TE-mediated local enrichment of H3K9me2, we calculated the m-HMD for the 1 kb left and right flanking regions separately and took the average of the two sides. To estimate the extent of H3K9me2 spreading, we examined whether m-HMD is above one, which indicates that the H3K9me2 HMD level for the window is higher than that of the local background. We scanned across windows, starting from those right next to TEs and identified the farthest window in which the m-HMD was consecutively above one. We then used the average for the two sides as the extent of H3K9me2 spreading. The estimates for HMD magnitude or extent from two replicates positively correlate (<italic>Spearman rank correlation coefficient</italic> ρ=0.19–0.84, p<italic>&lt;</italic>10<sup>–8</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Curiously, the strength of correlation for the estimated magnitude or extent of TE-mediated epigenetic effects among replicates is low for some samples (e.g., magnitude of the effect for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>). We performed IDR (irreproducible rate) analysis between replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Li et al., 2011</xref>) and found limited associations between IDR and the strength of between-replicate correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). For instance, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> shows the lowest correlation for the magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment between replicates, but has decent consistency between replicates by IDR analysis. A plausible cause for this discrepancy is that TE-mediated enrichment of repressive marks does not have the typical characteristic of ‘enrichment peaks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Karpen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Lee et al., 2020</xref>) and thus could be oftentimes missed by custom pipelines that were designed to identify ‘sharp peaks’ (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Park, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Nakato and Shirahige, 2017</xref>). For instance, only 12% of TEs showing local enrichment of H3K9me2 was detected by peak calling in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, IDR analysis estimates the reproducibility of called peaks between replicates and might not include the majorities of regions with TE-mediated enrichment of repressive marks. More importantly, the spreading of repressive marks from constitutive heterochromatin is a variegated phenotype and was observed to vary between cells and individuals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>), which could explain the variability between replicates. While the rank order of significance for called peaks are mostly consistent between replicates and falls along the diagonal line for significant called peaks for most samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), we noticed that this trend in <italic>D. simulans</italic> strain 2 is weak. We thus tried excluding this sample in analysis that tested the associations between genomic TE abundance and TE-mediated epigenetic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and reached similar conclusion (see text).</p><p>To proceed with following analysis, we averaged the estimates from two replicates to generate the magnitude and extent of H3K9me2 enrichment. It is worth noting that the estimated extent of H3K9me2 spreading with different thresholds of m-HMD strongly correlate (<italic>Spearman rank correlation coefficient</italic> ρ=0.69–0.87, p<italic>&lt;</italic>10<sup>–16</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>), suggesting the robustness of such estimate. In the analysis, a TE was considered showing ‘epigenetic effects’ when the magnitude of H3K9me2 enrichment is above one or has at least 1 kb spreading of H3K9me2 (see text). Because the magnitude and extent of H3K9me2 enrichment do not follow normal distribution even after log transformation (Anderson-Darling normality test, for all test p&lt;2.2e<sup>–16</sup>), we chose to perform nonparametric <italic>Spearman rank correlation tests</italic> when investigating the associations between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and factors of interests. The nonparametric <italic>Spearman rank correlation tests</italic> are also less sensitive to the effects of outliers, which is critical for our goal of identifying genome-wide patterns.</p><p>For two species (<italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. yakuba</italic>), we also investigated the epigenetic effects of TEs by comparing the enrichment of H3K9me2 at homologous sequences with and without TE insertions and contrast that to single species-based method (see above). We first used minimap v2.17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Li, 2018</xref>) to generate assembly-to-assembly alignments of the PacBio genomes and identify homologous sequences for the two strains of a species (paftools.js from minimap). We ran MACS v2.7.15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) to identify shared peaks of H3K9me2 enrichment using liberal significant threshold (with broad-cutoff p=0.5). TEs in these shared peaks were then excluded from the analysis because we could not determine if the enrichment of H3K9me2 for these regions were induced by TEs. We also excluded focal TEs whose homologous sequences were within 1 kb of another TE in the alternative strain. The magnitude of H3K9me2 enrichment was estimated as the m-HMD of the focal TE in the focal strain standardized by the m-HMD in the 1 kb TE-flanking regions in the homologous sequence in the alternative strain. The extent of H3K9me2 spreading was measured as the distance for the farthest windows from TEs that the m-HMD was consecutively higher in focal strain than that in the alternative strain. The estimates based on one or two genomes significantly correlate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; see text).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Inference of genic H3K9me2 enrichment</title><p>Reference genome sequences and annotations for <italic>D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. mauritiana,</italic> and <italic>D. yakuba</italic> were downloaded from NCBI Datasets (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, version Release 6 plus ISO1 MT; <italic>D. simulans</italic>, version ASM75419v2; <italic>D. mauritiana</italic>, version ASM438214v1; <italic>D. yakuba</italic>, version dyak_caf1).

When comparing the H3K9me2 enrichment level of homologous genic alleles with and without adjacent TEs, we calculated z-score as: (mean HMD of allele with nearby TE – mean HMD of allele without nearby TE in the alternative strain)/(standard deviation of both strains).

For most TEs, the differences between the updated and RepeatModeler2 boundaries are short and only 5.2–7.9% of TEs boundaries in each genome were significantly updated (≥20 bp from original boundaries). Code for the TE calling pipeline can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/harsh-shukla/TE_freq_analysis">https://github.com/harsh-shukla/TE_freq_analysis</ext-link>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Huang, 2022</xref> copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:e8a29a082fb85376996ba58ccad333ab02738278;origin=https://github.com/harsh-shukla/TE_freq_analysis;visit=swh:1:snp:81910efac0d8d326402f111c4bd2fecd5c7696b3;anchor=swh:1:rev:24218fab83996f657e489402c5ff1c4cc06bfe9c">swh:1:rev:24218fab83996f657e489402c5ff1c4cc06bfe9c</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantification of the heterochromatic repeats</title><p>To identify the repeat sequences enriched in the heterochromatic regions of the genome, we first used KMC (version 3.1.1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Kokot et al., 2017</xref>) to quantify the 12-mers in our H3K9me2 IP and matching input samples. In order to compare 12-mers abundance between IP and input libraries, we normalized the 12-mers counts by the number of reads mapped uniquely to the PacBio genome with at least 30 mapping quality score. 12-mers that have at least a threefold enrichment in an IP sample when compared to its matching input sample were considered as heterochromatic repeats.</p><p>Because PCR amplification of sequencing libraries were shown to influence the quantification of simple repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Wei et al., 2018</xref>), we sequenced the genomes of focused strains with Illumina PCR-free library preparation. We extracted DNA with 40 females using DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Extracted DNA was then prepared into Illumina sequencing libraries with PCR-free protocol and sequenced with 150pb paired-end reads by Novogene (Sacramento, CA). We then ran KMC3 on these libraries to quantify the abundance of heterochromatic repeats identified above. In order to compare across strains, the number of heterochromatic repeats were further normalized with the total number of reads from either the orthologous region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant crosses and eye pigmentation assay</title><p>To investigate the mutant effects of identified candidate <italic>Su(var)s</italic>, we followed approaches outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Sentmanat and Elgin, 2012</xref>.

that is made up of such elements varies greatly between species, and models suggest that this must reflect the balance between the rate at which they multiply, and the rate at which selection purges them from the genome. Precisely how selection acts against transposable element insertions is not clear. This paper provides evidence that the strength of selection depends on the extent to which epigenetic silencing spreads to nearby genes – although the mechanism is obscure, as gene expression is not affected. This is a very interesting hypothesis that deserves more attention, and the paper is an excellent example of trying to combine population genetics models with a mechanistic understanding of the process modeled.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81567.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Nordborg</surname><given-names>Magnus</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05twjp994</institution-id><institution>Gregor Mendel Institute</institution></institution-wrap><country>Austria</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</ext-link>.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81567.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><bold>1. General Statements</bold></p><p>This study builds upon a previous study published in <italic>eLife</italic> (Lee and Karpen 2017), which established the importance of transposable element (TE)-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks in TE evolution in the model species, <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> In the current study, we investigated this TE-mediated phenomenon in six closely related <italic>Drosophila</italic> species to have a good phylogenetic resolution, aiming to address step-by-step how such TE-mediated effects may shape the evolution of genomic TE content, a long-standing question in evolutionary genomics. Our analyses successfully connect species-specific host chromatin regulation, TE-mediated epigenetic effects, the strength of natural selection against TEs, and genomic TE abundance unique to individual species, while uncovering the evolutionary causes for the wide variety of TE profiles between species.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers for their overall positive response and helpful comments on the previous versions of the manuscript. We appreciate the opportunity to correct our previous oversights, revise analysis to corroborate findings, and improve interpretations of our observations. Thanks for these suggestions, we believe the revised manuscript is much improved and hope it is now acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Please see below for our pointby-point responses to reviewers’ comments.</p><p>In addition to analyses suggested by the reviewers, we also updated one of our analyses to avoid non-independence of samples. Specifically, in Figures 3A and B and Supplementary Figures S1-6, we investigated the associations between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and genic epigenetic states/expression. In our previous analysis, a TE could be associated with more than one gene, if it is the nearest TE to more than one gene. Yet, this could lead to nonindependence of observations. In this revised manuscript, we restricted the analysis to TE and its nearest gene, excluding this potential issue. The results are qualitatively the same and quantitatively similar, and our conclusions from these results remain unchanged.</p><p><bold>2. Point-by-point description of the revisions</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work titled &quot;Species-specific chromatin landscape determines how transposable elements shape genome evolution&quot;, Huang, Shukla and Lee examined the epigenetic effect of euchromatic TE insertions in 6 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (3 in melanogaster species complex and 3 in yakuba species complex). They profiled the H3K9me2 mark and transcriptome from 16-18hr embryos and, using genomics, population genetics and statistical tools, they extended claims made previously in D. mel to 5 more species: (1) H3K9me2 spreads to nearby regions, exerting an epigenetic effect; (2) TEs with epigenetic effects are selected against. More importantly, this work aims to identify rules that explain the differences in TE-mediated epigenetic effects across the 6 species examined and how their distinct chromatin landscape might affect the way in which TE-mediated epigenetic effects shape genome evolution. The analysis seems to be well done, rather rigorous, and considers important counterarguments in several places throughout the manuscript. The figure is clear, and the method is well detailed. I have some comments that should be addressed before publication, involving additional bioinformatic analysis and text edits to either tone down or re-frame the conclusions.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. Exclusive usage of Spearman rank correlation for key conclusions requires further support. I worry that using Spearman rank correlation loses too much of the quantitative information in e.g., gene expression. Have authors ever looked at Pearson's correlation (perhaps upon log-transformed levels when necessary) and does it lead to similar or different results? While this concern holds for all conclusions based on Spearman rank correlation, it is particularly a concern for analysis involving gene expression, especially for the surprising claim that TE-mediated K9 spreading does not affect adjacent gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that, compared to parametric tests (e.g., <italic>Pearson tests</italic>), nonparametric tests have more restricted statistical power. An insignificant <italic>Spearman correlation test</italic> could either be due to true biological reasons or simply a lack of statistical power. Yet, we found that the magnitude and extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment and the genic HMD do not follow normal distribution even after log transformation (Anderson-Darling normality test, all p-value &lt; 10<sup>-16</sup>). Accordingly, we are unable to perform the suggested <italic>Pearson</italic> correlation tests. Another reason why we would like to stick with the <italic>Spearman</italic> tests is because it is less sensitive to outliers than the <italic>Pearson correlation tests.</italic> This is especially important because our goal is to identify genome-wide average patterns.</p><p>It is worth noting that, in addition to <italic>Spearman rank</italic> correlation analysis, we also compared the expression level between homologous alleles with and without TEs showing H3K9me2 spreading in <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. yakuba</italic> (Figure 3C and Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure S7-9) and found consistent results. We included additional discussion to explain why we chose to use nonparametric tests (p50, line 12-18; p51, line 27-31) and emphasize that, in addition to the correlation analysis, other tests also support limited impacts of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment on gene expression (p39, line 13-15).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the observation of the limited associations between TE-mediated H3K9me2 spreading and gene expression is surprising. We hope our addressing the reviewer’s comment 3 and additional discussions and citations of other relevant/suggestive studies that reached similar conclusions (p39, line 15-22) help address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Choice of binning procedure over correlation analysis seems unjustified. I understand the binary binning in e.g., Figure 1C, but for quantitative variables e.g., distance to TE/gene, allele frequency in Figures3 and 4, I worry that the binning procedure based on somewhat arbitrary cutoffs could mask the real relationship. Are the conclusions robust against the cutoff chosen?</p><p>Is there actual correlation between the two variables examined?</p></disp-quote><p>For previous Figure 3A and 3B (now Figure 3 – Supplementary Figures 1-4), following the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed regression analysis that uses the distance between genes and TEs as continuous variables to test whether the associations between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and genic H3K9me2 enrichment/expression depends on TE-gene distance. Such analysis reached the same conclusion and is now included in p15, line31 – p16, line 4; p16, line 16-19. We chose to present the analyses that bin genes based on their distance to TEs because it is challenging to interpret them as three-dimensional graphs; current Figure 3 – Supplementary Figures 1-4 have TE-mediated epigenetic effects as X-axis, genic attribute as Y-axis, and bins of gene-TE distance as a binary color. It is worth noting that, in this revised version of the manuscript, we chose to present the correlation coefficients between TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment and genic epigenetic states/expression (new Figures 3A and 3B). This is because these figures provide a good visual summary for all the comparisons (magnitude/extent, genic H3K9me2 enrichment/expression, and TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes) and are easier to be interpreted than original Figures 3A and 3B (now Figure 3 – Supplementary Figures 1-4).</p><p>In Figure 3D, we estimated the z-score to compare the extent of TE-mediated spreading of H3K9me2 on the genic and intergenic sides between TEs close and distant from genes (the binning is based on 50% percentile of the distance between TEs and genes). Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed correlation tests between the z-score and TE-gene distance and found consistent results – we identified significant negative associations between the z-score of a TE and its distance from the nearest gene. These results are now presented in p19, line18-23.</p><p>For the population frequencies analysis (Figure 4), we were unclear about how we categorized low-frequency and high-frequency TEs. A TE is “low-frequency” if it is only identified in the focused strain, but not in the population (in other words, a private TE insertion). This information is now included in p23, line 19-21. Surveys on TE population frequencies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> found highly skewed frequency spectra and that the majority of the TEs appear as singletons (i.e., present in only one individual in the population sample); analysis typically categorizes TEs according to whether they are singleton (low-frequency in our analysis) or not (high-frequency in our analysis). Accordingly, we stick with this binning in our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.1. TE position relative to genes seems oversimplified. The manuscript compares TEs that are close to or far from genes, but what happens to TEs in the genes (either in UTRs, CDSs or introns)? Do these different TE positions inside and outside genes exert different effects on K9 magnitude, K9 spreading extent, gene expression and/or allele frequency in the population?</p></disp-quote><p>(We split the reviewer’s comment #3 into two and answered them individually).</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we compared the magnitude and extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment between intergenic, intronic, and exonic TEs. While we don’t find any consistent significant differences for the <italic>magnitude</italic> of TE-mediated epigenetic effects, intergenic TEs exert a larger <italic>extent</italic> of H3K9me2 enrichment than other TEs in multiple genomes. These results are now included in p13, line 4-15 and Figure 2 – Supplementary Figure S4.</p><p>Our goal is to identify how TE-mediated epigenetic effects associate with genic epigenetic status, gene expression, and TE population frequencies. The difference in TE-mediated epigenetic effects between intergenic and genic TEs would have been captured by the estimated magnitude and extent of H3K9me2 enrichment. Accordingly, for the downstream analysis, we did not further distinguish between genic and intergenic TEs with one exception. Because TEs inside genes could influence gene expression through mechanisms other than altering the epigenetic states, a major confounding factor of previous studies (reviewed in (Choi and Lee 2020 PLoS Genetics, Kelleher et al. 2020 Trends in Genetics)), we excluded TEs inside genes when testing the associations between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and gene expression. We further emphasized this point in p15, line 15-18.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.2. Are there any differences to TEs being 5' or 3' to the genes, since TEs 5' to the genes are more likely to affect the promoter? I worry that simple comparison of close vs. far might skew the actual relationships.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing this out. Our additional analysis following the reviewer’s suggestions led to some new observations that further corroborate our conclusions, mainly whether neighboring gene expression could influence the extent of TE-mediated epigenetic effects.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that TE-mediated epigenetic effects on the epigenetic states and expression of genes could differ when TEs are 5’ or 3’ to genes, especially given that TEs 5’ to genes should be more likely to influence the promoter. We performed correlation analyses between TE’s epigenetic effects and genic H3K9me2 enrichment or expression separately for TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes and reached similar conclusions to those of analyzing all TEs together (Figure 3B). Specifically, we found significant associations between TE’s epigenetic effects and genic H3K9me2 enrichment for both TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes, such associations depend on TE-gene distance, and we did not notice any major difference between TEs 5’ and 3’ to genes. On the other hand, we observed limited associations between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and gene expression, except for one incidence. These results are included in p16, line 23-p15, line 16 and Figure 3B.</p><p>We also tested whether the impact of adjacent gene expression on the extent of TE-mediated enrichment of H3K9me2 differs between TEs 5’ or 3’ to genes. We found that the difference in the extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment is greater for TEs 5’ than 3’ to genes, likely due to the effects mentioned by the reviewer and providing stronger support for the hypothesized effects of gene expression on the extent of TE-mediated local H3K9me2 enrichment. We included these results in p20, line 5-10, Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure S12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Transcriptional activity of TEs was not considered. Many TEs are (5'-) truncated and thus transcriptionally inactive. There is literature that suggests K9 installation and spreading only happen on transcriptionally active TEs. Have authors considered separating active/inactive or intact/truncated TEs? Combining TEs with different transcriptional activity (or K9 biology) despite the same length, family or position could confound the analysis and lead to different conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important axis of the analysis that we did not consider. We categorized TEs whose length is shorter than 70% of the annotated, canonical sequence in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> as truncated, and otherwise as full length. Consistent with what is suggested by the reviewer, full-length TEs tend to show a larger magnitude and extent of H3K9me2 enrichment. These results are now included in p11, line 18-26 and Figure 1 – Supplementary Figure S4. Because our following analysis focuses on how TE-mediated epigenetic effects, instead of individual TE attributes, influence genic H3K9me2</p><p>enrichment/expression and selection, we did not further consider full-length/truncated TEs for the downstream analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Usage of 16-18hr whole-embryo averaged transcriptome and H3K9me2 epigenome require justification. The 16-18hr embryo is presumably consisted of a very heterogenous population of cells, how does such a population average reflect bona fide biology? Authors should either justify this or comment explicitly in text on potential problems such datasets could have on major conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that 16-18hr embryos consist of heterogeneous cell types, which are precursors of different tissues and organs of a whole animal. By examining the epigenetic effects of TEs in whole embryos, our analysis would capture the averaged effects across cell types. If the relative importance of tissues/organs in determining individual fitness is proportional to the abundance of their specific cell precursors, our estimate could provide a reasonable estimate of the epigenetic effects of TEs that may be relevant to individual performance and thus fitness. Yet, if the fitness of an individual is predominantly determined by a tissue/organ that originated from a rare cell type and TE-mediated epigenetic effects vary substantially between cell types, our analysis of whole embryos may not be a good indication of the associated fitness consequence. Even though we did find evidence supporting selection against TE-mediated enrichment of repressive marks estimated from whole embryos, future investigation on the variability of such effects across tissues and cell types, which we aim to address in the future, will be important to further dissect the role of TE-mediated epigenetic effects in individual fitness and, thus, genomic TE abundance.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we emphasized that our dataset should be viewed as an average of all cell types and stated the potential caveats in p42, line 22-p43, lin2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Euchromatic TE and genome-wide TE abundance should not be used interchangeably. This work is done solely on euchromatic TEs, but throughout the text, authors comment on how a factor examined might shape genome-wide TE abundance or even genome evolution. I wonder how much euchromatic TE copy number reflects genome-wide TE abundance? I'd expect heterochromatin harbors most TE copies and to be the major place that determines the overall TE abundance. Authors should either discuss how euchromatic TEs do reflect genome-wide TE abundance (and genome evolution) or change all related claims to better describe analysis done on euchromatic TEs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a very important point that we did not specify previously. The genome-wide TE abundance we discussed in the text and also in the field mainly concerns euchromatic TEs. This is because of two major reasons. One is the technical difficulties associated with assembling and annotating TEs in the highly repetitive heterochromatic regions of the genome. The other reason is that, in the few species where heterochromatin has been assembled, most TEs in the heterochromatic regions are fragmented and have lost of transposition ability, making them no longer important players in the evolutionary dynamics of TEs (i.e., TE number increase through transposition and decrease through selection and excision). Following the reviewer's suggestions, we clearly defined that our study focuses on euchromatic TEs in the opening paragraph (p2, line 9-30), in the first paragraph of result (p7, line 21-22), and in the opening paragraph of discussion (p37, line 7-16).</p><p>We also emphasized that our study focused on euchromatic TEs and revised our claim at places throughout the manuscript (e.g., p6, line 8; p29, line 8, p37, line18).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Potential contradiction between key conclusion and the &quot;species complex effect&quot;. In Figures5A and 5C, the species complex effect is obvious and, when we compare the two species complexes, one would conclude the opposite of what the authors attempted to argue. For instance, K9 and TE copy number correlate between mel and yak species complexes. Does this actually mean that there is different biology (or forces) at play at different evolutionary timescales? Authors' major claims seem valid within a shorter period of time (&lt;3 million years) within each of the two species complexes, but they do not appear to hold when one looks at longer timescales. If so, the authors should modify key conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing this out and agree with the reviewer’s interpretation. Indeed, according to our data, the importance of TE-mediated epigenetic effects in shaping genomic TE abundance mainly acts on a short evolutionary time scale.</p><p>Previous studies have found greater net gains of intron sequence and duplicated genes in <italic>D. yakuba</italic> than in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and/or <italic>D. simulans</italic>. These observations suggest that the <italic>D. yakuba</italic> genome may be more tolerant of gained sequence. If similar mechanisms apply to the other two species in the <italic>yakuba</italic> species complex, lineage-specific mechanisms that shape the evolution of the whole-genome may also play a vital role in determining genomic TE abundance, and might potentially override the influence of selection against TE-mediated epigenetic effects. We revised our conclusion (by emphasizing it supports association within species complex, p30, line 8-12 (in Results)) and included these discussions in and p41, line 16-29 (in Discussions).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Biological difference between H3K9me2 magnitude and spreading extent seems unclear. Roughly speaking, the beginning of the manuscript made the two seem similar, the middle part found an effect on the extent only, and the last part found an effect on the magnitude only.</p><p>While I appreciate the authors examining two aspects of H3K9me2 spreading, I am unsure what either aspect truly reflects. I worry that some readers would find the authors cherry-picking either aspect to support their claims – perhaps authors should've commented a priori the difference between the two aspects such that conclusions made on one, but not the other, aspect of TE-mediated epigenetic effects are more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we did not make clear distinctions between the magnitude and extent of H3K9me2 enrichment, which could confuse readers about why we would need both indexes.</p><p>Previous studies on the spreading of repressive marks from constitutive heterochromatin suggested that the magnitude and extent of H3K9me2 enrichment may not be perfectly associated, mainly because the local genomic context could influence the extent of the spread. If similar molecular mechanisms are also applicable to epigenetically silenced TEs in euchromatin, the magnitude and extent should provide different information about TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks. Before conducting this study, we had no a priori expectation for which index would be more relevant to the questions we aim to address. Accordingly, we feel it is most appropriate to present both of them. Especially, in several analyses where the results differ between the two indexes, they provide important information about the underlying mechanisms (see below).</p><p>According to our observations, the major difference between these two indexes is that the magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment is more significantly associated with lower TE population frequencies (i.e., strong evidence supporting being selected against) and is correlated with genomic TE abundance. On the other hand, the impact of neighboring gene expression only influences the extent, but not the magnitude, of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment. In the discussion, we interpreted these two findings together as the result of the extent being more sensitive to the local genomic context (which is similar to previous studies) than the magnitude, making the latter a more direct estimate for the functional and thus fitness impact (which we still don’t know, see p40, line 18-p41, line 2 for discussion) of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment.</p><p>To make better distinctions between these two indexes, we (1) included definitions for what these two indexes are at where they were first mentioned in Results (instead of just in Materials and methods; p10, line 3-9), (2) discussed previous observations to explain why we used both indexes and provided our a priori guess that the extent may be more sensitive to local genomic context (p10, line 19-p11, line 8), (3) moved discussions regarding the difference and relative importance of these two indexes from the end of Discussion to the front of Discussion (p38, line 23-p39, line 7), and (4) emphasize their difference throughout the text when necessary. We hope these changes addressed the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.1. Chromatin landscape was examined by Su(var) gene expression and satellite repeat abundance, which seems insufficient and incomplete. Chromatin landscape is too broad of a term when authors only examined Su(var) gene expression and simple repeat abundance. Have authors look at other heterochromatin genes (e.g., ZAD-ZNF, piRNA pathway) besides Su(var)?</p></disp-quote><p>(We split the reviewer’s comment #9 into two and answered them individually). Most of the piRNA pathway genes are expressed in the female germline and at the early embryonic stage. Accordingly, nearly none of them are expressed in our dataset, which was generated using 16-18hr late-stage embryos. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> ZAD-ZNF proteins have a wide range of functions. For a ZAD-ZNF gene that has a demonstrated role in heterochromatin function (Oddjob, a Su(var)), we included it in our analysis.</p><p>It is worth noting that, instead of looking at the initiation of the epigenetic silencing of TEs, we mainly focus on the inadvertent side effect associated with the silencing – the enrichment of repressive marks at flanking non-TE sequences. This phenomenon is similar to the well-studied Position Effect Variegation (PEV). Accordingly, our analysis focuses on Su(var), whose role in determining the strength of PEV has been well characterized. To explain this point, we included more motivation for looking at Su(var) at p31, line 8-15. We agree with the reviewer and tone down several places that our study mainly concerns repressive chromatin landscape (e.g., p38, line 1) in addition to other existing places.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.2 What is the relationship between simple repeat abundance, TE abundance, and genomewide repeat content? This latter point is related to the point #6 above about euchromatic TE vs. genome-wide TE. I kept wondering, in the context of this work, whether there is biological difference between satDNA and TE – are they similar because they cause similar epigenetic effects or do they differ?</p></disp-quote><p>As described in our response to reviewer’s comment #6, our study mainly concerns the evolutionary dynamics of TEs in the euchromatic genome. We hope changes made while addressing that comment clarify this point.</p><p>We are unaware of studies that report H3K9me2/3 enrichment mediated by satellites in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> euchromatic genomes, except for those extreme cases through experimental manipulation (e.g., a large tandem array of constructs). The replication/expansion mechanisms and potential fitness impacts also differ between TEs and satellite repeats. Accordingly, we would argue the evolutionary dynamics would differ between these two types of repetitive sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>– Figure 2 beautifully shows the epigenetic effect depends on the TE family and other factors. I wonder if the authors would want to expand Figures3-5 to see if any TE family exerts a particularly strong (or weak) epigenetic effect in different species?</p></disp-quote><p>Because there are only a few TE families that have at least five copies included in the analysis for all genomes, our power to perform the suggested analysis is limited. Also, in Figures 3-5, our main goal is to identify the associations between the strength of TE-mediated epigenetic effects and various factors (e.g., gene expression, genomic TE abundance), irrespective of TE identity.</p><p>Due to these two reasons, we did not perform the analysis suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>Nevertheless, we hope the data presented in Figure 2C provides a glimpse into the reviewer’s question. We added some more discussions in the text regarding this p12, line 21-26, pointing to TE families that are of particularly strong/weak epigenetic effects across species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6 cartoon probably should have K9 spread less towards the gene side.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and revised the figure accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The senior author has previously found that euchromatic TE exerts an epigenetic effect via H3K9me2 spreading, which confers a fitness cost. Now, this work builds on the previous finding to attempt a conceptual advance that such a TE-mediated epigenetic effect differs across six species examined and depends on species-specific chromatin landscape. The examination of six species and the connection between molecular biology, population genetics and potentially genome evolution are rare among existing literature and thus present novelty. It should interest people working on TE, heterochromatin, epigenetics and population genetics. My expertise is in chromatin, epigenetics and RNAi. I do not have sufficient expertise to evaluate the regression analysis and TE population frequency estimation done in this work.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary: In this article, Huang and colleagues investigate the degree to which TEs can induce heterochromatin formation within the euchromatin across species. They hypothesize that different TE abundances across species might be explained by variation in the degree to which TEs impact a selective effects. In this article, they show that there does seem to be a big difference in the magnitude of H3K9me2 induction between the mel clade and the yak clade. This is extremely interesting and very worthy of publication. The authors do a great job exploring a variety of alternate hypotheses.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>I have no major comments that may significantly alter the conclusions. I found their approach robust. However, I will admit there is one thing I find difficult to understand regarding their model and conclusion. In the introduction they state:</p><p>&quot;These observations spurred our previous hypothesis that varying epigenetic effects of TEs could result in between-species differences in the strength of selection against TEs, eventually contributing to divergent genomic TE abundance (Lee and Karpen 2017).&quot;</p><p>And in the final figure (figure 6) they provide a schematic of this hypothesis (note typo in the worded &quot;mediated&quot; in the figure). In particular, they show (indicating the * where they state the paper found) that (1) The magnitude of Heterochromatin induction can lead to (2) lower TE population frequencies and this can lead to (3) lower genomic TE abundance. But doesn't 5A show that the yak clade has HIGHER magnitude of heterochromatin induction (as shown earlier) but also higher estimated TE copy number? So, 5A shows the opposite conclusion with respect to genomic copy number. I feel the disconnect might arise from mixing up the notions of low frequency of TE insertions from the notion of genomic copy number. It is possible to have a VERY large number of TEs that are segregating at very low numbers. So, selection against TEs (as evident by low allele frequency) doesn't easily translate to total copy number. I hope this makes sense.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing this out and this is indeed something we should address. Part of the issue raised by the reviewer is hopefully addressed in our response to reviewer #1’s comment #7 (please see above). In short, the strong species complex effect suggests that the role of TE-mediated epigenetic effects in determining genomic TE abundance may be acting on a short evolutionary time scale and could be overridden by other general processes that determine gain/loss of sequences (irrespective of types). This may explain why TEs in yakuba complex species show stronger epigenetic effects but are also more abundant.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that our model (presented in Figure 6) has unstated underlying assumptions. According to the population genetic theory of TE copy number, the equilibrium copy number is determined by the strength of selection removing TEs and TE increase through transposition rate. Our model assumes that the transposition rates are similar, and TE copy numbers are at equilibrium between species. Here, the population frequencies of TEs serve as an indicator for the strength of selection removing TEs. It is possible to have a large number of TEs segregating at low population frequencies, but the average copy number across individuals of a species (i.e., the number of TEs in each genome) would still be small. We hope this interpretation makes sense to the reviewer and are open to suggestions to further revise the model. We included additional discussions regarding the assumptions of our model, which can be found at p41, line 7-10 and in Figure 6 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments: I have some minor comments for clarity.</p><p>1) Since the paper is motivated to explain differences between species in genomic copy number, this information should be provided in the first figure in 1A (alongside the species name, with the two sim and yak samples also both provided numerically)</p></disp-quote><p>We revised Figure 1A according to the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Something should be made of the fact that some of these arguments can be circular and the arrow of causality is hard to tease apart. Genomic TE abundance may be explained by species level differences in the epigenetic impact of TEs. But, it may also be the case that as TE abundance varies, there may be evolution of the epigenetic impact. Causality is tricky here and worth being up front about.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and we included this possibility in Discussion. In this revised manuscript, we rewrote the discussion to further emphasize this point (p42, line 1-8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some clarity in the text (not just in the methods) should be provided for the reader about how the &quot;extent of spreading&quot; was calculated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and added these details in the Results section when this index was first mentioned (p10, line 3-9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In figure S1, what does it mean for points to have zero magnitude of enrichment but a great extent of enrichment? Shouldn't all points for zero magnitude be at the origin? I am looking at the scattered points that run along the Y axis in S1 of just the mel group (not seen in yak group)</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer for pointing this out.</p><p>We identified an error in the coding for generating this plot. In this script, a few “NA”s in the data file were treated as 0 when calculating the average magnitude of the two replicates. This error affected the results of Figure 1- Supplementary Figure S1, Figure 2B and 2C, Figure 2 – Supplementary Figures S1 &amp; S2. We updated these figures and revised the correlation coefficients in Figure 1 – Supplementary Figure S1. After removing these TEs with erroneous estimates, the correlation between the magnitude and extent of TE-mediated epigenetic effects becomes stronger. Other updated results reached the same conclusions as previous results.</p><p>We thoroughly checked our coding, and all the other results throughout the study are unaffected. For other analyses, we used a different script in R, which removes the “NA”s.</p><p>While addressing this comment, we noticed that we forgot to provide details about why a TE may have NA estimates for TE-mediated epigenetic effects (low local sequencing coverage) and how we treated them in the analysis (remove them from the analysis). We included these details in p48, line 20-21; p48, line 31.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In S2, how they compare the correlations across two genomes is confusing. Is that for shared TEs? Also, do estimates from two strains (Y axis) include values from X axis? It seems like this is saying X is correlated with the average of X and Y, which will always be true if Y is a random variable.

For the magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment, the two-genome estimates were further normalized by the enrichment level in the homologous sequence without the TE insertion.

What explains variation in genome size and TE content is one of the big questions in evolutionary genomics. The results are somewhat complex, but that is because biological systems are complex.</p><p>My expertise is in evolutionary genomics of TEs. I am not an expert in chromatin biology and regulation of gene expression.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>In this manuscript, Huang et al. expand upon results presented in two previous influential publications led by the corresponding author of this manuscript: Lee (2015) and Lee and Karpen (2017). Lee (2015) reported that H3K9me3 spreads from euchromatic TE insertions, these insertions lead to reduced expression of nearby genes, and this phenomenon depends on the piRNA pathway. Lee and Karpen (2017) reported a significant negative correlation between both H3K9me2 magnitude and extent and TE population frequencies in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and demonstrated strong spreading of H3K9me2 from TE insertions, an average of 4.5 kb into flanking regions. They also report stronger epigenetic effects of TEs in <italic>D. simulans</italic> compared to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> which they propose could be due to higher expression of Su(var) 3-9.</p><p>Here, Huang et al. examine H3K9me2 magnitude and extent (i.e. spreading) across six species of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including two different strains of D. simulans and D. yakuba. Across all species and strains, the authors observe a strong enrichment of H3K9me2 at euchromatic TE insertions. They find a large amount of variation in H3K9me2 magnitude and extent across TE classes and families, and among species and strains, but this variation does not appear to show any meaningful and/or consistent pattern. While they find that genic H3K9me2 is positively associated with the magnitude and extent of TE-derived H3K9me2, only the magnitude effect depends on gene distance. They find no relationship between TE epigenetic effects and expression of adjacent genes and some evidence of asymmetric H3K9me2 spreading due to neighboring highly expressed genes. Across all species, the magnitude of H3K9me2, but not the extent, was negatively correlated with TE population frequency. Similarly, the magnitude of H3K9me2, but not the extent, was correlated with TE abundance across species. Finally, they find that the magnitude of H3K9me2 (extent not tested) is positively correlated with expression of Su(var) genes across species.</p><p>The analyses performed here are rigorous and the appropriate replicates have been included. The authors also clearly go to great lengths to try to address confounding factors that could explain the correlations they are seeing.</p><p>1. My main concern related to evidence and reproducibility is that the results shown for H3K9me2 magnitude and spreading are highly variable between species and strains. It is not clear to me how much of this variation is due to biology versus technical issues related to ChIP, however I am surprised at how low the correlations among replicates are for these measures (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure S4). I would encourage the authors to perform additional QC measures for their ChIP experiments and replace any low quality replicates so as to minimize the contribution of technical variation. Some QC suggestions: the K-MetStat Panel spike-in should allow for an assessment of antibody specificity for the K9me2 modification and the Irreproducibility Discovery Rate (IDR) framework can quantify reproducibility among replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s helpful comment and performed analyses following the reviewer’s suggestion. We used ChIP-seq reads mapping to SNAP-ChIP K-MetStat Panel to assay the specificity of the used antibody (Abcam 1220). Consistent with previous investigations by modEncode (Egelhofer et al. 2011) and others (Sentmanat and Elgin 2012), our analysis found that this antibody shows high specificity against H3K9me2. We included this result in p45, line 23-25 and Figure 1 – Supplementary Figure S5.</p><p>We performed the suggested IDR analysis and found no direct associations between IDR and the correlations between replicates for the index of TE-mediated epigenetic effects (the diagnostic IDR plots are now in Figure 1 – Supplementary Figure S7). For instance, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> shows the lowest correlation for the magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment between replicates, but has decent consistency between replicates by IDR analysis.</p><p>A plausible technical reason for this discrepancy is that IDR analysis relies on called peaks. Custom pipelines, which were designed to identify “sharp peaks,” are likely to miss the enrichment of repressive marks, which typically have broad and lower level of enrichment (reviewed in Park 2009 Nature Review Genetics). Accordingly, TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment in euchromatic genome could be missed in the IDR analysis. Indeed, a previous study found that only 12% of TE-induced H3K9me2 enrichment was detected by peak calling (Lee et al. 2020 PLoS Genetics). Another more important biological reason is that the spreading of repressive marks from constitutive heterochromatin has been observed to be a variegating phenotype and could differ between cells and individuals. Accordingly, the variability for the magnitude and extent of TE-mediated local enrichment of heterochromatic marks could have contributed to the low correlation between replicates for some samples. We included these discussions in p49, line 10-29.</p><p>Thanks to the reviewer’s comment, we noticed that <italic>D. simulans</italic> strain 2 has much fewer peaks showing low IDR between replicates. To be conservative, we thus tried excluding this sample for the key analysis for our study and still found negative associations between the magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 and genomic TE abundance. We included this analysis in p29, line 2224; p29, line 28-29; p49, line 29-p50, line 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.1. Related to the comment above: does the &quot;extent&quot; measurement used here differ from the &quot;spreading&quot; measurement used in Lee (2015) and Lee and Karpen (2017). If so, why was a new metric used?</p></disp-quote><p>(We split the reviewer’s comment #2 into two and answered them individually).</p><p>We are a bit unsure about the “spreading” measurement the reviewer is referring to. In Lee (2015), we did not estimate TE-mediated local enrichment of H3K9me3 and instead investigated the associations between genic H3K9me3 enrichment and the presence of adjacent TEs. In Lee and Karpen (2017), we used the same measurement as the current study – the extent and magnitude of TE-mediated local enrichment of H3K9me2.</p><p>We agreed with the reviewer that we did not include enough descriptions of the two indexes for the epigenetic effects of individual TE and this can cause significant confusion. To address this, we added text in p10, line 3-9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2. Could that explain why spreading no longer seems to be an important contributor to TE epigenetic effects?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we did not clearly define “epigenetic effects of TEs” and, without that, the term may implicitly imply functional consequences (e.g., gene expression). We used the term “epigenetic effects” to describe TE-mediated local enrichment of H3K9me2. We added definition for this term when first mentioning this term in Introduction (p5, line 28) and Results (p10, line 3-5).</p><p>The spreading of H3K9me2 beyond TE boundaries could lead to local enrichment of H3K9me2. The strength of such an event could be described by the enrichment level (magnitude) and extent (extent) of the local enrichment of H3K9me2 outside TE sequence. We see that the word “spreading” might also be interpreted as the “extent” of the H3K9me2 enrichment. Accordingly, we replaced this word throughout the manuscript with a more accurate description (“local enrichment of H3K9me2”) to avoid confusion and misinterpretation (e.g., p1, line 23; p4, line 15; p5, line 1; p38, line 10).</p><p>According to Figure 1B and C, we observed that the presence of TEs not only lead to H3K9me2 enrichment at immediate TE-flanking regions, but also could extend for several kbs, suggesting that the “spreading” (used in reviewer’s context) of repressive marks from TEs is still an important “epigenetic effects.” We also observed that the extent of TE-mediated enrichment of H3K9me2 is positively correlated with genic H3K9me2 enrichment (Figure 3A). It is when we investigated the role of TE-mediated local enrichment of H3K9me2 that we did not find the predicted associations between the <italic>extent</italic> of such effect and genomic TE abundance, but did find significant associations between the <italic>magnitude</italic> of such effect and TE abundance. It is worth noting that Lee and Karpen 2017 made similar observations with two species (i.e., TE copy number is associated with the magnitude of epigenetic effects, but not with the extent), which we noted in p30, line 1-3. In addressing the reviewer #1’s comment 8, we also made more clear distinctions between the two estimates (magnitude and extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment; see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In terms of clarity: if the authors demonstrate that their ChIP replicates are highly reproducible and the &quot;extent&quot; metric is not meaningfully different from the previously used &quot;spreading&quot; metric, then it is hard for me to think of technical or analytical reasons why the findings reported here differ substantially from those reported previously. The previous model was intuitive: an underappreciated aspect of the deleterious nature of TE insertions is that euchromatic TEs can initiate heterochromatin formation which spreads into nearby genes leading to harmful reductions in their expression. This study suggests that magnitude of H3K9me2 is the major contributor to the &quot;epigenetic effect&quot; of TEs and that there is no relationship between TE-induced H3K9me2 and neighboring gene expression. I would encourage the authors to use the discussion to acknowledge these contradictions and try to reconcile these results with those from the previous two papers. Is there reason to believe the previous studies were incorrect? Otherwise, it is very hard to know what to take away from this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the reviewer that without clearly defining “epigenetic effects,” readers could get the impression that the current study contradicts previous findings. Hopefully, our revision according to the reviewer’s comment #2 above would clarify the meaning of “epigenetic effects of TEs.” Also, as noted above, similar to Lee and Karpen (2017), we used two indexes to describe the epigenetic effects of TEs, or TE-mediated local enrichment of H3K9me2 in the euchromatic genome. Both the previous study with a limited number of species and our study found that (1) TEs lead to a significant increase in the magnitude and extent of local enrichment of H3K9me2, and (2) TE copy number is negatively associated with the magnitude, but not extent, of the effect. Our findings do not contradict previous studies.</p><p>The generally limited associations between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and lowered gene expression, as mentioned by the reviewer, was also reported in other model species, including in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (Lee and Karpen 2017 <italic>eLife</italic>), <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Quadrana et al. 2016 <italic>eLife</italic>; Stuart et al. 2016 <italic>eLife</italic>), rice (Choi and Purugganan 2018 MBE), and mouse (Pezic et al. 2014 Genes &amp; Development). This has been a perplexing finding in the field of TE evolution, which was extensively discussed in two recent reviews (Kelleher et al. 2020 Trends in Genetics; Choi &amp; Lee 2020, PLoS Genetics; discussed in our Introduction p5, line 9-16). Our current study investigated this question in multiple species and used both within-genome and across-genome (i.e. between homologous alleles) comparisons, further revealing the complex relationship between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and neighboring gene expression. We hope that our new analyses addressing reviewers' comments (reviewer #1’s comment 3 and reviewer #3’s comment 4) further help corroborate our findings. We also included additional discussions regarding the limited associations between TE-mediated epigenetic effects and gene expression (p39, line 9-22) and provided possible reasons why we did not find the expected negative associations between them (p39, line 22 – p40, line 16).</p><p>It is worth noting that our analysis focuses on identifying the genome-wide average pattern; it is still plausible that the local enrichment of H3K9me2 induced by individual TE occasionally lowers nearby gene expression (e.g., genes with positive z-scores in Figure 3C). In fact, many early examples of TE-mediated enrichment of repressive marks were discovered by the phenotypic consequences of reduced neighboring gene expression (reviewed in (Choi and Lee 2020 PLoS Genetics)). We included this discussion in p18, line 14-21.</p><p>In this study, we tested the model proposed by Lee and Karpen (2017) (Figure 6). We were able to find support for most of the models except for the generally expected, but unsupported prediction that TEs’ epigenetic effect would lower neighboring gene expression. We proposed several possibilities for this missing link, which can be found in p40, line 18 – p41, line 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other major comments:</p><p>4. Figure 3C: For the gene expression analysis, it would be helpful to see a scatterplot where each point is a gene and the axes are the log2 expression level of the gene in the strain with an adjacent TE versus the log2 expression of the same gene in the strain without an adjacent TE. The slope of the regression line would show whether there is any tendency for genes with adjacent TEs to have lower expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the suggested analysis following the reviewer’s suggestion (p18, line 9-11 and Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure 9). In these plots, we have the log2 expression level of genes in the strain with a TE on the X-axis and in the strain without TE on the Y-axis. We plotted genes whose nearest TEs with and without epigenetic effects with different colors. The slope is close to 1 (i.e., no difference in gene expression with and without TE presence), and there is no difference in slope for genes whose nearest TEs with and without epigenetic effects. These observations are consistent with our z-score analysis, finding a limited influence of TE-mediated epigenetic effects on gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It is interesting that there is clear evidence supporting enrichment of H3K9me2 at TEs leading to genic H3K9me2 enrichment but not expression downregulation. It would be very interesting if the authors could extend this analysis to include all genes from the euchromatic chromosome arms showing H3K9me2 enrichment in at least one strain or species, irrespective of TEs. Overall, are differences in genic H3K9me2 enrichment between strains/species associated with differences in gene expression?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question raised by the reviewer. Yet, addressing this question is beyond the scope of this study. The suggested analysis would address the general role of the enrichment of H3K9me2 in gene expression, which is a broad topic.</p><p>It may be worth noting that, according to a previous analysis (Lee et al. 2020 PLoS Genetics), most, if not all, of the polymorphic H3K9me2 enrichment in the euchromatic genome is due to the presence/absence of TEs within species. Few H3K9me2 enriched regions in the euchromatic genome will thus be TE-free and could be suitable for performing the suggested analysis. On the other hand, the between-species comparison of gene expression is likely to be confounded by factors other than the enrichment of H3K9me2 (e.g., the evolution of regulatory sequences) and thus be challenging to interpret. We thus did not proceed with the suggested analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. I'm confused by the difference between Figure 3D and Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure S7. If I understand correctly, for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, there is no difference in the extent of spreading between the two sides of a TE when the highly expressed gene is near the TE, nor is there a difference when the highly expressed gene is far from the TE (Figure 3D). However, when expression measurements are used from a different strain (Figure 3 – S7), there is a clear difference in the extent of spreading on the gene side, specifically when the highly expressed gene is close to the TE. What explains these contradictory results? Are a large proportion of the genes identified as highly expressed when using the other strain's data no longer highly expressed in the strain of interest? (presumably due to the effect of the nearby TE?). If so, that seems notable as it lends support to an association between spreading and gene downregulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing out this incongruence.

In Figure 3D, we estimated the z-score for the difference in the extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment between the genic and intergenic sides, normalized by the standard deviation of the estimates. In previous Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure S7, we simply compared the extent of TE-mediated H3Kme2 enrichment on the two sides of a TE. The z-score should be a more appropriate statistic given that it is normalized, so comparable across TE insertions. By using the z-score to perform the analysis in previous Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure S7, we found the same results like those in Figure 3D, and there is no statistically significant difference in the extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment between the two sides of a TE in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81567-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Given that there is no major difference between Figure 3D and updated Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure S7, and the latter does not add additional information, we decided to exclude analysis based on categorizing genes according to modEncode data (i.e., previous Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure S7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors report that H3K9me2 spreading from TEs is counteracted by the presence of a highly expressed gene nearby (either upstream or downstream), leading to asymmetric spreading. However, the spreading extent index is calculated by averaging the extent of spreading between the two flanking regions of the TE. Is this the best choice given the presence of asymmetric spreading? Would using the longer of the two distances be better?</p></disp-quote><p>We think the reviewer is suggesting we use the “intergenic side,” which is less likely influenced by the expression of adjacent genes. Our response is based on this interpretation.</p><p>According to our data presented in Figure 3D, the extent of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment is not symmetrical even for TEs far from genes. This is consistent with findings from constitutive heterochromatin that the spreading of repressive marks is a stochastic process. Also, our goal is to understand the potential functional and thus fitness consequences of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment; such effect on the genic side may thus be of higher importance. Accordingly, it is challenging to predict a priori which side of the extent of H3K9m2 enrichment is more important, and we still chose to use the average of the two sides for our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. An important prediction related to the proposed relationship between differences among species in expression of Su(Var)s and differences in the magnitude of H3K9me2 at TEs is that the same pattern should be present for other heterochromatic loci. Do other (non-TE) heterochromatic loci show stronger H3K9me2 enrichment in species with higher expression of Su(Var)s?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting question. Yet, the suggested analysis and interpretation of the results are outside the scope of the current study. In addition, the effects of reduced dosage effects of Su(var)s were mainly observed at the boundaries of heterochromatin (e.g., at translocated genes located at the heterochromatin/euchromatin boundary and associated with PEV phenotype, reviewed in Elgin and Reuter 2013). In order to perform such analysis, one needs to first define the heterochromatin (HC)/euchromatin (EU) boundaries epigenetically using H3K9me2 enrichment. A potential issue is that the enrichment level of H3K9me2 at genes at HC/EU boundaries would highly depend on how the boundaries were first defined by H3K9me2, making the interpretation of the analysis challenging. Because of these reasons, we did not proceed with the suggested analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. It is not clear to me how the 1360 reporter experiment is applicable to the Su(Var)s expression results. The authors only consider H3K9me2 magnitude in their comparison to Su(Var)s expression rank yet, if I understand correctly, the 1360 reporter experiment measures spreading/extent of H3K9me2 which leads to downregulation of the adjacent mini-white gene. The reporter experiment described here suggests that reducing Su(Var) gene dosage leads to a reduction of H3K9me2 spreading along with a concomitant reduction in reporter gene silencing, however the other results reported here suggest that spreading of H3K9me2 is not an important contributor to the epigenetic effects of TE nor does spreading lead to gene downregulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our motivation for performing the 1360 reporter experiment was unclear and needs to be further clarified. As discussed in response to the reviewer’s comments 2 &amp; 3, we did find that euchromatic TEs lead to local enrichment of H3K9me2, which is characterized by higher H3K9me2 enrichment level (magnitude) and an extent beyond the TE sequence. Even though on a genome-wide average, we did not find predominantly negative impacts of TE’s epigenetic effects on neighboring gene expression, our analysis does not preclude individual cases where a gene’s expression is reduced by TE-mediated enrichment of H3K9me2 (see discussions in comment 3 above and p18, line 14-21).</p><p>The 1360 reporter consists of a TE right next to the reporter gene. Accordingly, for this reporter system, the magnitude, instead of the extent, of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment may be more important. In this specific reporter system, there are associations between the presence of 1360, the enrichment level of H3K9me2 at the mini-white reporter gene, and the reduced amounts of red-eye pigmentation (likely due to reduced gene expression). Accordingly, the eye pigmentation level in this system serves as a convenient readout for the magnitude of TE-mediated H3K9me2 enrichment. We clarified these points in p33, line 23-29.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments</p><p>1. Lee (2015) examined H3K9me3 while Lee and Karpen (2017) and this manuscript study H3K9me2 levels. I think it is important to explain why one modification was used versus the other. Do you expect them to be redundant or might they play different roles in spreading versus magnitude of heterochromatin?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we did not have enough context for why we chose to study H3K9me2. Both H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 are found to be highly enriched in the heterochromatic regions of the genome in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (Riddle et al. 2011 Genome Research; Kharchenko et al. 2011 Nature). According to Lee and Karpen (2017), both H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 captured TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks. The major reason that our study focused on H3K9me2 is due to the availability of suitable antibodies. Antibody against H3K9me2 is monoclonal and has been validated by modEncode to show high consistency (Egelhofer et al. 2011), while commonly used H3K9me3 ChIP antibody available at the time when this study started (Abcam ab8898) is polyclonal and likely cross-react with other histone modifications, in particular H3K27me3 (personal communications with modEncode team). Because H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 would both provide the needed information about TE-mediated local enrichment of heterochromatic marks, we proceeded with only H3K9me2. To provide more context, we added text at p7, line 6-12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
