In non-human primates, the motor areas contain independent, somatotopic, representations of the forelimb (i.e., motor maps). But are the neural codes for actions spatially organized within those forelimb representations? Addressing this question would provide insight into the poorly understood structure–function relationships of the cortical motor system. Here, we tackle the problem using high-resolution optical imaging and motor mapping in motor (M1) and dorsal premotor (PMd) cortex. Two macaque monkeys performed an instructed reach-to-grasp task while cortical activity was recorded with intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI). The spatial extent of activity in M1 and PMd was then quantified in relation to the forelimb motor maps, which we obtained from the same hemisphere with intracortical microstimulation. ISOI showed that task-related activity was concentrated in patches that collectively overlapped &lt;40% of the M1 and PMd forelimb representations. The spatial organization of the patches was consistent across task conditions despite small variations in forelimb use. Nevertheless, the largest condition differences in forelimb use were reflected in the magnitude of cortical activity. Distinct time course profiles from patches in arm zones and patches in hand zones suggest functional differences within the forelimb representations. The results collectively support an organizational framework wherein the forelimb representations contain subzones enriched with neurons tuned for specific actions. Thus, the often-overlooked spatial dimension of neural activity appears to be an important organizing feature of the neural code in frontal motor areas.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor system</kwd><kwd>somatosensory system</kwd><kwd>microstimulation</kwd><kwd>optical imaging</kwd><kwd>motor behavior</kwd><kwd>reach</kwd><kwd>grasp</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS105697</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gharbawie</surname><given-names>Omar A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-12-94</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gharbawie</surname><given-names>Omar A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The spatial dimension of neural activity is an organizing feature of the neural code that controls motor actions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motor (M1) and dorsal premotor (PMd) cortex in monkeys are widely used as models for studying cortical control of movement. Both cortical areas contain complete motor representations of the forelimb (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boudrias et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gould et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murphy et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raos et al., 2003</xref>). Somatotopy of the forelimb representations varies across studies, but there is consensus that muscles and cortical columns do not have a one-to-one mapping. Instead, an arm or a hand muscle receives corticospinal inputs from a population of cortical columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rathelot and Strick, 2006</xref>). Similarly, a cortical column can influence activity in several muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donoghue et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fetz and Cheney, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemon et al., 1987</xref>). The convergence and divergence of corticospinal projections mean that the same motor output is present in many locations within a forelimb representation. For example, intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) evokes shoulder flexion from many M1 sites where the affiliate corticospinal projections target the same group of arm muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2001</xref>). But how can a seemingly simple motor map control a rich repertoire of arm and hand actions?</p><p>To address this question, we must first understand the spatial relationship between neural activity that supports arm and hand actions (i.e., function), and the forelimb motor maps (i.e., structure). We consider two different perspectives. The first perspective is that neural codes for arm and hand actions are not spatially organized within the forelimb motor maps. Instead, neural activity affiliated with a particular function (e.g., reach) is present throughout the arm zones, or even throughout entire forelimb representations. This scheme has support in electrophysiological studies that examined relationships between neural coding, recording site location, and forelimb behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rouse and Schieber, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saleh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vargas-Irwin et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, most electrophysiological investigations pool results across recording sites, offering only limited insight into the spatial organization of functions. An alternative perspective is that neural codes for arm and hand actions are more spatially organized within the forelimb motor maps. Here, neural activity affiliated with a particular action (e.g., reach) is concentrated in subzones within the forelimb representations. This spatial organization of function is consistent with maps obtained using long train ICMS (500 ms), which approximates the duration of natural actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graziano et al., 2002</xref>). The same motor mapping parameters revealed functional subzones in both frontal and parietal cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke and Graziano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gharbawie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graziano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stepniewska et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Adjudicating between the two perspectives can be facilitated with neuroimaging because it provides uninterrupted spatial sampling and retains the spatial dimension of the recorded activity. The necessary implementation here is to image entire forelimb representations during arm and hand actions then quantify the spatial organization of movement-related cortical activity. Intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI), two-photon imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been successfully used in measuring cortical activity related to arm and hand actions in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ebina et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedman et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kondo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelissen and Vanduffel, 2011</xref>). The mesoscopic field-of-view (FOV) in ISOI is particularly well suited for the size of the forelimb representations in M1 and PMd. Moreover, ISOI affords high spatial resolution and contrast without extrinsic agents (e.g., GCaMP, dyes, or MION). These reasons motivated us to use ISOI to measure M1 and PMd activity in head-fixed macaques engaged in an instructed reach-to-grasp task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). In the same FOV, we used ICMS for high-density mapping of the forelimb representations and surrounding territories. We then quantified the spatial overlap between cortical activity determined from ISOI and the forelimb motor map. We reasoned that if the neural code for reaching and grasping is not spatially organized within the forelimb representation, then ISOI should report diffuse task-related activity that overlaps most of the M1 and PMd forelimb representations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top). Alternatively, if the neural code is more spatially organized, then ISOI should report focal task-related activity in subzones of the M1 and PMd forelimb representations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intrinsic signal optical imaging during instructed arm and hand actions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chronic recording chamber provides access to motor and somatosensory cortical areas in the right hemisphere.

Both monkeys completed 49 successful trials/condition/session (median; interquartile range [IQR] = 37–51 trials [monkey G], IQR = 45–51 trials [monkey S]). We used ISOI to measure cortical activity during task performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The spatial extent of activity in M1 and PMd cortex was quantified in relation to motor maps derived with ICMS from the same recording chambers. Measurements of joint angles and electromyography (EMG) activity during the task provided context for condition differences in cortical activity.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Consistent somatotopy in M1 and PMd</title><p>To find the forelimb representations in M1 and PMd, we used ICMS to map frontal cortex from central sulcus to arcuate sulcus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, E</xref>). The general organization of the motor map was consistent between monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D, F–H</xref>). Most ICMS sites evoked forelimb movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, F</xref>). We marked the rostral border of M1 such that (1) it was 3–5 mm from the central sulcus, and (2) separated high threshold sites (&gt;30 μA) from low threshold sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, G</xref>). To simplify the motor map, site classifications were consolidated into broader categories (e.g., elbow and shoulder became arm). The simplified maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, H</xref>) showed that the forelimb representations were flanked medially by trunk zones and laterally by upper trunk and face zones. Within the M1 forelimb representation, the main hand zone (i.e., digits and wrist) was surrounded by an arm zone, or an arm and trunk zone. This nested organization is consistent with previous maps from macaque monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murphy et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sessle and Wiesendanger, 1982</xref>) including maps obtained with stimulus triggered averaging of EMG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2001</xref>). The organization of the forelimb representations was less clear in PMd and PMv, which could have been related to higher thresholds, less extensive mapping, as well as more overlap between arm and hand zones than in M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boudrias et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Motor map organization in motor (M1) and dorsal premotor (PMd).</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Right hemisphere of monkey G.

Under red illumination (630 nm wavelength), which was used here, negative reflectance (i.e., pixel darkening) is a lagging indicator of increased neural activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, in the movement conditions, we assumed that pixels would darken in locations where neural activity increased for movement execution, movement planning, or both. We refer to a spatial cluster of darkened pixels as an active ‘patch’, which is conceptually similar to an active ‘domain’, referenced in other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonhoeffer and Grinvald, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu and Roe, 2007</xref>). A domain, however, is typically identified from the differential cortical response to orthogonal conditions (e.g., orientation domains in V1). If task-related neural activity increases throughout the forelimb representations, then we would expect a large patch to fill most of the FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top). If neural activity is more spatially confined, however, then we would expect multiple, smaller, patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom).</p><p>First, we examined reflectance change in M1 and PMd in an average time series from a representative session (36 trials/condition). In the power grip condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), there was no reflectance change from baseline to movement onset (−1.0 to +0.5 s from Cue). During reach, grasp, and hold (+0.5 to +2.0 s from Cue), pixels in the center of the FOV brightened (cool colors). In the same period, pixel darkening mostly overlapped the central sulcus and superior arcuate sulcus (landmarks on first panel). At first glance, these observations were counterintuitive as we expected pixel darkening (warm colors) in the center of FOV where neural activity presumably increased in support of arm and hand actions. We will explore the time course of reflectance change in subsequent panels and figures. For now, however, we interpret pixel darkening in this period as indication of activity in major vessels. Once the hand returned to the start position after movement completion (i.e., hold start), we observed the expected reflectance change: pixels in the center of the FOV started to darken and form patches in M1 and PMd (+3.5 s from Cue). Patches continued to darken and expand in the remaining frames. Nevertheless, even at peak intensity and size (+5.0 to +6.0 s from Cue), patches remained spatially separable within M1 and between M1 and PMd. For contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows an average time series from the withhold condition where the Cue instructed the animal to hold the start position for the duration of the trial. Here, pixel darkening was limited to major blood vessels as most of the FOV was unchanged or brightened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, cyan pixels). Thus, the patches in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> were likely lagging indicators of movement-related neural activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) detects movement-related activity in motor (M1) and dorsal premotor (PMd).</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Average time series from a representative session (36 trials/condition, monkey G).

For the baseline phase, we averaged 10 frames acquired −1.0 to 0 s from Cue. For the movement phase, we averaged 33 frames captured post-movement (+2.8 to +6.0 s from Cue). Average baseline frames showed no reflectance change and were indistinguishable between the movement and withhold conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>).

The small number of zones and their small size indicates that reflectance change was limited in the absence of movement.</p><p>Next, we examined the time course of reflectance change in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I, J</xref>). We placed regions-of-interest (ROIs) with two guiding objectives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, colored circles). First, to target M1 hand, M1 arm, and PMd arm, which we achieved by consulting the motor maps and blood vessel patterns. Second, to target locations that showed activity in time series averaged across trials from all imaging sessions (e.g., Figure 5A). Time courses from two of the ROIs showed an abrupt, yet small, reflectance change with movement onset (+0.5 s from Cue). This brief change was likely due to motion artifact and will be more apparent in the next figures. After the artifact, the arm ROIs and the hand ROI had distinct time course profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). For the arm ROIs, positive reflectance started to increase ~0.3 s after movement onset (+0.8 s from Cue) and peaked during the hold phase (+1.7 s from Cue) when the object was grasped and maintained in the lifted position. Then, negative reflectance increased and peaked 2–3 s after movement completion (+5.0 to +6.0 s from Cue). The positive–negative sequence is discussed later in relation to triphasic time courses (negative–positive–negative) established for sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen-Bee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sirotin and Das, 2009</xref>). In contrast, the time course of the hand ROI did not show the positive reflectance that lasted for several seconds in the arm ROIs. Instead, the time course was flat until negative reflectance began to increase +2.5 s from Cue. The timing of the negative peak was consistent, however, across the hand and arm ROIs. The distinctiveness of the time courses from the arm and hand may reflect functional differences between those zones. In contrast to the profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, the same ROIs showed no reflectance change in the withhold condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pixel darkening in M1 and PMd is locked to movement</title><p>Our next objective was to determine whether movement <italic>execution</italic> was necessary for the pixel darkening in the movement condition. We addressed this point in three separate experiments. In <italic>Experiment 1</italic>, one monkey performed reach-to-grasp trials interleaved with no-go trials. In a no-go trial, the Go Cue and preceding steps were no different from a trial in a movement condition. In a no-go trial, however, 250 ms after the Go Cue (i.e., during reaction time), another Cue (LED plus tone) instructed the monkey to hold the start position instead of move. Correct trials were typically achieved with the monkey releasing the start position to reach and then immediately returning its hand to the start position. Movements in no-go trials were therefore truncated but not inhibited. If the monkey reached past the midpoint between the start position and the target, then the trial was considered incorrect. We reasoned that no-go trials would minimize movement-related cortical activity without interfering with internal processes that precede movement (e.g., movement preparation). Results were obtained from two imaging sessions. In the movement condition, the thresholded map showed patches of activity in post-movement frames as compared to baseline frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>, <italic>t</italic>-test, p &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, the thresholded map from the no-go condition had fewer and smaller patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). <italic>Experiment 1</italic> therefore shows that significant pixel darkening was contingent on movement execution.</p><p>In <italic>Experiment 2</italic>, we added conditions in which the monkey did not move but observed an experimenter perform the task instead. First, the monkey completed blocks of trials with regular movement conditions (performed trials). Next, the monkey observed the experimenter perform blocks of trials of the same movement conditions (observed trials). The primate chair was closed off in the observed trials to prevent the monkey from reaching. Cues, timing, and reward schedule were consistent between performed and observed trials. Time courses were measured from ROIs in M1 and PMd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In M1, time courses had a clear negative peak in the performed trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) but remained near baseline in the observed trials. In PMd however, the performed and observed trials had overlapping time courses. All negative peaks in PMd were smaller than the M1 peaks in the performed trials. Results from <italic>Experiment 2</italic> suggest that M1 activity was driven by movement execution, whereas PMd activity was likely related to movement execution, movement preparation, and motor cognition.</p><p>In <italic>Experiment 3</italic>, we systematically varied the timing of the Go Cue so that it was 1, 2, or 3 s from trial initiation. We reasoned that temporal shifts in movement onset would lead to predictable shifts in pixel darkening. Only one movement condition was tested in this experiment. We placed ROIs in the M1 hand zone (insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Time courses from both monkeys confirmed that the negative peaks were locked to Cue onset, and by extension movement onset. This temporal relationship was also evident in the spatial development of cortical activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). For each Cue condition, we generated thresholded maps from three time windows near the negative peaks. Each thresholded map therefore reported on pixels that darkened in a specific time window as compared to the baseline frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <italic>t</italic>-test, p &lt; 0.0001, <italic>n</italic> = 44 trials). Across Cue conditions, the largest maps were in the time window +5.8 to +6.0 s from Cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, outlined panels). Thus, <italic>Experiment 3</italic> shows that peak map size, and the timing of the negative peak, were both locked to movement onset. Collectively, <italic>Experiments 1–3</italic> confirm that the M1 activity reported here was linked to movement execution, whereas PMd activity was likely more complex.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Reflectance change is locked to movement.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of reflectance change in motor (M1).

To that end, we used the time course of every pixel to visualize the time of the negative peak (i.e., maximal darkening). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> color codes peak times from the time series in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> but omits information related to magnitude of reflectance. Peak times fit into three broad categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). (1) <italic>Early peaks</italic>. Green pixels peaked ~2 s from Cue when the monkey was still engaged in task-related movements. Green pixels generally corresponded with the hot color pixels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> panels 1.6–2.5, and therefore may have been affiliated with the early response in major vessels. (2) <italic>Intermediate peaks</italic>. Orange/yellow pixels peaked ~3.5 s from Cue, which was within 1 s of movement completion. Orange/yellow pixels were in the approximate location of yellow pixels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> last panel. (3) <italic>Late peaks</italic>. Magenta/red pixels peaked ~5.5 s from Cue, which was ~3.0 s from movement completion. These pixels corresponded with the hot color pixels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> last three panels. Late peak pixels were in clusters surrounded by intermediate peak pixels, but there was no regional divide between the two.</p><p>For another perspective on the spatiotemporal patterns of cortical activity, we examined time courses from ROIs that we placed in M1 and PMd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The three circular ROIs matched those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and returned time courses consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I, J</xref>. In the movement conditions, time courses from the three ROIs had motion artifact that started with reach onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>; ~0.5 s from Cue) and lasted for ~0.2 s. For the M1 hand ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), after the artifact, reflectance change was flat for ~1.5 s. Negative reflectance started to increase ~2.5 s from Cue, which coincided with the end of movement in the precision and power conditions. In those conditions, the negative peak was larger, and occurred later, than in the reach-only condition. This temporal difference could have been due to the larger size of the negative peaks, or longer movement durations, or both. ROIs in M1 and PMd arm zones returned time courses that were consistent with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>). In both ROIs, the motion artifact was followed by an increase in positive reflectance, which is quite different from the time courses from the hand ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Nevertheless, in the arm ROIs, negative reflectance increased from +3.5 from Cue and peaked at approximately the same time as the M1 hand ROI.</p><p>Two controls provided context for the time courses of the movement conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). First, in all ROIs, the withhold condition had time courses that remained close to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). This control confirms that the reflectance change in the movement conditions was movement driven. Second, a ROI that comprised the entire forelimb representation of M1 and PMd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) returned time courses that differed entirely from the other three ROIs. Most importantly, the forelimb ROI lacked the characteristic negative peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>. This control confirms that time courses from movement conditions were spatially specific responses that did not generalize to the entire forelimb representation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Thresholded activity maps overlap limited portions of the forelimb representations</title><p>Next, we generated thresholded maps to summarize the spatial patterns of movement-related cortical activity. For each condition, trials were pooled across sessions and every trial contributed a baseline frame and a movement frame. Pixels that darkened significantly (<italic>t</italic>-test) in the movement frame as compared to the baseline frame were included in the thresholded map. A baseline frame was the average of the first 10 frames in a trial. The movement frame was defined in two different ways. First, as an average of all frames (<italic>n</italic> = 39) captured from end of movement (+2.2 to +6.0 s from Cue). This strategy was adopted for the thresholded maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Second, as an average of 5 consecutive frames captured in the post-movement period. A similar strategy was adopted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, but here the 5-frame range was guided by the timing of the negative peaks. Thus, we averaged the values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> to determine the mean timing of negative peaks in the precision condition. We repeated the procedure for the other conditions and then averaged the times across conditions. From those averages, the 5 frames for calculating the movement frame were set to +4.1 to +4.4 s from Cue (monkey G) and +3.9 to +4.3 s from Cue (monkey S).</p><p>First, we examine the 5-frame thresholded maps (<italic>t</italic>-test, p &lt; 0.0001). We co-registered those maps with the motor maps for reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, J</xref>). The general organization of the thresholded maps was more similar across conditions within an animal than for the same condition across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, J</xref>), which is consistent with human fMRI maps of M1 finger zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ejaz et al., 2015</xref>). In all thresholded maps, significant pixels were organized in patches that overlapped subzones of the M1 and PMd forelimb representations. The most lateral patches were in M1 face and PMv forelimb and were therefore excluded from subsequent analyses. In each map the patches collectively overlapped only 31% (median, IQR = 29–35%) of the forelimb representations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H, K</xref>). This measurement takes into consideration both monkeys, both M1 and PMd, and the three movement conditions. For reference, thresholded maps from the withhold condition overlapped 3% (median, IQR = 1–7%) of the M1 and PMd forelimb representations.</p><p>We repeated the overlap measurements after re-thresholding the maps to correct for multiple comparisons based on the number of pixels in the forelimb representations (<italic>t</italic>-test, p &lt; 1e−7). This more conservative threshold did not impact the spatial organization of the maps, but it shrank their sizes to 14% (median, IQR = 16–20%) overlap with the forelimb representations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, expanding the frame range of thresholded maps to the 39 frames post-movement (<italic>t</italic>-test, p &lt; 0.0001) led to only a small reduction of overlap with the forelimb representations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; median = 27%, IQR = 25–34%). Thus, generating thresholded maps using a less conservative threshold, or using different frame ranges from the post-movement period, returned the same overall result: &lt;40% overlap with the M1 and PMd forelimb representations.</p><p>For context on map sizes reported thus far, we redid the overlap measurements at every time point. Thus, we generated a thresholded map (<italic>t</italic>-test, p &lt; 0.0001) for every frame and measured its overlap with the M1 and PMd forelimb representations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I, L</xref>). A consistent feature across movement conditions, cortical areas, and monkeys, was that the size of thresholded maps started to rapidly increase from ~3 s after Cue, which nearly coincided with the end of movement in the precision and power conditions. The size of the maps plateaued, or even decreased, by ~5 s from Cue. At peak map expansion, overlap with the forelimb representations was 38% (median, IQR = 35–44%). Thresholded maps in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) were therefore only slightly smaller than peak maps sizes. Thus, the two strategies that we adopted for selecting movement frames (5- and 39-frame averages) did not underreport the size of the thresholded maps.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Condition differences in cortical activity patterns</title><p>The spatial organization and size of the thresholded maps suggested similar cortical activity across conditions.

Maps thresholded at p &lt; 0.0001 did not reveal distinguishable patches. After relaxing the threshold to p &lt; 0.001, we found several patches in the M1 and PMd forelimb representations that darkened more in the reach-to-grasp conditions as compared to the reach-only condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). In contrast, fewer and smaller patches reported differences between the precision and power conditions (not shown). Thus, the thresholded maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref> flag cortical zones that were more active in the reach-to-grasp conditions as compared to the reach-only condition.</p><p>Second, we used cross-correlation at zero lag to compare average time series from pairs of conditions. We focused on the post-movement frames and correlated each frame from one condition with the time-matched frame in the paired condition. The analysis was limited to pixels within the forelimb representations. Correlation coefficients were pooled across monkeys such that each condition pair returned a distribution of 78 points (39 frames × 2 monkeys). A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed an effect of condition pairs on the correlation coefficients (<italic>F</italic>(2,231) = 12.98, p &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Post hoc tests corrected for multiple comparison (<italic>n</italic> = 3; p &lt; 0.01), showed that the correlation coefficients for <italic>precision X reach-only</italic> was lower than the other two condition pairs. The cross-correlations therefore show that the spatiotemporal patterns of cortical activity were most dissimilar between the precision and reach-only conditions. For context, cross-correlating movement conditions with the withhold condition returned a much lower distribution of coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Cross-correlation was therefore sensitive enough to detect condition differences in the time series. In sum, the two approaches that we used for directly comparing cortical activity between conditions indicate that condition differences were small but most pronounced between the precision and reach-only conditions.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Forelimb activity scales across conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean flexion/extension changes in two arm joints and two hand joints as a function of time in the three movement conditions (5–15 sessions, 143–405 trials, monkey G). <italic>Y</italic>-axis scale is arbitrary units (AU).

Shoulder and elbow time courses were similar in the precision and power conditions. In the precision condition, however, digit and wrist angles were sustained throughout the hold period. The reach-only condition differed from the other two conditions in having truncated time courses and nearly absent flexion/extension of the digits. To quantify condition differences, we measured the area under the curve (AUC) from Cue to Replace. AUC values were standardized for each joint to facilitate comparisons across conditions. The reach-only condition stood out for having the smallest AUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) in all degrees of freedom. To simplify condition comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), we first combined the AUC calculated for arm joints (shoulder and elbow) and separately combined the AUC for hand joints (wrist and digits). For statistical testing, we then combined the AUC for arm and hand into a single group.

Post hoc tests corrected for multiple comparisons (<italic>n</italic> = 3; p &lt; 0.01) indicated that the kinematics of forelimb joints was less for the reach-only condition than the two grasp conditions.

Thus, joint angle kinematics and EMG indicate that arm and hand activity systematically differed across conditions: precision &gt; power &gt; reach-only.

Nevertheless, the magnitude of activity within the patches scaled with forelimb use as measured from joint and muscle activity. The spatial organization of thresholded maps, and relative invariance across conditions, suggests that neural activity for arm and hand functions is not uniformly distributed throughout the forelimb representations. Instead, our observations are consistent with a functional organization wherein subzones of the forelimb representations are preferentially tuned for certain actions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Measuring activity in M1 and PMd</title><p>Two provisions facilitated our findings. First, we used ISOI to measure cortical activity. ISOI is well established for studying sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonhoeffer and Grinvald, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grinvald et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ts’o et al., 1990</xref>), but few studies have leveraged it for cortical control of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedman et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Siegel et al., 2007</xref>). Functional MRI has been used more extensively to investigate reaching and grasping in monkeys and humans (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavina-Pratesi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gallivan and Culham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelissen and Vanduffel, 2011</xref>). Our objective, however, was better served with the higher contrast and spatial resolution afforded from ISOI. Similarly, calcium imaging has gained traction in cortical control of movement and brain–computer paradigms because it provides single-cell resolution and better temporal fidelity to neural signals. But in monkeys, the FOV in mini-scopes and two-photon microscopes, covers only a small fraction of one forelimb representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bollimunta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ebina et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kondo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trautmann et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, the present FOV was large enough for all forleimb representations on the precentral gyrus (M1, PMd, and PMv). Second, we obtained motor maps from the same chronic chambers and used them to quantify the spatial extent of the cortical activity recorded with ISOI. Without the present high-density motor maps, it would not have been possible to distinguish between cortical activity in the forelimb representations and the counterpart in the surrounding trunk and face zones. Thus, conducting ISOI and motor mapping in the same hemispheres was central to our results and interpretations.</p><p>Nevertheless, our approach had limitations that must be considered for proper interpretation of the results. First, our monkeys performed a reaching task that explored only a narrow range of their repertoire of arm and hand actions. Diversifying the task conditions would have expanded the range of arm and hand movements, which could have provided additional insight into the organization of cortical activity that supports forelimb actions. Second, the motor maps were based on low dimensional classifications of the ICMS-evoked movements. Although our motor mapping approach was sufficient for distinguishing the forelimb representations from the surrounding zones, it may have oversimplified the spatial organization of the arm and hand zones relative to each other. For that reason, we measured the spatial extent of the cortical activity with respect to the forelimb representations as a whole and did not examine potential differences between arm and hand zones.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Delayed negative peaks are locked to movement</title><p>Pixel darkening peaked several seconds after movement onset. Our three control experiments and the withhold condition indicated that most of the present pixel darkening was predicated on movement execution. The reflectance change time courses were consistent with those reported in the few studies that used ISOI with forelimb tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedman et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heider et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the lag between movement onset and peak pixel darkening was two to three times longer than expected from stimulus onset (peripheral or ICMS) and peak darkening in sensorimotor cortex (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Card and Gharbawie, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedman et al., 2020b</xref>). Slower intrinsic signals have been reported in other behavioral paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grinvald et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanigawa et al., 2010</xref>), which raises the possibility of time course differences between awake and anesthetized ISOI. Fundamental differences could also exist between intrinsic signals evoked from movement (active) and those from stimulation (passive). In our task, the arm and hand were active for ~2 s per trial. In contrast, sensory stimuli are typically more confined in both space and time to optimize focal activation in cortex (e.g., S1 barrel, V1 orientation column).</p><p>The protracted peak darkening should be considered in relation to the triphasic time course of reflectance change in ISOI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen-Bee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sirotin et al., 2009</xref>). Studies with stimulus-evoked responses typically focus on the <italic>initial dip</italic>, which is the first dark peak and occurs 1–2 s after stimulus onset. The subsequent <italic>rebound</italic> (bright peak) and <italic>undershoot</italic> (second dark peak) unfold sequentially over several seconds. In our time courses, the timing of the darkest peak would have coincided with the <italic>rebound</italic> in stimulus-evoked responses. The timing of our dark peak can potentially fit with the triphasic response in three ways. (1) Our dark peaks could have been <italic>initial dips</italic> locked to movement onset. In this interpretation our movement-evoked time courses would be slower iterations of stimulus-evoked responses. (2) Our dark peaks could have been <italic>initial dips</italic> locked to movement offset. The early negative peak of the reach-only condition does not provide clear insight into this point because this condition had an early offset time as well as a relatively small negative peak that could have peaked early. Direct testing of the movement offset interpretation would therefore require systematic manipulation of movement duration, which we did not explore. (3) Our dark peaks could have been the <italic>undershoot</italic> locked to movement onset. In this case, the <italic>initial dip</italic> may have been undetected because it was too small, obscured by motion artifact, or both. In this interpretation our movement-evoked time courses would be consistent with stimulus-evoked responses, albeit with a relatively brief rebound.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Movement activates subzones of the forelimb representations</title><p>Average thresholded maps reported cortical locations where task-related activity was present in hundreds of trials. Those maps overlapped &lt;40% of the M1 and PMd forelimb representations. Expanding the number of post-movement frames had no impact on the size of the thresholded maps and correcting the maps for multiple comparisons further diminished their size. Relatively small size was therefore a robust feature of the thresholded maps and we consider potential explanations for that result. (1) <italic>ISOI sensitivity</italic>. It is unlikely that ISOI lacked sensitivity for capturing the full extent of cortical activity and thereby underreported thresholded map sizes. If anything, ISOI sensitivity to subthreshold electrophysiological signals can lead to overestimation of the spatial extent of modulated neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frostig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grinvald et al., 1994</xref>). The issue is minimized by focusing on early segments of the ISOI response, which reports cortical organization and connectivity at columnar resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonhoeffer and Grinvald, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Card and Gharbawie, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Card and Gharbawie, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedman et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu and Roe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vanzetta et al., 2004</xref>). (2) <italic>Task overtraining</italic>. We started ISOI after ~2 years of task training. Extensive training as such has been shown to refine network activity and reduce metabolic demand in M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peters et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Picard et al., 2013</xref>). Both factors could have shrunk the thresholded maps from larger sizes in earlier training stages to the sizes reported here. (3) <italic>Functional organization</italic>. The small size of thresholded maps may reflect the functional organization of M1 and PMd. Specifically, neural activity that supports reaching and grasping could be largely concentrated in subzones of the forelimb representations. In this organizational framework, cortex in between those subzones may be better tuned for forelimb actions other than reaching and grasping. Testing this possibility would require training monkeys to perform tasks that probe a wide range of arm and hand actions, which was not done here. Nevertheless, the notion that actions may be spatially organized in cortex has support in long-train ICMS (500 ms), which maps multi-joint actions (e.g., reach, manipulate, and climb) to contiguous zones in M1 and PMd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldwin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gharbawie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graziano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaas et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional differences between somatotopic zones</title><p>Patches that overlapped arm zones could have been tuned to different task phases than patches that overlapped hand zones. This possibility is supported by distinct time course profiles from ROIs in arm and hand zones. Nevertheless, the temporal resolution of intrinsic signals is not sufficient for relating reflectance change to behavioral events that occur in close succession (e.g., reach and grasp). We are currently conducting high-density electrophysiological recordings to interrogate relationships between movement and spiking activity in constituents of the thresholded maps. Our report on a small sample of single units recorded in other hemispheres, suggested functional differentiation between patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedman et al., 2020a</xref>). Specifically, we found that a medial M1 patch contained more neurons tuned for reaching than neurons tuned for grasping. We found an opposite neural tuning distribution in a lateral M1 patch. Other recordings, however, from caudal M1 (central sulcus) and from rostral M1 (precentral gyrus) have reported spatially co-extensive encoding of reaching and grasping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rouse and Schieber, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saleh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vargas-Irwin et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the temporal dimension provides mixed evidence about functional differences across the spatial dimension (i.e., planar axis) of the forelimb representation.</p><p>Condition differences provide insight into the functional organization of the recorded cortical activity. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelissen and Vanduffel, 2011</xref> defined grasp zones as regions that were more active (fMRI) in reach-to-grasp conditions as compared to a reach-only condition. A similar analysis on our data revealed patches in M1 and PMd where activity in the reach-to-grasp conditions exceeded activity in the reach-only condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Nevertheless, these condition differences were less apparent in the spatial size and organization of the maps, which is consistent with other studies that used univariate analyses on fMRI measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fiave et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nelissen et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, multi-variate analyses (e.g., multi-voxel pattern analysis) on the same data showed that condition identities were embedded in the spatial dimensions of activity maps.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Differentiating between M1 and PMd activity</title><p>Functional differences between M1 and PMd were most apparent in the <italic>observation</italic> experiment. Time courses from the observation condition showed that there was no activity in M1. In contrast, comparable activity was recorded in PMd for the performed and observed conditions, which is consistent with the higher concentrations of mirror neurons in premotor areas than in M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grèzes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Papadourakis and Raos, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raos et al., 2007</xref>).

Task training with head fixation started after ~1 month (monkey G) or ~9 months (monkey S) and lasted for ~22 months. At the end of this training period, the monkey was considered ready for optical imaging. A craniotomy was performed for implanting a chronic recording chamber (30.5 × 25.5 mm internal dimensions) over motor and somatosensory cortical areas. The chamber was secured to the skull with ceramic screws and dental cement. Within the recording chamber, the native dura was resected and replaced with a transparent silicone membrane (500 μm thickness) that we fabricated from a mold. Protocols for the artificial dura have been previously described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arieli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruiz et al., 2013</xref>). The walls of the artificial dura lined the walls of the recording chamber. The floor of the artificial dura (i.e., the optical window) was flush with the surface of cortex and facilitated visualization of cortical blood vessels and landmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The walls and floor of the artificial dura delayed regrowing tissues from encroaching underneath the optical window. Single electrodes and linear electrode arrays were readily driven through the optical window without permanent deformation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Reach-to-grasp task</title><p>Monkeys performed a reach-to-grasp task with the left forelimb while head fixed in a primate chair. The right forelimb was secured to the waist plate. The task apparatus was positioned in front of the animal. A stepper motor rotated the carousel in between trials to present a target ~200 mm from the start position of the left hand. The relative position of the target made it directly visible and was also supposed to encourage consistent reach trajectories across conditions and trials. Task instruction was provided with LEDs mounted above the target. Photocells were embedded in multiple locations within the apparatus to monitor hand location and target manipulation. An Arduino board (Arduino Mega 2560, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arduino.cc/">https://www.arduino.cc/</ext-link>) running a custom script (1 kHz) controlled task parameters, timing, and logged the monkey’s performance on each trial. The task involved four conditions.</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Two reach-to-grasp conditions</title><p>In a successful trial, the animal had to reach, grasp, lift, and hold a sphere. The small sphere condition (12.7 mm diameter) and the large sphere condition (31.8 mm diameter) were used to motivate precision and power grips, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Spheres were attached to rods that moved in a vertical axis only. Task rules were identical for both conditions and are therefore described once. To initiate a trial, an animal placed its left hand over a photocell embedded in the waist plate. Covering the photocell for 300 ms turned on an LED, which signaled the start of the trial. Holding this start position for 5000 ms triggered the Go Cue, which was a blinking LED. The animal had 2400 ms (monkey G) or 2550 ms (monkey S) to reach, grasp, and lift the sphere; time limits were also set for each of these phases. Lifting the sphere by 15 mm turned the blinking LED solid, which signaled the end of the lift phase. Maintaining the lifted position for 1000 ms turned off the LED, which instructed the animal to release the object and return its hand to the start position within 900 ms. Maintaining the start position for 5000 ms triggered a tone and LED blinking. After an additional 2000 ms in the start position the trial was considered successful; tone and LEDs turned off and water reward was delivered. The animal could not initiate a new trial for another 3000 ms. Failure to complete any step within the allotted time window resulted in an incorrect trial signaled by a 1500-ms tone and a 5000-ms timeout in which the apparatus was unresponsive to the monkey’s actions. After the timeout, a new trial could be initiated with hand placement in the start position. Across both monkeys, the median failure rate per session was 18% (IQR = 13–39%) in the precision grip condition and 16% (IQR = 9–28%) in the power grip condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Reach-only condition</title><p>The target was a photocell embedded into the surface of the carousel. The photocell was visible to the monkey but was not graspable. The Go Cue was the same as the one used in the reach-to-grasp conditions, but here it prompted the monkey to reach and place its hand over the photocell. The hand had to cover the photocell for <underline>&gt;</underline>220 ms (monkey G) or <underline>&gt;</underline>320 ms (monkey S). All other task rules and steps were identical to the reach-to-grasp conditions.

Trial initiation was identical to the other conditions. Holding the start position for 5000 ms triggered the Withhold Cue, which was distinctly different from the Go Cue in the movement conditions. Maintaining the start position for another 2800 ms triggered a tone and LED blinking. After an additional 2000 ms in the start position the trial was considered successful and rewarded. Removing the hand from the start position at any time resulted in an incorrect trial and the same consequences described in a failed reach-to-grasp trial. Across both monkeys the median failure rate was 12% (IQR = 7–19%).</p><p>Conditions were presented in an event-related design (1 successful trial/condition/block). Condition order was randomized across blocks. We structured the trials and the inter-trial interval so that the hand would remain in the start position for ~13 s in between trials. Thus, in a successful trial from a movement condition, the arm and hand remained still in the start position for ~13 s and then moved for 1–2 s. This relatively long period without movement was useful for relating the changes in intrinsic signal (slow) to movement onset (rapid). In the withhold condition, the arm and hand were in the start position for ~10 s and no movement was allowed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Muscle activity</title><p>EMG was conducted in seven forelimb muscles on sessions that did not involve ISOI or other neural recordings. After head fixation, the monkey was lightly sedated with a single dose of ketamine (2–3 mg/kg, IM). Sedation was confirmed from decreased alertness and voluntary movements. At that point, pairs of stainless-steel wires (27 gauge, AM Systems) were inserted percutaneously into each muscle (~15 mm below skin). Three arm muscles were targeted (1) anterior or middle deltoid, (2) triceps brachii, and (3) biceps brachii. Four extrinsic hand muscles were targeted (1) extensor carpi radialis brevis, (2) flexor carpi radialis, (3) extensor digitorum 4–5, and (4) flexor digitorum superficialis. The task started 45–60 min after sedation. The monkey was fully alert by that point and showed no lingering effects of sedation. The non-working forelimb was restrained and therefore could not tamper with the EMG wires.</p><p>EMG signals were filtered (bandpass 15–350 Hz) and digitized (2 kHz) using a dedicated processor (Scout model, Ripple Neuro, Salt Lake City, UT). Recorded signals were segmented into trials and their power spectral density was estimated with a discrete Fourier transform (MATLAB <italic>fft</italic> function, Natick, MA). Trials with power &gt;7 μV<sup>2</sup> in the 1–14 Hz range were presumed to have artifact and were excluded from further analysis. EMG signals were rectified and smoothed with a 100-ms sliding window (MATLAB <italic>filtfilt</italic> function). Finally, for each muscle in each movement condition, the average signal was computed across trials and sessions (308–595 trials/muscle).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Joint kinematics</title><p>Forelimb joints were tracked in 3D on sessions that did not involve ISOI or other neural recordings. Before the task started, six LEDs were secured to sites on the left forelimb to track up to two joints/session. A motion capture system (Impulse X2, Phasespace) outfitted with six cameras recorded LED positions and logged <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic> coordinates (480 Hz). For each tracked joint, LEDs were configured to form imaginary vectors or planes. For example, to track the elbow, three LEDs were placed in a triangular formation on the upper arm (i.e., parallel to the humerus) and another three-LED formation was placed on the forearm (i.e., parallel to the ulna). Elbow flexion/extension was calculated as the angle between the vector aligned with the upper arm and the vector aligned with the forearm. Pronation/supination was calculated as the angle between the normal of the plane of the upper arm and the normal of the plane of the forearm. A similar approach was adopted for (1) shoulder flexion/extension, (2) shoulder abduction/adduction, (3) wrist flexion/extension, and (4) digits flexion/extension. Time series of LED coordinates were segmented into trials. Trials were excluded from analyses if LED positions were not logged for &gt;2% of trial duration. Such dropouts were typically due to LED occlusion by the forelimb, primate chair, or grasp apparatus. Kinematic profiles were calculated trial-by-trial and then averaged for each condition (143–405 trials/degree of freedom).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Movement quantification</title><p>EMG and kinematics were quantified trial-by-trial. Time-resolved traces were generated for each recorded muscle and degree of freedom. The AUC was calculated with trapezoidal approximation (MATLAB <italic>trapz</italic> function) applied to the time-resolved traces. We focused on the period from Cue onset until the end of forelimb withdrawal when the hand returned to the start position. For each muscle and degree of freedom, AUC values were standardized across task condition. Standardization was done separately for each session to account for recording variations across sessions. The average AUC for a muscle, or a joint, was calculated as the median of all trials acquired for a task condition. The average AUC for a group of muscles, or a group of joints, was calculated as a mean weighted by the number of trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Motor mapping</title><p>We used ICMS to map the somatotopic organization of frontal motor areas. In monkey S, all sites (<italic>n</italic> = 158) were investigated with a microelectrode in dedicated motor mapping sessions. We used the same approach in &gt;50% of the sites (<italic>n</italic> = 118) in monkey G. The remaining sites (<italic>n</italic> = 99) were mapped with a linear electrode array at the end of electrophysiological recordings that will be presented in a separate report. In the dedicated motor mapping sessions, the monkey was head fixed in the primate chair and sedated (ketamine, 2–3 mg/kg, IM, every 60–90 min). This mild sedation reduced voluntary movements but did not suppress reflexes or muscle tone. A hydraulic microdrive (Narishige MO-10) connected to a customized three-axis micromanipulator was attached to the recording chamber for positioning a tungsten microelectrode [250 μm shaft diameter, impedance = 850 ± 97 kΩ (mean ± standard deviation, SD)] or a platinum/iridium microelectrode [250 μm shaft diameter, impedance = 660 ± 153 kΩ (mean + SD)]. A surgical microscope aided with microelectrode placement in relation to cortical microvessels. The microelectrode was in recording mode at the start of every penetration. Voltage differential was amplified (10,000×) and filtered (bandpass 300–5000 Hz) using an AC Amplifier (Model 2800, AM Systems, Sequim, WA). The signal was passed through a 50/60 Hz noise eliminator (HumBug, Quest Scientific Instruments Inc) and monitored with an oscilloscope and a loudspeaker. As the electrode was lowered, the first evidence of neural activity was considered 500 μm below the pial surface. The microelectrode was then switched to stimulation mode and the effects of ICMS were tested at <underline>&gt;</underline>4 depths (500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 μm). Microstimulation trains (18 monophasic, cathodal pulses, 0.2 ms pulse width, 300 Hz) were delivered from an 8-Channel Stimulator (model 3800, AM Systems). Current amplitude, controlled with a stimulus isolation unit (model BSI-2A, BAK Electronics), was increased until a movement was evoked (max 300 μA). The stimulation threshold for each depth was the current amplitude that evoked movement on 50% of stimulation trains.</p><p>One experimenter controlled the location and depth of the microelectrode. A second experimenter, blind to microelectrode location, controlled the microstimulation. Both experimenters inspected the evoked response and discussed their observations to reach consensus about the active joints (i.e., digits, elbow, etc.) and movement type (flexion, extension, etc.). Movement classification was not cross-checked against EMG recording or motion tracking. The overall classification for a given penetration included all movements evoked within 30% of the lowest threshold across depths. The location of each penetration (500–1000 μm apart) was recorded in relation to cortical microvessels. Color-coded maps were generated from these data using a voronoi diagram (MATLAB <italic>voronoi</italic> function) with a maximum tile radius of 750 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, F</xref>). The rostral border of M1 was marked to separate sites with thresholds &lt;30 μA from higher threshold sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, G</xref>).</p><p>The mapping approach was similar for penetration sites stimulated with a linear electrode array (32 or 24 channels, 15 μm contact diameter, 100 μm inter-contact distance, 210–260 μm probe diameter; V-Probe, Plexon). Each penetration was mapped ~2.5 hr after the linear array was inserted into cortex, which was also the end of electrophysiological recordings during task performance. Only 1 penetration was mapped per session. Microstimulation parameters were identical to the ones used with the microelectrode but were controlled here using the Trellis Software Suite (Ripple Neuro). Channels were stimulated one at a time and every other channel was used. One experimenter controlled the microstimulation and classified the evoked movements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Intrinsic signal optical imaging</title><p>The FOV was illuminated with three independently controlled red LEDs (630 nm wavelength). Each LED was outfitted with a lens to diffuse the light emitted. The experimenters optimized LED positions and brightness with the aid of a real-time heatmap of the FOV. Camera frames 768 × 768 pixels (monkey G) or 1080 × 1310 pixels (monkey S) were captured with a 12-bit CMOS sensor (Photon Focus, Lachen, Switzerland). The tandem lens combination achieved a FOV of 15 × 15 or 22 × 26 mm, both at 20 μm<sup>2</sup>/pixel. Frames were temporally averaged from 100 to 10 frames/s then saved. Image acquisition and parameters were controlled with an Imager 3001 system (Optical Imaging Ltd, Rehovot, Israel). In every trial, imaging started 1 s before Cue onset and lasted for 7 s unless otherwise stated. For spatial reference, a high contrast image of the cortical surface was captured with green illumination (528 nm wavelength) at the start of every session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image processing</title><p>Image processing was conducted on individual imaging sessions. Data frames were rigid aligned in <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic> coordinates (MATLAB <italic>estimateGeometricTransform</italic> function) to a reference frame from the middle of the session. A trial was excluded if any frame was out of register by &gt;10 pixels (i.e., &gt;200 μm). In the remaining trials, the first 10 frames (−1.0 to 0 s from Cue) of a trial were averaged then subtracted from all frames in the same trial. This subtraction converted pixel values to reflectance change with respect to baseline, which effectively normalized every trial to itself. To correct uneven illumination and residual motion artifact, frames were processed with a high-pass median filter (kernel = 250 pixels). A low-pass Gaussian filter (kernel = 5 pixels) was used for smoothing. To accelerate the spatial filtering computations, frames were temporarily down sampled by a factor of 4.</p><p>Frames from different sessions were aligned to a common reference, which was a high contrast image of the cortical surface. For every imaging session, we marked 25–60 points that were apparent in the microvessel patterns from that session and in the common reference. These points were used to construct a mesh grid for the reference and session images. Non-rigid transformation (multilevel B-spline approximation) was then applied to fit the session mesh grid to the reference mesh grid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rueckert et al., 1999</xref>). The transformation matrix was then used to co-register all frames from the session to the common reference. Frames could then be averaged within a session and across sessions. To enhance visualization of average frames, the distribution of pixel values was clipped in relation to the median pixel value. Clipping was excluded, however, from time courses and thresholded maps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Reflectance change time course</title><p>Time courses were generated from two types of ROIs. (1) Small circles (radius = 20 pixels [0.4 mm]) that were placed in arm zones and hand zones in M1 and PMd. (2) A larger ROI that included the M1 and PMd forelimb representations. In both cases, pixel values within an ROI were averaged to obtain 1 value per frame. Pixels that overlapped blood vessels were excluded. Time courses were based on trial-averaged time series.</p><p>In the present illumination (630 nm, i.e., red), pixel darkening is accepted as a lagging indicator of neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grinvald et al., 1986</xref>). The increased consumption of oxygen by local neural activity is believed to increase deoxyhemoglobin concentrations, which absorbs red light and is therefore detected as pixel darkening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malonek and Grinvald, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shtoyerman et al., 2000</xref>). Some have likened the early pixel darkening in ISOI to the initial dip in BOLD fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ances, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Menon et al., 1995</xref>). Nevertheless, there is evidence from multi-spectral imaging to suggest that pixel darkening in ISOI is a more complicated response driven by changes in total hemoglobin, blood volume, and blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sirotin et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, pixel brightening reports increase in the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin and blood flow/volume and may therefore resemble the increase in BOLD fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen-Bee et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Thresholded activity maps</title><p>To identify pixels that darkened in response to task-related movements, we compared frames from the end of movement (i.e., movement frames) to frames acquired before movement onset (i.e., baseline frames). Every trial contributed 1 movement frame and 1 baseline frame (8 sessions, 236–432 trials/condition). A baseline frame was an average of the 10 data frames acquired from −1.0 to Cue. Depending on the analysis, a movement frame was an average of 39 data frames, or an average of 5 data frames, acquired after movement completion.</p><p>A two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was then conducted pixel-by-pixel to compare values between movement frames and baseline frames. Right tail values (p &lt; 1e−4) indicated that the affiliate pixels brightened significantly in movement frames as compared to baseline frames. Left tail values (p &lt; 1e−4) indicated that pixels darkened significantly in movement frames as compared to baseline frames. Pixels were also thresholded after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (p &lt; 1e−7); <italic>α</italic> here was based on the number of pixels (excluding blood vessels) in the M1 and PMd forelimb representations. For both threshold levels, pixels that darkened significantly were considered the constituents of the thresholded activity map. To denoise those maps, significant pixels were removed if they did not belong in a group with <underline>&gt;</underline>10 connected significant pixels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Thresholded map quantification</title><p>Thresholded activity maps and the motor maps were both registered to the common reference. Pixels within the M1 and PMd forelimb representations were counted. Those pixel counts were then expressed as a percentage of the total number of pixels that make up the forelimb representations. The analysis excluded pixels that overlapped major blood vessels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Paired comparisons of condition maps</title><p>Cortical activity was directly compared between condition pairs in two ways. (1) Two sample <italic>t</italic>-test as described earlier but deployed here for comparing movement frames between conditions. (2) Cross-correlation between condition pairs. For each condition, an average time series (<italic>n</italic> = 70 frames) was generated from all trials. Each average frame was then converted into a one-dimensional array. Pairs of arrays from different conditions but matched time points, were cross-correlated at zero lag (e.g., <italic>power grip condition Frame 1 × reach-only condition Frame 1</italic>). Thus, the full comparison between two conditions returned 70 correlation coefficients, but we only focused on the coefficients from the post-movement frames (n = 39). We used the motor map to constrain the analysis to the M1 and PMd forelimb representations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All analyses were done in MATLAB. Function names are in parentheses. We used parametric tests after verifying that our data met parametric assumptions. Specifically, we confirmed that the variance was comparable between groups (<italic>vartestn</italic>) and that the data were normally distributed, which we established from skewness (<italic>skewness</italic>) and kurtosis (<italic>kurtosis</italic>) values between −1 and +1. We used paired <italic>t</italic>-tests (<italic>ttest2</italic>) for the pixel-by-pixel comparisons used to generate thresholded activity maps. We used one-way ANOVA (<italic>anova1</italic>) for condition comparisons of imaging time series and metrics of forelimb use. Post hoc comparisons (<italic>multcompare</italic>) were follow-up <italic>t</italic>-tests corrected by the number of comparisons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Animal Care and Use Committees (protocol #21049001) and followed the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-83196-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data and code used in this paper are posted on OSF (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/7sgbe/">https://osf.io/7sgbe/</ext-link>).</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chehade</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Motor actions are spatially organized in motor and dorsal premotor cortex</data-title><source>Open Science Framework</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.17605/OSF.IO/7SGBE</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Project was supported with funds from NIH (R01 NS105697), Whitehall Foundation (2017-12-94), and University of Pittsburgh Brain Institute.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Wim Vanduffel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The evidence for &quot;clustered&quot; activity is incomplete. It is not clear whether there is convincing evidence that only a small part of the arm/hand representation is activated. Showing that the non-active regions can be activated by other actions would have been the most direct and convincing evidence here (see main comment 1. from both reviewers 1 and 2).</p><p>2) Both reviewers also point out that the comparison between activation and stimulation data (which is the unique feature of this dataset) is rather superficial and both reviewers saw a lot of potential here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper describes the neural activity, measured by intrinsic optical imaging in reach-to-grasp, and reach-only conditions in relation to the Intra-cortical micro stimulation maps. The paper mostly describes a relatively unique and potentially useful data set. However, in the current version, no real hypotheses about the organization of M1 and PMd are tested convincingly. For example, the claim of &quot;clustered neural activity&quot; is not tested against any quantifiable alternative hypothesis of non-clustered activity, and support for this idea is therefore incomplete.</p><p>The combination of intrinsic optical imaging and intra-cortical micro-stimulation of the motor system of two macaque monkeys promised to be a unique and highly interesting dataset. The experiments are carefully conducted. In the analysis and interpretation of the results, however, the paper was disappointing to me. The two main weaknesses in my mind were:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>The alternative hypotheses depicted in Figure 1B are not subjected to any quantifiable test. When is an activity considered to be clustered and when is it distributed? The fact that the observed actions only activate a small portion of the forelimb area (Figure 5G, H) is utterly unconvincing, as this analysis is highly threshold-dependent. Furthermore, it could be the case that the non-activated regions simply do not give a good intrinsic signal, as they are close to microvasculature (something that you actually seem to argue in Figure 6b). Until the authors can show that the other parts of the forelimb area are clearly activated for other forelimb actions (as you suggest on line 625), I believe the claim of cluster neural activity stands unsupported.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The most interesting part of the study (which cannot be easily replicated with human fMRI studies) is the correspondence between the evoked activity and intra-cortical stimulation maps. However, this is impeded by the subjective and low-dimensional description of the evoked movement during stimulation (mainly classifying the moving body part), and the relatively low-dimensional nature (4 conditions) of the evoked activity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Many details about the statistical analysis remain unclear and seem not well motivated.</p></list-item></list><p>Figure 1B: What does FL (gray area, caption) stand for? I can't see that the term is defined.</p><p>Line 158: I gather that unsuccessful trials were repeated. What were the repetition rates in the three conditions? Was the big and small sphere (here listed as one condition) also varied in a pseudorandom manner?</p><p>Line 223: I gather from this that the movement elicited in the ICMS was judged qualitatively by the two experimenters, but no EMG / movement kinematics was recorded as in the overt behavior. Did you make any attempts to validate the experimenter's judgement against objective recordings? Could you calculate inter-rater reliability or did the two experimenters interact with each other during the judgement?</p><p>Line 260: The baseline was either the first frame or the initial first four frames. How did you decide when to use which method? The statement &quot;to increase signal-to-noise ratio&quot; is somewhat cryptic. Increase in respect to what? Baseline subtraction clearly needs to be done in some form or the other. If you wanted a stable baseline, why not take the entire period before cue appearance?</p><p>Line 264-266. When you state: kernel = 250 or 550 pixels and low pass filer 5 or 15 pixels does this refer to the data from the two different monkeys? How were these values decided?</p><p>Line 278: If you do another baseline subtraction here, is the baseline subtraction on line 260 not superfluous? When did you use 5 and when 9 frames?</p><p>For the fMRI crowd, could you add here how pixel darkening and brightening relate to blood flow changes and blood oxygenation changes?</p><p>Line 305: Your nomenclature of cells / ROIs is somewhat confusing. What was the motivation to spatially average pixels across each cell/ROI instead of entering all pixels into the clustering analysis? What do mean by &quot;Spatially matched cells&quot;? Was co-registering not something that was done on the entire window?</p><p>Line 312: How big was the grid in horizontal and vertical dimensions for each monkey? Is this where the 1700 / 2249 numbers come from?</p><p>Line 313: A distances metric is defined to be zeros to itself, dist(A,A) = 0. The correlation of A with itself is 1. Do you mean to say that you used 1-max_correlation, or that you used the correlation as a similarity metric?</p><p>Line 323: My guess the point of this analysis is that the total distances decrease with an increasing number of clusters (and the correlation increases with an increasing number of clusters). So, fitting a line assumes a linear relationship between these two variables. When you say &quot;The longest of those orthogonal lines identified the optimal number of clusters&quot; why are the lines orthogonal? By longest – do you mean the largest deviation between the linear fit either above or below the line? This would pick either an especially good or bad parcellation. Or did you look at deviations above or below only?</p><p>Line 327: In the methods, we have 3 conditions – in the results 4. Which one is correct?</p><p>Line 370: Is the darkening appearing at 1s an artifact of the measurement or real? At least for the posterior border, it looks like it follows exactly the border of the window.</p><p>Line 451: &quot;that shifted and expanded across the time series&quot; – is there a statistical test for the claim that the activity region shifted?</p><p>Line 462: To what degree is the fact the activity averaged over the entire window remains stable simply a consequence of the high-pass filtering applied to each image? High-pass filtering basically removes the mean across the entire window, no?</p><p>Line 466: What is meant by &quot;domains&quot;? Activity clusters?</p><p>Line 5E: The analysis here involves statistical testing within each session, and then averaging activity estimates across sessions, subject to an arbitrary 50% threshold for statistical significance within the session. I cannot see a good motivation for this awkward type of analysis. If you want to consider trials a random effect, I would recommend calculating a statistical test for all trials across sessions combined. If you want to consider sessions as a random effect, then calculate a t-test across the 8 repeated activity estimates per session – this analysis also automatically takes the variability across trials into account. Or is there another reason why you chose this baroque style of analysis that is mentioned?</p><p>Line 474: &quot;organization of domains was more similar across conditions within an animal than for the same condition across animals&quot;. See Ejaz et al. (2015). Nature Neuroscience, for a similar observation in human fMRI motor maps.</p><p>Line 483: The overlap analysis is unfortunately quite dependent on the threshold.</p><p>Line 494: form → from?</p><p>I am not sure what I am supposed to learn from the cluster analysis. It is entitled &quot;Clustering time courses recapitulates spatial patterns of activity&quot; – likely referring to the similarity between Figure 6a and 6b. As the clustering partly depends on the magnitude of the signal at the time points presented in Figure 6a, what is the alternative? Is this similarity more than expected by chance?</p><p>Line 527-546. The overlap between the maps is very hard to interpret, as it is highly dependent on the threshold procedure applied, which is somewhat arbitrarily chosen (see above). Even random maps of a certain size would overlap to some degree, and even identical &quot;true&quot; maps don't overlap completely due to measurement error. An overlap of 0.5 has no intrinsic meaning. It would probably be more informative to report the correlation between unthresholded maps, and compare this to a noise ceiling, where you correlate the maps of one condition across sessions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Chehade and Gharbawie investigated motor and premotor cortex in macaque monkeys performing grasping and reaching tasks. They used intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) covering an exceedingly large field-of-view extending from the IPS to the PS. They compared reaching and fine/power-grip grasping ISOI maps with &quot;motor&quot; maps which they obtained using extensive intracranial microstimulation. The grasping/reaching-induced activity activated relatively isolated portions of M1 and PMd, and did not cover the entire ICM-induced 'motor' maps of the upper limbs. The authors suggest that small subzones exist in M1 and PMd that are preferentially activated by different types of forelimb actions. In general, the authors address an important topic. The results are not only highly relevant for increasing our basic understanding of the functional architecture of the motor-premotor cortex and how it represents different types of forelimb actions, but also for the development of brain-machine interfaces. These are challenging experiments to perform and add to the existing yet complementary electrophysiology, fMRI, and optical imaging experiments that have been performed on this topic – due to the high sensitivity and large coverage of the particular IOSI methods employed by the authors. The manuscript is generally well written and the analyses seem overall adequate – but see below for some additional analyses that should be done. Although I'm generally enthusiastic about this manuscript, there are two major issues that should be clarified. These major questions relate mainly to potential thresholding issues and clustering issues.</p><p>1) The main claim of the authors is that specific forelimb actions activate only a small fraction of what they call the motor map (i.e., those parts of M1/PMd that evoke muscle contractions upon ICM). The action-related activity is measured by ISOI. When looking a the 'raw' reflectance maps, it is rather clear that relatively wide portions of the exposed cortex are activated by grasping/reaching, especially at later time points after the action. In fact, another reading of the results may be that there are two zones of 'deactivation' that split a large swath of motor-premotor cortex being activated by the grasping/reaching actions. (e.g. at 6 seconds after the cue in Figure 3A, 5A). At first sight, the 'deactivated' regions seem to be located in the cortex representing the trunk/shoulder/face – hence regions not necessarily activated (or only weakly) during the grasping/reaching actions. If true, this means that most of the relevant M1/PMd cortex IS activated during the latter actions – opposing the 'clustering' claims of the authors.

As indicated in the introduction, the clustering hypothesis dictates that &quot;an arm function would be concentrated in subzones of the motor arm zones.

In that case, the authors could do a straightforward ANOVA (if the data permits parametric analyses) with ROI, action, and time point (and possibly subject) as factors.</p><p>3) More details about the transparent silicone membrane should be provided: How implanted?

It is not clear whether there is convincing evidence that only a small part of the arm/hand representation is activated. Showing that the non-active regions can be activated by other actions would have been the most direct and convincing evidence here (see main comment 1. from both reviewers 1 and 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ concerns. We overhauled that analyses for measuring the spatial extent of cortical activity. We present new and more robust evidence that cortical activity overlapped relatively small portions (&lt;40%) of M1 and PMd forelimb representations (Figure 5 and Figure 5 – supplemental Figure 1-2).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers; had the non-active regions shown activation in other arm/hand actions, that would have supported the notion of functionally specific subregions. Obtaining that data would require optical imaging while monkeys perform a variety of tasks that test a range of arm and hand movements (e.g., wide range of finger movements, wrist postures, arm directions, etc.). The two monkeys that supplied data for this study were trained only on a reach-to-grasp task with few task conditions. Moreover, the monkeys are no longer available for optical imaging. Thus, obtaining the desired data would involve conducting a larger version of the present study in naïve monkeys. A conservative estimate for completing such a study is 2-3 years. Until we can complete such a study, we expanded the Discussion to consider limitations of the behavioral task and our interpretation of the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Both reviewers also point out that the comparison between activation and stimulation data (which is the unique feature of this dataset) is rather superficial and both reviewers saw a lot of potential here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ concerns. We now leverage each monkey’s motor map to guide placement of regions-of-interest (ROIs) for measuring time courses. Similarly, we use the motor map to spatially constrain the field-of-view for analyses of the activity maps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This paper describes the neural activity, measured by intrinsic optical imaging in reach-to-grasp, and reach-only conditions in relation to the Intra-cortical micro stimulation maps. The paper mostly describes a relatively unique and potentially useful data set. However, in the current version, no real hypotheses about the organization of M1 and PMd are tested convincingly. For example, the claim of &quot;clustered neural activity&quot; is not tested against any quantifiable alternative hypothesis of non-clustered activity, and support for this idea is therefore incomplete.</p><p>The combination of intrinsic optical imaging and intra-cortical micro-stimulation of the motor system of two macaque monkeys promised to be a unique and highly interesting dataset. The experiments are carefully conducted. In the analysis and interpretation of the results, however, the paper was disappointing to me. The two main weaknesses in my mind were:</p><p>a) The alternative hypotheses depicted in Figure 1B are not subjected to any quantifiable test. When is an activity considered to be clustered and when is it distributed? The fact that the observed actions only activate a small portion of the forelimb area (Figure 5G, H) is utterly unconvincing, as this analysis is highly threshold-dependent. Furthermore, it could be the case that the non-activated regions simply do not give a good intrinsic signal, as they are close to microvasculature (something that you actually seem to argue in Figure 6b). Until the authors can show that the other parts of the forelimb area are clearly activated for other forelimb actions (as you suggest on line 625), I believe the claim of cluster neural activity stands unsupported.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns and we have made several revisions.</p><p>(1) The two panels in Figure 1B should have been presented as potential outcomes as opposed to hypotheses in need of quantifiable testing. We revised the Introduction (line 105-111) and the Results (line 149-152) accordingly.</p><p>(2) We agree that the thresholding procedure adopted in the original submission could have impacted the spatial measurements of cortical activity (i.e., Figure 5G-H in original submission). We have completely revised the thresholding procedure and it is now based on statistical comparisons that include all trials (instead of thresholding by number of sessions in the original submission). Thus, the thresholded maps in Figure 5G &amp; 5J are now obtained from pixel-by-pixel comparisons (t-tests, p&lt;1e-4) between frames acquired post-movement and frames acquired before movement. Nevertheless, even with this relatively relaxed threshold, the largest activity maps overlapped &lt;40% of the forelimb representations.</p><p>It is important to note that major vessels were excluded from the thresholded map and from the motor map. Thus, uncertainty about imaging in and around vessels was likely not a factor in the calculated overlap between thresholded maps and the motor map.</p><p>(3) We agree that showing activation in other parts of the forelimb representations in response to action other than reach-to-grasp would have supported some of the arguments that we previously put forth. Unfortunately, we do not have the supporting data and obtaining it would take months/years. We have therefore expanded the Discussion to include limitations of the behavioral task (line 439-443).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The most interesting part of the study (which cannot be easily replicated with human fMRI studies) is the correspondence between the evoked activity and intra-cortical stimulation maps. However, this is impeded by the subjective and low-dimensional description of the evoked movement during stimulation (mainly classifying the moving body part), and the relatively low-dimensional nature (4 conditions) of the evoked activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on all accounts. We expanded the Discussion to consider the low dimensionality of the motor maps and the behavioral task (line 439-449).</p><p>Measuring cortical activity in a variety of motor tasks would likely have provided additional insight about movement-related cortical activity. Nevertheless, including additional tasks, even if it were possible to do so in the same monkeys, would have delayed study completion by months/years. The hidden challenge of the experimental design is that each monkey is trained to not move for many seconds to minimize contamination of ISOI signals. For example, from trial initiation to Go Cue, the monkey must hold its hand in the start position for 5 seconds. Similarly, after movement completion, the monkey must hold its hand in the start position for another 5 seconds. In between successful trials, a monkey must wait for ~12 seconds before it can initiate a new trial. These durations are &gt;1 order of magnitude longer than in electrophysiological studies in comparable tasks. Achieving consistent task performance with the long durations used here, took months of daily training. Moreover, our monkeys typically run out of steam after ~60-70 min of working on the task. This forces us to limit the overall number of task conditions tested in a session, to obtain a large enough number of trials from each condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Many details about the statistical analysis remain unclear and seem not well motivated.</p></disp-quote><p>We address the reviewer’s specific concerns below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1B: What does FL (gray area, caption) stand for?

In brief, for the present illumination (630 nm wavelength), pixel darkening is established as an indicator of increased deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) concentrations. Pixel darkening in ISOI has been likened to the “initial dip” in BOLD fMRI, which has been elusive in some fMRI studies. In contrast pixel brightening in ISOI is considered an indicator of increased concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) and blood volume/flow. ISOI pixel brightening has therefore been likened to an increase in BOLD fMRI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 305: Your nomenclature of cells / ROIs is somewhat confusing.

We were enthusiastic about clustering because of its potential to return meaningful activity maps without input from us about frame range. To partially preserve that feature in the new analysis, we used all frames acquired post movement (i.e., 39 frames captured from +2.2 to +6.0s from Cue). We chose this frame range to (1) exclude frames that may contain motion artifact, and (2) focus on frames likely to have task-related activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 312: How big was the grid in horizontal and vertical dimensions for each monkey?

Is this similarity more than expected by chance?</p></disp-quote><p>The clustering analysis has been removed from the manuscript.</p><p>Nevertheless, yes, similarities between Figure 6A and 6B drove our conclusion that clustering returned maps that were comparable to the activity maps from averaging frames. It is important to note that clustering was conducted on the 70 time points that make up a time series (Figure 6B and 6E in original submission), whereas activity maps were averages from just five time points (Figure 6A and 6D in original submission).</p><p>Indeed, we believe that the similarities were more than expected by chance. We estimated the noise ceiling from running the clustering analysis after shuffling the timecourse of every pixel.

The overlap between the maps is very hard to interpret, as it is highly dependent on the threshold procedure applied, which is somewhat arbitrarily chosen (see above). Even random maps of a certain size would overlap to some degree, and even identical &quot;true&quot; maps don't overlap completely due to measurement error. An overlap of 0.5 has no intrinsic meaning. It would probably be more informative to report the correlation between unthresholded maps, and compare this to a noise ceiling, where you correlate the maps of one condition across sessions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have overhauled the analysis in question. Conditions are now compared in two ways. First, direct statistical comparison between the reach-to-grasp condition and the reach-only condition (Figure 6B-C). Second, correlating average time series from pairs of conditions (Figure 6D). Both comparisons reported differences between the precision grip condition and the reach-only condition. Those two conditions had the largest difference in forelimb joint kinematics and muscle activity (Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Chehade and Gharbawie investigated motor and premotor cortex in macaque monkeys performing grasping and reaching tasks. They used intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) covering an exceedingly large field-of-view extending from the IPS to the PS. They compared reaching and fine/power-grip grasping ISOI maps with &quot;motor&quot; maps which they obtained using extensive intracranial microstimulation. The grasping/reaching-induced activity activated relatively isolated portions of M1 and PMd, and did not cover the entire ICM-induced 'motor' maps of the upper limbs. The authors suggest that small subzones exist in M1 and PMd that are preferentially activated by different types of forelimb actions. In general, the authors address an important topic. The results are not only highly relevant for increasing our basic understanding of the functional architecture of the motor-premotor cortex and how it represents different types of forelimb actions, but also for the development of brain-machine interfaces. These are challenging experiments to perform and add to the existing yet complementary electrophysiology, fMRI, and optical imaging experiments that have been performed on this topic – due to the high sensitivity and large coverage of the particular IOSI methods employed by the authors. The manuscript is generally well written and the analyses seem overall adequate – but see below for some additional analyses that should be done. Although I'm generally enthusiastic about this manuscript, there are two major issues that should be clarified. These major questions relate mainly to potential thresholding issues and clustering issues.</p><p>1) The main claim of the authors is that specific forelimb actions activate only a small fraction of what they call the motor map (i.e., those parts of M1/PMd that evoke muscle contractions upon ICM). The action-related activity is measured by ISOI. When looking a the 'raw' reflectance maps, it is rather clear that relatively wide portions of the exposed cortex are activated by grasping/reaching, especially at later time points after the action. In fact, another reading of the results may be that there are two zones of 'deactivation' that split a large swath of motor-premotor cortex being activated by the grasping/reaching actions. (e.g. at 6 seconds after the cue in Figure 3A, 5A). At first sight, the 'deactivated' regions seem to be located in the cortex representing the trunk/shoulder/face – hence regions not necessarily activated (or only weakly) during the grasping/reaching actions. If true, this means that most of the relevant M1/PMd cortex IS activated during the latter actions – opposing the 'clustering' claims of the authors. This raises the question of whether the 'granularity' claimed by the authors is: a. Threshold dependent. In this context, the authors should provide an analysis whereby 'granularity' is shown independent of statistical thresholds of the ISOI maps.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns and have completely revised the analyses central to Figure 5. We believe that the figure now contains evidence from both thresholded and unthresholded ISOI data in support of limited spatial extent of cortical activation (i.e., “granularity” in the reviewer’s comments).</p><p>For evidence from unthresholded ISOI data, we examined reflectance change time courses from different size ROIs (line 764-768). (A) Small circular ROIs (0.4 mm radius), which we placed in the M1 hand, M1 arm, and PMd arm, zones (Figure 5B). (B) Large ROI inclusive of the M1 and PMd forelimb representations (Figure 5B). We reasoned that if cortical activity is spatially widespread, then the small and large ROIs would report similar time courses. In contrast, if cortical activity is spatially focal, then activity would be detected in the small ROI time courses but would washed out in the large ROI time courses. Our results support the second possibility (Figure 5C-F). Thus, in the movement conditions, time courses from the small ROIs had a large negative peak after movement completion (Figure C-E). In contrast, the characteristic negative peak was absent in the time courses obtained from the large ROI (Figure 5F).</p><p>Separately, we revised our thresholding approach to make those results less sensitive to thresholding effects (more details in our response to the first major point from Reviewer 1). The revised results – thresholded/ binarized maps – are consistent with focal cortical activity. Figure 5G &amp; 5J show activity maps thresholded (t-test, p&lt;0.0001) without correction for multiple comparisons, and therefore represent the least restrictive estimate of the spatial extent of cortical activity. Measurements from these maps showed that significantly active pixels overlapped &lt;40% of the M1 &amp; PMd forelimb representations. We interpret the thresholded results as evidence in support of focal cortical activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Dependent on the time-point one assesses the maps. Given the sluggish hemodynamic responses, it is unclear which part of the ISOI maps conveys the most information relative to the cue and arm/hand movements. I suspect that timepoints &gt; 6 s will reveal even larger 'homogeneous' activations compared to the maps &lt; 6s.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the lag in hemodynamic signals complicates frame selection. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that cortical activity maps would have been larger at time points &gt;6s from Cue. We provide three supporting arguments.</p><p>(1) In the imaging sessions used in Figure 4, we acquired images for 9s per trial and systematically varied Cue onset time. The time courses in Figure 4A-B show that for all Cue onset conditions, the negative peak occurred &lt;6s from Cue. This observation from unthresholded results does not support the notion of greater cortical activity at time points &gt;6s from Cue.</p><p>(2) From the same experiment, Figure 4C shows 9 thresholded/binarized maps generated from different time points in relation to Cue. We measured the size of each map (i.e., overlap with the M1/PMd forelimb representations). We present the results in a scatter plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>. The largest maps came from an average frame captured +5.8-6.0s from Cue. Those maps are on the diagonal in Figure 4E (top left to bottom right). This result from thresholded data therefore does not support the notion of greater cortical activity at time points &gt;6s from Cue.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83196-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>(3) In all other sessions, we acquired images for 7s per trial (-1.0 to +6.0 s from Cue) without varying Cue onset time. At every time point (100 ms), we measured the size of the thresholded/binarized map in relation to the size of the M1 and PMd forelimb representations. The results are presented in Figure 5I &amp; 5L and indicate that thresholded maps plateau in size by 5.0-5.5 s from Cue. At peak size, the maps overlapped &lt;50% of the M1 and PMd forelimb representations. These result indicates that it is unlikely that we underreported the size of activity maps by not measuring map size beyond 6s from Cue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In fact, Figure 5F (which is highly thresholded) shows a surprisingly good match between the different forelimb actions, which argues against the existence of small subzones that are preferentially activated by different types of forelimb actions -the main claim of the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Our original proposal should have been more clearly stated. We were proposing that the thresholded maps, which had similar spatial organizations across conditions as the reviewer suggested, reported on subzones tuned for reach-to-grasp actions. Adjacent to those subzones could be other subzones that are preferentially active during other types of forelimb actions (e.g., pulling, pushing, grooming). We could not test this possibility in our study because the behavioral task examined a narrow range of arm and hand actions. We therefore revised the Discussion to state the limitations of our task and to lean more on published work that supports the present proposal (439-443 and 504-508).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the previous point, the ROI selections/definitions for the time course analyses seem highly arbitrary. As indicated in the introduction, the clustering hypothesis dictates that &quot;an arm function would be concentrated in subzones of the motor arm zones. Neural activity in adjacent subzones would be tuned for other arm functions.&quot; To test this hypothesis directly in a straightforward manner, the authors could use the results from the ICM experiment to construct independent ROIs and to evaluate the ISOI responses for the different actions. In that case, the authors could do a straightforward ANOVA (if the data permits parametric analyses) with ROI, action, and time point (and possibly subject) as factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and we now leverage the ICMS map for guiding ROI placement. All time courses are now derived from 1 of 2 types of ROIs. (1) Small ROIs (0.4 mm radius) placed in zones defined from ICMS (e.g., M1 hand zone). (2) Large ROIs that include the entire forelimb representations in M1 or in PMd (Figure 5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More details about the transparent silicone membrane should be provided: How implanted? How maintained? Please provide pictures at the end of the 9 and 22months periods.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded the Methods section to provide additional information on the silicone membrane (line 566-577).</p><p>The optical imaging chamber and the silicone membrane were not implanted until a monkey was considered trained on the task (9 and 22 months, respectively). We revised the Methods to clarify this point (line 566-567).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1D: Are the yellow circles task cues that the monkeys saw? If not, what were the different cues (Reach, Grasp, Withhold)? Were precision and power grip (and reach?) trials similarly cued?</p></disp-quote><p>The yellow circles were digitally added to the still frames to make the target obvious to the reader. The monkey did not see the yellow circles. We revised the figure legend to clarify this point (line 1005).</p><p>Identical Go Cues were provided for the 3 movement conditions (i.e., reach-to-grasp large sphere, reach-to-grasp small sphere, and reach only). The purpose of the Go Cue was to instruct the monkey to start reaching. In any given trial, the target object was visible to the monkey throughout the trial. Thus, the type of movement condition was not cued as it was self-evident at the outset of the trial. We revised the Methods to ensure that there is no confusion about Cues (line 583-585; 593-594; 611-612).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For the MEG activity a total of 14 27gauge wires were inserted in 7 muscles. This sounds rather invasive. Did monkeys tolerate this easily? Were local anesthetics used? How deep were the wires inserted in the muscle? How did one prevent the monkeys grabbing these wires?</p></disp-quote><p>EMG recordings were conducted in separate sessions from ISOI. Once the monkey was head-fixed, we administered a single, low dose of ketamine (2-3 mg/kg, IM). The point of this mild sedation was to minimize any discomfort for the animal during EMG wire insertion, and to create a safe experience for the animal and the handler. The sedation achieved both objectives without eliminating reflexes or muscle tone. We have no reason to believe that the monkey did not readily tolerate the wire insertion procedure or the EMG recordings. Behavioral testing and EMG recordings started 45-60 minutes after sedation. By that point, there were no outwardly lingering effects of sedation and the monkey rapidly reached and grasped treats from the experimenter (line 633-643). Also, there were no differences in reaction time, reach speed, or success rate, on sessions without mild sedation and sessions with mild sedation and EMG recordings.</p><p>EMG wires were inserted ~15 mm below the surface of the skin.</p><p>Only the non-working forelimb could have disturbed the EMG wires that we inserted into the working forelimb. But the non-working forelimb was restrained from the outset. This point is now in the Methods (line 642-643).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The large FOV was illuminated using 2-3 LEDs. Was illumination uniform throughout the FOV? If not, can this lead to inhomogeneous sensitivity?</p></disp-quote><p>Even illumination is essential for high quality ISOI. We invested effort at the start of every session to optimize illumination. We revised the Methods (line 730-732) to include two factors that were critical to achieving even illumination. (1) Diffuser lens attached to each LED. (2) Real-time heat map of the field-of-view for positioning the LEDs and adjusting the intensity of each one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Pixel values were clipped, if I understood correctly, at either 0.3 SD or 1 SD from the mean. This significantly changes the dynamic range of these pixel values. Are results different without clipping?</p></disp-quote><p>Pixel values were clipped only to facilitate visualization of optical images (e.g., Figure 3A, 5A, 6A). No clipping was done wherever quantitative measurements were involved (e.g., Figure 5G-L). Thus, there was no clipping for time courses, t-tests, and spatial measurements. We revised the Methods to clarify this point (line 759-761).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) An arbitrarily p&lt;0.0001 statistical threshold was used. Why was no correction for multiple correspondence performed as one collects data from ~ 600k-1400k pixels (yet without considering the masks)?</p></disp-quote><p>We redid the analyses after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (p&lt;0.1e-7; 0.05/350k pixels [excluding masked pixels]). We describe the correction in Methods (line 791-794). We now report results thresholded at p&lt;1e-4 and thresholded at p&lt;1e-7 (Figure 5G-L; Figure 5 – Supplemental Figure 1). Not surprisingly, maps were smaller in the more conservative threshold.</p><p>We note that many labs consider the Bonferroni correction an overly conservative approach for correcting family wise errors in imaging. The correction assumes that pixels (or voxels in fMRI) provide independent measurements, which is not the case given the close functional relationship between every pixel with its neighbors. An alternative approach would have been to determine the number of multiple comparisons from the number of ROIs. But we had only 4 ROIs (Figure 5B), which would have resulted in a threshold (p&lt;0.01, [p=0.05/4]) that is more lenient than the one adopted here and in the original submission (p&lt;0.0001).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) What is the reason for obvious edge effects in the withhold condition (Figure 3A, 3F) and apparently also the precision grip condition (Figure 5A: 1.1-3.5sec)? Is this artifactual?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concerns, which were also raised by the first reviewer. We believe that the seeming edge effect is activity in major blood vessels. Specifically, the posterior border of the field-of-view coincides with the central sulcus, which contains a major blood vessel. The darkening is most likely due to reflectance change in the vessel as opposed to an edge effect of the cranial window. Similarly, the rostral edge effect coincides with the arcuate sulcus. We now include this explanation in the Results (line 157-160).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) How are the ROIs defined (cfr major point 2)? They differ in size and location between analyses (e.g. Figure 3 vs Figure 5/S1). Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the ROIs differed in size and location across analyses. We now use 1 of 2 types of ROIs. (1) Circular ROI that is the same size across analyses. (2) ROI fitted to the forelimb representation in M1 or PMd. The shape and size of those ROIs is guided exclusively by the motor map. We revised the Methods to reflect these points (line 764-768).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) I find it a bit counter-intuitive that the same color-code (i.e. black values) is given for 'activations' in panel 3G and 'deactivations' in panel 3H. Why not using red and blue instead? Along the same vein: activations in the time-courses are negative (reflecting the darkening). It would be instructive for the non-experienced reader to either add activation/ suppression on the figures (above and below zero in Figures 3I and J and 5C), or to invert the Y-axis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on all accounts. We revised the panels in Figure 3 so that significant pixel darkening is shown in red and significant pixel brightening is shown in blue. Separately, we revised the y-axis labels for all time course plots to facilitate interpretation of negative and positive values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Line 426: Figure 5K does not exist.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected the error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Line 520: It is argued that the unsupervised cluster analysis, which is quite interesting, is similar in both monkeys. However, this is not obvious from the data: neither in the spatial domain (Figure 6B vs S2B) nor in the temporal domain Figure 6C and S2 C, especially the blue plots. In fact, the clustering data from monkey G reveal a rather widespread, uninterrupted pattern arguing against the 'cluster hypothesis' of the authors. This should be discussed in more depth.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s concerns. As stated in response to reviewer 1, we replaced the clustering analysis with a more straightforward analysis that we now present in Figure 6 (line 345-374).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure 7A: It is unclear which analysis was done. Is this simply giving 3 different colors to each pixel – indicating 1) precision &gt; baseline; 2) reach &gt; baseline 3) both &gt; baseline (for the left panel)? Why not performing straight (pair-wise) subtractions?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the analysis and the presentation of the results were both confusing. We replaced the analysis with pairwise comparisons using t-tests and cross-correlations (Figure 6, line 345-374).</p></body></sub-article></article>
