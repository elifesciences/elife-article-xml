However, the mechanisms that regulate heterochromatin spreading are not well understood. In this study, we show that the conserved Mst2 histone acetyltransferase complex in fission yeast regulates histone turnover at heterochromatin regions to control heterochromatin spreading and prevents ectopic heterochromatin assembly. The combined loss of Mst2 and the JmjC domain protein Epe1 results in uncontrolled heterochromatin spreading and massive ectopic heterochromatin, leading to severe growth defects due to the inactivation of essential genes. Interestingly, these cells quickly recover by accumulating heterochromatin at genes essential for heterochromatin assembly, leading to their reduced expression to restrain heterochromatin spreading. Our studies discover redundant pathways that control heterochromatin spreading and prevent ectopic heterochromatin assembly and reveal a fast epigenetic adaptation response to changes in heterochromatin landscape.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06179.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06179.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06179.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA in the nucleus of a cell is wrapped around histone proteins to form a compact structure known as chromatin. Chromatin's structure can control how the genes in DNA are expressed. Loosely packed chromatin contains active genes, whereas densely packed chromatin (also called ‘heterochromatin’) contains silenced genes that are not expressed. The assembly of DNA into heterochromatin needs to be carefully controlled. Otherwise, the DNA next to heterochromatin regions can become densely packed as well (via a process called ‘heterochromatin spreading’), and the genes within this DNA are incorrectly silenced. Incorrect gene silencing is often associated with diseases such as cancer.</p><p>Cells add chemical groups onto the histone proteins to influence how chromatin is compacted. Densely packed chromatin contains histones with many methyl groups but few acetyl groups. A protein called Epe1, which potentially removes methyl groups, helps to prevent heterochromatin spreading in yeast cells. Wang et al. found that an enzyme called Mst2, which adds acetyl groups onto histones, also limits heterochromatin spreading and prevents extra heterochromatin from assembling at undesirable locations.</p><p>Wang et al. then generated yeast cells that lacked both Epe1 and Mst2. At first, these cells were sickly and unable to grow, because several essential genes were incorrectly silenced due to rampant heterochromatin spreading. However, the cells quickly overcame this growth defect by gaining an additional mutation. Normally mutations occur through changes in DNA sequences. However, Wang et al. found that the cells acquired this mutation by packing a gene required for heterochromatin assembly into heterochromatin. This in turn stopped more chromatin from becoming packed too densely. Changes to chromatin can also be passed on to the yeast's offspring, and such a change could help the offspring to better cope with changes in heterochromatin levels. Future work could test how often inheritable changes to chromatin modification help organisms adapt to environmental stresses, or if similar changes allow cancer cells to become tolerant to anticancer drugs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06179.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06179.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>spreading</kwd><kwd>epigenetic adaptation</kwd><kwd>mst2</kwd><kwd>epe1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM085145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Songtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM008798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reddy</surname><given-names>Bharat D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Redundant pathways prevent heterochromatin spreading and ectopic heterochromatin assembly; and plasticity of heterochromatin assembly allows cells to adapt to heterochromatin stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic genomic DNA is folded with histones and non-histone proteins in the form of chromatin, which regulates every aspect of DNA metabolism, including transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA damage repair. Chromatin is classified into euchromatin, which is gene rich and actively transcribed, and heterochromatin, which is gene poor and highly compacted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grewal and Jia, 2007</xref>). Heterochromatin preferentially forms at repetitive DNA elements in order to limit transcription and recombination at these regions to maintain genome integrity. It also forms at developmentally regulated genes to regulate their expression in response to developmental cues and external stimuli. Heterochromatin tends to spread into neighboring regions, leading to the inactivation of genes in a sequence-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Talbert and Henikoff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the sites of heterochromatin formation and extent of heterochromatin spreading need to be tightly controlled to prevent improper gene silencing, and misregulation of heterochromatin assembly has been linked to many human diseases, especially various types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geutjes et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Heterochromatic regions generally have distinct chromatin signatures such as histones that are hypoacetylated and methylated at histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me), and the enrichment of HP1 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rea et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannister et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lachner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakayama et al., 2001</xref>). Formation of heterochromatin requires the concerted actions of a diverse group of histone-modifying proteins, such as H3K9 methyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs), and is divided into three distinct steps: establishment, spreading, and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grewal and Moazed, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rusche et al., 2003</xref>). Heterochromatin is established at nucleation centers through the targeting of histone-modifying activities by transcription factors or non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen and Jia, 2014</xref>). Subsequently, heterochromatin spreads into neighboring regions, mostly via a network of interactions among chromatin proteins, resulting in the formation of large heterochromatin domains independent of the underlying DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Talbert and Henikoff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen and Jia, 2014</xref>). Once these domains are formed, they can maintain themselves also through interactions among chromatin proteins even in the absence of the initiation signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moazed, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ragunathan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The formation of heterochromatin has been extensively studied in fission yeast, which uses highly conserved histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin proteins for heterochromatin assembly, such as the SUV39 family histone H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4, the HP1 homologue Swi6, and HDACs Sir2 and Clr3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grewal and Jia, 2007</xref>). There are four types of heterochromatin identified in fission yeast: constitutive heterochromatin at repeat regions such as centromeres, telomeres, and the silent mating-type region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grewal and Jia, 2007</xref>); facultative heterochromatin islands at a subset of meiotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiriart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zofall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tashiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Egan et al., 2014</xref>); HOODs (heterochromatin domains) at sexual differentiation genes and retrotransposons in response to the misregulation of the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamanaka et al., 2013</xref>); and transient heterochromatin at convergent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gullerova and Proudfoot, 2008</xref>). These locations use distinct pathways to recruit histone-modifying activities to form heterochromatin.</p><p>The establishment of constitutive heterochromatin at repetitive DNA elements requires the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, a phenomenon also vastly conserved in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moazed, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lejeune and Allshire, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castel and Martienssen, 2013</xref>). The DNA repeats are transcribed and the transcripts are processed by the RNAi machinery into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which target the Clr4 complex (CLRC, consisting of Clr4, Cul4, Rik1, Raf1, and Raf2) to repeat regions to initiate H3K9me. In addition, DNA binding factors, such as telomeric shelterin and stress-activated ATF/CREB family proteins Atf1/Pcr1, also directly recruit histone-modifying activities to establish constitutive heterochromatin at telomeres and the silent mating-type region, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tadeo et al., 2013</xref>). The formation of facultative heterochromatin islands at meiotic genes requires RNA binding protein Mmi1, Zinc finger protein Red1, and the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiriart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zofall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tashiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Egan et al., 2014</xref>). Mmi1 binds to RNA transcripts containing DSR (determinant of selective removal) sequences and recruits the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex and the Red1-Mtl1 complex, which directly interacts with Clr4 complex, to initiate H3K9me at meiotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harigaya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zofall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Egan et al., 2014</xref>). HOODs are formed at sexual differentiation genes and retrotransposons in response to exosome malfunction or changes in environmental conditions and requires RNAi, polyA polymerase Pla1, and PolyA binding protein Pab2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamanaka et al., 2013</xref>). Convergent genes generate overlapping transcripts during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which induce the formation of transient heterochromatin through the RNAi pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gullerova and Proudfoot, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The spreading of heterochromatin requires Swi6 and the chromodomain of Clr4, both of which bind to H3K9me and position Clr4 to methylate neighboring nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hall et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Sady et al., 2013</xref>). The reiteration of H3K9 methylation and recruitment of Clr4 by H3K9me, either directly through the chromodomain or indirectly through Swi6, results in the ‘inch-worm’-like spreading of heterochromatin from nucleation centers into large chromosome domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Talbert and Henikoff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Some heterochromatin regions are flanked by DNA sequences termed boundary elements, which block heterochromatin spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In other cases, heterochromatin borders are determined by the local balance of heterochromatin and euchromatin proteins, which tends to differ between cells. Therefore, precise regulation of heterochromatin spreading is essential to maintain stable gene expression profiles.</p><p>One of the best-known negative regulators of heterochromatin spreading is Epe1 as <italic>epe1∆</italic> results in heterochromatin spreading beyond its normal boundaries as well as ectopic heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trewick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zofall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ragunathan et al., 2014</xref>). Loss of Epe1 also bypasses RNAi for pericentric heterochromatin assembly by strengthening heterochromatin spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trewick et al., 2007</xref>). Epe1 contains a JmjC domain, which is frequently associated with histone demethylase activity. Although no demethylase activity has been detected for Epe1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsukada et al., 2006</xref>), genetic evidence is consistent with Epe1 being a H3K9 demethylase and conserved catalytic residues are essential for Epe1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trewick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ragunathan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The Mst2 complex is similar in composition to budding yeast NuA3 and mammalian HBO1/MOZ/MORF complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). It is a highly specific histone H3K14 acetyltransferase that cooperates with Gcn5 to regulate global H3K14 acetylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nugent et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The formation of heterochromatin is negatively correlated with H3K14 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sugiyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Motamedi et al., 2008</xref>), and <italic>mst2∆</italic> bypasses the requirement of the RNAi pathway for pericentric heterochromatin assembly through modulating H3K14ac levels at heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reddy et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, <italic>mst2∆</italic> strengthens silencing at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gomez et al., 2005</xref>). These results suggest that Mst2 complex functions to antagonize heterochromatic silencing, although the mechanism by which it affects heterochromatin assembly is unknown. The ability to bypass RNAi requires ablating the enzymatic activity of the Mst2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reddy et al., 2011</xref>). It was proposed that Mst2-mediated H3K14 acetylation regulates histone turnover at heterochromatin regions and the loss of such activity preserves parental histone modifications to promote heterochromatin maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reddy et al., 2011</xref>), although the ability of Mst2 to regulate histone turnover has not been directly tested.</p><p>In this study, we show that Mst2 regulates histone turnover at heterochromatin regions and that loss of Mst2 results in heterochromatin spreading at telomeres and heterochromatin islands where boundaries are absent. We also found that <italic>mst2∆ epe1∆</italic> cells are initially very sick due to heterochromatin spreading-mediated inactivation of essential genes, suggesting that Mst2 and Epe1 function redundantly in regulating heterochromatin spreading.

In wild-type cells, H3K9me2 was mainly present at centromeres, telomeres, and the silent mating-type region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). There were also a few heterochromatic islands with low levels of H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although less heterochromatic islands were identified compared to a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zofall et al., 2012</xref>), our results are consistent with that of an earlier one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cam et al., 2005</xref>).

However, the quick generation of epigenetic suppressors in <italic>mst2∆ epe1∆*</italic> cells prevented us from directly testing the reason for the initial growth defects. Because H3K9me functions upstream of Swi6 localization and the silencing function of H3K9me requires Swi6, we reasoned that examining H3K9me2 levels in <italic>mst2∆ epe1∆ swi6∆</italic> cells might show the misregulation of heterochromatin assembly that resembles early stages <italic>mst2∆ epe1∆</italic> cells. Indeed, in <italic>mst2∆ epe1∆ swi6∆</italic> cells, the H3K9me2 domains at constitutive heterochromatin regions such as centromeres showed significant expansion, even when boundary elements are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).

The spreading of heterochromatin requires Swi6 as well as the chromodomain of Clr4, which binds to pre-existing H3K9me to allow the modification of adjacent nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hall et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Sady et al., 2013</xref>). Our data that <italic>mst2∆ epe1∆ swi6∆</italic> allows normal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) is consistent with such a hypothesis. However, Swi6 is required for heterochromatin spreading as well as heterochromatin-mediated silencing, making it difficult to definitively assess the contribution of heterochromatin spreading in this process. We therefore tested a mutation within the Clr4 chromodomain, W31G, which affects the binding of Clr4 to H3K9me to block heterochromatin spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, <italic>mst2∆ epe1∆ clr4-W31G</italic> cells showed no initial growth defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and heterochromatin expansion is prevented as indicated by ChIP analysis of H3K9me2 levels outside of centromere I boundary and at the <italic>mei4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ectopic heterochromatin at the <italic>clr4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> locus promotes adaption of <italic>mst2Δ epe1Δ</italic> cells</title><p>ChIP–chip analysis also showed that the patterns and levels of H3K9me2 in <italic>mst2∆ epe1∆*</italic> cells were more similar to those in wild-type cells with high levels of H3K9me2 at constitutive heterochromatic regions and low levels of H3K9me2 at heterochromatic islands, and much less heterochromatin spreading compared with <italic>mst2∆ epe1∆ swi6∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).

The distribution of H3K9me2 is on the whole similar to that of <italic>mst2∆ epe1∆*</italic> cells, with two major exceptions.

Second, an additional peak of H3K9me2 appeared at a 7-kb region that includes two genes in convergent orientation: <italic>rik1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>, which encodes a component of the Clr4 complex and is required for Clr4 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakayama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jia et al., 2005</xref>), and an uncharacterized gene <italic>SPCC11E10.09c</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H,I</xref>).

Therefore, Mst2 and Epe1 are likely evolved to counteract such a hyperactive H3K9 methyltransferase. Clr4 has an arginine at residue 406, which corresponds to a histidine in its mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Conversion of the histidine to arginine (H320R) makes mammalian SUV39H1 a hyperactive histone methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rea et al., 2000</xref>).

Therefore, the sites of heterochromatin assembly and the extent of heterochromatin spreading are generally precisely controlled to maintain stable gene expression patterns. In addition to the diverse pathways that accurately initiate heterochromatin assembly, anti-silencing activities also play essential roles in limiting heterochromatin spreading to shape the chromatin landscape.</p><p>Our results reveal a novel function of the Mst2 complex in regulating histone turnover at heterochromatin regions to counteract heterochromatin spreading. Loss of Mst2 bypasses the requirement of RNAi for pericentric heterochromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reddy et al., 2011</xref>), increases heterochromatin spreading and silencing at telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gomez et al., 2005</xref>), and increases the efficiency of ectopic heterochromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ragunathan et al., 2014</xref>), which is phenotypically very similar to <italic>epe1∆</italic>. Biochemically, the Mst2 complex is a highly specific histone H3K14 acetyltransferase and mutations resulting in the loss of its enzymatic activity, such as <italic>mst2-E274Q</italic> or <italic>nto1∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), also resulted in slow growth when combined with <italic>epe1∆</italic>, suggesting that its enzymatic activity is required for counteracting silencing. <italic>H3K14</italic> mutants have a direct effect on heterochromatin assembly independent of its acetylation state, making it difficult to directly address whether H3K14 is the only target of Mst2 in regulating heterochromatin spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mellone et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reddy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alper et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, it remains possible that Mst2 modifies heterochromatin assembly factors to regulate histone turnover and counteract silencing.</p><p>Our results also revealed the functional redundancy of Mst2 and Epe1 in regulating heterochromatin spreading, which explains why heterochromatin spreading only occurs in a small population of cells and requires the overexpression of Swi6 to be efficiently detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In the absence of both Mst2 and Epe1, heterochromatin spreading increases significantly, leading to the inactivation of essential genes and severe growth defects. Such strong survival pressure results in the selection of cells that can establish heterochromatin at the <italic>clr4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> locus, leading to reduced transcription of <italic>clr4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> and decreased Clr4 protein levels, thus allowing cells to reach a new equilibrium where heterochromatin assembly at regular locations is intact while the negative effects of heterochromatin spreading are mitigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although we cannot test the epigenetic profiles of individual cells, it is possible that <italic>mst2Δ epe1Δ</italic> cells initially generate varied epigenetic profiles, and only cells containing H3K9me at the <italic>meu6-clr4</italic> locus are clonally selected due to its beneficial effects on cell growth. The quick generation of this epigenetic suppressor also benefited from the stabilization of ectopic heterochromatin domains in <italic>mst2∆ epe1∆</italic> cells. Once established, such ectopic heterochromatin can be inherited, but can also be quickly erased to allow cells to adapt to new conditions. Interestingly, when H3K9me at the <italic>clr4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> locus is blocked, the survival pressure instead selects cells that can establish heterochromatin at the <italic>rik1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> locus to similarly reduce heterochromatin-forming abilities. The flexibility in heterochromatin assembly allows cells and their subsequent generations to efficiently cope with changes in heterochromatin levels.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06179.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model of the negative feedback of heterochromatin assembly.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06179.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06179.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06179-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>The formation of heterochromatin at the <italic>clr4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> locus does not employ any of the known heterochromatin assembly pathways. The intact 3’-UTR region of <italic>clr4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> seems to initiate heterochromatin through a novel mechanism, although such a mechanism must be very inefficient in wild-type cells given that no H3K9me is observed. It is interesting to note that the 3′-UTR of <italic>clr4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> overlaps the entire <italic>meu6</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> gene, which is arranged in a convergent orientation. The expression of <italic>meu6</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> is extremely low during vegetative growth, but is upregulated during meiosis, which might interfere with Clr4 expression, resulting in the loss of heterochromatin islands as seen in cells under conditions that induce meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zofall et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It has long been known that heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast is tightly regulated to prevent promiscuous heterochromatin assembly. For example, the amount of heterochromatin proteins such as Swi6 is limiting, and ectopic heterochromatin assembly can only succeed when Swi6 is overexpressed or when endogenous heterochromatin structures are compromised to release silencing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kagansky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tadeo et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, sub-telomeric heterochromatin regions, which contain no boundaries and no essential genes, can serve as ‘sinks’ to absorb extra heterochromatin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tadeo et al., 2013</xref>). These extensive pathways that limit heterochromatin assembly might be a response to the high enzymatic activity of Clr4, which is likely required for heterochromatin assembly in an otherwise highly compact and active genome. Our results provide an additional layer of control for cells to monitor heterochromatin levels through a negative feedback mechanism that uses the potentially promiscuous nature of heterochromatin assembly to induce heterochromatin formation at genes encoding heterochromatin assembly factors, thus ensuring the epigenetic stability of the genome.</p><p>Our results fit into a growing body of evidence demonstrating that epigenetic regulation of gene expression enables cells to adopt a wide variety of phenotypes to adapt to external or internal stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heard and Martienssen, 2014</xref>). Compared to genetic mutations, epigenetic mutations provide much faster responses. Most importantly, the effects are reversible, allowing easy reversion to normal epigenetic profiles when external stimuli disappear. In cancer cells, such epigenetic variations might result in the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes during tumorigenesis and might also enable tumor cells to survive certain therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kreso et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, our work sheds light on the mechanisms underlying how a relatively stable heterochromatic profile is maintained both under normal conditions and upon heterochromatin stress and will guide future efforts to combat epigenetic adaptations that interfere with cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fission yeast strains and genetic analyses</title><p>Detailed genotypes of strains used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>.

Your manuscript was reviewed by three experts in the field and by a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors (BRE). The detailed reviews for your manuscript are included at the end of this letter. After a full discussion of the study and the reviews, we are happy to report that the reviewers and the BRE member found the study of interest to the journal and therefore we are happy to consider a revised manuscript. As you will see from the reviewers' comments, there are several minor points to be considered and need to be addressed. Also, the third reviewer has suggested 5 points under his/her major concerns. Upon discussion, we do not require you to address these points for publication, however, if you have data that can clarify the reviewers concerns, we suggest including such new data in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>In this study Wang et al. describe a role for the conserved Mst2 histone acetyltransferase in regulation of heterochromatin spreading and inhibition of ectopic heterochromatin in fission yeast. In addition, they discover that the combined loss of Mst2 and Epe1 results in uncontrolled heterochromatin spreading and the formation of ectopic heterochromatin leading to inactivation of essential genes. Most importantly, their results reveal an epigenetic adaptation mechanism that can lead to the inactivation of heterochromatic genes such as <italic>clr4</italic> and <italic>rik1</italic> in <italic>mst2 epe1</italic> double mutant cells that allows these cells to survive.</p><p>This is an exciting and important study that provides insight into the role of anti-silencing modifications in control of heterochromatin spreading. The results on adaptation of cells to loss of Mst2 and Epe1 are particularly interesting and reveal epigenetic, rather than genetic, inactivation as a major survival strategy in response to inappropriate heterochromatin spreading.

Interestingly, the loss of Mst2 has similar phenotype in heterochromatin assembly as the loss of the anti-silencing factor Epe1. Further analysis revealed that the combined loss of Mst2 and Epe1 anti-silencing factors leads to widespread H3K9mehtyulation and growth defects due to gene inactivation.
