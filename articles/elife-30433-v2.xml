In a xenograft model, depletion of <italic>LAST</italic> diminished and ectopic expression of <italic>LAST</italic> induced tumor formation, which are suggestive of its oncogenic function. We thus report a previously unknown lncRNA involved in the fine-tuned regulation of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA stability, without which <italic>CCND1</italic> exhibits, at most, partial expression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30433.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cell division involves a series of steps in which the cell grows, duplicates its contents, and then divides into two. Together these steps are called the cell cycle, and the transition between each step must be controlled to make sure that events take place in the right order. Any loss of control can cause cells to divide in an unrestrained manner, which may lead to cancer.</p><p>Proteins called cyclins control progression through the cell cycle. As such, these proteins need to be produced in the correct amounts and at the correct times. Transcription factors are proteins that switch genes on or off to help regulate how much protein is made from those genes. A transcription factor known as c-Myc regulates the expression of the genes that encode the cyclins. Among these genes, one called <italic>CCND1</italic> is particularly important because it encodes a protein that controls a crucial transition in the cell cycle: it marks a ‘point of no return’, beyond which cells are committed to dividing.</p><p>When a transcription factor switches on a gene, the gene gets copied into a molecule of messenger RNA, which is then translated into protein. But, cells also contain genes that do not code for proteins. Transcription factors can bind to such non-coding genes, leading to the production of so-called long non-coding RNAs (often abbreviated to lncRNAs).</p><p>Many lncRNAs can affect the expression of other genes. Cao, Zhang et al. have now asked whether any lncRNAs regulate <italic>CCND1</italic> in human cells. The analysis revealed that the transcription factor c-Myc promotes the expression of a previously unidentified lncRNA. Cao, Zhang et al. name this lncRNA <italic>LAST</italic>, which is officially short for LncRNA-assisted stabilization of transcripts, and show thatit makes the <italic>CCND1</italic> messenger RNA more stable. In other words, it makes the messenger RNAs ‘last’ longer in the cell. This in turn, ensures that the cell cycle progresses in the correct manner, allowing cells to complete their division. In the absence of <italic>LAST</italic>, the <italic>CCND1</italic> messenger RNA becomes unstable and as a result the cell cycle does not progress.</p><p>Cao, Zhang et al. then explored the role of <italic>LAST</italic> in cancer cells. When human colon cancer cells that expressed <italic>LAST</italic> were implanted into mice, they formed tumors. Yet, reducing the expression of <italic>LAST</italic> in the colon cancer cells made the tumors grow slower.</p><p>Future challenges will be to understand how <italic>LAST</italic> makes messenger RNAs stable and further explore its role in cancer. A better understanding of this molecule could reveal whether it can be used to help doctors diagnose or treat cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LAST</kwd><kwd>CNBP</kwd><kwd>CCND1</kwd><kwd>mRNA stability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFC1302302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Mian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81430065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Mian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31371388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Mian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A c-Myc-transcribed long noncoding RNA namely <italic>LAST</italic> (LncRNA-assisted stabilization of transcripts) collaborates with a cellular factor CNBP to promote the stability of <italic>CCND1</italic>/<italic>cyclin D1</italic> mRNA post-transcriptionally, ensuring the proper G1/Sphase transition of the cell cycle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The oncoprotein c-Myc plays a pivotal role in multiple cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, malignant transformation, differentiation suppression and apoptosis induction, predominantly through its transcription activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seth et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drayton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demeterco et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prendergast, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amati et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoffman and Liebermann, 2008</xref>). Indeed, as a master transcriptional factor, c-Myc regulates the expression of approximately 10–15% of genes in the genome, including a variety of protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2003</xref>), such as <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, <italic>CDKN2B</italic>, <italic>CCND1, CCND2, CDK4</italic> and <italic>E2F2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikary and Eilers, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Among c-Myc target genes, <italic>CCND1</italic> is of particular importance in cell cycle control and is characterized by the dramatic periodicity of the abundance of its protein product cyclin D1 throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sherr, 1995</xref>). Cyclin D1 forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6 and functions as a regulatory subunit whose activity is required for G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sherr, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Resnitzky et al., 1994</xref>). Cyclin D1 also interacts with the tumor suppressor pRB1, which in turn positively regulates cyclin D1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeGregori, 2004</xref>). Mutation, amplification and overexpression of <italic>CCND1</italic> are frequently observed in cancer and have been reported to contribute to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiestner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elsheikh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Musgrove et al., 2011</xref>). Cyclin D1 is a short-lived protein with a rapid turnover rate (~24 min) due to degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diehl et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diehl et al., 1997</xref>). While early studies showed that the Skp2 F-box protein is involved in cyclin D1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu et al., 1998</xref>), a recent study has identified two additional F-box proteins that play important roles in targeting cyclin D1 for proteasome degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okabe et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>c-Myc can upregulate or downregulate expression of cyclin D1 in a context-dependent manner. On the one hand, c-Myc, together with Max, a co-transcription factor, activates <italic>CCND1</italic> transcription through an E box located at −558 nt in its promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kress et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, simultaneous overexpression of c-Myc and ZO-2 enhances repression of the <italic>CCND1</italic> promoter through the E box in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gonzalez-Mariscal et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, c-Myc has been reported to repress the cyclin DI promoter and antagonize USF-mediated transactivation in BALB/c-3T3, Rat6 and rat embryo fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Philipp et al., 1994</xref>). In addition to c-Myc, multiple transcription factors, including AP-1, NF-κB, E2F and Oct-1, can bind to their respective <italic>CCND1</italic> promoters and regulate its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>CCND1</italic> can also be regulated epigenetically through histone modifications; GATA3 cooperates with PARP1 to regulate <italic>CCND1</italic> transcription by modulating histone H1 incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shan et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, post-transcriptional mechanisms are also involved in the regulation of <italic>CCND1</italic>, as exemplified by MYF5-mediated enhancement in <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA translation, which contributes to early myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Panda et al., 2016</xref>). Mutations in <italic>CCND1</italic> leading to stable truncated transcripts are associated with increased cell proliferation and shortened survival of cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiestner et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are defined as transcripts that are longer than 200 nucleotides and lack protein coding capacity, are emerging as important regulators of biological processes, including regulation of gene expression at multiple levels, such as chromatin remodeling, transcription, and post-transcriptional modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derrien et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iorio and Croce, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonasio and Shiekhattar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilusz et al., 2008</xref>). Genome-wide studies have shown that c-Myc transcriptionally regulates many lncRNA genes, such as <italic>PVT1</italic>, the CCAT family, and MYCLos, whereas a number of lncRNAs have been demonstrated to be important components of the c-Myc-mediated signaling network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colombo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nissan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2015b</xref>). Nevertheless, whether lncRNAs participate in the regulation of <italic>CCND1</italic> remains to be fully studied.</p><p>Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the novel c-Myc regulated <italic>LAST</italic>, which acts as a <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA stabilizer and without which <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA becomes unstable and cell cycle arrest occurs in the G1 phase. Mechanistically, <italic>LAST</italic> cooperates with CNBP, a single-stranded DNA/RNA-binding factor, to bind to the 5’ untranslated region of <italic>CCND1</italic> messenger RNA, possibly to protect against nuclease degradation.

A band of approximately 700 nt in length was detected in both P493-6 and H1299 cells, but was absent in P493-6 cells treated with doxycycline, which suppresses c-Myc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The apparent size of <italic>LAST</italic> was the same as predicted by the UCSC (University of California, Santa Cruz) Genome Browser, suggesting that <italic>LAST</italic> is a full-length transcript. To investigate the cellular compartment in which <italic>LAST</italic> is located, single molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed in both HCT116 and H1299 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <italic>LAST</italic> was predominantly localized in the cytosol. Cytosol localization of <italic>LAST</italic> was also confirmed by determining the levels of <italic>LAST</italic> in different sub-cellular fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Moreover, the signal intensity of <italic>LAST</italic> was reduced in <italic>LAST</italic>-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It has been reported that lncRNAs are often present at relatively low copy numbers; hence, we measured the <italic>LAST</italic> transcript copy number per cell in various cell lines, including the normal cell lines HAFF, IMR90, and MCF10A and tumor cell lines HCT116, MCF7 and H1299. The <italic>LAST</italic> copy number was higher in tumor cells than in normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>Lentivirus-mediated gene knockdown of c-Myc decreased whereas ectopic expression of c-Myc increased <italic>LAST</italic> expression in HCT116, H1299 and MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). Furthermore, the levels of LAST and c-Myc appeared to be notably synchronous during cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In particular, the c-Myc and <italic>LAST</italic> levels were decreased in G2/M (lane 2), followed by a rapid increase in the G1 phase (lane 3). These data suggest that <italic>LAST</italic> expression is positively regulated by c-Myc.</p><p>We next explored whether c-Myc regulates <italic>LAST</italic> expression at the transcriptional level. We first inspected the genomic sequence around the <italic>LAST</italic> gene using the JASPAR database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mathelier et al., 2016</xref>). Six putative c-Myc binding sites (BS1, BS2, BS3, BS4, BS5 and BS6) were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, upper panel). Furthermore, we analyzed the genomic sequence around the <italic>LAST</italic> gene using the ENCODE database. Three fragments (F1, F2 and F3) were predicted to be recognized by c-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, upper panel). The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay determined the association of c-Myc with chromatin fragments corresponding to the BS2 and BS3 sites (within F2 fragment) among all examined fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, lower panel). We further evaluated whether BS2 and BS3 conferred c-Myc-dependent transcriptional activity. DNA fragments containing wild-type BS2 and BS3 or their corresponding mutant binding sites were inserted into the promoter region of a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, upper panel). Luciferase expression from the reporter containing an individual BS2 or BS3 site was indeed induced by ectopic expression of c-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, lower panel). By contrast, mutant BS2M and BS3M sites showed no response to c-Myc induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, lower panel).

The levels of both <italic>CCND1</italic> pre-mRNA and mature mRNA were examined by primers against <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA intron- or exon-specific regions in HCT116 cells treated with and without <italic>LAST</italic> knockdown. The levels of <italic>CCND1</italic> pre-mRNA containing four intronic regions were found to remain unaltered between control and <italic>LAST</italic> knockdown cells, whereas the levels of mature spliced <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA containing 5’UTR, CDS (coding sequences) and 3’UTR regions were greatly reduced upon <italic>LAST</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>LAST</italic> may post-transcriptionally regulate <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA. To evaluate the effect of <italic>LAST</italic> on the stability of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA, HCT116 cells were treated with actinomycin D, which measures the decay of pre-existing mRNA. Knockdown of <italic>LAST</italic> resulted in a decrease of the half-life of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA from 5 hr to 3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), whereas over-expression of <italic>LAST</italic> increased its half-life from 5 hr to 9 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that <italic>LAST</italic> stabilizes <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA. To determine whether <italic>LAST</italic> interacts with <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA, we performed a biotinylated oligonucleotide pull-down assay, and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, endogenous <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA but not <italic>CCNB1</italic> mRNA co-precipitated with <italic>LAST</italic>, indicating an association between <italic>LAST</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA. However, by careful inspection, we found there was no complementary base pairing between <italic>LAST</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA. We therefore hypothesized that some protein(s) may mediate this binding. Proteins pulled down by <italic>LAST</italic> were separated by SDS PAGE, and a unique band with a molecular weight of approximately 20 kDa was revealed and identified as CNBP by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, left panel). CNBP has a preference for binding single-stranded DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flink and Morkin, 1995</xref>) and has been reported to function in the translation of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sammons et al., 2010</xref>). To validate the MS Spectro result, we performed a <italic>LAST</italic> pull-down assay. A biotin-labeled antisense DNA probe against <italic>LAST</italic> pulled down CNBP, but not cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, right panel). To further demonstrate that CNBP can bridge <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA and <italic>LAST</italic>, we first pulled down <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA using a biotinylated antisense DNA probe as bait; both CNBP and <italic>LAST</italic> were coprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The RIP assay further concluded that CNBP interacts with both <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA and <italic>LAST</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These data demonstrate that CNBP acts as a mediator for <italic>LAST</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA binding. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, CNBP knockdown in HCT116 led to a decrease in both the mRNA and protein levels of <italic>cyclin D1/CCND1</italic>. The effect of CNBP on the stability of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA was evaluated in HCT116 cells treated with actinomycin D. The half-life of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA was reduced from 5 hr to 3 hr as CNBP was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), further demonstrating that CNBP prolongs the <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA half-life. Because CNBP predominantly resides in the cytosol, we investigated whether the association of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA with <italic>LAST</italic> via CNBP only occurs in the cytosol. Using a <italic>LAST</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA pull-down assay, we found that CNBP was co-precipitated by either <italic>LAST</italic> or <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA in the cytoplasm, but not the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). HNRNPK was used as a nuclear marker. Moreover, knockdown of CNBP was shown to result in decreased levels of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Further investigation revealed that knockdown of CNBP affected the level of mature <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA, but not unspliced <italic>CCND1</italic> pre-mRNA, indicating that the protective role of CNBP in mature <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA stability occurred in the cytosol since nuclear unspliced <italic>CCND1</italic> pre-mRNA was not affected when CNBP was silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To further confirm that <italic>LAST</italic> affects <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA stability through CNBP, we knocked down CNBP in HCT116 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>, the increased expression of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA caused by over-expression of <italic>LAST</italic> was diminished when CNBP was depleted (lanes 2 vs. 4). Thus, our hypothesis is that <italic>LAST</italic> affects <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA via CNBP. Knockdown of <italic>LAST</italic> resulted in no change in CNBP at either the RNA or protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), which suggests that <italic>LAST</italic> affects <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA not according to the quantity of CNBP, but rather by the association of CNBP and <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA. It was therefore expected that knockdown of CNBP would reduce the association between <italic>LAST</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA. This was indeed the case. An RNA pull-down experiment was performed starting with the same amount of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA, and less <italic>LAST</italic> was co-precipitated as CNBP was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Similarly, when we pulled down the same amount of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA, less co-precipitated CNBP was detected as <italic>LAST</italic> was silenced. As a negative control, the RNA-binding protein HuR remained unchanged after <italic>LAST</italic> was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).

To further determine whether <italic>LAST</italic> and CNBP bind to the <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA 5’UTR to enhance its stability, two <italic>CCND1</italic> expression constructs were generated, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>.

By contrast, the half-life of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA bearing 5'-UTRs was extended from 4 hr in the absence of <italic>LAST</italic> and CNBP to 9 hr in the presence of <italic>LAST</italic> and CNBP, indicating that <italic>LAST</italic> and CNBP enhanced <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA stability via its 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We checked the proportion of G-rich motifs in all of the peak sequences from the CNBP RIP samples. Nearly sixty percent of the CNBP enriched sequences contained the GGAG motif, and more than ninety percent of the peak sequences contained a GGR motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To assess the possible CNBP binding sites on <italic>LAST</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA, the bioinformatics software tool QGRS Mapper was utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kikin et al., 2006</xref>). Two G-rich sequences containing a GGAG core in the 5’UTR of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, upper part). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed, and the results showed that G-rich-1 and G-rich-2 in the <italic>CCND1</italic> 5’UTR were responsible for the binding of CNBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, lower part). Among the six predicted G-rich sequences (G-rich-A to F) found in <italic>LAST</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, upper part), four G-rich sequences (G-rich-A, C, D and F) were found to contain a GGAG core. G-rich-A, C, D and F from <italic>LAST</italic> were able to bind CNBP, whereas neither G-rich-B nor G-rich-E was able to bind CNBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, lower part). Thus, CNBP only interacted with G-rich sequences that contained the GGAG core, but not those lacking the GGAG core. These data suggest that both <italic>CCND1</italic> and <italic>LAST</italic> interact with CNBP via their G-rich motifs containing the GGAG core. Four G-rich regions (A, C, D and F) were mutated from GGAG to UUUU with either a single mutation or four combined mutations in <italic>LAST</italic>. We found that over-expression of <italic>LAST</italic> containing only one site mutation led to an increase in the <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA level, whereas over-expression of <italic>LAST</italic> containing four G-rich site mutations nullified its effect on the <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). This result indicates that the effect of <italic>LAST</italic> on <italic>CCND1</italic> stability requires at least one of the four functional G-rich motifs. To define which domain of CNBP is responsible for binding <italic>LAST</italic> and the <italic>CCND1</italic> 5’UTR, a biotin-labeled RNA pull-down assay and deletion mapping were performed. According to the web site InterPro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunter et al., 2009</xref>), CNBP can be divided into four structural domains based on its zinc-finger arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>, we concluded that <italic>LAST</italic> binds to the CNBP fragment corresponding to amino acids 92–134 (domain 3), whereas the <italic>CCND1</italic> 5’UTR binds to the CNBP fragment corresponding to amino acids 29–134 (domain 2 + domain 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Pre- or mature <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA is regulated at different hierarchical levels bymultiple protein factors. Multiple classical transcriptional factors, such as c-Myc, E2F1, OCT1，RELA and c-Jun, have been reported to modulate <italic>CCND1</italic> at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2011</xref>). Epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanisms are also involved in the regulation of <italic>cyclin D1/CCND1</italic> (16, 29, 30). Moreover, Pitx2 and HuR, which belong to the same ribonucleoprotein complex, also control the decay rate of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gherzi et al., 2010</xref>). However, whether lncRNA(s) is (are) involved in the regulation of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA stability remains largely unaddressed. Very recently, NcRNA<sub>CCND1</sub> was reported to negatively regulate <italic>CCND1</italic> transcription by recruiting TLS to the <italic>CCND1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we characterized an overlooked mechanism of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA regulation. c-Myc induced-<italic>LAST</italic> cooperates with CNBP, by which <italic>LAST</italic> is guided to the 5’ untranslated region of <italic>CCND1</italic> messenger RNA and thus stabilizes <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The detailed mechanism underlying this 5’end protection requires further characterization.</p><p>Normal growth control depends on the architecture of precise cell cycle control, and disturbing any component of this network could result in neoplastic growth and tumorigenesis. The G1/S transition is a major checkpoint in cell cycle progression, as it is a ‘point of no return’ beyond which cells are committed to dividing. Cyclin D1, along with its catalytically active partner CDK4, is a positive cell cycle regulator that advances the cell cycle from G1 to S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McKay et al., 2002</xref>). Instead of protein factors, in this study, we found a novel long noncoding RNA, <italic>LAST</italic>, that ensures normal cell cycle progression. Lacking this lncRNA causes cell cycle arrest at the G1/S stage due to decreased cyclin D1 and attenuates tumor growth. Both the <italic>LAST</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> expression levels are higher in most tumor tissues than in their corresponding normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Conceivably, <italic>LAST</italic> could be a potential target for new cancer therapeutics. However, a correlation between the expression levels of <italic>CCND1</italic> and <italic>LAST</italic> in the 15 tumor types examined was not found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In addition, there was no difference in survival when tumors were divided into those expressing high versus low <italic>CCND1</italic> or <italic>LAST</italic>. These results imply that the regulation of <italic>CCND1</italic> is more complicated than we had anticipated, and new functions of <italic>LAST</italic> need to be characterized.</p><p>CNBP encodes a nucleic-acid binding protein that has seven zinc-finger domains and a preference for binding single-stranded DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flink and Morkin, 1995</xref>). Previous studies have shown that CNBP acts on cap-independent translation of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sammons et al., 2010</xref>) and also functions in sterol-mediated transcriptional regulation as well as c-Myc transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajavashisth et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murphy et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we found that CNBP possesses a new function. CNBP is able to guide lncRNA to bind to the 5’UTR of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA, acting as a mediator between <italic>LAST</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA.</p><p>lncRNAs are able to regulate their genomic neighborhoods in cis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quinn and Chang, 2016</xref>). Examples of cis-acting lncRNAs include enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Santa et al., 2010</xref>), imprinted lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mancini-Dinardo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sleutels et al., 2002</xref>) and dosage compensation lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conrad and Akhtar, 2012</xref>). Homo sapiens <italic>cyclin D1/CCND1</italic> and <italic>LAST</italic> are both located on chromosome 11, and the two genes are 1.8 Mb apart and in the same transcriptional direction (+strand). It is interesting to note that although <italic>CCND1</italic> and <italic>LAST</italic> are both subjected to positive transcriptional regulation by c-Myc, they do not share the same promoter. Rather, <italic>CCND1</italic> and <italic>LAST</italic> are transcribed separately by c-Myc via their respective promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6H</xref>). The relatively long distance between the <italic>CCND1</italic> and <italic>LAST</italic> genes may preclude their direct interaction. Moreover, <italic>LAST</italic> was shown to borrow a trans-acting factor, CNBP, as a mediator to connect the 5’UTR of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA and itself, thus affecting <italic>CCND1/cyclin D1</italic> expression in trans. Without CNBP, <italic>LAST</italic> shows no effect on CCND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), further supporting the concept that <italic>LAST</italic> does not regulate CCND1 in cis. Therefore, co-location of <italic>CCND1</italic> and <italic>LAST</italic> on the same chromosome appears to be a random event.</p><p>In summary, our findings from this investigation have uncovered a novel, c-Myc-induced, long non-coding RNA, <italic>LAST</italic>. The <italic>LAST</italic> gene is encoded physically on the same chromosome as <italic>CCND1</italic>. Normally, <italic>LAST</italic> interacts with CNBP, a RNA binding protein, by which it is guided towards the 5’UTR of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA, leading to the stabilization of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA, which in turn ensures orderly cell cycle progression. In the case of <italic>LAST</italic> dysregulation, <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA becomes unstable, resulting in decreased cyclin D1, inevitably causing cell cycle arrest and stoppage of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). This is a novel mechanism for <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA regulation. Based on the importance of cyclin D1 in proliferative control and its ability to promote oncogenic transformation, this finding provides new insight into the complexity of the regulatory network underlying the mechanistic regulation of <italic>cyclin D1/CCND1</italic>. Moreover, this <italic>LAST</italic>/CNBP regulatory mode can be applied to other genes; three different mRNAs, <italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>NFE2L1</italic> and <italic>PDF,</italic> were identified with half-lives that were prolonged by <italic>LAST</italic>/CNBP. The lack of similarity between human <italic>LAST</italic> and transcripts of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> also precludes using mouse c-Myc-driven tumor models to further clarify the significance of the <italic>LAST</italic> in c-Myc-mediated cell cycle regulation and tumor growth in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>The following antibodies were used for western blot analysis in this study: anti-c-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-GAPDH and anti-β-Actin (CMC-TAG); normal rabbit IgG, normal mouse IgG<sub>2a</sub>, anti-HUR, anti-cyclin D1, anti-CNBP and anti-NADSYN1 (Santa Cruz); anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich); anti-cyclin E1, anti-CDK2, and anti-CDK4 (ImmunoWay Biotechnology Company); anti-HNRNPK (ABclonal); anti-DHCR7 (ABCAM).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Cao and colleagues describe the function of a lncRNA that they name lncRNA-CCDN1. It is transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc and necessary for cell cycle progression. The authors found that lncRNA-CCDN1 promotes the stability of CCDN1 mRNA by binding to it through the protein CNBP. They finally show that lncRNA-CCDN1 is upregulated in some cancers, and its downregulation inhibits tumor growth in xenografts.</p><p>The authors make a quite convincing case for the claim that lncRNA-CCND1 post-transcriptionally regulates the accumulation in the cytoplasm of the CCND1 RNA. The experiments are performed overall to a high standard, and since there are few convincing reports of lncRNAs regulating mRNA stability in the cytoplasm, this study is of high interest to the lncRNA community and the broader audience interested in gene regulation. However, some aspects need clarification and improvement prior to decision on publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The name of the lncRNA is not appropriate. Since the authors show that exogenous over-expression of lncRNA-CCND1 is sufficient for regulation of CCND1, and a rescue experiment with shRNA-insensitive lncRNA-CCND1, this lncRNA appears to act in trans. Therefore, the localization of lncRNA-CCND1 and CCND1 on the same chromosome is inconsequential, and since there is no evidence for direct pairing between the two RNA molecules, it’s also not clear that CCND1 is the main target of lncRNA-CCND1. There is no justification for the lncRNA-CCND1 name and the authors should choose a more appropriate one.</p><p>2) The authors should check the effect of the shRNA knockdown of lncRNA-CCND1 on the two adjacent genes DHCR7 and NADSYN1.</p><p>3) Because the sequence of the lncRNA is composed mostly of transposable elements, there is a concern about the specificity of the FISH probe, which does not appear to be listed in the supplementary materials. The authors should provide the sequence and show specificity of the signal using their shRNA KD cells, and to also show that the RNA is cytoplasmic in their subcellular fractionation data.</p><p>4) The TCGA analysis is lacking – its currently showing data from just two tumor types. They authors should show a comparison of normal and tumor expression levels for lncRNA-CCND1 in all the solid tumors in which TCGA has data (~15 tumor types), and show the same comparison for CCND1 levels, as well as the correlation between CCND1, MYC and lncRNA-CCND1 expression levels in each tumor type. If tumors are divided into those expressing high versus low cyclin D1 or lncRNA-CCND1, is there a difference in survival (Kaplan Meier plots).</p><p>5) The authors show some CLIP-seq data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, but it’s not described at all and not used in the rest of the study. They should describe in detail how these data were obtained and what is their quality. Do they see CLIP peaks on CCND1 and lncRNA-CCND1? Do they see G-rich motifs in the CLIP peaks when considering the whole transcriptome? If the data is not of proper quality, it is best to leave it out of the manuscript.</p><p>6) The analysis of the transcripts that are both bound by CNBP and changed upon lincRNA KD should be part of the results and not the discussion. This part of the analysis is incomplete and the conclusions are not fully supported by the data. Is the overlap significantly higher than expected by chance? How many of the 10 mRNAs have different half-lifes following lincRNA-CCND1 KD and overexpression? Without these data the claim that this lincRNA can regulate other transcripts in the same way is not supported.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;LAST, a c-Myc-inducible long noncoding RNA, cooperates with CNBP to promote CCND1 mRNA stability in human cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) It is not clear how the RIP-seq experiment was done – the authors refer to Yang et al., (2014), but it has RIP qRT-PCR and not RIP-seq. It is not clear if any digestion of the RNA following IP is performed. If there is no digestion – how can the authors conclude from it where CNBP is binding the CCND1 mRNA? If there is no digestion, then the peaks merely correspond to regions that are resistant to degradation, and it’s not surprising that they G/C-rich.</p><p>2) The manuscript still needs very extensive language editing. Sentences like &quot;In addition, c-Myc has been reported to repress transcription of CCND1 mediated by core elements of the CCND1 promoter but not MAX when expression of human Myc in BALB/c-3T3 cells, Rat6 cells and rat embryo fibroblasts.&quot; (from the Introduction) are not comprehendible. Other examples: &quot;was particularly attracted our attention&quot;, &quot;G1-relevant cyclins and CDKs genes&quot;, &quot;To further confirm that LAST affect CCND1 mRNA stability is through CNBP&quot;, &quot;It is therefore expected that knockdown of CNBP will reduced the association between LAST and CCND1 mRNA&quot;, &quot;The exact reason for LAST or 5-'UTR involved in choosing the CNBP domain(s) for association is not clear at this moment&quot;, &quot;Three mRNAs namely <italic>SOX9, NFE2L1</italic> and <italic>PDF</italic> as the same as CCND1&quot;, &quot;Six weeks after cells expressing shRNA injection or three weeks after cells expressing lncRNA injection, Due to the humane care for experimental animals,&quot;. These are just some of the examples. In present form, the article cannot be published in <italic>eLife</italic> without editing.</p><p>3) The lack of any anti-correlation between CCND1 and LAST across tumor samples, which should be discussed in the manuscript. It’s negative data, but important negative data, and so cannot be left out.</p><p>4) We cannot find the accession number for the mRNA-seq, microarray and RIP-seq results in the manuscript.

This also implies that the decrease inCCND1 mRNA by knockdown of LAST is not an off-target effect. We have added sentences in text (subsection “LAST promotes G1/S transition and upregulates cyclin D1/CCND1”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Because the sequence of the lncRNA is composed mostly of transposable elements, there is a concern about the specificity of the FISH probe, which does not appear to be listed in the supplementary materials.

Additionally, we performed a FISH experiment in H1299 cells expressing control shRNA, LAST shRNA-1 or -2 and found that the LAST signal intensity was markedly reduced in LAST depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data showed that this probe we used is specific for LAST. Furthermore, the cytosolic localization of LAST was also confirmed by a new sub-cellular fractionation experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>.

Both LAST and CCND1 expression levels were higher in the majority of tumor tissues relative to normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Sentences have been added in text to state this (subsection “LASTpromotes tumorigenesis”). However, the correlation between CCND1, Myc and LAST expression levels in 15 types of tumor examined was not found (Data are shown in below Table R1). In addition, there is no difference in survival when tumors are divided into those expressing high versus low cyclin D1 or LAST. As these results do not add significantly to the main message, we have not included them in the revised manuscript.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">TCGA Tumor Types</td><td valign="top">Pearson Correlation Coefficient (LAST-CCND1)</td><td valign="top">P value</td><td valign="top">Pearson Correlation Coefficient (LAST-Myc)</td><td valign="top">P value</td><td valign="top">Pearson Correlation Coefficient (CCND1- Myc)</td><td valign="top">P value</td><td valign="top">Sample Size</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">BLCA</td><td valign="top">0.028</td><td valign="top">0.567</td><td valign="top">-0.105</td><td valign="top">0.034</td><td valign="top">-0.08</td><td valign="top">0.107</td><td valign="top">408</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">BRCA</td><td valign="top">0.119</td><td valign="top">0</td><td valign="top">0.118</td><td valign="top">0</td><td valign="top">-0.069</td><td valign="top">0.023</td><td valign="top">1090</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CESC</td><td valign="top">0.089</td><td valign="top">0.122</td><td valign="top">-0.005</td><td valign="top">0.93</td><td valign="top">-0.044</td><td valign="top">0.445</td><td valign="top">304</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CHOL</td><td valign="top">-0.088</td><td valign="top">0.61</td><td valign="top">0.025</td><td valign="top">0.884</td><td valign="top">-0.187</td><td valign="top">0.274</td><td valign="top">36</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">COAD</td><td valign="top">-0.162</td><td valign="top">0.001</td><td valign="top">0.188</td><td valign="top">0</td><td valign="top">0.073</td><td valign="top">0.119</td><td valign="top">454</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ESCA</td><td valign="top">0.337</td><td valign="top">0</td><td valign="top">-0.132</td><td valign="top">0.094</td><td valign="top">0.021</td><td valign="top">0.788</td><td valign="top">161</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">HNSC</td><td valign="top">0.034</td><td valign="top">0.442</td><td valign="top">-0.068</td><td valign="top">0.131</td><td valign="top">-0.031</td><td valign="top">0.496</td><td valign="top">499</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">KIRC</td><td valign="top">0.008</td><td valign="top">0.845</td><td valign="top">0.037</td><td valign="top">0.399</td><td valign="top">0.091</td><td valign="top">0.037</td><td valign="top">530</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">LIHC</td><td valign="top">-0.047</td><td valign="top">0.366</td><td valign="top">-0.014</td><td valign="top">0.783</td><td valign="top">0.003</td><td valign="top">0.949</td><td valign="top">371</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">LUAD</td><td valign="top">-0.037</td><td valign="top">0.402</td><td valign="top">-0.061</td><td valign="top">0.169</td><td valign="top">-0.033</td><td valign="top">0.454</td><td valign="top">513</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">PAAD</td><td valign="top">-0.025</td><td valign="top">0.745</td><td valign="top">0.022</td><td valign="top">0.772</td><td valign="top">0.154</td><td valign="top">0.041</td><td valign="top">177</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">PRAD</td><td valign="top">-0.061</td><td valign="top">0.174</td><td valign="top">-0.048</td><td valign="top">0.29</td><td valign="top">-0.016</td><td valign="top">0.715</td><td valign="top">495</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">READ</td><td valign="top">-0.277</td><td valign="top">0</td><td valign="top">0.072</td><td valign="top">0.357</td><td valign="top">0.063</td><td valign="top">0.422</td><td valign="top">165</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">STAD</td><td valign="top">0.167</td><td valign="top">0.001</td><td valign="top">0.073</td><td valign="top">0.159</td><td valign="top">0.045</td><td valign="top">0.384</td><td valign="top">375</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">UCEC</td><td valign="top">0.024</td><td valign="top">0.58</td><td valign="top">-0.024</td><td valign="top">0.584</td><td valign="top">-0.049</td><td valign="top">0.25</td><td valign="top">543</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>BLCA (bladder urothelial carcinoma); BRCA (breast invasive carcinoma); CESC (cervical squamous cell carcinoma); CHOL (cholangiocarcinoma); COAD (colon adenocarcinoma); ESCA (esophageal carcinoma); HNSC (head and neck squamous carcinoma); KIRC (kidney renal clear cell carcinoma); LIHC (liver hepatocellular carcinoma); LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma); PAAD (pancreatic adenocarcinoma); PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma); READ (rectum adenocarcinoma); STAD (stomach adenocarcinoma); UCEC (uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors show some CLIP-seq data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, but it’s not described at all and not used in the rest of the study.

Because the sequencing depth of CNBP RIP-seq is 6 G, it is not enough to analyze the peaks on noncoding RNA. However, we have evaluated the enrichment efficiency of LAST and CCND1 in the RIP-seq samples. Both LAST and CCND1 were significantly enriched by CNBP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Furthermore, we checked the proportion of G-rich motifs in all peak sequences from CNBP RIP samples and found that nearly 60% of the CNBP enriched sequences contained GGAG core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which is in good agreement with what had been previously reported (1, 2).
