The effects of statistical gene–gene interactions on phenotypes have been used to assign genes to functional modules. However, directional, epistatic interactions, which reflect regulatory relationships between genes, have been challenging to map at large-scale. Here, we used combinatorial RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping to generate a large genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. We devised a method that combines genetic interactions on multiple phenotypes to reveal directional relationships. This network reconstructed the sequence of protein activities in mitosis. Moreover, it revealed that the Ras pathway interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, an interaction that we show is conserved in human cancer cells. Our study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing directional regulatory networks and provides a resource for the interpretation of functional consequences of genetic alterations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05464.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05464.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05464.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes encode instructions that control our physical characteristics, known as traits. Although some traits are controlled by the activity of a single gene, most traits are influenced by the activities of multiple genes.</p><p>The genes that influence a particular trait may work independently of each other. However, it is also possible for the genes to interact so that one gene may mask or amplify the effect of another gene. Although gene interactions were first described almost 100 years ago, it has been difficult to identify them and work out the direction of these interactions (i.e., does gene A affect gene B, or vice versa?).</p><p>Fischer, Sandmann et al. have now studied the interactions between the genes involved in 21 different traits of fruit fly cells. A technique called RNA interference was used to lower the expression of the genes in different combinations, which made it possible to analyze any changes in the traits that occurred when particular genes were not working properly. Fischer, Sandmann et al. took hundreds of thousands images of the cells and analyzed the changes in cell shape, cell size, cell division and other traits. Next, they developed a method to infer the directions of the interactions between individual pairs of genes from the data and then made a map of the genetic interactions for the traits.</p><p>This map was able to reconstruct the known order of activity of genes during cell division and other cell processes. Furthermore, it revealed previously unknown interactions between genes. For example, genes involved in the Ras signaling pathway—which promotes cell growth and is frequently mutated in human tumors—interacted with genes that encode a group of proteins called the SWI/SNF complex. This complex alters how DNA is packaged in cells to control the expression of genes, and these gene interactions may play an important role in the control of cell growth by Ras signaling.</p><p>The approach developed by Fischer, Sandmann et al. can shed light on the interactions between genes that produce complex traits of cells. In future, this approach might be helpful to find out which genetic differences between individuals alter the effectiveness of drug treatments, and the impact of using combinations of drugs to treat diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05464.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05464.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>genetic interaction</kwd><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>image-based phenotyping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boutros</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Systems Microscopy Network of Excellence</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CellNetworks Cluster of Excellence</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name><name><surname>Sandmann</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A systematic analysis of gene–gene dependencies using high-throughput imaging of cells detects causal and temporal relationships between genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genes display epistatic (genetic) interactions, whereby the presence of one genetic variant can mask, alleviate or amplify the phenotypic effect of other variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateson, 1907</xref>). Genetic interactions have profound effects during normal development and in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashworth et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Two genes show a genetic interaction if the phenotype of allele combinations (or double perturbations) is different from the expected combination of the individual phenotypes; this statistical definition of genetic interactions was introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fisher (1918)</xref>. Mathematically, Fisher defined a genetic interaction as an interaction term between genetic covariates in a (statistical) linear model for a phenotype. Genetic interactions occur, for example, when a cellular process is controlled by two parallel pathways: loss of gene products in one pathway are buffered, and only when the both pathways are disturbed, a phenotype is observed. Conversely, the phenotype of closely collaborating proteins, for example, in a protein complex, is often not further enhanced when more than one of its gene products are depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dixon et al., 2009</xref>). Systematic screens for genetic interactions have been performed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuldiner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costanzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryan et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nichols et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehner et al., 2006</xref>) and metazoan cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laufer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roguev et al., 2013</xref>). These approaches have successfully unravelled symmetric relationships, such as pathway and complex co-membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baryshnikova et al., 2013</xref>). However, the observation of a statistical genetic interaction implies no directionality between the genes: it does not take into account a possible order of relationships, for example, their temporal relation in a signalling cascade. Directionality is present if one gene product positively or negatively regulates the activity of the other, if its function temporally precedes that of the other, or if its function is a necessary requirement for the action of the other. Such directional genetic interactions were described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateson (1907)</xref>, and observing epistatic interactions between genes has been a powerful method to organise them into functional pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phillips, 2008</xref>). In special cases, for example, in which one of the two interrogated genes has no phenotype itself, it has been possible to infer directionality by comparing the gene–gene phenotype to the single gene phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drees et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">St Onge et al., 2007</xref>). However, in many cases genes that show genetic interactions have phenotypes themselves, and more general methods to predict directionalities have been lacking.</p><p>We report the largest map of multi-phenotype genetic interaction profiles in metazoan cells to date. Our map comprises 1367 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes implicated in cellular processes including signalling, chromatin and cell cycle regulation. We quantitatively scored 21 phenotypes in cultured cells using automated imaging. First, we inferred gene functions based on statistical genetic interactions, predicted protein complexes and clustered processes by similarity. Moreover, in a novel analytical approach, we employ the multivariate nature of the phenotypes to compute directional genetic interactions, and we show that they reveal the logical and temporal dependencies between functional modules. For example, we were able to reconstruct the temporal order in which protein complexes are active during mitosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate an epistatic relationship between Ras/MAPK signalling and SWI/SNF regulators of chromatin remodelling, which we confirmed in vivo. We demonstrate that directional genetic interactions can be identified at a large scale and mapped to other genomic data sets to identify regulatory relationships.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantitative genetic interactions by high-throughput imaging</title><p>We generated the largest map of multi-phenotype genetic interaction profiles in metazoan cells to date by co-depleting gene pairs by RNAi in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, high-throughput imaging of single-cell phenotypes, and modelling of gene–gene interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We selected 1367 genes implicated in key biological processes, that is, signalling, chromatin biology, cell cycle regulation and protein turnover control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Each of these 1367 target genes was tested against 72 query genes in all pairwise knockdown combinations (2 × 2 dsRNAs), following previously established approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laufer et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The 72 query genes were selected from an initial single-gene screen on the 1367 genes, to cover a range of phenotypes, processes and protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). After 5 days, cells were fixed and stained for DNA, α-tubulin, and Ser9-phosphorylated histone 3, a mitosis marker. Cells were imaged by automated whole-well fluorescence microscopy, and phenotypic features were extracted using an image analysis pipeline (see ‘Materials and methods’). On average, 15,962 cells were imaged and analysed per well. Single-cell measurements were aggregated into 328 cell population features per experiment such as cell number, mitotic index, nuclear and cellular area, and other descriptors of shape and morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). 162 features were highly reproducible between replicates, with Pearson correlation &gt;0.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Using a step-wise feature selection algorithm, we determined a subset of 21 features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>) that non-redundantly captured the range of phenotypes.

Collectively, the phenotypes provided a broad overview of biological processes that impact cell proliferation and growth, cell shape and cell cycle regulation. For example, depletion of <italic>ida</italic>, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), led to an increased mitotic index as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bentley et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, cell number and mitotic index decreased upon depletion of <italic>stg</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CDC25 ortholog required for mitotic progression, which resulted in enlarged cells with large nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edgar and O'Farrell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui and Doe, 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Arpc1</italic>, a core member of the actin-related protein Arp2/3 complex, led to elongated, spindle-like cell morphologies detected by an increase in cell eccentricity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Machesky et al., 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, the measured phenotypes reflect known biological functions.</p><p>All 98,424 pairwise knockdown combinations of these 1367 target genes and the 72 query genes were tested four times each (2 × 2 dsRNAs). We filtered out genes with suboptimal dsRNAs (low efficiency or specificity) by assessing the phenotypic concordance between the two dsRNAs targeting different regions of the same gene (referred to as sequence-independent dsRNAs). For more than 94% (1293 of 1367) of genes, phenotypic profiles were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>), and these genes were used in further analysis. Genetic interactions were calculated using a multiplicative model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horn et al., 2011</xref>). 12361 gene pairs (13%) showed significant statistical genetic interactions in at least one phenotype (FDR 1%, moderated <italic>t</italic>-test). Compared to an analysis of the cell number phenotype alone, which detected 2357 genetic interactions, the number of observed genetic interactions was more than fivefold higher in the multi-phenotype analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interactions derived from different phenotypes were non-redundant, for example, genetic interactions affecting the number of cells displayed only weak correlation with those affecting mitotic index (correlation coefficient: 0.33) or cell diameter (correlation coefficient: −0.32) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For example, depletion of <italic>Rho1</italic> mRNA alone interfered with cytokinesis, resulting in large, multinucleated cells and reduced cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, RNAi against <italic>Dlic</italic>, the dynein light intermediate chain, led to a moderate reduction in cell number but did not affect nuclear size.

In contrast, their co-depletion resulted in a negative genetic interaction on cell and nuclear sizes, indicating that <italic>Dlic</italic> is epistatic to <italic>Rho1</italic>. Similarly, co-depleting <italic>Not3</italic> (a member of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex) and the growth regulator <italic>hippo</italic> (<italic>hpo</italic>) did not reveal a significant genetic interaction affecting total cell number. Yet, the same RNAi combination reversed the mild decrease in mitotic index observed upon RNAi of each single gene, and increased the fraction of mitotic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, this situation is depicted by the blue and orange arrows that represent the effects of the single-gene knockdowns. When A and B do not genetically interact, the phenotype of the double-knockdown (grey arrow; AB) is simply the combination (vector sum) of the two individual arrows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We call this the non-interacting model (NI). Second, when A and B genetically interact, the multivariate phenotype of the double knockdown (AB) is different from the vector sum (NI). This difference, geometrically depicted by the black arrows, defines the genetic interaction (π). If the double knockdown phenotype is an amplified or dampened version of one of the single gene knockdown phenotypes, then the genetic interaction (black arrow) is parallel or antiparallel to the phenotype of either one of the single knockdowns (blue or orange arrow: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Together, this geometric information indicates the directionality of the interaction (i.e., which gene modifies which), and whether it is alleviating (antiparallel) or aggravating (parallel). For example, if the double knockdown phenotype of gene A and gene B is similar to the single knockdown of gene A, we call this an alleviating interaction from A to B (A → B). This indicates that a functional gene A is required for the phenotype of gene B (i.e., gene A is functionally upstream of gene B), while the absence or presence of B has a limited effect on the phenotype of A. Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows an example of an aggravating interaction from gene A to gene B (A <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">⊣</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> B), where loss of gene A's function leads to an even stronger phenotype of gene B, while the phenotype of gene A is unchanged. The two remaining cases, alleviating and aggravating directional interactions from gene B to gene A are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (B → A, B <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">⊣</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> A). Alternatively, if the double knockdown phenotype (AB) is not merely increasing or decreasing the amplitude of one of the single gene phenotypes, no direction is assigned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We systematically determined whether such an epistatic relationship could be identified for each of the 93,096 gene pairs by testing if the 21-dimensional genetic interaction vectors were (anti-) parallel to either of the two single knockdown vectors (‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using a conservative threshold, we found directional epistatic interactions between 1344 pairs of genes. Of these, 1040 were alleviating and 304 aggravating (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>). This directional genetic interaction network provided a rich snapshot of regulatory, causal and temporal relationships. For instance, we detected an alleviating interaction between the APC/C member <italic>Cdc23</italic> and the cytokinesis regulator <italic>sti</italic>. After knockdown of <italic>Cdc23</italic>, we recorded reduced growth and slightly smaller nuclear area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>, blue arrows for the two independent dsRNAs). Knockdown of <italic>sti</italic> also reduced growth, but in addition led to a strong increase in nuclear area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>, orange arrows). The double knockdown of <italic>Cdc23</italic> and <italic>sti</italic>, however, almost completely reproduced the phenotype of <italic>Cdc23</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, black arrows for 2 × 2 dsRNA design). This directional alleviating interaction between the genes reflects the known, consecutive functions of the encoded proteins. Without <italic>Cdc23</italic>, cells arrest in metaphase, leading to the observed reduction in cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, top). Without <italic>sti</italic>, a component of the contractile ring, which executes the abscission of the cytoplasm to form the two daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D'Avino et al., 2004</xref>), cells undergo karyokinesis (division of the nucleus) and re-replicate their genome without being able to divide their cytoplasm, resulting in giant cells with large nuclei and often multi-nucleated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, middle). However, when <italic>Cdc23</italic> is depleted together with <italic>sti,</italic> the increase of nucleus size is avoided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, bottom) since depletion of <italic>Cdc23</italic> arrests cells in metaphase thereby preventing re-replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zielke et al., 2008</xref>), explaining the detected directional interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>An epistatic network of mitotic genes</title><p>Next, we studied the directional genetic interactions of key regulators of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The mitosis master regulator <italic>polo</italic> was observed as alleviating epistatic to components that are required for the initial mitotic phases, including the γTuRC, which serves as the structural basis of the mitotic spindle. In contrast, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme <italic>vih</italic> showed directional interactions to components that are active at later stages. Depletion of γTuRC members aggravated the cellular phenotype of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Dynein/dynactin motor proteins mediated a chain of directional epistatic interactions between the SAC and the APC/C. Moreover, whereas SAC knockdown had an aggravating effect on the phenotype of condensin/cohesion, the latter relied on a functional APC/C. The phenotypes of cytokinesis regulators including <italic>sti</italic>, <italic>pav</italic>, <italic>tum</italic>, <italic>Rho1</italic> or <italic>scra</italic> were strongly dependent on APC/C as well as on dynein/dynactin motor proteins.

We aimed to use our directional interaction network to predict relationships between recurrent cancer mutations. For example, we found an alleviating directional interaction between <italic>Pten</italic> (PTEN) and <italic>gig</italic> (TSC2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2012</xref>).

A systematic understanding of genetic interactions is an important basis for linking genotypes to phenotypes, to dissect the genetic dependencies of cellular processes and may also have profound implications for disease treatment. Identifying genetic dependencies can facilitate finding combinatorial drug treatments and avoiding resistance mechanisms, which are important in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nijman and Friend, 2013</xref>). The identification of genetic interactions in population-based observational studies, however, is limited by sample size and statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zuk et al., 2012</xref>) both in model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mackay, 2014</xref>) and for human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Civelek and Lusis, 2014</xref>). Even though algorithmic and statistical approaches have been tuned over the last 10 years to address this issue, the number of detected instances of epistasis in genome-wide association studies remains small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lincoln et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gregersen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). Large-scale reverse-genetic combinatorial perturbation experiments offer an avenue to systematically map genetic interactions to infer gene functions and their interdependencies.</p><p>Analyses of genetic interaction screens so far have been mainly based on the ‘statistical’ definition by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fisher (1918)</xref>. A statistical genetic interaction exists between genes if the effect of their combined perturbation differs from what is expected from the single perturbations. The obtained information on gene–gene interactions is symmetric and does not reveal a potential directionality. The experimental and computational approach presented in this study aimed at capturing interactions, first irrespective of direction (symmetric), and second, adding directionality. Directional genetic interactions provide an additional layer of information above symmetric, statistical genetic interactions. Directional genetic interactions reflect causal, temporal or regulatory relationships between phenotypes and their underlying biological processes. Our method requires the observation of multiple phenotypes and is an algorithmic formalisation of the epistasis concept of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateson (1907)</xref>. Bateson mapped epistatic alleles when studying the inheritance of coat colour of mice using multiple colour phenotypes. The formalisation of mapping epistatic interactions as done in our study is straightforward to implement and should also be applicable to future studies.</p><p>Our map encompasses approximately 1300 genes for which we derived genetic interaction profiles, the largest genetic interaction map generated for a metazoan cell to date. The study demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale, automated discovery of directional epistatic interactions. There are also other approaches to annotate relationships between genes. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelley and Ideker (2005)</xref> detected different interaction types by searching for network motifs and integrated information from genetic, physical and reaction networks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drees et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">St Onge et al. (2007)</xref> derived partial orderings of single and double mutant viability phenotypes. This method can derive directional interactions in special cases, for example, when one of the genes does not have a phenotype itself. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vinayagam et al. (2014)</xref> annotated protein–protein interactions with positive and negative signs, which they obtained from the correlations between the genes' individual knockdown phenotypes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liberali et al. (2014)</xref> tested whether one gene's single knockdown phenotypes are contained in those of another gene, and used such subset relationships to derive hierarchies between genes. In contrast to these previous approaches, our study directly captures epistatic relationships from multivariate phenotypes observed after di-genic perturbations, often revealing effects that cannot be constructed from single-gene perturbations, or from single phenotypes alone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Wageningen et al. (2010)</xref> recorded gene expression profiles from single and double yeast deletion strains and reported frequent instances of mixed epistasis. It would be interesting to study how our approach can be extended to detect mixed directional relationships. Another avenue for future work is the combination of directional genetic interaction mapping with Bayesian modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Battle et al., 2010</xref>) to further improve the inference of regulatory networks.</p><p>For the gene set presented here, we predicted the temporal and causal relationships between cell cycle regulators during mitosis without using prior knowledge. To highlight the functional relevance of the genetic interactions revealed in the study, we first showed that Ras-mediated signalling in fly development in vivo can be suppressed by loss-of function mutations in multiple SWI/SNF components. This is concordant with results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herr et al. (2010)</xref>, who reported attenuated EGFR/Ras/MAPK signalling activity after reduced <italic>brm</italic> activity in the background of the dominant active EGFR mutation <italic>ElpB1</italic>. In addition, we confirmed the genetic interactions of SWI/SNF components with constitutively active KRAS in human colon cancer cells. Recent cancer genome sequencing studies have revealed many recurrent mutations that are individually rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chin et al., 2011</xref>). A current challenge is to order these genetic variants by their functional and phenotypic effects. We have demonstrated a method to detect which recurrently mutated genes modify each other's phenotypes. Such information could be instrumental for understanding the joint effect of multiple mutated genes, for example, in the same tumour, and may contribute to understanding tumour evolution and drug sensitivity.</p><p>We have demonstrated inference of directional genetic interactions from multiple phenotypes as a new approach to shed light on the patterns underlying complex genotype-phenotype relationships. This approach could provide a basis for the understanding of epistatic and functional dependencies between disease-associated genetic variants. Future studies could include additional phenotypes, optimized experimental designs and improved computational methods for the discovery of directional interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue culture and combinatorial RNAi</title><p>Schneider S2 cells (D.Mel-2; ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) were grown in serum-free medium (Express Five SFM; ThermoFisher) supplemented with 20 mM GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (ThermoFisher) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horn et al., 2011</xref>).

Nuclei were segmented by adaptive thresholding, identified separately in the DAPI and pH3 channels and matched. From the 4× images, 84 features per nucleus were extracted, including number of nuclei in each channel, mean, standard deviation and other distribution statistics of area and fluorescence intensity in both channels. Local cell density was estimated with a kernel density estimator using a Gaussian kernel on eight different scales. In the 10× images, the cellular boundary was estimated from fluorescence levels in the α-tubulin channel by extension from nuclei by the propagation algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). 244 features per cell were extracted from the 10× images, including distribution moments, shape and Haralick texture features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haralick et al., 1973</xref>). To obtain features per experiment (cell population), averages of per-cell features were computed separately for mitotic and non-mitotic cells.

A full list of features is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>. All feature data were subjected to a variance-stabilising transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huber et al., 2002</xref>) that interpolates between the logarithm function for large values and a linear function around 0. The transformation reduced heteroskedasticity and improved the fit of the multiplicative model, which was verified by the concentration of residuals around 0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Feature interpretation and selection</title><p>Many of the extracted features have obvious or intuitive interpretations, such as mean cell area, eccentricity, intensity. Our measurements for these phenotypes correlate with previously published single gene morphological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rohn et al., 2011</xref>) for cell size and eccentricity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Other features are more abstract. For instance, we included the quantile features to be able to detect changes that affect only a small proportion of cells: for example, the elongation phenotype often only affects a small fraction of the cells. Other features are mathematical descriptors, or numerical ‘fingerprints’, of texture and intensity patterns; the use of these is well-established in cellular image analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boland and Murphy, 2001</xref>), and while they are not directly interpreted as a specific process or function, they sensitively pick up complex changes in the cellular network caused by the genetic perturbations. Together, we computed a large number of phenotypic features, which were partially redundant. We then aimed at selecting an informative, non-redundant subset of these features for further analysis by an automated procedure. First, we eliminated those features that were not sufficiently reproducible between replicates (cor &lt;0.6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We then started the feature selection with three manually chosen features based on their interpretability and to facilitate comparability with previous work: number of cells, fraction of mitotic cells and cell area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horn et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequently, for each further feature, we fit a linear regression that modelled the feature's values over all experiments as a function of the already selected features. The residuals of this fit were used to measure new information content not yet covered by the already selected features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Among candidate features, we selected the one with the maximum correlation coefficient of residuals between two replicates. This procedure was iterated, and in each iteration we computed the fraction of features with positive correlation coefficients. The iteration was stopped when this fraction no longer exceeded 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This choice of cut-off was motivated by the fact that for a set of uninformative features, the fraction is expected to be 0.5.

By analysis of variance we then quantified how much of the π-score was explained by each of the two genes. We called an epistatic interaction from gene A to B if the fraction of sum of squares explained by gene A was smaller than a lower threshold and if the fraction of sum of squares explained by gene B was larger than a higher threshold. The two thresholds were chosen as the 10% and 95% quantile over all gene pairs.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, Trey Ideker, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Boutros and colleagues reports analysis of a large-scale screen evaluating effects of siRNA knockdown of genes alone and in pairwise combinations on multiple quantitative cellular phenotypes. The major novel innovation of the manuscript is the use of combinations of phenotypes as the basis for determining the directionality of epistatic interactions. The authors present evidence for directional epistatic relationships between genes encoding components of the Swi/Snf complex and genes influencing Ras signaling as an unexpected and significant finding. The authors present evidence for this functional relationship in the fly eye and in a human colon cancer cell line. All three reviewers liked the basic concept and execution of the experiments and thought that the manuscript would be a good candidate for <italic>eLife</italic> subject to satisfactory responses to the following major comments:</p><p>1) The Introduction needs to be revised to give additional consideration to prior work. There was some disagreement among reviewers regarding the extent to which earlier work communicates directional interactions. However, at a minimum the following additional references should be cited and referred to in the Introduction and/or Discussion: St. Onge et al. Nature Genetics (2007); Drees et al. Genome Biology (2005); Kelley et al. Nature Biotech (2005). See also Jerby-Arnon et al. Cell 2014 with respect to use of the term 'statistical' genetic interactions.</p><p>2) The Introduction should be made more accessible to the general reader by discussing the mechanistic origins of interactions at the protein level.</p><p>3) There was unanimous agreement among all three reviewers that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> needs to be better explained.</p><p>4) For the single gene knockdown phenotypes, these should be benchmarked against previous RNAi knockdown high-content imaging papers to look at the reproducibility/overlap.</p><p>5) The biological meanings of many of the cellular phenotypes that are used as the basis for determining directionality of epigenetic interactions are unclear. While some phenotypes such as cell size, cell number, nuclear size, etc., can be traced to functions of specific genes or combinations of genes, many or most 'phenotypes' are hard to interpret (e.g., 10x.meanNonmitotic.cell.BDAPITub.b.q001, from Table S3). This raises the question of whether epistatic relationships observed for many of the quantitative parameters are of biological relevance. The authors do provide evidence that each of the quantitative phenotypes chosen for study add information and that their screen and analytical methods capture previously established functional relationships, but additional explanation of why many of the seemingly esoteric measurements should be informative at a biological level is needed.</p><p>6) There are prior reports of connections between Swi/Snf complexes and RAS signaling (e.g., PMID: 20416294, PMID: 23438604). In some cases these interactions would seem to predict opposite results from those observed in human colon cancer cells. These studies possibly weaken the interpretation and novelty of what the authors have chosen to highlight as a new and unexpected finding. The authors need to place their findings in the context of these prior papers. It would also be helpful to know what phenotypes besides cell number drove the epistatic relationships and their directionality for the plot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05464.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The Introduction needs to be revised to give additional consideration to prior work.

In the revised version of the manuscript, we acknowledge these papers and refer to them either in the Introduction (second paragraph) or Discussion (third paragraph). We also explain how our approach differs from previous studies. Specifically, in previous studies epistasis and therefore directionality was only inferred in special cases, e.g. where one of the single gene phenotypes is zero. By using multiple phenotypes and considering them as ‘vectors’, our method is more general and more widely applicable. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> gives an example: when both genes have some effect on growth rate, it is not possible to unambiguously derive directionality. In practice, these cases are common and previous studies have demonstrated that genes with phenotypes are most likely to show genetic interactions (Costanzo, Science, 2010). In contrast, our multivariate method is able to assign directionality even in cases where both single gene phenotypes are non-zero, based on a straightforward vector algebra calculation.</p><p><italic>See also Jerby-Arnon et al. Cell 2014 with respect to use of the term 'statistical' genetic interactions</italic>.</p><p>Regarding the nomenclature of epistasis and genetic interactions, a range of different definitions is found in the literature. In particular, the term “statistical” was used by Jerby-Arnon et al. to detect and prioritize synthetic lethal or synthetic dosage lethal interactions by an integrative analysis of diverse experimental datasets by three separate statistical inference procedures. While they report the use of statistical methods to discover genetic interactions, in the paper they did not use the expression “statistical genetic interactions” for these. To the best of our knowledge, we follow the mainstream usage of this term, where a statistical interaction is detected from an interaction term between the covariates in a linear model (ANOVA) for the phenotype (see e.g., Cordell et al., Epistasis: what it means, what it doesn't mean, and statistical methods to detect it in humans, Human Molecular Genetics, 2002). To clarify the terminology, we added an explanation in the Introduction (second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) The Introduction should be made more accessible to the general reader by discussing the mechanistic origins of interactions at the protein level</italic>.</p><p>We added several sentences on genetic interactions and their underlying mechanistic origins (parallel pathways; linear pathway or protein complex) to the Introduction (second paragraph). In addition, we added a reference to the review of Dixon et al. (Andrews and Boone labs) in the Annual Review of Genetics (2009), which gives a more extensive overview over possible mechanistic origins.</p><p><italic>3) There was unanimous agreement among all three reviewers that</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref> <italic>needs to be better explained</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We have revised the figure to get a better connection between the bar charts in the first column and the geometric charts in the third column. We also revised and extended the text by adding additional explanations.</p><p><italic>4) For the single gene knockdown phenotypes, these should be benchmarked against previous RNAi knockdown high-content imaging papers to look at the reproducibility/overlap</italic>.</p><p>We compared the extracted phenotypes to a previous screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells by Rohn et al. (J Cell Biol, 2011) and added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> to the manuscript, which shows a significant overlap of the phenotypes (fourth paragraph of Materials and Methods). However, we would like to point out the limitations of such an analysis as different cell lines have been used.</p><p><italic>5) The biological meanings of many of the cellular phenotypes that are used as the basis for determining directionality of epigenetic interactions are unclear. While some phenotypes such as cell size, cell number, nuclear size, etc., can be traced to functions of specific genes or combinations of genes, many or most 'phenotypes' are hard to interpret (e.g., 10x.meanNonmitotic.cell.BDAPITub.b.q001, from Table S3). This raises the question of whether epistatic relationships observed for many of the quantitative parameters are of biological relevance. The authors do provide evidence that each of the quantitative phenotypes chosen for study add information and that their screen and analytical methods capture previously established functional relationships, but additional explanation of why many of the seemingly esoteric measurements should be informative at a biological level is needed</italic>.</p><p>We added the following explanation on this issue to Section “Feature interpretation and selection” in the Methods section.</p><p>“Many of the extracted features have obvious or intuitive interpretations, such as mean cell area, eccentricity, intensity. Our measurements for these phenotypes correlate with previously published single gene morphological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rohn et al. 2011</xref>) for cell size and eccentricity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Other features are more abstract. For instance, we included the quantile features to be able to detect changes that affect only a small proportion of cells: e.g. the elongation phenotype often only affects a small fraction of the cells. Other features are mathematical descriptors, or numerical ‘fingerprints’, of texture and intensity patterns; the use of these is well-established in cellular image analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boland and Murphy 2001</xref>), and while they are not directly interpreted as a specific process or function, they sensitively pick up complex changes in the cellular network caused by the genetic perturbations.”</p><p>Regarding the biological relevance, we can only point out that the detection of apparent changes in the output of a biological system in order to sense variation in the underlying, complex molecular network, often in a very specific manner, has a long history. For instance, medical practitioners can sometimes diagnose congenital anomalies from very specific, recurrent symptoms (syndromes), even if we currently cannot make an intuitive biology-based link. Differences between vein pattern formations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have been used to map intra- and inter-cellular signalling networks of very general relevance. Similarly, we do not attempt to link interactions found with respect to one of these more abstract phenotypes in our data directly to a biological function. We merely use them to detect the relationships between the underlying perturbations.</p><p><italic>6) There are prior reports of connections between Swi/Snf complexes and RAS signaling (e.g., PMID: 20416294, PMID: 23438604). In some cases these interactions would seem to predict opposite results from those observed in human colon cancer cells. These studies possibly weaken the interpretation and novelty of what the authors have chosen to highlight as a new and unexpected finding. The authors need to place their findings in the context of these prior papers. It would also be helpful to know what phenotypes besides cell number drove the epistatic relationships and their directionality for the plot shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6A</italic></xref>.</p><p>Herr et al. (PMID: 20416294) reported an antagonistic effect of geminin (gem) and the SWI/SNF component brahma (brm) on EGFR-Ras-MAPK signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They showed that while <italic>brm</italic> is required for EGFR-Ras-MAPK signaling, <italic>gem</italic> inhibits downstream activity. Their interaction phenotype of the over-activated EGFR pathway with <italic>brm</italic> heterozygous mutant is in agreement with our data. However, this study did not show an effect of other SWI/SNF members <italic>osa</italic> and <italic>Snr1</italic> on EGFR pathway. This is now discussed in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion. Tu et al. (PMID: 23438604) reported the requirement of BRG1 (the human brm ortholog) in Ras-induced senescence. They use a lung-derived fibroblast cell line. While loss of BRCA1 is known to induce senescence, they show that the effect of BRG1 is independent of BRCA1 or DNA damage. While the consequences of activated Ras signaling induce different cell fate routes, we demonstrate a conserved dependency of the increased growth phenotype on SWI/SNF function.</p><p>It is indeed interesting to look at the features that drive the epistatic relationship. Multiple features contribute, but most of them are related to nuclear size and eccentricity. We added a panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) that exemplary shows these relationships between RasGap1 and the SWI/SNF members. It can be observed that the RasGap1 growth rate increase is compensated after double knockdown, but the SWI/SNF cell area and eccentricity phenotype is strongly increased after double knockdown.</p></body></sub-article></article>
