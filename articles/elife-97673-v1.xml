circuits. The various computational functions of inhibition are thought to be mediated by different inhibitory neuron types, of which a large diversity exists in several species. Current understanding of the function and connectivity of distinct inhibitory neuron types has mainly derived from studies in transgenic mice. However, it is unknown whether knowledge gained from mouse studies applies to the non-human primate, the model system closest to humans. The lack of viral tools to selectively access inhibitory neuron types has been a major impediment to studying their function in the primate. Here, we have thoroughly validated and characterized several recently developed viral vectors designed to restrict transgene expression to GABAergic cells or their parvalbumin (PV) subtype, and identified two types that show high specificity and efficiency in marmoset V1. We show that in marmoset V1, AAV-h56D induces transgene expression in GABAergic cells with up to 91–94% specificity and 79% efficiency, but this depends on viral serotype and cortical layer. AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 induces transgene expression in PV cells across all cortical layers with up to 98% specificity and 86–90% efficiency, depending on layer. Thus, these viral vectors are promising tools for studying GABA and PV cell function and connectivity in the primate cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>marmoset monkey</kwd><kwd>new world primate</kwd><kwd>primary visual cortex</kwd><kwd>inhibitory neurons</kwd><kwd>AAV</kwd><kwd>viral vector</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Callithrix jacchus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY031959</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angelucci</surname><given-names>Alessandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY026812</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angelucci</surname><given-names>Alessandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1755431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angelucci</surname><given-names>Alessandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>unrestricted grant to the Dept of Ophthalmology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angelucci</surname><given-names>Alessandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 EY014800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angelucci</surname><given-names>Alessandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Univ of Utah</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angelucci</surname><given-names>Alessandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The gene-regulatory enhancers h56D and S5E2 restrict transgene expression to GABAergic and parvalbumin-positive interneurons, respectively, across marmoset cortical layers, thus representing a promising tool for circuit dissection in non-human primates.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The computations performed by the neocortex result from the activity of neural circuits composed of glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Although representing only 15–30% of all cortical neurons, inhibitory neurons profoundly influence cortical computations and cortical dynamics. For example, they influence how excitatory neurons integrate information, shape neuronal tuning properties, modulate neuronal responses based on sensory context and behavioral state, and maintain an appropriate dynamic range of cortical excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferster and Miller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shapley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). These various functions of inhibition are thought to be mediated by different inhibitory neuron types, of which a large diversity has been identified in several species, each having distinct chemical, electrophysiological, and morphological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ascoli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhalter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kubota et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In mouse cortex, the expression of specific molecular markers identifies three major, largely non-overlapping classes of inhibitory neurons: parvalbumin- (PV), somatostatin- (SOM), and serotonin receptor (5HT3aR, a larger class which includes vasoactive intestinal peptide or VIP cells)-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>). The creation of mouse lines selectively expressing Cre-recombinase in specific inhibitory neuron classes has led to a multitude of studies on the connectivity and function of each class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shin and Adesnik, 2023</xref>). Distinct patterns of connectivity and function specific to each inhibitory neuron class are emerging from these mouse studies, but it remains unknown whether insights gained from mouse apply to inhibitory neurons in higher species such as primates. Understanding cortical inhibitory neuron function in the primate is critical for understanding cortical function and dysfunction in the model system closest to humans, where cortical inhibitory neuron dysfunction has been implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Verret et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A major impediment to studying inhibitory neuron function in primates has been the lack of tools for cell-type-specific expression of transgenes in this species. However, recent advances in the application to primates of cell-type-specific viral technology are beginning to enable studies of inhibitory neuron types in primate cortex. In particular, two recent studies have developed specific promoters or enhancers that restrict transgene expression from recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) to GABAergic neurons, specifically the <italic>mDlx</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>) and the <italic>h56D</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mehta et al., 2019</xref>), in both rodents and primates. Viral strategies to restrict gene expression to PV neurons have also been recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mehta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mich et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To facilitate the application of these inhibitory-neuron specific viral vectors to studies of the primate cortex, we have performed a thorough validation and characterization of the laminar expression of reporter proteins mediated by several enhancer/promoter-specific AAVs. Here, we report results from the two vector types that have shown the greatest specificity of transgene expression in marmoset primary visual cortex (V1); specifically, we have tested three serotypes of the <italic>h56D</italic> promoter-AAV that restricts gene expression to GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mehta et al., 2019</xref>), and one serotype of the S5E2 enhancer-AAV that restricts gene expression to PV cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020</xref>). Using injections of these viral vectors in marmoset V1, combined with immunohistochemical identification of GABA and PV neurons, we find that the laminar distribution of reporter protein expression mediated by the GABA- and PV-enhancer AAVs validated in this study resembles the laminar distribution of GABA-immunoreactive (GABA+) and PV-immunoreactive (PV+) cells, respectively, in marmoset V1. Reporter protein expression mediated by the h56D-AAV is specific and robust, but the degree of specificity and coverage depended on serotype and cortical layer. We found that about 92% of PV cells in marmoset V1 are GABA+, and reporter protein expression mediated by the S5E2-AAV shows up to 98% specificity and 86–90% coverage, depending on layer. We conclude that these viral vectors offer the possibility of studying GABAergic and PV neuron connectivity and function in primate cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We validated three serotypes (1,7,9) of a pAAV-h56D-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mehta et al., 2019</xref>) and the AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2.tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020</xref>).

Given identical volumes and titers used for the AAV9 and AAV7 injections (injected volume of the AAV1 was the same but titer was higher; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), as well as identical post-injection survival times for all three serotypes, the differences in the size of the expression region are likely due to different tropism and/or viral spread of the different serotypes. However, given that we only made a single injection per serotype, we cannot exclude that other factors may have contributed to the reduced spread of the AAV7.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Laminar profile of pAAV-h56D-mediated tdT expression in marmoset V1.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Left: tdT expression (<italic>red</italic>) across V1 layers (indicated) following injection of an identical volume of AAV-h56D-tdT serotype 9 (<bold>A</bold>), serotype 7 (<bold>B</bold>), and serotype 1 (<bold>C</bold>).

Recently, several enhancer and promoter elements have been identified that allow to selectively and efficiently restrict gene expression from AAVs to GABAergic neurons and their subtypes across several species, but a thorough validation and characterization of these enhancer-AAVs in primate cortex is lacking. In particular, previous studies have not characterized the specificity and coverage of these vectors across cortical layers. In this study, we have characterized two main enhancer-AAV vectors designed to restrict expression to GABAergic cells or their PV subtypes, which show high specificity and coverage in marmoset V1. Specifically, we have shown that the GABA-specific AAV9-h56D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mehta et al., 2019</xref>) induces transgene expression in GABAergic cells with up to 91–94% specificity and 80% coverage, depending on layer, and the PV-specific AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020</xref>) induces transgene expression in PV cells with up to 98% specificity and 86–90% coverage, also depending on layer. We conclude that these two viral vector types provide useful tools to study inhibitory neuron connectivity and function in primate cortex.</p><p>Many recent studies have investigated the connectivity and function of distinct classes of inhibitory neurons in mouse V1 and other cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shin and Adesnik, 2023</xref>). In contrast, similar studies in the primate have been missing due to the lack of tools to selectively express transgenes in specific cell types and the difficulty of performing genetic manipulation in this species. It is important to study inhibitory neuron function in the primate because it is unclear whether findings in mice apply to higher species, and inhibitory neuron dysfunction in humans has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marín, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldberg and Coulter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewis, 2014</xref>). While the basic inhibitory neuron subtypes seem to exist across most mammalian species studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeFelipe, 2002</xref>), species differences may exist, particularly given the evolutionary distance between mouse and primate. Indeed, species differences have been reported in marker expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hof et al., 1999</xref>), in the proportion of cortical GABAergic neurons (24–30% in primates vs. 15% in rodents) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hendry et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaulieu, 1993</xref>), in the proportion of PV neurons (74% in macaque V1 vs. 30–40% in mouse) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Van Brederode et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Defelipe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), and in the abundance of the various subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krienen et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we found that PV cells in marmoset V1 across all layers represent on average 61% of all GABAergic cells, and up to 79% in V1 L4C. These percentages are lower than previously reported for macaque V1 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Van Brederode et al., 1990</xref> (74% across all layers and nearly 100% in L4C), but higher than recently reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kelly et al., 2019</xref> (52% across all V1 layers, up to 80% in L4C). We also found differences in the V1 laminar expression of both GABA+ and PV+ cells between mouse and marmoset. Specifically, GABA+ and PV+ expression peaks in L2/3 and 4C in marmoset V1, but in L4 and 5 in mouse V1. Similar differences between mouse and primate V1 in the laminar distribution of PV cells were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kooijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Medalla et al., 2023</xref>). Our results on the laminar distribution of PV and GABA immunoreactivity are consistent with previous qualitative and quantitative studies in macaque V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hendry et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blümcke et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Defelipe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Disney and Aoki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kooijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Medalla et al., 2023</xref>), and with a quantitative study in marmoset V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodchild and Martin, 1998</xref>).</p><p>We compared laminar distribution, specificity, and coverage of three different serotypes of the AAV-h56D vector. Serotypes 9 and 7 showed slightly greater specificity than serotype 1, and the specificity of AAV9 was more consistent across layers than the specificity of serotypes 7 and 1, which instead varied somewhat across layers. Serotypes 9 and 1 showed greater coverage than serotype 7. Thus, serotype 9 may be a better choice when high specificity and coverage across all layers are required. Serotype 7, instead, showed high specificity (80%) but low coverage (34%), except in layer 6 (48%) and L2/3 (45%); therefore, this serotype may be desirable to restrict transgene expression to L6 or 2/3 GABAergic cells. We note that these differences among serotypes should be interpreted with caution as they are based on a single injection per serotype. Despite this, our results demonstrate sufficiently high efficiency and specificity of transgene expression in GABA cells using the h56D promoter, at least with two of the three AAV serotypes we tested, warranting their use in the non-human primate.</p><p>We compared laminar distribution, specificity, and coverage resulting from different volume injections of the AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 vector. Injections of 180 nl volume resulted in higher specificity (95% across layers) and coverage (81% across all layers) than obtained with injection volumes equal to or larger than 315 nl (specificity 82% and coverage 78% across all layers), although coverage did not differ significantly across volumes. This mild dose-dependent alteration of specificity could depend on some off-target expression reaching above detection levels at higher doses. Thus, injection volumes of 150–300 nl are recommended for studying PV neuron function and connectivity using this viral vector. Alternatively, or in addition, an apparent dose-dependent reduction in specificity may result from viral-induced suppression of PV immunoreactivity, which could be more pronounced for larger volume injections. Indeed, we found that both GABA- and PV-specific AAVs slightly, but significantly, reduced both GABA and PV immunoreactivity at the site of the viral injection, but GABA expression was more reduced at the AAV-h56D injection site, while reduction in PV expression was more marked at the AAV-S5E2 injection site. This reduction in GABA and PV immunoreactivity at the viral injected sites most likely affected our measurements of specificity, suggesting that specificity for the viruses tested in this study is even higher than revealed by our counts. However, this reduced immunoreactivity raises concerns about the virus or the high level of reporter protein possibly harming the cell physiology. Our data does not allow us to assess the origin of the reduced GABA and PV immunoreactivity. Qualitative observations did not reveal structural damage at the site of the viral injections to suggest cell death. Moreover, we have been able to record the electrophysiological responses of V1 neurons in which opsin protein expression was induced via injections of these viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vafaei et al., 2024</xref>).

Viral vectors were loaded in glass micropipettes (tip diameter 30–45 µm) and pressure injected using a PicoPump (World Precision Instruments). To ensure viral infection of all cortical layers, each injection was made at three depths within the cortical column: 1.2–1.5 mm from the cortical surface (deep), 0.8–1.0 mm (middle), and 0.4–0.6 mm (superficial). After injecting at each depth, the pipette was left in place for 2–4 min before being retracted to the next depth, and for 5 min before being fully retracted from the brain. The PV-specific AAV was injected at four different total volumes: 585 nl (one injection), 315 nl (two injections), 180 nl (two injections), and 90–105 nl (two injections). The AAV-h56D vectors were each injected at a total volume of 600 nl. One-third of each total volume per injection was slowly (6–15 nl/min) injected at each of the three depths. For animals that received multiple injections in the same hemisphere, injections were spaced at least 3 mm apart to ensure no overlap.

In one case (MM423, which received a 315 nl injection of AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2.tdTomato), the brain was sunk in a 20% glycerol solution and frozen at –80°C for 6 months prior to being sectioned. To locate the viral injection sites, a 1:5 series of tissue sections were wet-mounted and observed under microscopic fluorescent illumination. Sections containing each injection site had their coverslips removed, and fluorescent IHC was performed on free-floating sections to reveal both GABA+ and PV+ neurons. No IHC was performed to enhance reporter proteins signals as these were sufficiently bright. GABA and PV IHC was performed by incubating sections for 3 days at 4°C in primary antibody, followed by 12 hr incubation at room temperature in secondary antibody. The primary and secondary antibodies used for GABA-IHC were a rabbit anti-GABA antibody (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_477652">AB_477652</ext-link>) and an Alexa Fluor 647 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc, West Grove, PA; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2492288">AB_2492288</ext-link>), respectively.

Images were stitched, rotated, and cropped as necessary using Zen Blue software (Carl Zeiss AG) and loaded into Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience) for data quantification. To quantify inhibitory neurons that expressed the viral-mediated reporter protein tdTomato, GABA+ and PV+ neurons revealed by IHC at the viral injection sites (i.e., the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, and the ‘IN’ data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we counted single-, double-, and triple-labeled cells across two 100-μm-wide ROIs extending through all layers at the injection site on each channel, yielding a total of four ROIs across two tissue sections being counted and analyzed for each viral injection site. All ROIs used for counts were positioned at the center of the viral expression region in sections where the latter encompassed all cortical layers. To quantify the distribution of GABA+ and PV+ immunoreactivity in control tissue (i.e., the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and the ‘OUT’ data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we counted single- and double-labeled cells across two 100-μm-wide ROIs extending through all layers in each tissue section for a total of six ROIs across three sections. The ROIs for this analysis were selected to be millimeters away from the V1 region containing the viral injection sites. Cell counting was performed by two undergraduate researchers (AI, PB) and reviewed for accuracy by senior lab members (FF, AA). Cortical layer boundaries were determined using DAPI staining or PV-IHC (after confirming the layer boundaries based on PV-IHC matched those seen in DAPI).

Several new results were obtained. First, AAV-h56D targeted GABAergic cells with &gt;90% specificity, and this varied with serotype and layer. Second, AAV-PHP.eB.S5E2 targeted parvalbumin-expressing neurons with up to 98% specificity. Third, the immunohistochemical detection of GABA and PV was attenuated near viral injection sites.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Vormstein-Schneider et al. (2020) tested their AAV-S5E2 vector in marmosets by intravenous injection. The data presented in this manuscript are valuable in part because they show the transduction pattern produced by intraparenchymal injections, which are more conventional and efficient.</p></disp-quote><p>Our manuscript additionally provides detailed information on the laminar specificity and coverage of these viral vectors, which was not investigated in the original studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The conclusions regarding the effects of serotype are based on data from single injection tracks in a single animal. I understand that ethical and financial constraints preclude high throughput testing, but these limitations do not change what can be inferred from the measurements. The text asserts that &quot;...serotype 9 is a better choice when high specificity and coverage across all layers are required&quot;. The data presented are consistent with this idea but do not make a strong case for it.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware of the limitations of our results on the AAV-h56D. We agree with the Reviewer that a single injection per serotype does not allow us to make strong statements about differences between the 3 serotypes. Therefore, in the revised version of the manuscript we have tempered our claims about such differences and use more caution in the interpretation of these data (Results p. 6 and Discussion p.10). Despite this weakness, we feel that these data still demonstrate high efficiency and specificity across cortical layers of transgene expression in GABA cells using the h56D promoter, at least with two of the 3 AAV serotypes we tested. We feel that in itself this is sufficiently useful information for the primate community, worthy of being reported. Due to cost, time and ethical considerations related to the use of primates, we chose not to perform additional experiments to determine precise differences among serotypes. Thus, for example, while it is possible that had we replicated these experiments, serotype 7 could have proven equally efficient and specific as the other two serotypes, we felt answering this question did not warrant additional experiments in this precious species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related criticism extends to the analysis of Injection volume on viral specificity. Some replication was performed here, but reliability across injections was not reported. My understanding is that individual ROIs were treated as independent observations. These are not biological replicates (arguably, neither are multiple injection tracks in a single animal, but they are certainly closer). Idiosyncrasies between animals or injections (e.g., if one injection happened to hit one layer more than another) could have substantial impacts on the measurements. It remains unclear which results regarding injection volume or serotype would hold up had a large number of injections been made into a large number of marmosets.</p></disp-quote><p>For the AAV-S5E2, we made a total of 7 injections (at least 2 at each volume), all of which, irrespective of volume, resulted in high specificity and efficiency for PV interneurons. Our conclusion is that larger volumes are slightly less specific, but the differences are minimal and do not warrant additional injections. Additionally, we kept all the other parameters across animals constant (see new Supplementary Table 1), all of our injections involved all cortical layers, and the ROIs we selected for counts encompassed reporter protein expression across all layers. To provide a better sense of the reliability of the results across injections, in the revised version of the manuscript we now provide results for each of the AAV-S5E2 injection case separately in a new Supplementary Table 2. The results in this table indicate the results are indeed rather consistent across cases with slightly greater specificity for injection volumes in the range of 105-180 nl.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This is a straightforward manuscript assessing the specificity and efficiency of transgene expression in marmoset primary visual cortex (V1), for 4 different AAV vectors known to target transgene expression to either inhibitory cortical neurons (3 serotypes of AAV-h56D-tdTomato) or parvalbumin (PV)+ inhibitory cortical neurons in mice. Vectors are injected into the marmoset cortex and then postmortem tissue is analyzed following antibody labeling against GABA and PV. It is reported that: &quot;in marmoset V1 AAV-h56D induces transgene expression in GABAergic cells with up to 91-94% specificity and 80% efficiency, depending on viral serotype and cortical layer. AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 induces transgene expression in PV cells across all cortical layers with up to 98% specificity and 86-90% efficiency.&quot;</p><p>These claims are largely supported but slightly exaggerated relative to the actual values in the results presented. In particular, the overall efficiency for the best h56D vectors described in the results is: &quot;Overall, across all layers, AAV9 and AAV1 showed significantly higher coverage (66.1{plus minus}3.9 and 64.9%{plus minus}3.7)&quot;. The highest coverage observed is just in middle layers and is also less than 80%: &quot;(AAV9: 78.5%{plus minus}9.1; AAV1: 76.9%{plus minus}7.4)&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>In the abstract, we indeed summarize the overall data and round up the decimals, and state that these percentages are upper bound but that they vary by serotype and layer while in the Results we report the detailed counts with decimals. To clarify this, in the revised version of the Abstract we have changed 80% to 79% and emphasize even more clearly the dependence on serotype and layer. We have amended this sentence of the Abstract as follows: “We show that in marmoset V1 AAV-h56D induces transgene expression in GABAergic cells with up to 91-94% specificity and 79% efficiency, but this depends on viral serotype and cortical layer.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 the efficiency reported in the abstract (“86-90%) is also slightly exaggerated relative to the results: “Overall, across all layers coverage ranged from 78%{plus minus}1.9 for injection volumes &gt;300nl to 81.6%{plus minus}1.8 for injection volumes of 100nl.”</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the numbers in the Abstract are upper bounds, for example efficiency in L4A/B with S5E2 reaches 90%. To further clarify this important point, in the revised abstract we now state ”AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 induces transgene expression in PV cells across all cortical layers with up to 98% specificity and 86-90% efficiency, depending on layer”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These data will be useful to others who might be interested in targeting transgene expression in these cell types in monkeys. Suggestions for improvement are to include more details about the vectors injected and to delete some comments about results that are not documented based on vectors that are not described (see below).</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>Details provided about the AAV vectors used with the h56D enhancer are not sufficient to allow assessment of their potential utility relative to the results presented. All that is provided is: &quot;The fourth animal received 3 injections, each of a different AAV serotype (1, 7, and 9) of the AAV-h56D-tdTomato (Mehta et al., 2019), obtained from the Zemelman laboratory (UT Austin).&quot; At a minimum, it is necessary to provide the titers of each of the vectors. It would also be helpful to provide more information about viral preparation for both these vectors and the AAVPHP.eB-S5E2.tdTomato. Notably, what purification methods were used, and what specific methods were used to measure the titers?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. In the revised version of the manuscript, we now provide a new Supplementary Table 1 with titers and other information for each viral vector injection. We also provide information regarding viral preparation in a new sections in the Methods entitled “ Viral Preparation” (p12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The first paragraph of the results includes brief anecdotal claims without any data to support them and without any details about the relevant vectors that would allow any data that might have been collected to be critically assessed. These statements should be deleted.

They also report on the selectivity and efficiency of expression of a PV-selective enhancer (S5E2). Three further viruses were tested, with a view to characterizing the expression profiles of a GABA-selective enhancer (h56d), but these results are preliminary.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The derivation of cell-type specific enhancers is key for translating the types of circuit analyses that can be performed in mice - which rely on germline modifications for access to cell-type specific manipulation - in higher-order mammals. Federer et al. further validate the utility of S5E2 as a PV-selective enhancer in NHPs.</p><p>Additionally, the authors characterize the laminar distribution pattern of GABA+ and PV+ cells in V1. This survey may prove valuable to researchers seeking to understand and manipulate the microcircuitry mediating the excitation-inhibition balance in this region of the marmoset brain.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Enhancer/promoter specificity and efficiency cannot be directly compared, because they were packaged in different serotypes of AAV.</p><p>The three different serotypes of AAV expressing reporter under the h56D promoter were only tested once each, and all in the same animal. There are many variables that can contribute to the success (or failure) of a viral injection, so observations with an n = 1 cannot be considered reliable.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that was also brough up by Reviewer 1, which we have addressed in our reply-to-Reviewer 1.

We agree with the Reviewer that a single injection per serotype does not allow us to make strong statements about differences between the 3 serotypes. Therefore, in the revised version of the manuscript we will temper our claims about such differences and use more caution in the interpretation of these data. Despite this weakness, we feel that these data still demonstrate high efficiency and specificity across cortical layers of transgene expression in GABA cells using the h56D promoter, at least with two of the 3 AAV serotypes we tested. We feel that in itself this is sufficiently useful information for the primate community, worthy of being reported. Due to cost, time and ethical considerations related to the use of primates, we chose not to perform additional experiments to determine precise differences among serotypes. Thus, for example, while it is possible that had we replicated these experiments, serotype 7 would have proven equally efficient and specific as the other two serotypes, we felt answering this question did not warrant additional experiments in this precious species.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The language used throughout conflates the cell-type specificity conferred by the regulatory elements with that conferred by the serotype of the virus.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply.

Hence the density of tdTomato appeared lower than it is. Moreover, the tdT expression region shown in Fig. 3A is a merge of two sections, while it is only from a single section in panels B and C, leading to the impression of higher density of infected cells in panel A. The pipette used for the injection in panel A was not inserted perfectly vertical to the cortical surface, resulting in an injection site that did not span all layers in a single section; thus, to demonstrate that the injection indeed encompassed all layers (and that the virus infected cells in all layers), we collapsed label from two sections.

Density, as now clarified in the Results on p. 4, was defined as the number of cells per unit area. Counts in each layer were divided by each layers’ counting area.

Therefore, reporting DAPI density is not necessary (we did not count DAPI cell density per layer).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Identical injection volumes of each serotype, delivered at 3 different cortical depths (see Methods), resulted in different injection sizes, suggesting the different serotypes have different capacity of infecting cortical neurons. AAV7 produced the smallest injection site, which additionally was biased to the superficial and deep layers, with only few cells expressing tdT in the middle layers (Fig. 3B). AAV9 (Fig. 3A) and AAV1 (Fig. 3C) resulted in larger injection sites and infected all cortical layers.&quot; Differences noted here might reflect either differences related to the AAV serotype or to differences in titers. Please add details about titers for each vector and add comments as appropriate. Another interpretation would be that there are differences in viral spread within the tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added Supplementary Table 1 which reports titers in addition to other information about injections. The titers and volumes used for AAV9 and AAV7 were identical, while the titer for AAV1 was higher. Therefore, the differences in infectivity, particularly the much smaller expression region obtained with AAV7 cannot be attributed to titer. Likely this is due to differences in tropism and/or viral spread among serotypes.
