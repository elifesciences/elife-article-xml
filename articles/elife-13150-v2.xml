This force is a pre-transition (or pre-melting) effect for the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane. Using large-scale molecular simulation, we show that a protein with hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic order–disorder interface. The stiffness of that interface is finite. When two such proteins approach each other, they assemble because assembly reduces the net interfacial energy. Analogous to the hydrophobic effect, we refer to this phenomenon as the 'orderphobic effect'. The effect is mediated by proximity to the order–disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those that could arise from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13150.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13150.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13150.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The membrane that surrounds cells provides a selective barrier that allows some molecules through, but blocks the path of others. A cell’s membrane is made up of two layers of molecules with oily tails, and is therefore known as a bilayer. Many proteins are dotted within and on the inner and outer surfaces of the bilayer: some act as channels that control what goes in and out of the cell, while others protrude outside the cell so that they can sense changes in the environment.</p><p>Membrane proteins can move and interact within the bilayer, and various models have emerged to try to explain this dynamic system. These models are based on the membrane having some fluidity but also having regions where there is more structure, and typically describe the proteins as ordered clusters floating in an otherwise disordered fluid membrane. However, many researchers now think some proteins that pass through both layers of the bilayer (i.e., transmembrane proteins) make membranes more ordered, with a possibly gel-like state. However, it is not clear how transmembrane proteins can move and assemble together within such a relatively rigid membrane.</p><p>To investigate this, Katira, Mandadapu, Vaikuntanathan et al. carried out computer simulations using a model of a simple bilayer membrane. This membrane can exist in an ordered state, where the oily tails are neatly aligned, or a disordered state, where they are irregularly packed. Virtual ‘heating’ of the membrane caused it to shift from an ordered to a disordered state. When a simple transmembrane protein favoring the disordered state was inserted into the ordered state of the modeled membrane, disordered regions formed locally around the protein and the protein was able to diffuse within the membrane.</p><p>Modeling what would happen if two transmembrane proteins approached each other revealed that a consequence of the order–disorder transition is a strong attractive force that assembles the proteins together. Katira, Mandadapu, Vaikuntanathan et al. named this new phenomenon the 'orderphobic effect'. The forces arising from this effect were much greater than those currently believed to contribute to the assembly of membrane protein complexes, such as those generated by the elasticity of the membrane. This means that the orderphobic effect may be responsible for generating the protein clusters commonly seen in cell membranes.</p><p>Future work should next explore the opposite effect, where proteins favoring the ordered state are inserted into the disordered state of a membrane. This is expected to cause clustering of such proteins and thus large ordered regions in an otherwise disordered membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13150.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13150.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>lipid bilayers</kwd><kwd>phase transition</kwd><kwd>hydrophobic mismatch</kwd><kwd>orderphobe</kwd><kwd>orderphobic effect</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandadapu</surname><given-names>Kranthi K</given-names></name><name><surname>Vaikuntanathan</surname><given-names>Suriyanarayanan</given-names></name><name><surname>Chandler</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katira</surname><given-names>Shachi</given-names></name><name><surname>Mandadapu</surname><given-names>Kranthi K</given-names></name><name><surname>Vaikuntanathan</surname><given-names>Suriyanarayanan</given-names></name><name><surname>Smit</surname><given-names>Berend</given-names></name><name><surname>Chandler</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Chicago</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaikuntanathan</surname><given-names>Suriyanarayanan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FWP number SISGRKN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katira</surname><given-names>Shachi</given-names></name><name><surname>Smit</surname><given-names>Berend</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>SV is currently supported by the University of Chicago.

The fluid mosaic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singer and Nicolson, 1972</xref>) and the lipid raft hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Munro, 2003</xref>) have guided intuition on how proteins diffuse and assemble in biological membranes—ordered clusters floating in an otherwise disordered fluid membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simons and Toomre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>). However, recent advances show that a significant proportion of the membrane is liquid-ordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Swamy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Polozov et al., 2008</xref>), with coexistence between the liquid-ordered and disordered phases. This coexistence suggests that effects of an order–disorder transition might be at play in the assembly of proteins. This possibility is studied here by examining the effects mediated by the simplest related order–disorder transition, that between solid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases.</p><p>Specifically, with molecular simulation, we study a coarse-grained model of a hydrated one-component bilayer and proteins that are added to the membrane. The model membrane exhibits two distinct phases—a solid-ordered phase and a liquid-disordered phase—and a first-order transition between them. We find that a transmembrane protein in the ordered bilayer can induce effects that resemble pre-melting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lipowsky, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Limmer and Chandler, 2014</xref>). In particular, within the otherwise ordered membrane phase, mesoscopic disordered domains surround proteins that favor disordered states. Importantly, the boundary of the domains resembles a stable, fluctuating order–disorder interface. The dynamic equilibrium established at the boundary allows the protein and its surrounding domain to diffuse. Moreover, because the interface has a finite stiffness, neighboring proteins can experience a membrane-induced force of adhesion, an attractive force that is distinctly stronger and can act over significantly larger lengths than those that can arise from simple elastic deformations of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goulian et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haselwandter and Phillips, 2013</xref>).</p><p>This force between transmembrane proteins is analogous to forces of interaction between hydrated hydrophobic objects. In particular, extended hydrophobic surfaces in water can nucleate vapor–liquid-like interfaces. In the presence of such interfaces, hydrophobic objects cluster to reduce the net interfacial free energy. This microscopic pre-transition effect manifesting the liquid–vapor phase transition can occur at ambient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chandler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lum et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Willard and Chandler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stillinger, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">ten Wolde and Chandler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mittal and Hummer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2012</xref>). In the transmembrane case, we show here that a protein favoring the disordered phase creates a similar pre-transition effect. In this case it manifests the order–disorder transition of a lipid bilayer. Like the raft hypothesis, therefore, clusters do indeed form, but the mechanism for their assembly and mobility emerge as consequences of order–disorder interfaces in an otherwise ordered phase. We refer to this phenomenon as the 'orderphobic effect'.</p><p>While considering the effect with one specific order–disorder transition, one should bear in mind its generic nature. The orderphobic effect should be a general consequence of a first-order transition, whether the transition is between solid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases as considered explicitly herein, or between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases as in multicomponent membrane systems. More is said on this point in the <italic>Implications</italic> section of this paper.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>The order–disorder transition is a first-order phase transition</title><p>We choose the MARTINI model of hydrated dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marrink et al., 2007</xref>) to illustrate the orderphobic effect.

For a hexagonal lattice, there are three symmetric orientations for which the interfacial stiffnesses are equal. We will see that for the model we have simulated there appears to be only little angle dependence. Irrespective of that angle dependence, the stability of the interface and the quantitative consistency with capillary scaling provide our evidence for the order–disorder transition being a first-order transition in the model we have simulated.</p><p>The system sizes we have considered contain up to 10<sup>7</sup> particles, allowing for membranes with <italic>N</italic> ≈ 10<sup>4</sup> lipids, and requiring 10 μs to equilibrate. As such, our straightforward simulations are unable to determine whether the ordered phase is hexatic or crystal because correlation functions that would distinguish one from the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nelson et al., 1982</xref>) require equilibrating systems at least 10 times larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernard and Krauth, 2011</xref>).

Here, we do not pursue this additional level of detail in the phase diagram because the additional boundaries refer to <italic>continuous</italic> transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sirota et al., 1988</xref>).

This ability depends upon the proximity to the membrane’s phase transition, and, for the simple protein models considered in this paper, it depends upon the protein’s radius and hydrophobic mismatch with the membrane.

See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also shows that the orderphobic effect produces excess mobility, by proteins melting order in a surrounding microscopic layer and by facilitating the motions of neighboring proteins. This finding explains how protein mobility and reorganization can be relatively facile in the so-called 'gel' phases of membranes. Further information on this phenomenon is provided in <italic>Appendix</italic>. Our prediction of enhanced lipid mobility surrounding orderphobic proteins may be amenable to experimental tests by single molecule tracking techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eggeling et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-6"><title>Implications of the orderphobic effect and related phenomena in biological membranes</title><p>Biological membranes and transmembrane proteins are far more complicated than the models considered in this paper. Part of the complexity is associated with multiple components, which allow for more than one order–disorder transition. For example, with a membrane composed of three components, coexistence can be established between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Veatch and Keller, 2005</xref>), and both of these phases exist in bio-membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Swamy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Polozov et al., 2008</xref>). The fact that liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases can coexist with finite line tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Veatch and Keller, 2005</xref>) implies the existence of a first-order transition between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chandler, 1987</xref>) and thus the relevance of the orderphobic effect. This effect is much wider in applicability than the Casimir effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Machta et al., 2012</xref>), which applies only within the much smaller range of conditions where the first-order transition reaches its limiting case of criticality. A director density for hydrophobic chains serves as the order parameter distinguishing liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. The strength and range of orderphobic effects that will arise from this order–disorder transition merit future investigation. Modeling might build from recent numerical work on the liquid-ordered phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Risselada and Marrink, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Bear in mind that the strength and range of the orderphobic effect depends upon the proximity of the order–disorder transition. This proximity can be changed by changing temperature, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. With many components in play, the proximity can also be changed by varying membrane composition. One can therefore anticipate that the strength and range of orderphobic effects will depend upon, for example, cholesterol concentrations. It will also depend upon the presence of additional proteins, and the domains formed with those proteins themselves depend upon the orderphobic effect.</p><p>Another source of complexity is the side-chain structure of transmembrane proteins. These side chains can affect the packing of lipid chains. To the extent that lipid packing is disrupted, even small <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf84"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-helix proteins can be orderphobic. Evidence for this assessment is provided in <italic>Appendix</italic>. Thus, the orderphobic effect can lead to clustering of transmembrane <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf85"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-helices. Moreover, just as the strength and range of the orderphobic effect can be modified by changing the radius and mismatch of our model proteins, the strength and range of the orderphobic effect will also be affected by the structure of protein side chains. Further, an obvious consequence of the orderphobic effect is the existence of a driving force that will move orderphobic proteins from an ordered phase to a disordered phase, and the creation of large disordered domains as a result of clustering orderphobic proteins. Both of these effects have been noted in simulations of disordering <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf86"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-helix proteins in a membrane exhibiting coexisting liquid-ordered and liquid disordered domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schäfer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domański et al., 1818</xref>).</p><p>Further, there is a dual to the orderphobic effect: a transmembrane protein in the disordered phase that favors the ordered phase can nucleate an ordered region and order–disorder interface. For example, one of our model proteins with a positive mismatch (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf87"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ℓ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">𝒟</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) would induce order in its vicinity. This effect is illustrated in the <italic>Appendix</italic>. Interfaces separating the ordered and disordered regions will again provide a force for assembly. This case corresponds to the situation of lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>), which consists of ordered domains floating in otherwise disordered membranes. The stable interface separating domains then serves as a concrete geometrical definition of the raft. This orderphilic effect will depend upon the extent to which the surface of the transmembrane protein is commensurate with the ordered phase structure. Hydrophobic mismatch is but one possibility. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf88"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-sheets that align neighboring lipids are others. The fact that the orderphilic effect is a pre-transition effect for the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases implies it should occur in disordered membranes that are thermodynamically close to coexistence between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases.</p><p>The orderphobic effect may also be of direct relevance in understanding the behavior of lung-surfactant monolayers. The primary component of these monolayers is the lipid DPPC, with melting temperature higher than physiological temperature (41°C), and a small proportion of cholesterol, and proteins. These monolayers undergo cyclic surface tension mediated phase transitions between the ordered and disordered phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nag et al., 1998</xref>). The results of this paper are also applicable to lipid monolayers and could govern the diffusion and assembly of proteins embedded within the relatively rigid ordered phases.</p><p>Finally, we speculate that the orderphobic effect plays important roles in membrane fusion, budding, and cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fratti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">James and Vale, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Różycki et al., 2012</xref>). In the case of fusion, it would appear that one important role is to promote fluctuations in an otherwise stable membrane. Otherwise, it is difficult to conceive of a mechanism by which thermal agitation would be sufficient to destabilize microscopic sections of membranes. Such destabilization seems necessary for initiating and facilitating membrane fusion. Many proteins are involved in such processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fratti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fasshauer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wickner and Schekman, 2008</xref>), but it may not be a coincidence that the hydrophobic thicknesses of SNARE proteins are 25% smaller than that of the ordered membrane states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Milovanovic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stein et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Molecular simulations</title><p>We simulate the MARTINI coarse-grained force field using the GROMACS molecular dynamics package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marrink et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pronk et al., 2013</xref>). ‘Antifreeze’ particles are added to the solvent to ensure that the solvent does not freeze over the temperature range considered in the simulations as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marrink et al.

Thermostats and barostats control temperature and pressure, and checks were performed to assure that different thermostats and barostats yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frenkel and Smit, 2001</xref>). The hydrophobic cores of our idealized proteins are constructed using the same coarse-grained beads as the lipid tails (particle C1 in the MARTINI topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marrink et al.

The associated harmonic force constants for the bond lengths and angles are 1250 kJmol<sup>−1</sup>nm<sup>−2</sup> and 25 kJmol<sup>−1</sup>rad<sup>−2</sup>. Based on the hydrophobic mismatch with the bilayers, the proteins are classified into three categories: (i) positive mismatch (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf89"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ℓ</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">𝒟</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) (ii) negative mismatch (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf90"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ℓ</mml:mi><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">𝒟</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) and (iii) no mismatch (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf91"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ℓ</mml:mi><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">𝒟</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). To create different mismatches, we alter the number of beads in the protein core. These idealized proteins do not contain charges.</p><p>Proteins are embedded in the equilibrated bilayer at 279 K. The resulting system is then heated to the required temperature and equilibrated for another 1.2 µs. All the subsequent averages are performed using 10 independent trajectories each 600 ns long. The assembly of proteins is also performed using the same DPPC bilayer system with 3200 lipids and 50000 water beads. In this case, two proteins are inserted in this bilayer with centers at a distance of 14 nm and the simulation is carried out at 309 K.</p><p>The flat interface is stabilized by juxtaposing an ordered bilayer equilibrated at 285 K and zero lateral pressure with a disordered bilayer equilibrated at the same conditions corresponding to the cooling and heating curves of the hysteresis loop in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>, respectively. The system thus constructed is equilibrated in the ensemble with fixed temperature, volume, and numbers of particles. This ensemble allows for maintaining an area per lipid intermediate between the two phases, thus stabilizing the interface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Instantaneous interface</title><p>For the purpose of obtaining a smooth and continuous interface, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf92"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is coarse grained by replacing Dirac’s delta function with a finite-width Gaussian, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf93"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Hysteresis occurs because ordering from the metastable disordered phase is much slower than disordering from the metastable ordered phase.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.

It suggests that clustering of membrane proteins may not be a consequence of inter-protein or protein-lipid &quot;mismatches&quot; (e.g., membrane thickness as suggested by Milovanovic et al. Hydrophobic mismatch sorts SNARE proteins into distinct membrane domains. Nat Commun 6:5984. doi: 10.1038/ncomms6984, 2015), but rather by the differences in membrane thickness in difference &quot;phases&quot; of a membrane. If transmembrane domains are shorter than the thickness of a particular phase, they would then prefer to be in a phase that matches the length of the transmembrane domains, hence clustering in these areas. Thus, clustering of certain membrane proteins (such as SNAREs) may be a consequence of this &quot;order-phobic&quot; (but see comment 6 below) effect.</p><p>More specifically, in this work, simulations of coarse-grained lipid membrane models and of membrane/protein models show that (1) transmembrane proteins can induce a local order/disorder transition in a lipid membrane at conditions close to phase coexistence, and (2) that such local phase separation can drive protein association by a reduction of the interfacial free energy between the ordered and disordered lipid phases. These effects should be general in lipid membranes at conditions close to an order/disorder transition. By using orientational order parameters, the phase boundary in the membrane could be clearly resolved, enabling a characterization of its properties. In particular, the fluctuations of the length and shape of the boundary are shown to follow a capillary wave model down to almost molecular length scales. The observation of nanoscale phase separation induced by transmembrane proteins perturbing the local structure should be of interest not only to the physico-chemical community but also to bioscientists. In particular, it may play a role in lipid-mediated assembly of integral membrane protein complexes and supercomplexes.</p><p>While the reviewers and editors found this work interesting, concerns were raised as outlined below that need to be addressed in a revised version before a decision can be made. In particular, the authors are asked to respond to the concern about the biological relevance of the particular phase transition. If possible the authors are encouraged to perform a simulation that is more relevant to biology.</p><p>1) The authors mention in the <italic>Introduction</italic> a number of papers (Nishimura et al., 2006; Polozov et al., 2008; Swamy et al., 2006; Munro, 2003; Thewalt and Bloom, 1992; Owen et al., 2012) that supposedly provide evidence for the physiological relevance of gel domains. Either the referenced papers deal with situations in which membranes are being cholesterol depleted or thermally quenched, or they talk about liquid-ordered domains, not gel domains. In fact, in Munro, 2003 it literally states &quot;The solid gel phase is not thought to be of physiological relevance&quot;. Please change the Introduction accordingly.</p><p>2) The demonstration of the attraction between proteins in this manuscript concentrates on proteins that induce local disorder in an otherwise ordered phase. In biological membranes the disordered phase is expected to dominate, to ensure fluidity and facile transport. The authors may thus want to discuss the reversed situation in a bit more detail (which should be quite symmetric). Ideally, the authors are encouraged to consider a simulation that is more relevant for the biological situation.</p><p>3) The authors may want to discuss in more depth the relation to the lipid raft model. Lingwood and Simons (Lingwood and Simons, 2010) argue that proteins segregate into domains of preferred lipid phase, ordered or disordered. Once such segregation has occurred, would the association force described in this paper effectively disappear? Can the two processes, segregation into domains of preferred phases (at coexistence), and attraction between proteins within mismatched phases, be reconciled (or are they the equivalent)? Could the effect presented here be a driver for raft formation? In such a process, &quot;mismatched&quot; proteins in a membrane close to phase separation would aggregate into clusters, and entropic effects would then push the phase boundary out.</p><p>4) Molecular determinants. What would make a protein orderphilic, beyond having low hydrophobic mismatch with the ordered phase? Are there ways to modulate the strength and the range of the interaction?</p><p>5) Membrane remodeling. The authors briefly discuss a possible role in membrane fusion. Interestingly, lipid phase separation has been suggested to play a central role in ESCRT-protein induced coat-free vesicle budding (Rozycki et al., PLoS Comp Biol 8, e1002736, 2012).</p><p>6) It would be instructive to include the definition of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf151"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p><p>7) The use of the word 'ordered' in both the <italic>Abstract</italic> and <italic>Introduction</italic> is misleading in the context of biomembranes. What the authors probably mean is solid-ordered, or gel, and not liquid-ordered. This distinction should be made from the beginning to avoid misunderstanding.</p><p>8) The final paragraph on the possible importance of the &quot;order-phobic&quot; force should be revised in light of the above comments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Pre-transition effects mediate forces of assembly between transmembrane proteins&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some minor remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have largely addressed my concerns. Introduction <italic>Introduction</italic> and sections establish the biological relevance more clearly, without hiding the simplifications of the simulation model compared to biological membranes. Even if the new simulations of orderphilic proteins in a liquid-disordered membrane are only at a preliminary stage, the observed behavior clearly mirrors that of orderphobic proteins in a solid-ordered membrane, as would be expected. In my opinion, the new data strengthen the paper considerably, and I thus suggest including them.</p><p>Despite the simplifications compared to real biological membranes, the work provides strong evidence that the perturbation of lipid phase behavior by integral membrane proteins can create substantial driving forces for assembly. The paper should attract attention also by the experimental community and stimulate further explorations of the role of phase behavior. I recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>My main previous concern, the biological relevance of the findings, is now much more clearly discussed in the revised paper.</p><p>There are two remaining aspects that still require some discussion:</p><p>1) The authors write &quot;The orderphobic effect should be a general consequence of a first-order transition, whether the transition is between solid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases as considered explicitly herein, or between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases as in multicomponent membrane systems&quot;. I strongly doubt that the transition between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases is a first order transition. The experimental work of Veatch, Keller and co-workers (e.g. Veatch et al., ACS Chem Biol, 2008; Honerkamp-Smith et al., BBA Biomem, 2009), clearly shows that, upon cooling of a lipid extract (either from real plasma membranes or model membranes), the system shows critical behavior. I urge the authors to cite this work and discuss the implications thereof.</p><p>2) The authors should discuss the connection between their work and the work of Schäfer et al. (Shäfer et al., 2011) in more detail. The simulation studies of Schafer et al., based on the same (Martini) model that is used here, demonstrate that proteins are expelled from liquid-ordered domains as a result of 'orderphobicity'. Although the term orderphobic is not used, the driving forces for the partitioning of proteins into disordered domains are shown to be a direct consequence of the protein-induced perturbation of order in the liquid-ordered domains. In a subsequent study (Domanski et al., BBA Biomem, 2012), it is actually shown that these driving forces can lead to protein-induced domain formation. In the context of the biological significance of the current work, these studies should be properly discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13150.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>The primary concern of the reviewers appears to be the biological relevance of the solid-ordered phase used to demonstrate the orderphobic effect. We agree with the reviewers that the solid ordered phase has not been directly observed in most biological membranes (except lung surfactants). And we agree that our writing was inaccurate on this issue. Our revision emphasizes that biological membranes exhibit order–disorder phenomena in that significant portions exist in the liquid-ordered state, and these parts coexist with the liquid-disordered state. The liquid-ordered state is multicomponent and much more complicated than the one-component membrane considered in the current work. Nevertheless, our one-component system also exhibits an order–disorder transition between a solid-ordered phase and a liquid-disordered phase, which allows us to demonstrate the generic role of order–disorder in organizing proteins in what we think is the simplest possible context.</p><p> <italic>1) The authors mention in the Introduction a number of papers (Nishimura et al., 2006; Polozov et al., 2008; Swamy et al., 2006; Munro, 2003; Thewalt and Bloom, 1992; Owen et al., 2012) that supposedly provide evidence for the physiological relevance of gel domains. Either the referenced papers deal with situations in which membranes are being cholesterol depleted or thermally quenched, or they talk about liquid-ordered domains, not gel domains. In fact, in Munro, 2003 it literally states &quot;The solid gel phase is not thought to be of physiological relevance&quot;. Please change the Introduction accordingly.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the original references (Nishimura et al., 2006; Polozov et al., 2008; Swamy et al., 2006; Munro, 2003; Thewalt and Bloom, 1992; Owen et al., 2012) did not provide evidence for the physiological relevance of solid domains and that the <italic>Introduction</italic> and <italic>Implications</italic> sections required revision. The comment is correct in that some references (Nishimura et al., 2006; Polozov et al., 2008; Swamy et al., 2006; Munro, 2003; Thewalt and Bloom, 1992; Owen et al., 2012) in our initial submission were about membrane temperature changes and cholesterol depletion. Nevertheless, those references are not irrelevant because such experiments provide important clues to understanding the ﬁnal state of biological membranes at physiologically relevant temperatures and compositions. That said, the original reference (Munro, 2003) was improperly placed, and we have changed its position now to be a reference for the lipid raft hypothesis.</p><p>We revised our <italic>Introduction</italic> to make our motivation clear as to why we studied the transition between solid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases to facilitate the simplest possible illustration of the generic orderphobic eﬀect. The importance of studying the ordered phase and the orderphobic eﬀect is further elaborated in the revised <italic>Implications</italic> section. Studying the ordered phases and the eﬀects of order–disorder transitions are also of direct relevance in understanding the behavior of lung-surfactant monolayers. The implications of the orderphobic eﬀect to monolayers is now added in our revised <italic>Implications</italic> section.</p><p><italic>2) The demonstration of the attraction between proteins in this manuscript concentrates on proteins that induce local disorder in an otherwise ordered phase. In biological membranes the disordered phase is expected to dominate, to ensure fluidity and facile transport. The authors may thus want to discuss the reversed situation in a bit more detail (which should be quite symmetric). Ideally, the authors are encouraged to consider a simulation that is more relevant for the biological situation.</italic> </p><p>First, we direct the reviewers to our revised <italic>Introduction</italic> and <italic>Implications</italic> sections that discuss the importance of liquid-ordered phases in biological membranes, in addition to the disordered phase.</p><p>Second, concerning the dual to the orderphobic eﬀect, the orderphilic eﬀect, we have followed up on the suggestion of reviewers by reversing the roles of solid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. Preliminary results of these calculations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Appendix 1—figures 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">5</xref>. Bear in mind that without the additional components needed to produce a liquid-ordered phase, these results are no more or less relevant than those already studied for the orderphobic eﬀect.</p><p>In particular, with the disordered bilayer, we embedded a model protein with a hydrophobic thickness approximately equal to that of the ordered phase, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf152"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ℓ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>3.3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> nm. This embedding illustrates the orderphilic case.

Further, with the procedure described in the text, we have computed the instantaneous interfaces from the coarse graining of each of these three ﬁelds <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf160"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf161"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. In the orderphilic case, interfaces are apparent for all three ﬁelds. The director ﬁeld provides the clearest pictures, which are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Appendix 1–figures 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">5</xref>. In the control case, interfaces do not appear.</p><p>Distinctions between interfaces for each of the ﬁelds are interesting microscopic eﬀects worthy of future study. For the bulk interface between the ordered and disordered phases, the distinction disappears because there is only one order–disorder transition for the membrane model we have considered. In more complicated membrane models, those with mixtures of components exhibiting both liquid-ordered and solid-ordered phases, the diﬀerent ﬁelds oﬀer diﬀerent information for both large and small length scales, as now mentioned in the <italic>Implications</italic> section and elsewhere.</p><p><italic>3) The authors may want to discuss in more depth the relation to the lipid raft model. Lingwood and Simons (Lingwood and Simons, 2010) argue that proteins segregate into domains of preferred lipid phase, ordered or disordered. Once such segregation has occurred, would the association force described in this paper effectively disappear? Can the two processes, segregation into domains of preferred phases (at coexistence), and attraction between proteins within mismatched phases, be reconciled (or are they the equivalent)? Could the effect presented here be a driver for raft formation? In such a process, &quot;mismatched&quot; proteins in a membrane close to phase separation would aggregate into clusters, and entropic effects would then push the phase boundary out.</italic> </p><p>The comment raises interesting questions, but answering those questions is beyond the scope of what we have thus far done. We have considered the eﬀects of one or two proteins in a one-component membrane, while understanding lipid rafts and the like requires studies of the collective phase behavior of the mixtures of lipids and proteins including the orderphobic and orderphilic eﬀects. Appropriate modeling is possible, as the revised manuscript indicates, but it will involve extensive new work. The revised manuscript foreshadows studies of these questions in the <italic>Implications</italic> section.</p><p><italic>4) Molecular determinants. What would make a protein orderphilic, beyond having low hydrophobic mismatch with the ordered phase? Are there ways to modulate the strength and the range of the interaction?</italic> </p><p>As already discussed in the earlier version of our paper, the strength and range of the interaction can be modulated by (a) proximity to the order–disorder transition (in temperature as well as surface pressure), (b) radial size of the solute, and (c) relative interactions between the lipid tail groups and the hydrophilic ‘caps’ of the protein. See the subsection “The orderphobic eﬀect generates forces of assembly and facilitates protein Mobility” of the revised version. An additional factor is that changing components of the membrane change the proximity to the order–disorder transition, thus also aﬀecting the strength and range of the eﬀect. This last aspect is added to the <italic>Implications</italic> section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Note also that the Appendix shows how a model <italic>α</italic>-helix is orderphobic even though the chosen peptide has low hydrophobic mismatch with the ordered phase. This ﬁnding demonstrates that side-chains of a protein are suﬃcient to perturb the ordered structure of the membrane, making <italic>α</italic>-helices orderphobic. Similarly, it should be possible to make a protein less orderphobic by altering its side-chain chemistry, or secondary structure (e.g., <italic>β</italic>-sheet). A detailed characterization of how proteins of diﬀerent hydrophobic mismatches, secondary structures, and side-chain chemistries modulate the orderphobic eﬀect is left to future work. This possibility is noted in the <italic>Implications</italic> section.</p><p><italic>5) Membrane remodeling. The authors briefly discuss a possible role in membrane fusion. Interestingly, lipid phase separation has been suggested to play a central role in ESCRT-protein induced coat-free vesicle budding (Rozycki et al., PLoS Comp Biol 8, e1002736, 2012).</italic> </p><p>We have changed the manuscript to include this reference.</p><p> <italic>6) It would be instructive to include the definition of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf162"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We have modiﬁed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> to include an illustration of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf163"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p> <italic>7) The use of the word 'ordered' in both the Abstract and Introduction is misleading in the context of biomembranes. What the authors probably mean is solid-ordered, or gel, and not liquid-ordered. This distinction should be made from the beginning to avoid misunderstanding.</italic> </p><p>We have revised the <italic>Introduction</italic> accordingly.</p><p> <italic>8) The final paragraph on the possible importance of the 'orderphobic' force should be revised in light of the above comments.</italic></p><p>We have revised the <italic>Introduction</italic> and <italic>Implications</italic> sections.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: The authors have largely addressed my concerns. Introduction and Implications sections establish the biological relevance more clearly, without hiding the simplifications of the simulation model compared to biological membranes. Even if the new simulations of orderphilic proteins in a liquid-disordered membrane are only at a preliminary stage, the observed behavior clearly mirrors that of orderphobic proteins in a solid-ordered membrane, as would be expected. In my opinion, the new data strengthen the paper considerably, and I thus suggest including them. Despite the simplifications compared to real biological membranes, the work provides strong evidence that the perturbation of lipid phase behavior by integral membrane proteins can create substantial driving forces for assembly. The paper should attract attention also by the experimental community and stimulate further explorations of the role of phase behavior. I recommend publication in eLife.</italic> </p><p>We are pleased with the reviewer’s assessment. We have followed his/her advice and added a section to the Appendix in which we show preliminary results for the orderphilic case. Also, in the <italic>Implications</italic> section, we have added a few more words both to point to the Appendix and to explain the relevance to lipid rafts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3: My main previous concern, the biological relevance of the findings, is now much more clearly discussed in the revised paper. There are two remaining aspects that still require some discussion: 1) The authors write &quot;The orderphobic effect should be a general consequence of a first-order transition, whether the transition is between solid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases as considered explicitly herein, or between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases as in multicomponent membrane systems&quot;. I strongly doubt that the transition between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases is a first order transition. The experimental work of Veatch, Keller and co-workers (e.g. Veatch et al., ACS Chem Biol, 2008; Honerkamp-Smith et al., BBA Biomem, 2009), clearly shows that, upon cooling of a lipid extract (either from real plasma membranes or model membranes), the system shows critical behavior. I urge the authors to cite this work and discuss the implications thereof.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s thoughts on this issue, but with all due respect, we disagree with his/her impression that the first-order transition is not present in these systems. It is true that, for a fixed cholesterol concentration, there is a critical temperature associated with the transition, as located by Veatch and Keller, but below that temperature, there is two-phase coexistence, and the transition at those lower temperatures is first-order. (The same is true for a liquid–vapor transition: below its critical temperature, there is two-phase coexistence, and at such temperatures the transition between those phases is first order.) It is a general principle that at the conditions where two phases with different order-parameter values coexist, the transition between the phases is first order. The reference to Veatch and Keller that we do supply in the <italic>Implications</italic> section of the paper establishes the region of two-phase coexistence between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. The temperatures and lipid concentrations for which this coexistence occurs depends upon additional parameters, such as cholesterol concentrations and membrane surface tension.</p><p>Because there is some confusion over this point, we have added further explanation concerning first-order and coexistence to the <italic>Implications</italic> section. We have also added a sentence that contrasts the orderphobic and orderphilic effects, which occur broadly for any membrane close to order–disorder coexistence, with the Casimir effect, which occurs over the much narrower conditions of order–disorder criticality.</p><p> <italic>2) The authors should discuss the connection between their work and the work of Schäfer et al. (Shäfer et al. 2011) in more detail. The simulation studies of Schafer et al., based on the same (Martini) model that is used here, demonstrate that proteins are expelled from liquid-ordered domains as a result of 'orderphobicity'. Although the term orderphobic is not used, the driving forces for the partitioning of proteins into disordered domains are shown to be a direct consequence of the protein-induced perturbation of order in the liquid-ordered domains. In a subsequent study (Domanski et al., BBA Biomem, 2012), it is actually shown that these driving forces can lead to protein-induced domain formation. In the context of the biological significance of the current work, these studies should be properly discussed.</italic></p><p>In the <italic>Implications</italic> section, we have added discussion of the results that the reviewer points us to.</p></body></sub-article></article>
