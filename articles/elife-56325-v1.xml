variant are integral aspects of active transcription. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities <italic>via</italic> an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. <italic>Drosophila</italic> generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells contain a large number of proteins that control the activity of genes in response to various signals and changes in their environment. Often these proteins work together in groups called complexes. In the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, one of these complexes is called DOMINO. The DOMINO complex alters gene activity by interacting with other proteins called histones which influence how the genes are packaged and accessed within the cell.</p><p>DOMINO works in two separate ways. First, it can replace certain histones with other variants that regulate genes differently. Second, it can modify histones by adding a chemical marker to them, which alters how they interact with genes. It was not clear how DOMINO can do both of these things and how that is controlled; but it was known that cells can make two different forms of the central component of the complex, called DOM-A and DOM-B, which are both encoded by the same gene.</p><p>Scacchetti et al. have now studied fruit flies to understand the activities of these forms. This revealed that they do have different roles and that gene activity in cells changes if either one is lost. The two forms operate as part complexes with different compositions and only DOM-A includes the TIP60 enzyme that is needed to modify histones. As such, it seems that DOM-B primarily replaces histones with variant forms, while DOM-A modifies existing histones. This means that each form has a unique role associated with each of the two known behaviors of this complex.</p><p>The presence of two different DOMINO complexes is common to flies and, probably, other insects. Yet, in other living things, such as mammals and yeast, their two roles are carried out by protein complexes originating from two distinct genes. This illustrates a concept called convergent evolution, where different organisms find different solutions for the same problem. As such, these findings provide an insight into the challenges encountered through evolution and the diverse solutions that have developed. They will also help us to understand the ways in which protein activities can adapt to different needs over evolutionary time.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>histone exchange</kwd><kwd>histone acetylation</kwd><kwd>histone h2a.z</kwd><kwd>nucleosome remodeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1064-A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scacchetti</surname><given-names>Alessandro</given-names></name><name><surname>Campos Sparr</surname><given-names>Aline</given-names></name><name><surname>Krause</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Peter B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1064-Z04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schauer</surname><given-names>Tamas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heun</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 168-2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Apostolou</surname><given-names>Zivkos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Alternative splicing of a single gene generates functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin, are inherently stable and organized in polymeric fibers of variable compactness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erdel and Rippe, 2018</xref>). The dynamic properties of the fiber required for gene regulation are implemented by several broad principles. ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factors slide or evict nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>), chemical modifications of histones create new interaction surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman and Poirier, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao and Garcia, 2015</xref>) and histone variants furnish nucleosomes with special features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Talbert and Henikoff, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The very conserved H2A variant H2A.Z accounts for ~5–10% of the total H2A-type histone pool in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Redon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thatcher and Gorovsky, 1994</xref>) and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnet et al., 2019</xref>). H2A.Z is primarily found at active promoters and enhancers, where it is thought to be important to regulate transcription initiation and early elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weber et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, H2A.Z is introduced into chromatin by the SWR1 complex (SWR1.C), a multi-subunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler with the INO80-type ATPase SWR1 at its core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mizuguchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Willhoft et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). In humans, the two SWR1 orthologs EP400 and SRCAP may also be involved in H2A.Z incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pradhan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where H2A.Z is named H2A.V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldi and Becker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Daal and Elgin, 1992</xref>), only one gene codes for a SWR1 ortholog: <italic>domino</italic> (<italic>dom</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruhf et al., 2001</xref>). The first biochemical characterization revealed the presence of a multi-subunit complex composed of 15 proteins associated with the DOM ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kusch et al., 2004</xref>). While many of the interactors identified are orthologous to the yeast SWR1.C subunits, additional interactors were found. Surprisingly, they showed similarity to components of a distinct yeast complex, the Nucleosome Acetyltransferase of H4 (NuA4.C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kusch et al., 2004</xref>). NuA4.C is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex with the histone H4 N-terminal domain as a primary target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doyon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). The DOM complex (DOM.C) appeared then to be a chimera, a fusion between two complexes with different biochemical activities. It has been proposed that both enzymatic activities of DOM.C, histone acetylation and histone variant exchange, are required for H2A.V turnover during DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kusch et al., 2004</xref>). It is unclear, however, if this model of DOM.C action could be generalized to other processes, such as transcription regulation. Furthermore, it is still not known how H2A.V is incorporated globally into chromosomes while, at the same time, enriched at promoters.</p><p>It is long known that the <italic>dom</italic> transcripts are alternatively spliced to generate two major isoforms, DOM-A and DOM-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruhf et al., 2001</xref>). We and others previously found that the two splice variants play non-redundant, essential roles during development with interesting phenotypic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Börner and Becker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we systematically characterized the molecular context and function of each DOM splice variant in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> cell lines and assessed their contribution to the activity of the DOM.C in the context of transcription. We discovered the existence of two separate, isoform-specific complexes with characteristic composition. Both are involved in transcription regulation, but through different mechanisms. On the one hand, we found that the DOM-B.C is the main ATP-dependent remodeler for H2A.V, responsible for its deposition across the genome and specifically at active promoters. On the other hand, we discovered that DOM-A.C is not involved in bulk H2A.V incorporation, despite the presence of an ATPase domain and many shared subunits with DOM-B.C. Rather, we realized that DOM-A.C might be the ‘missing’ acetyltransferase NuA4.C of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, which specifically targets lysine 12 of histone H4 (H4K12), the most abundant and yet uncharacterized H4 acetylation in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feller et al., 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, our data also suggest that the ATPase activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation by the DOM-A.C, a principle that might be conserved across metazoans. Our work illustrates how alternative splicing generates functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The splice variants of DOMINO, DOM-A and DOM-B, define two distinct complexes</title><p>The isoforms of the DOMINO ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, are identical for the first 2008 amino acids, but alternative splicing diversifies their C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both proteins share an N-terminal HSA domain and a central, INO80-like ATPase domain. DOM-A has a longer C-terminus characterized by a SANT domain and a region rich in poly-glutamine stretches (Q-rich). The shorter C-terminus of DOM-B, instead, folds in no predictable manner. Given these differences, we wondered if the interaction partners of the two isoforms might differ. To avoid artefactual association of DOM isoforms with proteins upon overexpression, we inserted a 3XFLAG tag within the endogenous <italic>dom</italic> gene in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryonic cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9. The sites were chosen such that either DOM-A (DOM-RA) or DOM-B (DOM-RE) would be tagged at their C-termini. Of note, the editing of DOM-A C-terminus results in the additional tagging of a longer, DOM-A-like isoform (DOM-RG, which compared to DOM-RA has an insertion of 35 residues at its N-terminus starting from residue 401), but leaves a second DOM-A-like isoform untagged (DOM-RD, 16 residues shorter than DOM-RA at the very C-terminus). We obtained three different clonal cell lines for each isoform (3 homozygous clones for DOM-A, 2 homozygous and 1 heterozygous clone for DOM-B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Mass-spectrometry analysis revealed 13 and 12 strongly enriched interactors (FDR &lt; 0.05 and log2 fold-change &gt;0) for DOM-A and DOM-B, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Of those, 7 are common between the two isoforms and were previously characterized as DOM interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kusch et al., 2004</xref>). Two of the expected subunits, PONT and REPT, associated more strongly with DOM-B than with DOM-A under these conditions (log2 DOM-A IP/CTRL = 1.19 and 1.16, FDR = 0.373 and 0.338). A newly identified DOM-B interactor, HCF, also interacts less strongly DOM-A (log2 DOM-A IP/CTRL = 0.70, FDR = 0.466). The unique interactors revealed interesting differences between DOM-A and DOM-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Three of the proteins that specifically associate with DOM-A [ING3, E(Pc) and TIP60] share extensive homology with the acetyltransferase module of the yeast NuA4 complex. Another component of the yeast NuA4.C, NIPPED-A, specifically associates with DOM-A. Additionally, we found two transcription factors, XBP1 and CG12054, amongst the DOM-A specific interactors. On the DOM-B side, only ARP6 and PPS appear to be specific interactors of this isoform. While ARP6 was not described before in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> its yeast homolog is essential for H2A.Z remodeling by the SWR1.C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). To validate the DOM-A/TIP60 interaction, we raised monoclonal antibodies against TIP60. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that TIP60 interacts with DOM-A and not with DOM-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The immunoprecipitation of DOM-A appears to be more efficient when probing with the anti-FLAG antibody compared to the anti-DOM-A polyclonal antibody. This difference might be explained by the presence of one of the DOM-A-like isoforms (DOM-RD), which was left untagged. This isoform is therefore not immunoprecipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody, but it is recognized by the DOM-A specific antibody. Importantly, the same co-immunoprecipitation showed that DOM-A and DOM-B do not interact with each other under these conditions.

The functional complementation involved wild-type DOM-B or a mutant predicted to be deficient in ATP-binding (K945G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mizuguchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). GFP-tagging of the DOM-B proteins allowed to selectively monitor the H2A.V levels by immunofluorescence microscopy in the cells in which the transgenes are expressed. We detected higher levels of H2A.V in cells complemented with a wild-type DOM-B transgene, indicating the expected rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Conversely, the remodeling-defective mutant transgene did not increase the residual H2A.V levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Therefore, we considered other functions for DOM-A.C. The striking correlation between transcriptional responses upon TIP60 and DOM-A depletion suggests a unique association with functional relevance. Our mass-spectrometry analysis had identified several proteins that are homologous to corresponding subunits of the yeast NuA4 HAT complex. The core NuA4.C subunit EAF1 is a small protein with prominent N-terminal HSA and C-terminal SANT domains. DOM-A also features similarly arranged domains, but they are separated by the long ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This raises the question whether DOM-A might serve as the central subunit of a NuA4-type complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The existence of such a complex with functional and structural similarity to the well-studied yeast complex has not been reported so far. Since NuA4.C is responsible for histone acetylation, we looked at H3 and H4 acetylation changes upon DOM isoform-specific knock-down by targeted mass-spectrometry.</p><p>The hypothesis of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> NuA4.C poses the acetyltransferase TIP60 as the main effector of DOM-A.C. This is supported by the earlier finding that TIP60 is unstable in the absence of DOM-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We therefore included TIP60 knock-down for our targeted mass-spectrometry. Our analysis showed that RNAi against DOM-A, but not against DOM-B, specifically reduces H4K12ac (average 28.9% reduction) and, to a lesser extent, H4K5ac (average 23.1% reduction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, unsupervised clustering shows that depleting DOM-A or TIP60 lead to very similar changes in histone acetylation patterns: depletion of TIP60 also reduces H4K12ac, by on average 36.3% and H4K5ac by 16.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We sought to confirm the mass spectrometric result by an orthogonal ChIP-seq experiment.

Comparison between H4K12ac and transcription showed that genes downregulated in DOM-A or TIP60 knock-down tend to have higher basal levels of H4K12ac at promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). The reduction of H4K12ac by DOM-A or TIP60 knock-down, however, is global and does not affect some genes specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Remarkably, depletion of DOM-B caused an unexpected increase in H4K12 acetylation at many chromosomal regions that lose the mark upon DOM-A ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Depletion of H2A.V also causes a small H4K12ac increase similarly to DOM-B knock-down, as if the absence of this remodeler and/or its substrate allowed more DOM-A activity at promoters.</p><p>The yeast NuA4.C does not contain a functional ATPase at its core. To explore whether the acetylation of H4K12 catalyzed by the DOM-A.C depends on ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activity, we employed the same RNAi-based complementation strategy we had used for DOM-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). DOM-A was depleted and RNAi-resistant DOM-A wild-type or ATPase mutant derivatives were tested for their ability to rescue the loss of H4K12ac. As expected, the wild-type DOM-A transgene restored H4K12 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Remarkably, this acetylation did not depend on a functional DOM-A ATPase. Comparison of the mean H4K12ac signals in cells that do or do not express the transgene confirmed that both, the wild-type and the mutant transgenes, could restore H4K12ac levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our mass-spectrometry analysis of endogenously expressed DOM isoforms purified under stringent conditions revealed two separate complexes. A DOM.C was previously reported after overexpression and affinity-purification of tagged PONTIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kusch et al., 2004</xref>), which yielded a mixture of DOM-A and DOM-B complexes and may be contaminated with the dINO80 complex, which also contains PONTIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klymenko et al., 2006</xref>). In light of our results, we think the model for H2A.V exchange during DNA damage response proposed in this early work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kusch et al., 2004</xref>) should be re-visited accounting for the contribution of both DOM-A.C, DOM-B.C and possibly dINO80.C. It will be interesting to define the role of each complex on the recognition and restoration of damaged chromatin, especially at the level of H2A.V remodeling and acetylation-based signaling.</p><p>We previously showed that DOM-B, and not DOM-A or TIP60, affects H2A.V levels during fly oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Börner and Becker, 2016</xref>). In addition to confirming this finding in a different system and with complementary experimental approaches, we now also showed that the DOM-B.C is responsible for H2A.V incorporation into chromatin. The reaction requires ATP, like SWR1.C-mediated H2A.Z incorporation. We also discovered a previously unidentified subunit, ARP6, which is necessary for the maintenance of H2A.V global levels, just like DOM-B. In yeast SWR1.C and human SRCAP.C, the ARP6 orthologs are indispensable for nucleosome remodeling since they couple the ATPase motor to productive nucleosome sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Willhoft et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Willhoft and Wigley, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> DOM-B.C is likely to employ a similar remodeling mechanism. Knock-down of DOM-B affects transcription, but the effects overlap only partially with those that follow H2A.V depletion. This discrepancy could be explained in several ways. First, the reduction of H2A.V levels upon DOM-B knock-down is not as extensive as the one caused by direct depletion of H2A.V. The residual levels of H2A.V upon DOM-B depletion may suffice to regulate transcription at many promoters. Second, we cannot exclude that DOM-B.C also impacts transcription independently of H2A.V incorporation. Third, the global increase of H4K12ac at promoters upon DOM-B knock-down might indirectly compensate for the loss of H2A.V at some specific genes.</p><p>The DOM-A.C, surprisingly, did not affect H2A.V incorporation under physiological conditions in any of our assays, in agreement with what has been observed for the DOM-A isoform during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Börner and Becker, 2016</xref>). DOM-A.C lacks the ARP6 subunit that is a mechanistic requirement for nucleosome remodeling by INO80-type remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Willhoft and Wigley, 2020</xref>). Because the ATPase domain of DOM-A is identical to the one in DOM-B, it is possible that DOM-A utilizes ATP under circumstances that we did not monitor in our study. It is also possible that DOM-A.C-specific subunits have an inhibitory effect on DOM-A ATPase activity through allosteric regulation. Of note, the recombinant human ortholog of DOM-A, EP400, can incorporate H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2010</xref>), but H2A.Z levels are unaffected if EP400 is depleted in vivo, where it resides in a multi-subunit complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pradhan et al., 2016</xref>). Regulation of nucleosome remodeling through autoinhibitory domains or associated subunits is a widespread mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that the DOM-A.C is the functional equivalent of the yeast NuA4.C, which acetylates the H4 N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuo et al., 2015</xref>) and possibly other proteins. Depletion of DOM-A.C causes a significant reduction of H4K12ac at a global level. Some genomic regions that still retain a high H4K12ac ChIP signal in the absence of DOM-A may be explained by the presence of additional acetyltransferases targeting H4K12, such as CHAMEAU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peleg et al., 2016</xref>). The function of H4K12ac is still largely unknown in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, although it has been implicated in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peleg et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate that H4K12ac may participate in transcriptional regulation since knock-down of DOM-A or TIP60 perturb the transcriptional program in a very similar manner. Genes down-regulated upon DOM-A and TIP60 RNAi show high H4K12ac around their TSS, but the H4K12ac is not specifically reduced at their promoters. We speculate that these genes might rely more on H4K12ac for their expression or be more sensitive to changes in acetylation. Given that H4K12ac is the most abundant H4 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peleg et al., 2016</xref>), we also cannot exclude that some of these effects are due to global and aberrant chromosomal condensation. The increase in H4K12ac at promoter observed upon DOM-B RNAi appears to be partially phenocopied by the knock-down of H2A.V. It is possible that H2A-containing nucleosomes are a better substrate for the DOM-A.C compared to the ones containing only H2A.V. The loss of the variant might therefore result in higher H4K12ac catalyzed by TIP60.</p><p>In the absence of DOM-A, TIP60 is unstable suggesting that the DOM-A.C is the major form of TIP60, at least in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> cells. It also suggests that during evolution a HAT module and some components of the SWR1.C became stably associated in a new functional complex, the dNuA4.C, as it has been proposed for the human EP400 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auger et al., 2008</xref>). An intermediate case is found in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, where acetylation of EAF1 by TIP60 mediates a reversible association between the NuA4.C and SWR1.C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>). We found that the DOM-A.C H4K12 HAT activity does not need the DOM-A ATPase activity. In yeast, inserting the ATPase domain of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> DOM between the HSA and SANT domains of EAF1, the central subunit of the yeast NuA4, does not affect its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auger et al., 2008</xref>). Such a situation could also apply to DOM-A. Lastly, our mass-spectrometry analysis revealed new, uncharacterized interactors for DOM-A. Of those, the transcription factor CG12054 has been found as a potential DOM partner in a previous screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rhee et al., 2014</xref>). Its human ortholog, JAZF1, appears to be involved in transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakajima et al., 2004</xref>) and has been associated to endometrial stromal tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koontz et al., 2001</xref>). Its function in flies is unknown.</p><p>Division of labor between chromatin modifying enzymes is key to ensure efficient regulation of nuclear processes. During evolution, genome duplications and genetic divergence expand and diversify activities. The case of DOM illustrates beautifully how evolution can take different routes to achieve what must be assumed as an important functional specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In yeast, the SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are entirely separate entities. In humans, whose genomes underwent duplication events, the paralogous SRCAP and EP400 protein ATPases each organize different complexes that may serve distinct, conserved functions. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> a similar specialization was achieved by alternative splicing. Surprisingly, the gene orthologs of <italic>dom</italic> in honeybee (<italic>A. mellifera</italic>, LOC413341), jewel wasp (<italic>N. vitripennis,</italic> LOC100115939), Jerdon’s jumpin ant (<italic>H. saltator</italic>, LOC105183375), red flour beetle (<italic>T. castaneum</italic>, LOC656538) and even in the common house spider (<italic>P. tepidariorum</italic>, LOC107448208) undergo alternative splicing to generate at least two isoforms with different C-termini. The mode of specification of SWR1 and NuA4 through splice variants might therefore not be limited to <italic>Drosophila,</italic> but more wide-spread throughout the Arthropoda phylum.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Kc167</td><td valign="top">DGRC</td><td valign="top">FLYB;FBtc0000001</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">S2 (Clone L2-4)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Villa et al., 2016</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Gift from P Heun lab</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>D. virilis</italic>)</td><td valign="top">79f7Dv3</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albig et al., 2019</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Gift from BV Adrianov</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">DOM-A (17F4) <break/>(rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Börner and Becker, 2016</xref> and this publication</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">1:5 (WB)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">DOM-A <break/>(SA-8977) <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">This publication</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">1:1000 (WB)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">DOM-B (SA-8979) <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">This publication</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">1:1000 (WB)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">TIP60 (11B10) <break/>(rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">This publication</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">1:20 (WB)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">H2A.V (Rb-H2Av) <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Börner and Becker, 2016</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">1:1000 (WB) <break/>1:2500 (IF) <break/>25 μl/IP (ChIP)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">H4 <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">abcam</td><td valign="top">ab10158</td><td valign="top">1:5000 (WB)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">H4K12ac <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Merck-Millipore</td><td valign="top">07–595</td><td valign="top">1:2500 (IF) <break/>2 μl/IP (ChIP)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">FLAG-m2 <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">F3165</td><td valign="top">1:1000 (WB)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">GFP <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">11814460001</td><td valign="top">1:500 (IF)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Lamin <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Gift from H Saumweber</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">1:1000 (WB)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pENTR3C <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fischer Scientific</td><td valign="top">A10464</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pHWG (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">DGRC</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Kind gift from P Korber</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Plasmids, primers, cell lines and antibodies from this study are available upon request from Peter B Becker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sfb1064.med.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/becker_-peter/index.html">pbecker@bmc.med.lmu.de</ext-link>).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryonic Kc167 cell line was obtained from the <italic>Drosophila </italic>Genomic Resource Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/Home">https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/Home</ext-link>). <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> S2 (subclone L2-4) cell line was a kind gift of P Heun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Villa et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>D. virilis</italic> 79f7Dv3 cell line was a kind gift of BV Adrianov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albig et al., 2019</xref>).

this study shows that in flies and perhaps other insects this specialization is achieved by alternative splicing of the Domino ATPase. One version of the Domino complex is primarily involved in histone acetylation whereas the other is primarily involved in exchange of the histone variant H2Av.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are defined by DOMINO isoforms&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jerry L Workman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Vikki Weake (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are defined by DOMINO isoforms&quot; by Scacchetti et al. demonstrates that the two alternatively spliced products of <italic>domino</italic> (<italic>dom</italic>) form two distinct complexes: DOM-A.C and DOM-B.C. They further show that DOM-A.C resembles the human EP400 complex, which seems to be a joint complex containing the yeast NuA4.C and some components of the SWR1.C. This DOM-A.C contains TIP60 and may target H4K12 and K5, and its HAT activity does not depend on the ATPase activity of DOM-A. On the other hand, the DOM-B.C is more like the conventional SWR1 complex and is responsible for putting H2Av onto the chromatin. This manuscript clearly demonstrates an interesting example in evolution that, while mammals separate the functions of SWR1.C and NuA4.C by gene duplication, flies achieve the same result by alternative splicing. However, some clarifications and improvement of either statements or experimental data (ex. ChIP-seq) are needed as detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1—figure supplement 1A: Why is the size of the band of the DOM-A clone #2 different from those of the other two clones? According to the legend, they should all be 72 bp longer than in the untagged cells.</p><p>2) Figure 1C: The authors described that Mass-spectrometry revealed 13 and 12 interactors for DOM-A and DOM-B, respectively. And they said, &quot;of those, 8 are common between the two isoforms…&quot; However, only 7 common interactors can be found in Figure 1C: BRD8, DMAP1, GAS41, MRGBP, BAP55, YL-1 and MRG15.</p><p>3) Figure 1D: REPT, PONT and HCF seem to be missing in this figure. If the authors do not define REPT and PONT as specific interactors of DOM-B (as they are shown in yellow in Figure 1C; DOM-A), please clarify whether HCF is a specific interactor or not by putting it in Figure 1C (DOM-A) or in Figure 1D.</p><p>4) Figure 1E: It is very difficult to understand that anti-DOM-A showed a band in unbound with DOM-A IP but no band in unbound with DOM-B IP (the DOM-A levels are similar in input). Also, since anti-DOM-A and anti-DOM-B can detect a band in unbound with DOM-A IP, it is awkward that there were no bands in unbound with no tag (input showed similar levels).</p><p>5) Figure 2: The main conclusion of this manuscript is that the DOM-A.C regulates transcription by acetylating H4K12 and the DOM-B.C regulates transcription by incorporating H2Av genome-wide. However, in Figure 2B, while the transcriptome profiles from cells treated with dsRNAs against DOM-A or TIP60 are closely positioned, those from cells treated with dsRNAs against DOM-B or H2Av are far apart (PC1/PC2). Furthermore, the r values of DOM-B data sets compared with DOM-A or H2Av are 0.45 (Figure 2C) or 0.51 (Figure 2D), respectively, which are pretty similar. If the transcriptional responses upon loss of DOM-A or DOM-B are &quot;clearly different&quot;, then those upon loss of DOM-B or H2Av are also clearly different.</p><p>The authors tried to explain this discrepancy in Discussion: &quot;DOM-B.C may also impact transcription independent of H2Av incorporation, as has been found for SWR1 (Morillo-Huesca et al., 2010).&quot; However, this cited reference actually demonstrated that the genome-wide transcriptional misregulation in htz1d strain can be rescued by inactivation or deletion of SWR1. This result suggests that &quot;SWR1 affects chromatin integrity because of an attempt to replace H2A with Htz1 in the absence of the latter&quot;, which further connects the function of SWR1 with Htz1. Therefore, the authors need to provide a more solid explanation for the discrepancy between the transcriptional responses upon loss of DOM-B or H2Av, in order to claim the main conclusion of this manuscript.</p><p>6) Figure 3—figure supplement 1C: An RT-qPCR control to show the knockdown efficiencies of all DOM-A.C or DOM-B.C components is required to claim &quot;only RNAi against the DOM-B.C-specific subunit ARP6 reduced H2Av levels to a similar extent.&quot;</p><p>7) Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1: Based on the labeling in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D, it seems that the B_1 sample was omitted from the analysis. The reason to omit this sample cannot be found in the Materials and methods. Please provide the reason.</p><p>8) Figure 4—figure supplement 1B: Upon TIP60 knock-down, while 1338 genes were down-regulated (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B), the H4K12ac and H4K5ac levels were only reduced 29% and 23%, respectively. Is H4K12ac levels reduced specifically at those 1338 genes? Similarly, this question also applies to DOM-A knock-down. The correlation between the down-regulated genes and the sites with reduced H4K12ac occupancies upon TIP60 or DOM-A knock-down is needed.</p><p>9) Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-F: The changes in H3K14ac and H3K23ac upon DOM-A or TIP60 RNAi are not very consistent between replicates (A_1 is even outside the clustering and B_3 is within two replicates of TIP60). Also, the text regarding Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-F are all descriptive without any interpretation about the possible biological meaning of these results.</p><p>10) Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1G: The replicates of TIP60 and DOM-A RNAi are not consistent. For example, the middle track of TIP60 apparently shows more reads across the whole region (Figure 4B). Also, the middle track of DOM-A apparently shows less reads. More obviously, in Figure 4—figure supplement 1G, the correlation coefficients between TIP60_2 and _1/_1.2 are 0.58 and 0.4, which are very low as biological replicates. Even between TIP60_1 and _1.2, the coefficient is as low as 0.64. Also, the coefficients between A2 and A1/A1.2 are also too low (0.63). These data sets need to be improved.</p><p>11) Figure 4B, C: The authors propose that the increase in H4K12ac upon DOM-B RNAi may be due to absence of DOM-B allowing more DOM-A activity. Does it work through loss of H2Av incorporation? The authors may test their hypothesis by H4K12ac ChIP-qPCR in H2Av or DOM-B RNAi cells at some representative loci.</p><p>12) The authors mentioned that the model for H2Av exchange during DNA damage proposed in Kusch et al. should be re-visited because the purified complex may be a mixture of DOM-A.C, DOM-B.C and maybe dINO80.C. However, this early work did knock down TIP60, a specific component of DOM-A.C, and showed that the removal of phosphorylated H2Av is delayed after DNA damage. This result actually suggests a possible link between DOM-A.C and DOM-B.C under DNA damage stress. Otherwise, DOM-A.C itself may have activity to exchange H2Av upon DNA damage. The authors should test whether DOM-A.C and DOM-B.C functionally interact with each other upon DNA damage or DOM-A.C can perform H2Av exchange upon DNA damage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56325.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1—figure supplement 1A: Why is the size of the band of the DOM-A clone #2 different from those of the other two clones?

We don’t know the nature and the origin of this insertion but, as both DOM-A protein expression, protein size (Figure 1B) and interactome (Supplementary file 1) in clone #2 don’t show major differences compared to the other clones, we consider this as a silent insertion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1C: The authors described that Mass-spectrometry revealed 13 and 12 interactors for DOM-A and DOM-B, respectively. And they said, &quot;of those, 8 are common between the two isoforms…&quot; However, only 7 common interactors can be found in Figure 1C: BRD8, DMAP1, GAS41, MRGBP, BAP55, YL-1 and MRG15.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct, the common interactors are indeed 7 and not 8. By mistake, we considered DOM itself as a common interactor. We now updated the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1D: REPT, PONT and HCF seem to be missing in this figure. If the authors do not define REPT and PONT as specific interactors of DOM-B (as they are shown in yellow in Figure 1C; DOM-A), please clarify whether HCF is a specific interactor or not by putting it in Figure 1C (DOM-A) or in Figure 1D.</p></disp-quote><p>We define as isoform-specific interactors those proteins that are significantly enriched (false discovery rate &lt; 0.05) in the affinity purification of one or the other isoform when the pulldowns are compared (Figure 1D). No data point was excluded from the plot in Figure 1D, and the results of the statistical analysis are found in Supplementary file 1. PONT, REPT and HCF do not meet the significance criteria (FDR &gt; 0.05) and are therefore not considered isoform-specific interactors. For clarity, HCF is now added to the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1E: It is very difficult to understand that anti-DOM-A showed a band in unbound with DOM-A IP but no band in unbound with DOM-B IP (the DOM-A levels are similar in input). Also, since anti-DOM-A and anti-DOM-B can detect a band in unbound with DOM-A IP, it is awkward that there were no bands in unbound with no tag (input showed similar levels).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for spotting this inconsistency. We could not easily explain these results unless referring to loading mistakes. Therefore, we repeated the immunoprecipitation with two different sets of clones and following the exact procedure we used for mass spectrometry (including benzonase treatment). The results are shown in Figure 1E and Figure 1 —figure supplement 1C) both DOM-A and DOM-B bands could be detected in the unbound fraction of the no-tag control and 2) we could see a reduction in intensity in the unbound fraction in the corresponding IP samples (more for DOM-B, less for DOM-A). The main text was modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2: The main conclusion of this manuscript is that the DOM-A.C regulates transcription by acetylating H4K12 and the DOM-B.C regulates transcription by incorporating H2Av genome-wide. However, in Figure 2B, while the transcriptome profiles from cells treated with dsRNAs against DOM-A or TIP60 are closely positioned, those from cells treated with dsRNAs against DOM-B or H2Av are far apart (PC1/PC2). Furthermore, the r values of DOM-B data sets compared with DOM-A or H2Av are 0.45 (Figure 2C) or 0.51 (Figure 2D), respectively, which are pretty similar. If the transcriptional responses upon loss of DOM-A or DOM-B are &quot;clearly different&quot;, then those upon loss of DOM-B or H2Av are also clearly different.</p><p>The authors tried to explain this discrepancy in Discussion: &quot;DOM-B.C may also impact transcription independent of H2Av incorporation, as has been found for SWR1 (Morillo-Huesca et al., 2010).&quot; However, this cited reference actually demonstrated that the genome-wide transcriptional misregulation in htz1d strain can be rescued by inactivation or deletion of SWR1. This result suggests that &quot;SWR1 affects chromatin integrity because of an attempt to replace H2A with Htz1 in the absence of the latter&quot;, which further connects the function of SWR1 with Htz1. Therefore, the authors need to provide a more solid explanation for the discrepancy between the transcriptional responses upon loss of DOM-B or H2Av, in order to claim the main conclusion of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are right: correlation values of 0.51 and 0.45 are in a similar range. They show that the two compared data sets are different yet contain many co-regulated genes. When it comes to comparing the correlation of depletion profiles for either DOM-A or DOM-B with H2A.V, the difference is clear: The correlation of DOM-A with H2A.V is 0.25, while the correlation between DOM-B and H2A.V is 0.51. This substantiates our conclusion that many effects of DOM-B depletion can be explained by H2A.V depletion. The revised text now reads: “The effects of H2A.V depletion were better correlated to DOM-B (r=0.51) than to DOM-A knock-down (r=0.25) (Figure 2B, D). Obviously, many effects of DOM-B depletion may be explained by its H2A.V deposition function, but the ATPase also affects transcription through different routes”.</p><p>The correlation of DOM-A and DOM-B depletion transcriptomes of 0.45 shows that many genes are regulated by both proteins, but around 2500 genes are affected differently by DOM-A or DOM-B knockdown (see Figure 2 —figure supplement 1B, last panel). We revised the text to better describe the results, by adding the following sentences: “The correlation value of 0.45 indicates that many genes are regulated similarly by both ATPases, but a significant number of genes are also differentially affected based upon depletion of either DOM-A or DOM-B (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1B)”.</p><p>We removed the reference to the paper Morillo-Huesca et al. from the discussion since upon further inspection we found the data presented there can be interpreted in different ways and the reference does not clarify the issue. The revised text now reads: “This discrepancy could be explained in several ways. […] Third, the global increase of H4K12ac at promoters upon DOM-B knock-down might indirectly compensate for the loss of H2A.V at some specific genes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3—figure supplement 1C: An RT-qPCR control to show the knockdown efficiencies of all DOM-A.C or DOM-B.C components is required to claim &quot;only RNAi against the DOM-B.C-specific subunit ARP6 reduced H2Av levels to a similar extent.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Results of qPCR analysis are now included in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1D. As shown in the figure, with the exception of <italic>Nipped-A</italic>, the mRNA of the other subunits is reduced efficiently without major differences between the targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1: Based on the labeling in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D, it seems that the B_1 sample was omitted from the analysis. The reason to omit this sample cannot be found in the Materials and methods. Please provide the reason.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the figure legend, only 3 replicates for DOM-B where analyzed and none of the replicates was excluded from the analysis. For clarity we re-numbered the samples from _1 to _3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 4—figure supplement 1B: Upon TIP60 knock-down, while 1338 genes were down-regulated (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B), the H4K12ac and H4K5ac levels were only reduced 29% and 23%, respectively. Is H4K12ac levels reduced specifically at those 1338 genes? SImilarly, this question also applies to DOM-A knock-down. The correlation between the down-regulated genes and the sites with reduced H4K12ac occupancies upon TIP60 or DOM-A knock-down is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We correlated the basal H4K12ac signal (i.e. control RNAi) at promoters of genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated in the knockdown of DOM-A or TIP60, and the results can now be found in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1G. We observed that in both cases down-regulated genes are more enriched in H4K12ac at their promoters in steady state. We then looked at the log2 fold-change (TIP60 or DOM-A knock-down versus control) of H4K12ac signal at promoters of the same gene classes (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1H). For both TIP60 and DOM-A RNAi, H4K12ac is reduced globally and not specifically at the significantly mis-regulated genes (although there is a trend of stronger H4K12ac loss at promoters of downregulated genes).</p><p>These findings are now presented as Figure 4 —figure supplement 1G, H, I and discussed in the main text. In the Discussion we speculate that these genes might rely more on H4K12ac for their expression or be more sensitive to changes in acetylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-F: The changes in H3K14ac and H3K23ac upon DOM-A or TIP60 RNAi are not very consistent between replicates (A_1 is even outside the clustering and B_3 is within two replicates of TIP60). Also, the text regarding Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-F are all descriptive without any interpretation about the possible biological meaning of these results.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the variability and the fact that little is known about the biological functions of these modifications in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we decided to remove the plot. Raw data, along with other modifications measured but not described, is still available in Supplementary file 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1G: The replicates of TIP60 and DOM-A RNAi are not consistent. For example, the middle track of TIP60 apparently shows more reads across the whole region (Figure 4B). Also, the middle track of DOM-A apparently shows less reads. More obviously, in Figure 4—figure supplement 1G, the correlation coefficients between TIP60_2 and _1/_1.2 are 0.58 and 0.4, which are very low as biological replicates. Even between TIP60_1 and _1.2, the coefficient is as low as 0.64. Also, the coefficients between A2 and A1/A1.2 are also too low (0.63). These data sets need to be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the quality of the dataset is borderline, because the H4K12ac ChIP is not very efficient. Unfortunately, this is the first profiling of this modification and so there is no published dataset for reference. While we controlled for most of the critical variables (e.g. knock-down efficiency, MNase digestion, spike-in amounts, etc.) we still observe high variability between replicates. In the case of TIP60 knock-down, despite variability, we still observe a significant global loss of H4K12ac. We now alerted the reader to these shortcomings in the text: “We found the H4K12ac signal reduced in many regions of the genome, including promoters and transcriptional termination sites, upon TIP60 RNAi and to a lesser extent upon DOM-A RNAi (Figure 4B,C, Figure 4 —figure supplement 1F,H,I), but the results suffer from variability probably due to a low ChIP efficiency of the H4K12ac antibody (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1F).”. Additionally, to reduce the noise of the data, we re-calculated TSS/TTS coverages and correlation coefficients using the expressed genes (N=10138) instead of all genes (N = 17549). The overall results are not changed but the correlation coefficients between biological replicates are a bit higher (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1F).</p><p>If you insist, we can add additional replicates, but due to the shut-down of our facilities this may take some time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 4B,C: The authors propose that the increase in H4K12ac upon DOM-B RNAi may be due to absence of DOM-B allowing more DOM-A activity. Does it work through loss of H2Av incorporation? The authors may test their hypothesis by H4K12ac ChIP-qPCR in H2Av or DOM-B RNAi cells at some representative loci.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed H4K12ac ChIPseq upon H2A.V knockdown, now included in Figure 4 and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1 and the text. As in the case of DOM-B RNAi, we observe an increase in H4K12ac signal at promoters when H2A.V is depleted – although the magnitude of the effect is lower. We speculate that DOM-B effects on H4K12ac might be, at least partially, dependent on its ability to incorporate H2A.V. We now provide a possible explanation in the Discussion: “The increase in H4K12ac at promoter observed upon DOM-B RNAi appears to be partially phenocopied by the knock-down of H2A.V. It is possible that H2A-containing nucleosomes are a better substrate for the DOM-A.C compared to the ones containing only H2A.V. The loss of the variant might therefore result in higher H4K12ac catalyzed by TIP60”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The authors mentioned that the model for H2Av exchange during DNA damage proposed in Kusch et al. should be re-visited because the purified complex may be a mixture of DOM-A.C, DOM-B.C and maybe dINO80.C. However, this early work did knock down TIP60, a specific component of DOM-A.C, and showed that the removal of phosphorylated H2Av is delayed after DNA damage. This result actually suggests a possible link between DOM-A.C and DOM-B.C under DNA damage stress. Otherwise, DOM-A.C itself may have activity to exchange H2Av upon DNA damage. The authors should test whether DOM-A.C and DOM-B.C functionally interact with each other upon DNA damage or DOM-A.C can perform H2Av exchange upon DNA damage.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of our work was to define the molecular signatures of DOM-A and DOM-B complexes the context of transcription. The characterization of their role during DNA damage response/repair is of great interest and warrants a deep and thorough investigation. Given the complexity of DNA damage response, teasing apart the effects of the two DOM complexes and H2A.V on DNA repair is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Nevertheless, we think this is a necessary and natural continuation of our current work and we added the following sentence to the Discussion: “It will be interesting to define the role of each complex on the recognition and restoration of damaged chromatin, especially at the level of H2A.V remodeling and acetylation-based signaling”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
