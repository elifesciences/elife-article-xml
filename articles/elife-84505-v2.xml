bacterial actin MreB assembles into dynamic membrane-associated filamentous structures that exhibit circumferential motion around the cell. Current knowledge of MreB biochemical and polymerization properties <italic>in vitro</italic> remains limited and is mostly based on MreB proteins from Gram-negative species. In this study, we report the first observation of organized protofilaments by electron microscopy and the first 3D-structure of MreB from a Gram-positive bacterium. We show that <italic>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</italic> MreB forms straight pairs of protofilaments on lipid surfaces in the presence of ATP or GTP, but not in the presence of ADP, GDP or non-hydrolysable ATP analogs. We demonstrate that membrane anchoring is mediated by two spatially close short hydrophobic sequences while electrostatic interactions also contribute to lipid binding, and show that the population of membrane-bound protofilament doublets is in steady-state. In solution, protofilament doublets were not detected in any condition tested. Instead, MreB formed large sheets regardless of the bound nucleotide, albeit at a higher critical concentration. Altogether, our results indicate that both lipids and ATP are facilitators of MreB polymerization, and are consistent with a dual effect of ATP hydrolysis, in promoting both membrane binding and filaments assembly/disassembly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin-like MreB</kwd><kwd>polymerization</kwd><kwd>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</kwd><kwd>crystal structure</kwd><kwd>ATPase</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-SG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carballido-Lopez</surname><given-names>Rut</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-CG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carballido-Lopez</surname><given-names>Rut</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX0038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bertin</surname><given-names>Aurélie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bertin</surname><given-names>Aurélie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>VolkswagenStiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Renner</surname><given-names>Lars D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INSB-05-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nessler</surname><given-names>Sylvie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>311231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carballido-Lopez</surname><given-names>Rut</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>772178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carballido-Lopez</surname><given-names>Rut</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>First 3D-structure and first observation of organized protofilaments of MreB from a Gram-positive bacterium, suggesting a model where ATP drives the formation of dynamic pairs of MreB protofilaments on a lipid surface.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytoskeletal proteins are known to polymerize into filaments that play critical roles in various aspects of cell physiology, including cell shape, mechanical strength and motion, cytokinesis, chromosome partitioning and intracellular transport. Prokaryotic cells contain homologs of the main eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins, namely actin, tubulin and intermediate filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabeen and Jacobs-Wagner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lin and Thanbichler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shaevitz and Gitai, 2010</xref>), which were identified decades after their eukaryotic counterparts. In 2001, MreB proteins of the Gram-positive model bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> were found to form filamentous structures underneath the cytoplasmic membrane and to play a key role in the determination and maintenance of rod-shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carballido-Lopez, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jones et al., 2001</xref>). Soon after, the three-dimensional structure of one of the two MreB isoforms from the Gram-negative thermophilic bacterium <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> (MreB<sup>Tm</sup>) was solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>), confirming its structural homology with actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bork et al., 1992</xref>). Besides, MreB<sup>Tm</sup> in solution was shown to assemble into filaments similar to filamentous actin (F-actin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Research in the field of eukaryotic actin historically focused on elucidating structure-function relationships from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. The availability of large amounts of soluble actin purified from several cell types since the 1940s enabled decades of mechanistic studies on actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pollard, 2016</xref>). In contrast, MreB from mesophilic bacteria proved particularly difficult to purify in a soluble form, thwarting efforts to perform <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Instead, research on MreB primarily focused on cellular studies, driven by the advent of fluorescent microscopy in bacterial cell biology. Over the past two decades, the subcellular localization and dynamics of MreB have been described in several Gram-negative and Gram-positive species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billaudeau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billaudeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dion et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Olshausen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oswald et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ouzounov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Renner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schirner et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, MreB proteins form discrete, nanometer-long, membrane-associated polymeric assemblies along the cell cylinder that move processively around the rod circumference together with proteins of the cell wall (CW) elongation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Domínguez-Escobar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van Teeffelen et al., 2011</xref>), forming the so-called Rod complex. The motility of the Rod complex is driven by CW synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Domínguez-Escobar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van Teeffelen et al., 2011</xref>) and MreB assemblies self-align circumferentially, along their direction of motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billaudeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, it was proposed that the specific intrinsic curvature of MreB polymers increases their affinity for the greatest concave (negative) membrane curvature within the cell, that is the inner surface of the rod circumference, accounting for their orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>). The current model is that self-aligned MreB filaments restrict the diffusion of CW biosynthetic proteins in the membrane and orient their motion to insert new peptidoglycan strands in radial hoops perpendicular to the long axis of the cell, promoting the cylindrical expansion of rod-shaped cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Domínguez-Escobar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>). However, many questions remain to be answered. What prompts the assembly of MreB on the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane? What is the architecture of the membrane-associated MreB polymeric assemblies and how is it controlled? How is their distribution along the cell cylinder regulated? What is the length of individual MreB filaments within these assemblies and how is it controlled? Are the filaments stable? Do they exhibit turnover like actin filaments? <italic>In vivo</italic>, the length of MreB filamentous assemblies can be affected by the intracellular concentration of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billaudeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Salje et al., 2011</xref>), but seems to have little impact on MreB function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billaudeau et al., 2019</xref>). No turnover of MreB assemblies was detected <italic>in vivo</italic>, at least relative to their motion around the cell circumference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Domínguez-Escobar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van Teeffelen et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, MreB polymers are believed to be quite stable despite their motion in the cell. To elucidate in detail the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of MreB, it remains necessary to understand their biochemical and polymerization properties. The majority of biochemical and structural studies on MreB proteins originally focused on the highly soluble Gram-negative MreB<sup>Tm</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bean and Amann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Esue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Popp et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van den Ent et al., 2010</xref>). The tendency to aggregation upon purification hampered most <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of MreBs from other species. Over the last decade, purification and polymerization assays were nevertheless reported for MreBs from several Gram-negative bacteria, from the Gram-positive <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (MreB<sup>Bs</sup>) and from wall-less <italic>Chlamydophila</italic> and <italic>Spiroplasma</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dersch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaballah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maeda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mayer and Amann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nurse and Marians, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pande et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Salje et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Takahashi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van den Ent et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Direct binding to the cell membrane was shown for MreB from the Gram-negative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (MreB<sup>Ec</sup>) and <italic>T. maritima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Salje et al., 2011</xref>) and, more recently, for MreB from <italic>Spiroplasma citri</italic> (MreB5<sup>Sc</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harne et al., 2020</xref>). The N-terminal amphipathic helix of MreB<sup>Ec</sup> was found to be necessary for membrane binding and also to cause the full-length purified protein to aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Salje et al., 2011</xref>).

We therefore tested how higher salt concentrations affect the properties of MreB polymers. At 500 mM KCl, MreB<sup>Gs</sup> readily polymerized into straight pairs of filaments as well, which also distorted liposomes but did not induce negative curvature. Instead, they faceted and tubulated the liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>), suggesting that high salt concentration increases the stiffness of MreB filaments and/or of the membrane.

An analysis of nucleotide-bound crystal structures of MreB<sup>Cc</sup> also suggested that ATP binding may trigger the transition to the double-protofilament conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pande et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, liposome binding studies of MreB5<sup>Sc</sup> pointed to an allosteric effect of ATP binding and hydrolysis for effective polymerization and membrane binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pande et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We then wondered about the specificity of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> toward nucleotides and their role in polymerization on a lipid membrane. MreB<sup>Gs</sup> formed straight pairs of protofilaments and sheets in the presence of either ATP or GTP, as shown by negative stain EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Noteworthy, the average length of double filaments displayed an approximately twofold increase in the presence of GTP compared to ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The significance of this observation is unclear at present but it may reflect differential affinity, dissociation rate or hydrolytic activity of the two nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs). Next, we asked whether formation of pairs of filaments required nucleotide hydrolysis and tested if nucleotides diphosphate or non-hydrolysable ATP analogues would also support polymer assembly. Virtually no double filaments were observed when ATP/GTP was replaced by ADP, GDP, AMP-PNP, or ApCpp (5′‐adenylyl methylenediphosphate), either in the presence or in the absence of lipids, in our standard polymerization conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, differential affinity of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> for these nucleotides, or a higher critical concentration for MreB<sup>Gs</sup> to polymerize in their presence could also explain these results. Both actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooke and Murdoch, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iyengar and Weber, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kinosian et al., 1993</xref>) and MreB<sup>Cc</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van den Ent et al., 2014</xref>) have the highest affinity for ATP, followed by ADP and then by AMP-PNP. Similarly, the critical concentration of actin polymerized with ADP is about 18-fold higher than with ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fujiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pollard, 1986</xref>), while the critical concentration of <italic>Thermotoga</italic> and <italic>Spiroplasma</italic> ADP-MreBs was reported to be approximately threefold and twofold higher, respectively, than that of ATP-MreBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bean and Amann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Takahashi et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, the critical concentration of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MreB deduced from light scattering experiments was 0.9 µM regardless of the nucleotide species bound, and even in the absence of nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mayer and Amann, 2009</xref>). To exclude that the absence of polymerization was due to reduced nucleotide binding, we first increased the concentration of ADP and AMP-PNP from 2 mM to 50 mM. Again, no polymers were detected in the negatively stained samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we performed a competition experiment by mixing ATP (1 mM) with increasing amounts of AMP-PNP (1, 10 and 25 mM) in the polymerization reaction.

To address this question, we turned to quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) to measure the binding affinity of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> to supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) of various lipid mixtures. QCM-D is a surface-sensitive technique that can be used to measure biomolecular interactions at aqueous interfaces in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reviakine et al., 2011</xref>). Changes in frequency (Δ<italic>f</italic>) and dissipation (Δ<italic>D</italic>) are recorded. The frequency is directly proportional to any mass added or removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sauerbrey, 1959</xref>), while dissipation changes are indicative of the viscoelastic properties of the attached layer.

Although lipid proportions vary widely depending on the strains and growth conditions, PE is largely dominant in <italic>E. coli</italic> while PG is more dominant in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, indicating that phospholipids are more negatively charged in Gram-positive membranes. To mimic <italic>Bacillus</italic> membranes in our QCM-D assay, we used mixtures of the zwitterionic dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) doped with the anionic dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) in various ratios (DOPC:DOPG 100:0, 90:10 or 80:20) to generate SLBs. DOPC was selected to replace PE because of its widespread role as a scaffold lipid in SLBs formation. We had to adopt a mixture that enabled us to form SLBs on planar substrates, as the inverted conical shape of PE makes the formation of planar SLBs difficult (PE tends to form non-bilayer structures because of its small headgroup). A typical SLBs signature experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>. Briefly, SLBs are formed after the adsorption of liposomes (Δ<italic>f</italic> decrease, Δ<italic>D</italic> increase) onto activated silica surfaces. Once a critical surface concentration of liposomes is reached and the interactions between liposomes and the surface are suitable, the liposomes spontaneously rupture and coalesce into flat SLBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keller et al., 2000</xref>). After the formation of stable and flat SLBs (i.e. a stable baseline for frequency and dissipation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>), we started to add MreB<sup>Gs</sup> to the SLBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>, closed arrows). We recorded frequency and dissipation changes for the added MreB<sup>Gs</sup> protein in varying concentrations on all SLBs. Binding was strongly dependent on ATP and was substantially affected by the lipid composition of SLBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>). Increasing the levels of DOPG led to a higher amount of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> binding, with DOPC:PG 80:20 giving the highest observed adsorption, suggesting that the presence of negatively charged lipids favors MreB<sup>Gs</sup> binding to the membrane. In the presence of ATP, binding was detected almost instantaneously after adding MreB<sup>Gs</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>, closed arrows) for all concentrations of MreB tested, either above or below the concentration in which polymers were observed by EM on a lipid monolayer (0.55 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Interestingly, a shift in frequency was detected even at 0.1 µM MreB, well below the critical ATP-MreB concentration, suggesting that MreB monomers might bind too (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B and E, F</xref>).

Upon rinsing with the same buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>, open arrows), MreB<sup>Gs</sup> at low concentration (0.1 µM) was almost completely removed from the membrane while at higher concentration (1 µM) it remained stably absorbed. When replacing ATP with ADP or AMP-PNP, we were not able to detect any significant binding at either low or high concentrations of MreB, indicating a virtually complete loss of interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D and F</xref>). We further increased the concentration of ADP or AMP-PNP to exclude the possibility that the binding was simply affected by a decreased affinity of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> for these nucleotides. Higher concentrations of ADP and AMP-PNP did not restore the binding of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> to the SLBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that nucleotide hydrolysis drives MreB<sup>Gs</sup> membrane binding. Because some binding was detected at 0.1 µM MreB in the presence of ATP but not of ADP and AMP-PNP, it is tempting to speculate that lipid binding might occur prior to polymerization into pairs of filaments on the membrane surface.</p><p>Finally, we used the Sauerbrey model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sauerbrey, 1959</xref>) to calculate the average coverage and thickness of the layer of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> attached to the SLB. The thickness of the MreB films ranged from 0.1 nm to approximately 4 nm on the SLBs with an 80:20 ratio of DOPC:DOPG, which corresponds to ~2.5% to 100% coverage assuming a monolayer filament thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3H</xref> and Materials and methods). These data suggest that MreB<sup>Gs</sup> mainly form monolayers on the SLBs, with limited out-of-plane interactions (i.e. limited tendency to stack into multilayers), consistent with our EM observations of pairs of filaments and sheets lying flat on the lipid monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>) and with the pattern displayed by the filaments on cross-sections of vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), and thus with the interaction of the membrane with a specific surface of the MreB<sup>Gs</sup> filaments. Taken together, these observations suggest an oriented arrangement of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> filaments on the membrane, with lateral interactions between filaments in the plane perpendicular to their membrane-binding surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The hydrophobic amino-terminus and α2-β7 loop of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> are required for membrane anchoring alongside with electrostatic interactions</title><p>Membrane binding of MreB<sup>Tm</sup> is mediated by a small loop containing two hydrophobic residues (L93 and F94), whereas binding of MreB<sup>Ec</sup> and MreB<sup>Cc</sup> is mediated by an amino-terminal extension (9 residues) predicted as an amphipathic helix, which is disordered in all crystal structures of MreB<sup>Cc</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Salje et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van den Ent et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, green highlights).

We noticed that in the crystal structure of the apo form of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> this short hydrophobic N-terminal sequence is in close proximity to loop α2-β7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which in MreB<sup>Tm</sup> carries the hydrophobic residues L93 and F94 involved in membrane binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Salje et al., 2011</xref>).

Folding of the protein was not affected by the deletions as shown by circular dichroism (CD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). To comparatively analyze membrane binding of these mutants, we first examined their polymerization at high-salt concentration (500 mM KCl). We reasoned that high salt would reduce the contribution of electrostatic interactions to membrane binding by screening the charges of the anionic lipids in the membrane, allowing to better assess the contribution of the short hydrophobic sequences to membrane anchoring. The three mutants and the wild-type MreB<sup>Gs</sup> protein were set to polymerize in the presence of lipids and the formation of filaments was assessed by negative stain EM. The three mutants displayed a dramatic reduction in the formation of double filaments in the EM fields relative to the wild-type, with a gradation of defects, with the deletion of the GLFA sequence having the least effect and the double deletion having the greatest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A similar gradient of phenotypes was observed at lower salt concentration (100 mM KCl) but the overall number of filaments detected on the membrane surface was increased as expected, consistent with electrostatic interactions also contributing to lipid binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

The crystals diffracted in space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The electron density map clearly revealed the presence of three phosphates, demonstrating that the ATP had not been hydrolyzed into ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref>). This is probably due to the absence of a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in the catalytic site. No residual electron density peak could be interpreted as a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion with appropriate coordination. As a consequence, the binding mode of the nucleotide is distinct from other MreB structures, with the γ-phosphate located in the Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5B</xref>).

Our EM and QCM-D results suggested that ATP hydrolysis by MreB<sup>Gs</sup> may be required for efficient membrane binding and polymerization, and thus that hydrolysis may occur in solution also. We monitored ATPase activity by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) in the presence of ATP for a wide range of MreB concentrations, in the presence and in the absence of lipids. In our standard polymerization conditions, in the absence of lipids and at 53 °C (a temperature close to the optimal growth temperature of <italic>G. stearothermophilus</italic>), we observed a constant release of P<sub>i</sub> over time, with an equilibrium rate of P<sub>i</sub> dissociation of 0.198±0.008 P<sub>i</sub>/min/MreB molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Similar rates were observed when the incubations were performed at a higher KCl concentration (500 mM), with 0.158±0.003 and 0.081±0.004 P<sub>i</sub>/min/MreB with and without lipids, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>).

These rates of P<sub>i</sub> release in the presence of ATP (~1 P<sub>i</sub>/MreB in 5 min at 53 °C) are comparable to those observed for MreB<sup>Tm</sup> and MreB<sup>Ec</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Esue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nurse and Marians, 2013</xref>), and also remarkably similar to the rate of the (very slow) dissociation of γ-phosphate after ATP hydrolysis within actin filaments, which has a half-time of ∼6 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlier and Pantaloni, 1986</xref>). Interestingly, the release of P<sub>i</sub> was constant over the length of our ATPase experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, similar density and lengths of negatively stained MreB<sup>Gs</sup> polymers were observed over the EM grids for all incubation (polymerization) times tested, ranging from a few minutes to several hours. This suggests that after a fast polymerization step, either (i) filaments remain stable and release P<sub>i</sub> constantly but very slowly, or (ii) P<sub>i</sub> release reflects the turnover of the filaments. To test these hypotheses, we performed a series of semi-quantitative TEM experiments in the presence of a limiting concentration of ATP. We reasoned that if the population of filaments is in steady-state, polymerization should be unaffected at early time points but polymer density would decrease as ATP gets depleted and, conversely, if the polymers are static, they should not be affected over time. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> a similar density of double protofilaments was observed on the lipid monolayer at early time points at both saturating and limiting concentrations of ATP. However, polymers progressively disappeared over time in the presence of limiting concentrations of ATP, but not when ATP was in excess.

In the presence of lipids, the rate of P<sub>i</sub> release of all mutants was reduced relative to the wild-type MreB<sup>Gs</sup>, and overall P<sub>i</sub> release rates were significantly reduced at high salt (500 mM KCl) relative to low salt (100 mM KCl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). At 100 mM KCl, the mutant deleted for both the GLFA and the N-terminus hydrophobic sequences was the only one severely impacted in P<sub>i</sub> release rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), as it was in the formation of filaments on a lipid surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We concluded that the release of P<sub>i</sub> by the wild-type and membrane-binding mutants in the presence of lipids was consistent with the density of double filaments observed in the EM fields.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the presence of lipids is not required for the ATPase/GTPase activity of MreB<sup>Gs</sup>. However, P<sub>i</sub> release is enhanced in the presence of lipids, advocating for some conformational changes upon binding of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> to the membrane and/or upon polymerization on the lipid surface. Furthermore, we show that pairs of filaments formed on a lipid surface are at steady-state, undergoing a dynamic, ATP-driven assembly/disassembly process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we show that bacterial actin MreB from the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>G. stearothermophilus</italic> polymerizes into pairs of protofilaments on lipid surfaces and that this process is dynamic, with steady-state polymerization/depolymerization of the population of filaments. If individual double filaments are antiparallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van den Ent et al., 2014</xref>), they are structurally nonpolar and thus their disassembly could result either from dynamic instability or from steady-state fluctuations (growing and shrinking) of the filaments ends. The requirement for a membrane is consistent with the observation that <italic>in vivo</italic> MreB polymeric assemblies are membrane-associated (i.e. localize at the cell periphery), in line with their role as scaffold of the CW elongation machinery. Membrane binding of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> is direct and mediated by the hydrophobic α2-β7 loop protruding from the protein in domain IA, consistent with the prediction by Salje and colleagues that binding to membranes via such a hydrophobic loop and/or an amphipathic helix may be conserved for all MreBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Salje et al., 2011</xref>). However, we found that MreB<sup>Gs</sup> membrane binding is also mediated by the hydrophobic N-terminus, which together with the spatially closed α2-β7 loop would constitute a membrane anchor, as well as by electrostatic interactions, possibly through the positively charged residues around the membrane insertion hydrophobic region. The absence of an amphipathic helix and the presence instead of a hydrophobic N-terminus in many MreB sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggest that most MreB use one or the other amino-terminal structure to bind to membranes.</p><p>Another important finding concerns the role of NTP in MreB<sup>Gs</sup> membrane binding and formation of double protofilaments on a lipid surface. In the absence of lipids, MreBs from Gram-negative bacteria have been reported to assemble into sheets and bundles in the presence of either ATP or non-hydrolysable nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barkó et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Esue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maeda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nurse and Marians, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Popp et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Salje et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>), as we found here for MreB<sup>Gs</sup>, indicating that membrane binding and nucleotide hydrolysis are not a prerequisite for polymerization. However, our data indicate that ATP binding and hydrolysis promote effective membrane binding and transition to the double-protofilament conformation, as recently suggested for <italic>Spiroplasma</italic> MreB5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pande et al., 2022</xref>). Efficient formation of double filaments on the lipid monolayer was not observed in the presence of ADP, even at the highest MreB<sup>Gs</sup> concentration that we could test, about 15-fold the estimated ATP-MreB<sup>Gs</sup> critical concentration. The critical concentration of actin polymerized with ADP is 18-fold higher than that of actin polymerized with ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fujiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pollard, 1986</xref>). This suggests that depolymerisation of the membrane-bound double filaments is stimulated by P<sub>i</sub> release, as F-actin depolymerisation.</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest a model for ATP-driven polymerization of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> on a lipid surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Comparison of the crystal structures of apo and ATP-bound MreB<sup>Gs</sup> shows that only minor conformational changes occur upon nucleotide-binding, in agreement with what was observed when comparing crystal structures of MreB<sup>Cc</sup> and MreB5<sup>Sc</sup> in different nucleotide-bound states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pande et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van den Ent et al., 2014</xref>). This invariability of folding regardless of the bound ligands has also been observed in crystal structures of actin and other members of the actin superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schüler, 2001</xref>). ATP hydrolysis might promote small but dynamic structural changes that cannot be observed in crystal structures, which are locked in a conformation imposed by the packing. Different modes of membrane binding depending on the nucleotide state have indeed been suggested for MreB based on molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that MreB has limited affinity for lipids, and nucleotide hydrolysis may induce a conformational change that allows or stabilizes its interaction with the membrane. This is consistent with our findings that ATP is required for membrane interaction in QCM-D experiments and for detection of pairs of filaments on a lipid surface, and that at high concentration of MreB, ADP- and AMP-PNP-MreB sheets are frequent in solution while pairs of filaments found on the membrane are, respectively, scarce and virtually absent. Membrane interaction could occur by either a monomeric or an oligomeric form of MreB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It was previously speculated that the weak binding energy of individual membrane binding domains could be overcome by multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Salje et al., 2011</xref>), which would favor the latter. Such oligomerization would nonetheless remain limited to very short filaments, as a nucleation step, since no filaments were detected in solution in these conditions. Binding to lipids would induce a second conformational change that triggers polymerization into double protofilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The double filament conformation might in turn favor P<sub>i</sub> release, which would ultimately promote filament disassembly. In this scenario, the ADP-P<sub>i</sub>-MreB intermediate would be the long-lived intermediate state within MreB filaments. The rate of P<sub>i</sub> release from MreB<sup>Gs</sup> is consistent with previous reports on MreB<sup>Tm</sup>, MreB<sup>Ec</sup> and MreB5<sup>Sc</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bean and Amann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Esue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nurse and Marians, 2013</xref>) and is strikingly similar to that from F-actin. It will be interesting to measure the half-time of ATP hydrolysis by MreB<sup>Gs</sup> and confirm if it is uncoupled and much faster than the half-time of P<sub>i</sub> release, like in F-actin (~2 s and ~6 min, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pollard, 2016</xref>). In the absence of lipids, the decreased P<sub>i</sub> release rate observed may reflect either a reduced P<sub>i</sub> dissociation from soluble MreB-ADP-P<sub>i</sub> or a reduced ATPase activity of the protein.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for ATP-driven MreB<sup>Gs</sup> membrane binding and polymerization into pairs of filaments.</title><p>ATP hydrolysis stimulates MreB<sup>Gs</sup> adsorption to lipids, possibly by promoting a conformational change that renders the hydrophobic α2-β7 loop and N-terminal protruding region prone for insertion into the membrane, either as a monomeric (1) or a nucleated (2) MreB<sup>Gs</sup> form (dotted lines). Lipid binding would trigger formation of double-protofilaments on the lipid surface, which in turn would promote Pi release.

A recent model postulates that MreB polymers are intrinsically curved and have a strong affinity for negatively curved membranes while avoiding to be positively bent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). The presence of a high concentration of KCl could stiffen MreB filaments, as shown to occur for actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kang et al., 2012</xref>), and/or the lipid membrane, leading to a virtual disappearance of curved liposomes <italic>in vitro</italic> in these conditions.

In any case, the intrinsic affinity of MreB protofilaments for negative concave membrane curvature remains to be demonstrated. The identity of the bound nucleotide may also regulate the bending properties of MreB filaments, as it has been shown for actin filaments, with ADP-bound actin filaments being less stiff than ATP-bound filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isambert et al., 1995</xref>). In agreement with this, molecular simulations suggest that MreB filaments exhibit nucleotide-dependent intersubunit bending, yet with straight, ADP-bound and curved, ATP-bound filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colavin et al., 2014</xref>), opposite to actin. The kinetics of polymerization of MreB filaments, the apolarity of growth of presumably antiparallel doublets, and whether their disassembly results from dynamic instability or from growing and shrinking of the filaments at steady-state as well as the characterization of the polyelectrolyte properties of MreB filaments and their interactions with lipids are also important questions for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>General procedures and growth conditions</title><p>DNA manipulations were carried out by standard methods. <italic>G. stearothermophilus</italic> was grown at 55 °C and <italic>E. coli</italic> at 37 °C in rich lysogeny broth (LB).

Crystals of the complex were obtained with a crystallization solution containing 16% PEG 8000, 20% Glycerol and 0.04 M potassium phosphate. All crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen before data collection. Diffraction-quality crystals attained their full sizes in roughly 10–14 days.</p><p>Diffraction data were recorded on beam line PROXIMA 1 (synchrotron SOLEIL, France) at a wavelength of 0.9786 Å. Data were processed with the XDS package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kabsch, 2010</xref>). All structures were solved by molecular replacement using the MOLREP program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997</xref>) using the crystal structure of MreB<sup>Cc</sup> (PDB ID 4CZJ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van den Ent et al., 2014</xref>), and the models were refined using PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liebschner et al., 2019</xref>). The models were further improved by iterative cycles of manual rebuilding using COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). Final structural models were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berman et al., 2000</xref>). Statistics for all the data collections, refinement of the different structures and the PDB codes are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. All structural figures were generated with PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 1.2r3pre, Schrödinger, LLC n.d.). Protein structure comparison was performed using the PDBeFold service at European Bioinformatics Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krissinel and Henrick, 2004</xref>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Polymerization cycle of actin homolog MreB from a Gram-positive bacterium&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Petra Anne Levin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ethan Garner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and came to the conclusion that, while the current manuscript makes some important contributions--particularly with regard to structural data, it has limitations that will need to be addressed in a substantive and meaningful way in order to be reconsidered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Please write G+ and G- out as Gram positive and Gram negative (or gram positive and gram negative). Not only is this convention, but it also avoids confusion with G-actin, etc.</p><p>2. Line 334 &quot;revelaed&quot; is misspelled.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Interpretation of ligand density in the PDB 8ZAG (ATP-bound structure):</p><p>A figure of the electron density map showing the density of the ligand in the ATP structure should be shown.</p><p>The authors should re-visit the interpretation of the electron density at the nucleotide-binding pocket. Factors to recheck are as follows:</p><p>a. Is the third phosphate density really present? Given the high-resolution data and the redundancy, is there a possibility of observing the phosphate anomalous signal to confirm the presence of the third phosphate?</p><p>b. The third phosphate, even if present, has been possibly modeled in the wrong orientation. Please recheck.</p><p>c. Modelling of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is incorrect since none of the bond lengths is less than 2.4 A and the geometry of the coordination is incorrect. This is most probably a water molecule and not Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Interestingly this coincides with the position of a K<sup>+</sup> ion in Spiroplasma MreB structure and a water molecule in other MreBs.</p><p>d. It is possible that the third phosphate has been built in place of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>? There are remnants of Fo-Fc density in the vicinity of the phosphates. A direct hydrogen bonding with aspartate and glutamate side chains is highly unlikely for the phosphate.</p><p>The authors are requested to check and correct the errors and resubmit the PDB file if required, before the release of the coordinates.</p><p>2. Could authors provide information on the ATP hydrolytic activity for the membrane binding motifs mutants, in the presence and absence of liposomes? It can also be that the mutants are able to undergo hydrolysis like wildtype without liposomes, but have lower (but not dead) ATPase activity in the presence of liposomes since you do see filaments in a few percentages of the fields for these mutants.</p><p>3. Line 306: Rather than just a possibility of nucleotide binding affecting the polymerization, did you go higher in MreB concentration? Did this make a difference? Since you are working in saturating concentrations of the nucleotide already an increase from 2 to 10 mM of the nucleotide is unlikely to make a difference.</p><p>4. Line 308: If filaments bound to ATP bind to the membrane, but AMPPNP or ADP do not bind, it is essential that the ADP-ALFx complex, the transition state analog, has to bind. The ATP in the presence of MreB will be transitioning through a mixture of states of AMPPNP, ADP-AlFx and ADP. Hence, a control with ADP-AlFx is essential to support this conclusion.</p><p>5. If the conclusion is that monomers cannot bind and assuming that AMPPNP and ADP states do not form polymers is true, then why is it that the monomeric proteins in AMPPNP and ADP states should bind as monomers to SLBs? How can the authors explain that this is not observed?</p><p>A concentration of 0.5 μm cannot be considered as monomers assuming 0.55 to be 100 % filaments. Hence, 0.5 μm and 1 μm considered for the binding study comparison is essentially the same data and do not compare monomer vs filament.</p><p>6. Line 349 – 351: Isn't this an indication that the readout on EM is membrane binding and not polymerization? How are the authors excluding the possibility that these do not form filaments, albeit at a higher critical concentration?</p><p>7. Lines 312 – 323: How does this data change for the monomeric binding? Monomer binding can also be demonstrated in the absence of ATP rather than testing at a lower polymeric concentration below 0.55.</p><p>8. Line 396: How do these observations suggest that polymerization and depolymerization are dynamic processes? Here since there is no change in density or length, it could also mean that they are static, and hydrolysis happens on the membrane-bound filaments.</p><p>Has the ATPase activity been tested in limiting concentrations of ATP? Then with time, there should be a disappearance of filaments from the lipids, if the sentence of steady state is indeed true.</p><p>Dynamics can be observed only if the experiment is repeated in limiting concentrations of ATP.</p><p>9. Line 940: How can error bars be included if these are only two independent repeats? Error bars require a minimum of three values for a statistically meaningful calculation.</p><p>10. A concentration of 1.37 μm MreB implies that the void fraction in SEC was used for the assay. Have the authors planned for an ATPase residue mutant to substantiate that the activity is indeed from the purified MreB?</p><p>11. In Line 221, (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). &quot;These deformed vesicles confirmed that MreBG &quot;, replace MreBG to MreBGs.</p><p>12.

Modelling of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is incorrect since none of the bond lengths is less than 2.4 A and the geometry of the coordination is incorrect.

Interestingly this coincides with the position of a K<sup>+</sup> ion in Spiroplasma MreB structure and a water molecule in other MreBs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this remark. We agree and we have replaced the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion by a water molecule.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. It is possible that the third phosphate has been built in place of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>? There are remnants of Fo-Fc density in the vicinity of the phosphates.

In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the β-phosphate can slightly rotate and bring the γ-phosphate in the atypical orientation observed in the electron density map. We have resubmitted the PDB file after correcting the errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Could authors provide information on the ATP hydrolytic activity for the membrane binding motifs mutants, in the presence and absence of liposomes? It can also be that the mutants are able to undergo hydrolysis like wildtype without liposomes, but have lower (but not dead) ATPase activity in the presence of liposomes since you do see filaments in a few percentages of the fields for these mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful to reviewer #3 for this suggestion. We were making the same assumptions but we had not measured the ATPase activity of the mutants. We have now measured it in the presence and in the absence of liposomes as per the reviewer request, and added the results to the manuscript (Figure 5-S1D-E). As expected, the mutants retained basal ATPase activity (similar to the wild-type protein) in the absence of lipids, while in the presence of lipids they showed an increased activity that mirrors the amount of polymers quantified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 306: Rather than just a possibility of nucleotide binding affecting the polymerization, did you go higher in MreB concentration? Did this make a difference? Since you are working in saturating concentrations of the nucleotide already an increase from 2 to 10 mM of the nucleotide is unlikely to make a difference.</p></disp-quote><p>We are afraid we do not fully understand this comment. L306 of our original manuscript corresponded to the QCM-D assay in the presence of ADP and AMP-PNP. All QCM-D assays were performed at higher MreB concentration already (5 µM), in addition to 0.5 and 1 µM. No binding was observed in the presence of ADP and AMP-PNP, for any of the MreB concentrations tested.</p><p>See responses to 1 and 2 above for the polymerization assays by TEM at higher MreB concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Line 308: If filaments bound to ATP bind to the membrane, but AMPPNP or ADP do not bind, it is essential that the ADP-ALFx complex, the transition state analog, has to bind. The ATP in the presence of MreB will be transitioning through a mixture of states of AMPPNP, ADP-AlFx and ADP. Hence, a control with ADP-AlFx is essential to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this useful suggestion. On the light of our new data (filaments observed in the presence of ADP and AMP PNP), adding this experiment is no longer needed and beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We plan to address the question of the transition state in depth, a thorough analysis is needed for this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. If the conclusion is that monomers cannot bind and assuming that AMPPNP and ADP states do not form polymers is true, then why is it that the monomeric proteins in AMPPNP and ADP states should bind as monomers to SLBs? How can the authors explain that this is not observed?</p></disp-quote><p>This comment made us examine in detail our QCM-D data at 0.1 µM MreB (well below the critical concentration, and thus presumably unpolymerized MreB). Interestingly, a shift in frequency was detected even at 0.1 µM MreB in the presence of ATP but not of ADP or AMP-PNP, raising the intriguing possibility that MreB<sup>Gs</sup>-ATP monomers (or very short oligomers), but not MreB-ADP and MreB-AMP-PNP monomers, might interact with the membrane (Figure 3C and Figure 3-S3B, C, F). In the presence of ADP or AMP-PNP, we were not able to detect any significant binding at either low or high concentrations of MreB (Figure 3C and Figure 3-S3D, F). We also increased the concentration of ADP or AMP-PNP to exclude the possibility that the binding was simply affected by a decreased affinity of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> for these nucleotides. Higher concentrations of ADP and AMP-PNP did not restore the binding of MreB<sup>Gs</sup> to the SLBs neither (Figure 3-S3G).</p><p>Because binding was detected at 0.1 µM MreB in the presence of ATP but not of ADP and AMP-PNP, it is tempting to speculate that lipid binding might occur prior to polymerization into pairs of filaments on the membrane surface. However, we cannot exclude the presence of some MreB-ATP filaments in this QCMD experimental conditions even at the low 0.1 µM MreB concentration and thus we cannot draw any strong conclusion. We have reworked the text to remove any issuing interpretation of the QCMD data at 0.1 µM MreB but still point to the interesting observation that binding is observed at this low concentration of MreB only in the presence of ATP. We thank the reviewer for this useful comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A concentration of 0.5 μm cannot be considered as monomers assuming 0.55 to be 100 % filaments. Hence, 0.5 μm and 1 μm considered for the binding study comparison is essentially the same data and do not compare monomer vs filament.</p></disp-quote><p>At 0.55 µM (0.02 mg/ml) filaments are seen in ~10 % of the fields, versus 100% at 1.3 µM (0.045 mg/ml) (Figure 2B). However, as indicated in the previous answer, we realized that we cannot draw any strong conclusion on whether the residual binding at low MreB concentrations is due to monomers or filaments and we have therefore removed our interpretation of these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Line 349 – 351: Isn't this an indication that the readout on EM is membrane binding and not polymerization? How are the authors excluding the possibility that these do not form filaments, albeit at a higher critical concentration?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we could not discriminate between the two possibilities (lack of membrane binding vs lack of polymerization) on the EM experiments in the presence of lipids. We have now added complementary semi-quantitative EM experiments that show absence of polymers in solution too for the three mutants (Figure 4 -S4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Lines 312 – 323: How does this data change for the monomeric binding? Monomer binding can also be demonstrated in the absence of ATP rather than testing at a lower polymeric concentration below 0.55.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to 5 above. Binding of monomers in the QCM-D experiments cannot be conclusively demonstrated but our QCM-D results at 0.1 µM MreB-ATP (below the critical concentration in the presence of lipids) suggest that only MreB-ATP monomers (or a nucleated form of the filament) might bind to the membrane, while MreB-ADP or MreB-AMP-PNP monomers (or filaments) do not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 396: How do these observations suggest that polymerization and depolymerization are dynamic processes? Here since there is no change in density or length, it could also mean that they are static, and hydrolysis happens on the membrane-bound filaments.</p><p>Has the ATPase activity been tested in limiting concentrations of ATP? Then with time, there should be a disappearance of filaments from the lipids, if the sentence of steady state is indeed true.</p><p>Dynamics can be observed only if the experiment is repeated in limiting concentrations of ATP.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the referee that the ATPase findings were not conclusive. We have now performed the EM experiments in limiting conditions of ATP as suggested. In these conditions, the dual filaments disappeared from the lipid layer over time, providing further evidence for their dynamic nature (new Figure 5B). These new data have been added to the manuscript. Many thanks to reviewer #3 for this great suggestion to confirm the steady-state of the filaments!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Line 940: How can error bars be included if these are only two independent repeats? Error bars require a minimum of three values for a statistically meaningful calculation.</p></disp-quote><p>Error bars here represent standard deviations (SD) and show how scattered the values are. They are not meant to inform on whether the differences between the datasets are statistically significant or not (and that would be true even if n was &gt;2), since only a statistical test can tell. When we wondered if two datasets were statistically different, we performed a statistical analysis (Figure 3-S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. A concentration of 1.37 μm MreB implies that the void fraction in SEC was used for the assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We are afraid that we do not understand this statement. Only the fractions corresponding to the later peak (lower MW) in SEC was used in our experiments, far away from the void. Or does the reviewer suggest that at this concentration the protein would be above its critical concentration for aggregation? This is not the case, 1.37 µM correspond to 0.05 mg/ml, our standard condition for polymerization, and 10x below the critical concentration.</p><p>We have homogenized MreB concentrations to µM throughout the text and figures (previously both mg/ml and µM were used) to prevent any confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have the authors planned for an ATPase residue mutant to substantiate that the activity is indeed from the purified MreB?</p></disp-quote><p>We are currently lacking a good ATPase mutant, but this is planned for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.
