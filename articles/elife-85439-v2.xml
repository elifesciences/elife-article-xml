large number of drug combinations in a single-cell culture sample. We rely on the randomness of drug uptake in individual cells as a tool to create and encode drug treatment regimens. A single sample containing thousands of cells is treated with a combination of fluorescently barcoded drugs. We create independent transient drug gradients across the cell culture sample to produce heterogeneous <italic>local</italic> drug combinations. After the incubation period, the ensuing phenotype and corresponding drug barcodes for each cell are recorded. We use these data for statistical prediction of the treatment response to the drugs in a macroscopic population of cells. To further application of this technology, we developed a fluorescent barcoding method that does not require any chemical drug(s) modifications. We also developed segmentation-free image analysis capable of handling large optical fields containing thousands of cells in the sample, even in confluent growth condition. The technology necessary to execute our method is readily available in most biological laboratories, does not require robotic or microfluidic devices, and dramatically reduces resource needs and resulting costs of the traditional high-throughput studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>drug combinations</kwd><kwd>single-cell</kwd><kwd>optimization</kwd><kwd>barcoding</kwd><kwd>high-throughput</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HGHG007690</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loscalzo</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL108630</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loscalzo</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL155107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loscalzo</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL155096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loscalzo</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL119145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loscalzo</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D700382 and CV-19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loscalzo</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AHA957729</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loscalzo</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Engineered local heterogeneity in drug concentration is used as a tool to encode drug treatment regimens and to predict the macroscopic cellular response to drug perturbations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The optimization of targeted therapies is based on the determination of drug dose-response and the selection of a regimen that is best suited for an individual patient. A critical barrier to optimization screening is the availability and amount of relevant tissue sample (e.g. biopsy), especially in the case of combination therapy. This limitation is a reflection of the fact that the number of possible drug combinations grows exponentially with the number of drugs and dosages (cf., Supporting Information). For example, the number of all possible combinations of three drugs tested at ten different concentrations (including zero) is 10<sup>3</sup>. This number does not include the biological replicates and controls that render the careful testing of even three drugs extremely challenging.</p><p>There exists another challenging aspect to the identification of optimal drug dosage and regimen: accurate reproducibility of in vivo and in vitro experiments is notoriously difficult to achieve in many biological applications, such as drug dose-response quantification. Many confounding factors contribute to the variability in sample readout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balázsi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Niepel et al., 2019</xref>; these factors can generally be grouped into two categories, which are usually described as intrinsic and extrinsic noise.</p><p>Originally, this noise nomenclature was used to describe temporal fluctuations in a single protein within a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008</xref>). Here, we adopted this classification to an autonomous system which is an ensemble of cells isolated from other samples, but still subject to fluctuations in the external environment. Instead of measuring temporal fluctuations in individual cells, one can record snapshot(s) of cellular phenotype(s) within a single sample. The source of noise in these measurements is variability between individual cells within the sample; we refer to this type of noise as intrinsic. Noise that is driven by external factors to this autonomous system (a particular sample) is referred to as extrinsic. Variability between different samples due to temperature, humidity, etc., are examples of extrinsic noise in this context.</p><p>Sources of intrinsic noise in drug uptake by and action within cells include fundamental biochemical processes, such as passive uptake, active transport, and degradation. By contrast, external factors that contribute to noise are principally manifest through convection and advection. Namely, these external factors are related to movement and gradient formation of fluid or gas. The initial cell seeding that eventually leads to unique microenvironment formation can also be thought as an example of extrinsic noise using this terminology.</p><p>While intrinsic cell variability can be significant, we believe that it is the extrinsic factor(s) that drive sample variability in most experimental cellular systems. This conclusion derives from the Law of Large Numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feller, 1968</xref>), since the typical number of cells in a culture sample is at least of the order of 10<sup>4</sup>, while the number of biological/technical replicates is ∼3.</p><p>If the observed sample variability is due to extrinsic noise then it is very tempting to conduct all drug response experiments in the same tissue or cell culture sample. Indeed, under these conditions, it is guaranteed that external fluctuations in the environment are exactly the same for all testing conditions. Hence, quantification of the drug’s response does not require averaging over many different samples to achieve an accurate, <italic>relative</italic> comparison of the drug’s effectiveness.</p><p>In order to test different drug combinations in the same cell culture or tissue specimen, one must create these combinations <italic>locally</italic>. One of the smallest possible quantifiable locales in both cell culture and tissue samples is a single cell. Indeed, we can treat each cell as an individual chemical &quot;reactor&quot; in which testing of different drug combinations is performed. Thus, if we can (i) create different drug combinations in individual cells, and (ii) subsequently quantify these combinations and the ensuing outcome (phenotype) for each cell, the logistics of testing combinations in a single macroscopic sample would be effectively addressed.</p><p>There exists a straightforward way to resolve the quantification issue (ii) above. Drugs can be uniquely labeled (e.g. using fluorescent tags), in which case, the amount of drug taken up by each cell would scale as the fluorescence of its corresponding tag.</p><p>Let us now address a more delicate problem (i): how to create a broad range of drug combinations in different individual cells. At first glance, an herculean effort would be required to accomplish this task. Fortunately, cells themselves solve this problem effortlessly for us. Even cells with identical DNA typically exhibit deviations in drug uptake. Therefore, the random nature of drug(s) uptake by individual cells can be utilized to create different drug combinations. Here, we further enhance heterogeneity and independence in <italic>stochastic</italic> drugs mixing by creating individual drug gradients across the sample.</p><p>Rather than delivering drugs homogeneously, we rely on simple forced drug advection (by local injection) to create transient local drug gradients independently for each drug. After delivery and incubation of random <italic>local</italic> drug combinations to individual cells, we analyze the ensuing cellular phenotypes and corresponding drug optical barcodes by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry.</p><p>Cell ‘barcoding’ terminology in biology usually implies DNA identification, but here we use fluorescent signal(s) instead to encode drug regimen. This method was used by Krutzik and Nolan to distinguish between individual <italic>samples</italic> exposed to different drug regimens for high-throughput analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Krutzik and Nolan, 2006</xref>). The number of samples in their experiments was equal to the number of drug conditions, since the authors were barcoding samples, not individual cells.</p><p>The statistical analysis of the imaging data is used to predict the effect of ratiometric dosing on the outcome (cell phenotype). In this fashion, we require as little as a single cell culture sample to test all feasible drug combinations, bypassing the need for an otherwise enormous number of controls and technical replicates.</p><p>In this work, fluorescently labeled drugs are clustered into three ‘barcoding’ classes distinguished by the physical association of the label with the drug: either irreversibly linked or cleavable/separable chemistry. Additionally, we developed a labeling method that does not require any chemical modification of the drug(s), such as covalent fluorescent tagging. This particular approach involves local co-injection of an unconjugated pair of pre-mixed drug and fluorescent dye that serves as a correlative barcode. We utilize the fact that on short incubation time scales (less than an hour), the initial injection producing forced advection is mainly responsible for transient gradients in the sample. Immediately after local injection, the drug and its tag concentration profiles across the sample correlate. The subsequent diversion of these profiles due to differences in diffusion and transport rates between the drug and its unconjugated tag occurs slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">di Cagno and Stein, 2019</xref>) over this comparatively short incubation period, ensuring persisting correlation between drug and tag uptakes throughout the course of the typical experiment. For all drug barcoding classes we designed and tested, we rely on the fact that the drug barcode is retained by the cells. Hence, total drug exposure over time (area under the curve) can be assessed by a single time point measurement.</p><p>We also developed segmentation-free microscopy-based image analysis and statistical data processing capable of handling large optical fields containing thousands of cells in the sample, even in confluent growth conditions. These algorithms allow us to bypass the standard segmentation process, typically requiring additional fluorescent marker(s), significant computational time, and resources.</p><p>To demonstrate a range of possible applications of our method using different drug classes, we include implementation of our stochastic drug mixing strategy covering different biological topics. We first consider a benchmark system in which ‘drugs’ are diester dyes with distinguishable fluorescent properties. To go beyond this ‘toy’ system, we assessed the effect of a combination of siRNAs on a direct and quantifiable target, viz., GFP fluorescence, as modified by siRNA-dependent expression of GFP protein. This system is characterized by a simple phenotype readout, such as an unique fluorescent signal, and the modulation of the phenotype is a result of the direct drug-target interaction, and not a secondary, downstream effect.</p><p>Lastly, we conducted multiple cell culture experiments treating cells with combinations of drugs commonly used in multi-drug chemotherapy regimens, such as cisplatin, docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil. We adopted our technology to accommodate quantification of cell death as a phenotype common to all of these agents.</p><p>Our approach has distinct advantages over conventional drug combination screening methods, including far greater efficiency, a smooth (continuous) variation of drug concentrations in the resulting combinations, and concomitant phenotype readout. We believe this study demonstrates the applicability of this method to practical challenges in combination drug development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stochastic drug mixing</title><p>Stochastic mixing occurs naturally due to randomness in the drug(s) uptake process by individual cells. We enhance the random process of drugs’ uptake by creating transient drug gradients across the sample.</p><p>In the simplest possible implementation of <italic>deterministic</italic> gradient mixing, one can create a drug <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> gradient along the sample’s x-axis and a drug <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> gradient along its y-axis, generating (locally) drug <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and drug <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> combinations in a continuous fashion. This approach, however, requires microfluidic devices that would maintain stable drug gradients, which can be technically challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wei et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kuo et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the implementation of multiple (i.e. &gt;2) drug gradients ex vivo is probably not feasible on a small spatial scale. It is also not obvious as to how to prepare efficient combinations of three or more drugs using this approach.</p><p>Here, we used a much simpler approach involving local point injection to create spatio-temporal drug gradients in (mammalian) cell culture. We do not homogeneously distribute drugs in the media but, rather, inject them locally into cell culture in separate, discrete locations. Point injection of multiple drugs ensures chaotic/stochastic mixing patterns across sample (<xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><boxed-text id="box1"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>Barcoding individual cells using stochastic drug mixing One can think of transient drug gradients as local, short incubation processes that facilitate uptake heterogeneity across the sample.</title></caption><p>The duration(s) of these local uptake processes are governed by diffusion, advection, and the drug-target reaction kinetics in cell culture.</p><fig position="float" id="box1fig1"><label>Box 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>The aesthetic visualization of the stochastic mixing method implemented on a muchlarger scale.</title><p>Ink In Motion by Macro Room, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ICxC5ekWnUc">https://www.youtube.com/embed/ICxC5ekWnUc</ext-link>.

Here, we demonstrate the application of our method for irreversibly tagged drugs using cell-retained dyes as a benchmark drug model. The cell-permeable diester dye, carboxy fluorescein succinimidyl ester, and its derivatives are an example of this type of drug.</p><p>We first consider a benchmark system in which ‘drugs’ are diester dyes with distinguishable fluorescent properties. These dyes are well retained by the cell for an extended period and, hence, can be used to characterize total uptake by individual cells. Typical targets of these ‘drugs’ are intracellular thiol or amine groups (Materials and methods).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, we demonstrate the typical results of a random drug mixing experiment using a homogeneous delivery method. HeLa cells were exposed to four different dyes mixed together simultaneously in suspension cell culture according to the manufacturer’s protocol and imaged using confocal microscopy. The color of each dye (violet, green, yellow, and red) corresponds to its specific fluorescence emission maximum. The color and intensity of each cell in the image correspond to a unique ‘drug’ combination.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Enhancement of random drug mixing in suspension culture.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) and (<bold>b</bold>), Results of random dye mixing in suspension culture; raw image data are shown for homogeneous and point injection delivery methods, respectively.

There is a propensity for cells to take up similar molecules proportionally, with only atypical cells (outliers) exhibiting different behavior in this case.</p><p>We experimented with multiple strategies for increasing variability, such as decreasing incubation time and cell culture volume, factors that we showed previously drove heterogeneity in drug uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elgart et al., 2018</xref>). We found that the most robust way to control variability in uptake is to generate transient drug gradients in culture. A typical outcome of these experiments with HeLa cells is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> as a raw image. Here, we used a rather crude and simple method to establish transient spatial gradients in suspension cell culture by point injection (Methods).</p><p>The quantitative comparison of homogeneous and point injection-based dye delivery in terms of the fluorescence intensity distribution and pairwise correlation relationship is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, respectively. Additional heterogeneity introduced by point injections leads to a widening of the fluorescence intensity distributions and, thus, a significantly broader concentration range compared to the homogeneous mixing experiment.</p><p>We next conducted parallel experiments with adherent HeLa cells using the gradient mixing method by point injection of different drugs in different locations in the culture well (Methods).</p><p>Due to the dispersion process, the initial drugs’ distribution is spread (‘averaged’) locally across finite regions of space (spread size depends on drug diffusion and uptake rates, and also incubation time). This observation allows one to simplify the image processing by averaging fluorescence signal intensities not over individual cells, but, rather, over the mesoscopic regions of space containing multiple cells (Materials and methods). This simplification is critical since confluent cell growth conditions (necessary for a large statistical ensemble) usually present a problem for image segmentation. The statistics obtained using this approach describes typical local cell drug uptake within the given mesoscopic region (tile).</p><p>The results of a typical experiment utilizing point injections are compared to homogeneous dye delivery in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Here, we either co-delivered all dyes homogeneously or locally by point injection. Point injections were performed by local delivery of two dye pairs simultaneously: One pair of <italic>pre-mixed</italic> dyes was codelivered in one point location and another pair of <italic>pre-mixed</italic> dyes was injected at a different point location on the microscopy cell culture slide. As in the case of cells grown in suspension culture, point injection greatly increased the range of drug uptake across the population compared to homogeneous delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A pair of Green and Red CellTrace dyes was co-delivered in one point location and another pair of Blue and QD<sub>655</sub> dyes was co-delivered in another point location simultaneously of adherent cell culture sample.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) and (<bold>b</bold>), Statistical properties of homogeneous and point drug injections (microinjection) are compared in the same fashion in Sections 6 and 6.

Locally co-delivered dyes (point-injection) exhibited a far greater degree of correlation compared to those in unmatched pairs of drugs delivered to different slide locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This behavior is apparent from the scatter plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> where color represents local cell count (higher count corresponds to a redder color in the color spectrum scheme).

We next considered a biological system with a detectable drug mixing effect that could be monitored. To do so, we chose drugs that are direct binding partners of a common, measurable target. We also designed this system to be as portable as possible, that is, be adaptable to different cell types and culture conditions.</p><p>We implemented this system as follows: The drugs’ target is the exogenous green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene (d2EGFP, a short-lived variant, cf., Materials and methods).

At high drug concentrations, we expected different drug interaction patterns that depend on target site locations. Different siRNA molecules targeting overlapping regions may, for example, antagonize each other due to binding competition.</p><p>For siRNAs targeting non-overlapping regions, one can expect additive or, perhaps, synergistic drug interactions owing to accelerated mRNA degradation and modulated translation rates in the presence of multiple RISC complexes bound to the mRNA.

Here, we rely on engineered local heterogeneity in drug uptake as a tool to encode drug treatment regimens and to predict the macroscopic response to drug perturbations. This approach was inspired by the celebrated fluctuation–dissipation theorem in statistical physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cardy, 1996</xref>) that predicts the response of a system to external perturbations based on the underlying properties of noise in the system at equilibrium.</p><p>Rather than testing thousands of samples, as little as a single-cell culture sample is required to perform the search for optimal drug combination using our approach. Applications of our method are not limited to the identification of optimal drug concentrations, as the approach is applicable to any quantifiable cell phenotype. The method is readily generalizable to a much broader set of problems involving complex biochemical or molecular perturbations applied in vitro and in vivo. Examples of these perturbations include combinations of signaling molecules, optimization of drug delivery strategies, lineage differentiation identification, stem cell manipulations and tracking, etc.</p><p>The best possible random drug mixing is achieved in cells in suspension. Suspension cells can be easily mixed (i.e. cell locations can be randomly re-distributed), and local drug gradients can be applied in a statistically independent serial fashion. By contrast, since the locations of adherent cells in the sample are fixed, we exclusively rely on the randomness of the drug distribution in the media by means of forced advection, which is challenging to control. Hence, further theoretical and experimental work is required to improve the stochastic drug mixing range and its smoothness for adherent cells. A possible way to improve the mixing range (and minimize reagent use even further) can be utilization of recently developed ‘Dye Drop’ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mills et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We would like to point out an important limitation of our stochastic drug mixing method (at least in its current state). Throughout this paper, we tacitly assumed that both drugs and their labels are retained by the cells and are not re-distributed from cell to cell after the washing step. This is certainly the case for siRNA drugs delivered via nanoparticles and CellTracker dyes in our applications, but this assumption does not necessarily hold in general.</p><p>Drugs can, in principle, leak from the cells into the culture media after the washing step and, eventually, be redistributed homogeneously across the entire cell population. This behavior will affect the ‘area under the curve’ for individual cells after prolonged incubation periods, especially cells that had initially very low (or no) drug exposure. We assumed that this effect is small and did not study the kinetics or the extent of this ‘secondary’ drug exposure here. (Multiple washing steps were performed to mitigate this effect.) More careful analysis and ‘compensation’ is required for drugs that are not retained by the cells.</p><p>Another possible drawback of our method is a limit on maximal drug concentration due to drug solubility and its solvent (e.g. DMSO) toxicity. Since we utilize short drug exposure times, high drug concentrations may be required to test a broad range of conditions. Typically, low concentrations of individual drugs are desired in combination therapies and, hence, our method can be implemented even for drugs with low solubility.</p><p>We expect possible adaptation of the point injection method to facilitate random mixing in vivo. The spatial distances between injection sites, geometry, needle gauge size, injection volume, and the specific measurement protocol (readout) will, of course, all need to be established and optimized for a particular application.</p><p>Throughout this paper, we focus exclusively on the measurement approach rather than on data interpretation, which is context- and phenotype-dependent. Further work is necessary to develop a methodology, interpretation, and dedicated numerical methods to identify optimal drug combinations from high dimensional experimental data.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Drug labeling and delivery</title><p>The workflow of the temporal local gradient method used in this work is depicted schematically in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The cell culture sample is placed on a horizontal vibration-free surface, and buffer containing labeled drug is injected in the periphery of the sample. The ratio of injection to sample volumes was typically <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>% and injection speed is slow to ensure local initial distribution of the drug in the sample. (In order to visualize and adjust injection volume, release speed, and dispersion dynamics, dyes visible by naked eye or food-dyes such as Brilliant Blue FCF can be used on training samples.) Care should be taken not to disturb the sample during the incubation period (to avoid sample homogenization). After the incubation period, culture media should be quickly replaced with fresh media in adherent cell culture samples.</p><p>In suspension cell experiments, cells are placed into narrow cuvettes using a buffer density lower than cell density. After cell sedimentation, their spatial distribution corresponds to a narrow rectangle on the bottom of the cuvette. Local point injection is delivered in the ‘corner’ of this rectangle sufficiently slowly so as to minimize the cells’ movement in the cuvette. Mixing labeled drugs with iodixanol (OptiPrep), an inert liquid with a density higher than PBS/media, can be used to minimize dispersion of local injection in the vertical direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mills et al., 2022</xref>). Immediately after the drug incubation, large wash volume is used to minimize re-distribution of drug(s) within the sample prior to and during spin down step.</p><p>We used multiple different dyes to perform the multiplexing experiments: CellTracker dyes (blue, green, orange, CMTPX red, and deep red) and CellTracer dyes (violet, carboxy fluorescein succinimidyl ester [CFSE], yellow, red, and far-red). The CellTracker probes have been designed to pass freely through cell membranes, and once inside the cell, they are converted into impermeable fluorescent products. The probes are transferred to daughter cells, but are not transferred to adjacent cells in a population. The CellTracker fluorescence probes contain chloromethyl/bromomethyl or succinimidyl ester reactive groups that react with ubiquitous intracellular thiol or amine groups, respectively.</p><p>More flexible barcoding can be achieved by utilizing a tag bound to a drug by a cleavable linker. The tag can be designed to be retained by the cell, with the delivered cellular drug amount proportional to the tag’s fluorescence signal. We used nanoparticle drug delivery to apply this labeling method, namely, cell-penetrating peptide-conjugated quantum dots (QD) were used both for drug delivery and barcoding. The fluorescent reporter (QD) is retained within the cell upon entry and the drug, siRNA in our case, is released locally into the cytosol via cleavage of a disulfide bond in the cytosolic reducing environment.</p><p>Finally, we utilized the point injection method to co-deliver locally both drug and conjugation-free fluorescent dye retained by the cells. We note that to achieve one-to-one (monotonic) correspondence between total cellular drug uptake and its conjugation-free tag, it is important to ensure non-saturation labeling and detection conditions. If the tag fluorescence intensity saturates beyond a certain exposure concentration (or time), the total drug uptake prediction will be inaccurate. Most of the dyes we used (CellTrace and CellTracker) have abundant intracellular target concentrations and saturate only at very high extra-cellular concentrations (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). Therefore, the saturation in tag signal may be caused by microscopy detection limits (for either too low or too high fluorescent signals at the given laser power and sensitivity of the photomultiplier settings). Careful adjustment of these parameters is required to ensure a maximal dynamic detection range.</p><p>To avoid label and drug homogenization during the wash/collection steps using media (containing both fluorescent tags and drugs), the washing steps need be performed quickly using large dilution volumes. This homogenization, in turn, can affect local labeled drug gradients in the culture, reducing the dynamic range of drug concentrations within the sample. Cells that were initially exposed to very low local drug(s) concentration are most affected. We note that this short time scale ‘leakage’ effect occurs with both label(s) and drug(s) proportionally. Hence, label intensity should be proportional to the corresponding drug concentration, and can be still used as a proxy for drug concentration.</p><p>Long time scale leakage occurs if the drug within cells is released to neighboring cells either via media or through cell-to-cell contact. In general, this secondary drug exposure cannot be accounted for using fluorescent tags in our method because the tags/labels are designed to be irreversibly bound to the cells and do not leak (labels can, however, be diluted by cell division). Drug leakage from cell to cell mediated by media can be estimated using the volume ratio of cells and culture media. This ratio in most cell culture condition is negligibly small and leakage of this sort can be ignored.</p><p>Drug leakage from cell-to-cell mediated by direct contact can be much more significant. However, this effect is mitigated in adherent cell culture experiments by the coarse-graining procedure when the optical field containing multiple neighboring cells is averaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Effective drug combinations by stochastic mixing</title><p>Steps involved in the point injection method compared to homogeneous delivery are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11b</xref>, respectively.

Cell intensity data were clustered hierarchically based on the barcodes’ signals, and renormalized data were produced by averaging all optical parameters within each cluster (cf., Supporting Information).</p><p>Specifically, for siRNA experiments, after image segmentation, fluorescence of QD drug carriers and of GFP was assessed for individual cells. Each drug’s uptake was assumed to be proportional to the intensity of the corresponding QD carrier in each cell. The data were typically recorded as a 3-tuple <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf69"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo rspace="4.2pt">,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo rspace="4.2pt">,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> for each cell <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf70"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>We grouped cells into bins characterized by different QD combinations (in terms of fluorescence intensities <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf71"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo rspace="4.2pt">,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). For pairwise drug combination experiments, binning was achieved by partitioning the 2d space of the corresponding QD-tags’ fluorescence values into a finite mesh. The bins were designed to contain 30 or more cells each. We averaged a phenotypic marker (e.g. GFP intensity) over each binned cell population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell culture and microscopy imaging</title><p>The great majority of the experiments were conducted with the HeLa cell line. We used human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) for quantification of auranofin delivery. All experiments utilizing the point injection method were performed in confluent cell culture. The cells were grown on culture plates (microscopy slides) as follows: we used rectangular 4 and 8 chamber slides (Ibidi μ-Slides) for siRNA experiments, and either rectangular or circular slides for dye labeling experiments.</p><p>In experiments requiring single-cell imaging, cells were either ‘shrunken’ or completely detached using Accutase treatment to facilitate image segmentation. Homogeneous dye and QD labeling were performed according to the manufacturer’s (Thermo-Fisher) suggested protocol(s), typically at room temperature.</p><p>For point injection experiments, we used 10 x dye concentration (compared to the homogeneous staining condition). Delivery was carried out by injection of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf72"><mml:mrow><mml:mi/><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn> 0.05</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> cell culture volume locally. Cell imaging was performed with an inverted fully motorized Zeiss LSM-800 confocal scanning microscope utilizing 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm diode lasers for excitation of dyes and markers. Most of the microscopy experiments were performed using the 5 x objective to capture larger optical fields necessary for statistical analysis.</p><p>Imaging data from single-cell experiments were processed as follows: cell segmentation was performed using bright-field and/or dedicated cytosolic markers. We employed Cellpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>) for accurate cellular segmentation. For the auranofin co-delivery experiments, the ratiometric signal of the HyPer7 sensor was calculated as the ratio of cellular fluorescence intensities of the GFP channel excited by 488 and 405 nm laser sources.</p><p>Excitation and emission settings were chosen according to the dye manufacturer’s suggestions. In all QD experiments, we used a 405 nm laser for excitation with corresponding emission spectra filters. We tested fluorescent labels/markers individually to detect possible cross-channel leakage/overlap. This analysis was especially critical in dye co-delivery experiments where the degree of correlation may be strongly affected by channel leakage. To ensure channel ‘isolation’, we utilized dyes/fluorophores with well separated emission spectra for these experiments.</p><p>HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate, 2 mM <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf73"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) were cultured at 37°C in modified EGM2 medium (Clonetics). Cells were maintained in continuous culture in an air-5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at constant humidity and used within three to five passages. For fixation experiments, after aspiration of the culture media, cells were incubated with 10% formalin for 5 min at room temperature followed by a PBS wash. For cell suspension experiments, we detached HeLa cells with Accutase solution (Sigma-Aldrich), washed the cells with culture media, and kept them at either room temperature or 4°C in dPBS in non-treated plastic cuvettes for a short duration of dye(s) labeling (typically 1/2 hour).</p><p>In siRNA experiments, point-injection of two different QD nanoparticles carrying different siRNAs was performed at two different corners of the cell culture plate (chamber slide). Samples were incubated at 37° for 30 min. (Of note, no special precautions were taken to suppress the advection process, which facilitated the creation of concentration gradients).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>siRNA design and delivery method</title><p>We used short-lived green fluorescent protein (d2EGFP) to ensure correlation between fluorescent GFP signal and mRNA target concentration in cells. The d2EGFP plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Warren et al., 2010</xref>) was a gift from Derrick Rossi, Addgene #26821. We used siRNAs that were designed and experimentally validated by Dharmacon (cf., Accell eGFP Control siRNA) and the Sharp laboratory with binding strand sequences <named-content content-type="sequence">GCCACAACGTCTATATCAT</named-content> (siRNA<sub>1</sub>) and <named-content content-type="sequence">GCACCATCTTCTTCAAGGA</named-content> (siRNA<sub>2</sub>), respectively.

All siRNAs were designed with a cleavable disulfide linker (CL) attached to their 3’ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We used streptavidin-conjugated Quantum Dots (QDs) as fluorescent tags for each class of siRNAs, creating uniquely labeled siRNA-QD pairs. Quantum Dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanoparticles, typically excitable by UV light, with fluorescence emission spectra that are fairly narrow. The emission peaks of QDs depend on the nanoparticle size, a property that makes QDs very useful for high-throughput microscopy measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wegner and Hildebrandt, 2015</xref>). To facilitate siRNA-QD cellular delivery, we further functionalized the QDs with a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) [a nanopeptide (Arg)<sub>9</sub>] that can facilitate cell uptake through endocytosis or non-endocytotic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Verma and Stellacci, 2010</xref>) (cf., Supporting Information for technical details).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Coarse-grained image analysis</title><p>In addition to course graining of single-cell data, we develop a similar approach with respect to raw images. We performed effective local averaging over multiple confluent cells by partitioning the entire image into tiles. The size of the tile (typically, ∼50x50 microns) was estimated to contain at least a few cells on average.</p><p>Each tile in the image was replaced with an effective ‘pixel’ characterized by the average fluorescence intensity of real pixels within the tile. The only segmentation we performed in this case was identification of large lacunae (cell-free regions) in the optical field, with exclusion of these regions from image analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing

Here, we will refer to intrinsic noise as phenotype(s) fluctuations across isogenic cell populations cultured under the same conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kaern et al., 2005</xref>. Measurement noise in some cases can also be thought as intrinsic noise. Fluctuations in cellular phenotype(s) driven by the global environment will be referred to as extrinsic noise.</p><p>In cell culture, there exist several extrinsic factors that drive heterogeneity in the cells’ response to the drug treatment. Among these factors are included cell density, local cell clustering in the well, passage number, time in culture prior to drug exposure, and position on a multi-well plate (leading, for example, to temperature and evaporation rate gradients). All of these factors contributes to extrinsic noise and, paradoxically, the fate of drug response experiments can be (pre-)determined (in terms of fluctuations in the outcome) even before they begin as a consequence. Hence, quantification of drug effects requires multiple replicates, and very carefully designed protocols and handling of the biological specimens.</p><p>There also exist many microscopic parameters that drive intrinsic noise in drug uptake. The drug diffusion coefficient, cell membrane potential and capacitance, active transport properties, and intracellular metabolism/degradation of the drug are among parameters controlling drug uptake by individual cells. Due to differences in cell shape and size, cell cycle state, and the microenvironment, these parameters can vary from cell to cell, further driving intrinsic noise in drug uptake.</p><p>While intrinsic cell variability can be significant (with coefficients of variation of the order <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf91"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), we believe that it is extrinsic factors that drive overall replicate sample variability in typical cell biological experiments. This conclusion is a consequence of the Law of Large Numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feller, 1968</xref>, since the typical number of cells in a culture sample is at least of the order of 10<sup>4</sup>. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed. Deviation from the expected value scales inversely proportionally to the square root of the number of trials. Hence, even if intrinsic cell variability is of the order <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf92"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, averaging over 100 randomly chosen cells will decrease this variability to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf93"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, corresponding to 90% noise suppression. By contrast, the typical number of replicates in most biological applications is 3, averaging over which will only suppress noise by roughly 40%.</p><p>Throughout this paper, we utilize the Law of Large Numbers in different contexts, and, hence, it is worth demonstrating its action in a concrete biological example. To illustrate the application of the law, we assessed a few commonly used cellular characteristics, such as a gene expression level and dye uptake, at the single cell level. We also measured uptake by individual cells of such different fluorescent species as the Hoechst bisbenzimidine nuclear stain or quantum dot fluorescent nanoparticles (QDs). Detectable fluorescence signals from these agents can be thought of as a correlate to drug delivery: Fluorescence intensity of transient GFP-expressing cells is a direct consequence of Lipofectamine transfection of the corresponding plasmid. Hoechst dye becomes fluorescent only upon binding to the minor groove of DNA. QDs (functionalized by cell penetrating peptides) can be designed to carry a real drug payload. A large degree of intracellular heterogeneity in uptake is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1a</xref> for these diverse fluorescent species with corresponding reagents delivered sequentially to a single HeLa cells sample (cultured on a microscopy slide).</p><p>Using single-cell data as a starting point, we randomized cell ordering and uniformly partitioned data into bins. Each bin contains an equal number of elements, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf94"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, corresponding to measured parameters (attributes) of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf95"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> distinct cells. We will refer to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf96"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> as a coarse graining or scaling factor, borrowing the terms from the statistical physics approach to model reduction (renormalization) developed in 1960–1970s by Kadanoff, Wilson, and Fisher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cardy, 1996</xref>). We averaged cellular attributes (e.g. GFP fluorescence) over each bin to produce a renormalized distribution of the phenotype for different values of the parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf97"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>A reduction in noise for all three phenotypes was observed after distribution renormalization, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1b</xref> where narrowing of the distribution of Hoechst dye fluorescence intensity is demonstrated as a function of the scaling factor <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf98"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (similar results hold for the other reporters, GFP and QDs).

It is rather obvious that the renormalization process applied uniformly (i.e. randomly choosing cells for each bin) to a cell population results in a reduction of possible combinations precisely as a consequence of this law. This effect is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2a</xref> , where we show a scatter plot of QD and GFP cellular fluorescence intensities before (red) and after (blue) a uniform renormalization procedure.</p><fig id="app1fig2" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 2.</label><caption><title>Results of multivariable data coarse-graining depend on pre-processing step(s).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Scatter plot of QD<sub>655</sub> and GFP cellular fluorescence intensities for raw (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf101"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) data and <italic>uniformly</italic> renormalized (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf102"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>16</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) data shown in red and blue, respectively.

For example, we can partition the entire population of cells into bins designed to span the whole range of a particular reporter such as Hoechst dye fluorescence intensity.

The resulting partition bins do not contain cells typical for an entire population but, rather, are organized by the degree of closeness with respect to the reporter used for cell sorting. The partitioning for each bin in this way is analogous to gating used in flow cytometry. Hence, we will refer to this partition strategy and subsequent coarse graining as a gated renormalization process (cf., uniform renormalization by binning cells randomly).</p><fig id="app1fig3" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 3.</label><caption><title>The simplest example of gated partitioning is based on the color of the objects.</title><p>Here, we partitioned all objects shown in the center into a one-dimensional grid with 4 bins spanning the color spectrum.

As a trivial example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>, the ‘cellular’ attribute not involved in the clustering and partitioning is ‘cell’ size, which has large fluctuations among each partition bin in this example. By contrast, the gating parameter(s) for each bin is(are) expected to lie somewhere within the gating criteria <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf108"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for each bin <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf109"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> after averaging. If cell attributes are all statistically independent, gated renormalization will result in coarse grained, but still statistically independent, attributes; however, if some attributes correlate with one another, the gated renormalization is expected to make this dependence more apparent by reducing biological and measurement noise.</p><p>The variance across data renormalized in this fashion is expected to be comparable to that of raw data for gating attributes by construction. The variance in the cellular attributes not involved in the partitioning criteria after gated renormalization will depend on the degree of correlation between these attributes and the gating parameters(s). As an example of this point, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2b</xref> we show a scatter plot of QD and GFP cellular intensities with renormalization performed after sorting in ascending order of fluorescence intensity. This strategy can be generalized to design mesoscopic partitioning of a cell population into multi-dimensional bins characterized by a range of multiple reporters (e.g. by choosing Hoechst and GFP fluorescence intensities as gating parameters).</p><p>The gated partition data analysis for identification of the optimal drug combinations is, then, rather straightforward. First, we rely on natural biophysical phenomena to provide a broad range of random mixing in drug uptake. Next, we use the fluorescence intensity of drugs (or their corresponding tags) to partition all cellular attributes into bins. These bins are designed to be sufficiently capacious to contain dozens or hundreds of cells. All cellular attributes are averaged within these bins, which map out the space of drug concentrations and corresponding cellular responses/phenotypes. Finally, we treat data from each bin as an individual culture dish with delivered drug concentrations proportional to fluorescence intensities of the corresponding tags. (According to the Law of Large Numbers, averaging drug response over many cells in each bin suppresses intrinsic noise by the factor <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf110"><mml:msqrt><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:msqrt></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the number of cells in bin <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf111"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Point injection and conjugation-free method</title><p>We labeled each drug uniquely with fluorescent tags, and assumed that the amount of drug taken up by each cell scales as the fluorescence of its corresponding tag. The quantification of each cell response is matched to fluorescence data by utilizing tags that are retained in cells. The inherited randomness in cell behavior is not only responsible for variable drug uptake, but also drives response to drug treatment by individual cells. To overcome this source of heterogeneity, we perform averaging over many cells within the sub-population binned by fluorescence intensities of drug tags.</p><p>There are potential pitfalls in the random mixing method. For example, the uptake of different drugs may be correlated due to the similarity in chemical structures or delivery methods. Cells that take up one drug may, therefore, be likely to take up a similar drug, as well, in proportional fashion. Hence, drug mixing becomes not very effective since we are not exploring the entire drug mixing range by introducing a bias in the mixing process.</p><p>Multiple approaches can potentially mitigate this “proportionality” bias. One possibility is to utilize different delivery mechanisms for different drugs. This approach, however, is too cumbersome and does not guarantee bias elimination. Randomness in drug uptake might be driven by similar factors (such as membrane geometry and physical properties), even for different delivery methods.</p><p>Here, we developed a method to facilitate independent drug mixing by the creation of local drug gradients across the sample using point injection of individual drugs in different sample locations. The modification of the point injection method can be used for conjugation-free drug labeling by local co-delivery of a pre-mixed drug and its corresponding label. We confirmed that the conjugation-free drug labeling method works well, not only with dyes or small molecule drugs, such as auranofin, but also with much larger nanoparticles, such as QDs.</p><p>To assess the predictive power of the conjugation-free method, we compared the CV for each cell subpopulation (bin) used to produce the coarse-grained data shown in Section 6 and Section 6 to the CV of the entire population in a uniform dye delivery experiment. The results of this comparison are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4b</xref> for dyes we treated as ‘drugs’.

This requirement is essential for two primary reasons. First, a large statistical ensemble allows one to collect enough information about atypical (rare) cellular responses to drug treatment that may nevertheless be critically important (e.g. resistance to treatment). Second, renormalization requires partitioning and subsequent bin averaging to suppress intrinsic noise, which is best achieved using a large ensemble.</p><p>While flow cytometry-based experiments can easily be designed to handle large numbers of cells, this is usually not the case for fluorescence microscopy. The experimental protocols, data storage, and analysis are usually non-trivial technically. Confluent cell culture conditions can present a problem for segmentation analysis both in terms of accuracy and run-time. Hence, many tiled optical fields might be necessary to image a large number of cells. Cell segmentation may also require a dedicated optically active biomarker resulting in bandwidth reduction and possible leakage to other channels in high-throughput experiments designed to assess multiple cellular attributes.</p><p>To overcome these issues with confocal fluorescence microscopy methodologies, we employed yet another coarse graining method for image analysis. Similar to renormalization of the cell population, microscopy images are renormalized as follows. All channel images are identically partitioned into square tiles of an area large enough to contain at least one cell on average. Fluorescence intensities for each of these tiles are averaged, and the resulting mean intensities are treated as a single-cell attribute. Of course, the data collected in this fashion would include intensities from incomplete cells, fragmented by the tile limits, and also intensities from multiple cells averaged together.</p><p>To study these effects on tiled renormalization and assess its quality, we generated synthetic images of geometrically regularized but dense objects (circles), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>.

The images were partitioned into tiles (we will refer to its tile size as a scaling parameter) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5b</xref> by the red lines. We calculated average pixel intensity by normalizing total intensity to the foreground area for each tile. To this end, we created a binary image (mask) by separating foreground (circles) and background in the image.

This conclusion is because a consequence of the fact that a single object in the image does not contribute A identical values to the overall distribution in this case. Averaging over finite sized regions suppresses multiplicative noise in the model we introduced. Naively, we expect similar behavior in real microscopy data.</p><p>We found that the tile renormalization (and segmentation-free) approach, indeed, results in fairly accurate estimates of the statistical properties of cellular attributes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref> for comparison between segmented single cell and renormalized [tiled] image statistics for the phenotypes we tested). We must note that, in principle, accurately determined statistics of each individual random variable in the multidimensional ensemble does not necessarily guarantee a correlative relationship between these variables. For example, some cellular markers (such as QDs) tend to be localized in sub-cellular compartments, and too aggressive image partitioning (i.e. too small a scaling parameter) may result in loss of the correct relationship between these localized markers. By contrast, too large a scaling parameter results in loss of sensitivity and range in the determination of the quantitative relationship between the markers. We, therefore, relied on a comparison of segmented single cell and tiled data to determine the optimal trade-off in the partition strategy empirically (using sparsely seeded control samples where traditional segmentation is possible).</p><p>For confluent cell culture conditions (or tissue), the application of tiling renormalization is straightforward. However, when lacunae are present in the culture due either to seeding inhomogeneities or cell death, one has to use masking to prevent averaging over empty space. Masking does not require segmentation but, nevertheless, may require an additional fluorescence marker or phase-contrast imaging to define the approximate limits of the lacunae.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12"><title>siRNA delivery by quantum dots nano-carriers</title><p>After conjugation of streptavidin-QDs with biotinylated siRNA, we further functionalized QDs with an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) that facilitate cell entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Medintz et al., 2008</xref>.

Leakage can occur on short and long time scales, based on the following reasoning.</p><p>Short time scale leakage occurs during the wash/collection steps using media (containing both fluorescent tags and drugs) when sample is unavoidably homogenized. This phenomenon, in turn, can affect local labeled drug gradients in culture, reducing the dynamic range of drug concentrations within the sample. Cells that were initially exposed to very low local drug(s) concentration are most affected. Thus, the washing steps need be performed quickly using large dilution volumes. We note that this short scale leakage effect occurs with both label(s) and drug(s) proportionally. Hence, label intensity should still be proportional to the corresponding drug concentration, and can be used as a proxy for drug concentration.</p><p>Long time scale leakage occurs if the drug(s) within cells is released to neighboring cells either via media or through cell-to-cell contact. In general, this secondary drug exposure cannot be accounted for using fluorescent tags in our method because the tags/labels are designed to be irreversibly bound to the cells and do not leak (labels can, however, be diluted by cell division). Drug leakage from cell to cell mediated by media can be estimated using the volume ratio of cells and media. This ratio in most cell culture conditions is negligibly small. For example, 10<sup>4</sup> HeLa cells have a volume of <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>2.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mtext>μl</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?id=103725&amp;ver=20).

However, this effect is mitigated in adherent cell culture experiments by the coarse-graining procedure we use when the optical field containing multiple neighboring cells is averaged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the authors emphasize the importance of large cell numbers in order to minimize or suppress the variability in cell responsiveness; Can the authors provide some data to demonstrate distinct experiments with different numbers of cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss this issue in the Supplementary Material section, Noise and Law of Large Numbers (please see Figure S1 in particular). In brief, our method relies on sub-population averaging to suppress noise in cell response due to inherited cell variability. This averaging (coarse-graining) procedure reduces intrinsic noise by factor <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of cells in the sub-population. The typical coefficient of variation, <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CV</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, in biological applications is less than 1, and averaging over 100 cells reduces the intrinsic noise to <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CV</mml:mtext><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. Further noise reduction is probably meaningless owing to the existence of other factors such as systematic instrumental noise. Moreover, averaging over too many cells results in shrinking the dynamic range of variable(s) that encode drug concentration and cell phenotype. In the extreme case of averaging over an entire cell population, one can only determine a single data point, reducing the ‘single’ cell to bulk measurement.</p><p>In order to investigate the accuracy of prediction as a function of cell number in the population, we simply down-sampled (randomly) existing experimental data to reduce the number of cells in the ensuing <italic>in silico</italic> experiments. (Please see the Supplementary Material section, Noise and Law of Large Numbers, for more details.) We believe that this approach is equivalent to performing distinct real experiments with different numbers of cells. (We wish to emphasize that physical experiments with different numbers of cells would need to be conducted using scaled volumes to ensure identical cell/drug concentrations, including local injection volumes, which could be fairly challenging experimentally.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall this is a very interesting concept and manuscript. More clarity is needed around the set up for the injections – perhaps pictures or diagrams would be helpful for readers early on to grasp what is occurring. Reading through the methods, they appeared more result-like in their writing; perhaps points that wish to be made in the methods could be pulled out and placed into the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for this suggestion. In response to this comment, we reorganized the paper to move the discussion related to creation of local gradients and the coarse-graining procedure into the Results section. We also created a graphic abstract (listed as Figure 1 in the revised manuscript) that we hope to be useful for readers early on.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the validity of the approach. What is being proposed is very novel for chemotherapeutic agents, but there is a working parallel that might be useful to prove the concept: that of multi-drug combinations in microbiology cultures. While that is beyond the scope of this paper, a similarly established quantitative multi-drug model with a quantifiable outcome would ideally have been used for determining the validity of your new methodology.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this very insightful observation. We note that the method, &quot;disc-diffusion antibiotic susceptibility (Kirby–Bauer) test,&quot; used in microbiology cultures was the inspiration for this project in the first place. We tried to imagine what would happen to local microbial density if the diffusion disks of two different drugs would overlap. The schematic depiction shown in Figure 12 was our initial view of this scenario. The reviewer’s suggested application in microbial cultures is, indeed, an excellent example for testing drug combinations and, perhaps, is easier to implement compared to mammalian cell cultures. We are very grateful for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The only other recommendation I would make on an otherwise excellent paper is to clarify the usage of microRNA experimentation. The rationale for those experiments seemed disjointed from the combo chemotherapy experiments. I would reword the manuscript to better set up the readers to understand the need for those experiments and how they added to the validity of the model.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the motivations for the inclusion of two entirely different biological topics in the same paper was to demonstrate a range of possible applications of our method using different drug classes. Another motivation in considering the siRNA application was a simple phenotype readout. We assessed the effect of a combination of siRNAs on a direct and quantifiable target, viz., GFP fluorescence, as modified by siRNA-dependent expression of GFP protein. Unlike combination chemotherapy experiments, this is a much better understood and simpler system. In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we added a linking paragraph in the Introduction’s text for clarification (line 112).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have more detailed comments on the manuscript to improve the scientific communication:</p><p>Advection vs convection: terminology seems to be misused several times in the text</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. We changed the terminology in the manuscript in response to this comment using the following rule – we referred to dispersion of dye/drug by local fluid injection as an advection process. The movement of fluid/air due to thermal and other gradients around the sample is referred to as convection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Barcoding&quot;: this terminology is highly misleading, especially since single-cell heterogeneity is often explored through oligonucleotide barcoding (see PMID: 33619394).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that &quot;barcoding&quot; terminology in biology usually implies genetic barcoding. Here, however, we use this term much as Gary Nolan’s group had over a decade ago (cf., Krutzik PO, Nolan GP. Fluorescent Cell Barcoding in Flow Cytometry Allows High-Throughput Drug Screening and Signaling Profiling., Nature Methods, 2006). We added clarification on this matter in the &quot;Introduction&quot; section (line 83).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods: What were the parameters used in microscopy imaging to prevent PMT saturation? How is the threshold for minimal detection handled in linear regression?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s question is related to the fact that to image many cells using scanning microscopy, one has to image and stitch/combine many optical fields together. Since we utilize gradient labeling, some cells may have very high signal intensities, while other cells in the population may have very low fluorescent signal intensities–below the detection limit for a given PMT voltage controlling detector’s sensitivity. Additionally, if measurement involves multiple samples (e.g., gradient and homogeneously labeled specimens), the dynamic range of detector sensitivity has to accommodate a broad range of possible fluorescent signals.</p><p>We, therefore, used the following strategies to avoid signal saturation:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>All related samples were imaged using the same PMT settings for each individual channel. This means that the imaging was not optimal for some conditions but allows one to compare cell label intensities directly.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We scanned all related samples manually (using a wide-field camera and eye-piece) to identify the brightest (highest intensity) sub-population. (This can be done for fixed samples only.) The maximal PMT voltage setting for each channel was set to avoid signal saturation for these brightest spots (their location can vary across sample(s) for each respective channel).</p></list-item></list><p>We used Cellpose v0.6 for morphological/texture segmentation using brightfield images (with default values for flow and cell threshold). This implementation was done to make image segmentation independent of fluorescent tag signal(s) and avoid dealing with fluorescent threshold detection differences that can vary across tiles and samples.</p><p>For low signal intensity handling, we averaged the signal over a cell cross-section of at least 300 pixels, minimizing white (but not systematic) instrument noise. Background (white noise) signal noise was assessed for each optical field using inversion of the binary (mask) of foreground objects identified by Cellpose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods: What buffer fluid was used with the labeling kits? In the homogenous concentration setup, were cells in a density-matched fluid?</p></disp-quote><p>Serum-free media and dPBS were used as buffers with the labeling kits. We did not match media density to cell density in the nonhomogeneous setup to minimize movement of the cells during injection. To ensure similar conditions, we also did not match cell and media densities in the homogeneous setup, as well. We clarified this point in Methods (line 509).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nearly all of the figures require more detailed schematics to indicate how (and in what order) the dye(s) or drug(s) are introduced into the cuvette or culture dish</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we listed details of the dye/drug injection method in the Methods section (line 500) and modified the corresponding figure captions. In brief, suspension/detached cells were treated one dye at a time to create independent gradients within a sample. The only exception was a co-delivery experiment in which a pair of the pre-mixed dyes was injected simultaneously. In all experiments with adherent cell culture, drugs/dyes were injected into different slide locations simultaneously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 1d and 2b: The correlation matrices are not symmetrical. Why? Does this reflect the sequence of uptake? If point injection, wouldn't this be simultaneous delivery? Please provide more detail for interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for this clarifying question. The reviewer correctly states that the switch in delivery sequence should not result in a dramatic change in dye-dye correlation coefficients.</p><p>The asymmetry is not due to the sequence of delivery. The lower and upper triangular parts of the tables in Figures 1d and 2b simply represent different delivery methods as stated in the legend: &quot;Correlation coefficients, <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m8"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, for all pairwise dye combinations are shown graphically for homogeneous and point injection deliveries on lower and upper triangular matrix plots, respectively.&quot;</p><p>Perhaps, the culprit for the confusion was a shared diagonal (self-correlation coefficient is 1 regardless of the delivery method). We adjusted the legend to stress the distinction between upper and lower diagonal parts of the correlation tables, and to clarify the confusing prior version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: Please provide R2 values for each linear regression.

The modulation of expression occurs by means not only of accelerated degradation of target mRNA (which is, indeed, an exponential decay process), but also by modulation of translation. The translation modulation is not an exponential process because it does not change the number of mRNAs and affecting a different species – proteins.

We note that while homogeneous drug delivery in biological samples can be replicated in traditional fashion, local delivery samples are not reproducible in our current implementation.
