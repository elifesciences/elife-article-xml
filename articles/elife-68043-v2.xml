However, to advance its technical development and further our understanding, implementation of the method in animal models is indispensable. Here, we report the successful employment of slow waves’ phase-targeted closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) in rats. To validate this new tool both conceptually and functionally, we tested the effects of up- and down-phase CLAS on proportions and spectral characteristics of sleep, and on learning performance in the single-pellet reaching task, respectively. Without affecting 24 hr sleep-wake behavior, CLAS specifically altered delta (slow waves) and sigma (sleep spindles) power persistently over chronic periods of stimulation. While up-phase CLAS does not elicit a significant change in behavioral performance, down-phase CLAS exerted a detrimental effect on overall engagement and success rate in the behavioral test. Overall CLAS-dependent spectral changes were positively correlated with learning performance. Altogether, our results provide proof-of-principle evidence that phase-targeted CLAS of slow waves in rodents is efficient, safe, and stable over chronic experimental periods, enabling the use of this high-specificity tool for basic and preclinical translational sleep research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>closed-loop auditory stimulation</kwd><kwd>sleep slow waves</kwd><kwd>motor learning</kwd><kwd>sleep modulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>163056 and 188790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumann</surname><given-names>Christian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Synapsis Foundation for Alzheimer's Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noain</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Neuroscience Center Zurich, University of Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rahn and Bodmer donation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noain</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Armin and Jeannine Kurz Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noain</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Delivery of auditory triggers as unique slow waves-targeting approach yields efficient, stable, and precise modulation of slow-wave activity in rats.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Noninvasive neuromodulation strategies are en vogue for their unique potential to diagnose and treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, or to rebalance the activity in dysfunctional brain networks. In particular, modulation of slow wave sleep (SWS) has increasingly gained attention over recent years. Tailoring novel stimulation tools to effectively optimize SWS profiles appears crucial to intervene SWS-related cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mander et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papalambros et al., 2017</xref>), as well as other important brain and body processes, in both rodents and humans. Therefore, innovative approaches to further comprehend and eventually enable therapeutic implementations of SWS modulation have been tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marshall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Massimini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vyazovskiy et al., 2009</xref>). More recently, auditory stimulation during SWS was successfully implemented in human subjects in laboratory-based settings. At first, the method disregarded the phase of the ongoing oscillatory activity in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ngo et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tononi et al., 2010</xref>), but was later developed further to deliver auditory stimulation in synchrony with the brain’s own rhythm in a closed-loop manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ngo et al., 2013b</xref>). Targeting ongoing slow waves in their up-phase enhanced slow oscillations during SWS, while targeting the waves’ down-phase had the opposite effect. The success of the human implementation of CLAS further encouraged the development of portable devices enabling acoustic stimulation in a home-based environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferster et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Memory formation is one of the most intriguing sleep-dependent brain processes for which the links between SWS—characterized by brain slow oscillatory activity in the delta-frequency range (0.5–4 Hz) and oscillations &lt;1 Hz among its most distinctive features in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Timofeev, 2011</xref>)—and motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stickgold, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walker et al., 2002</xref>), synaptic downscaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>), and consolidation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>) have been exhaustively studied. In this context, it was not surprising that the novel specific auditory modulation of SWS methods implemented in humans was first assessed in their capacity to interact with memory performance. Initially, Ngo and colleagues found enhanced performance during a paired-associates learning task in subjects undergoing up-phase auditory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ngo et al., 2013a</xref>), and soon several other studies employing similar stimulation paradigms replicated the enhanced memory effect, although with more modest effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leminen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papalambros et al., 2017</xref>). In a novel implementation of this concept, some of us found that auditory disruption of slow waves perturbing local SWS in the motor cortex attenuated the brain’s SWS-dependent capacity to undergo neuroplastic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fattinger et al., 2017</xref>), corroborating that SWS integrity is critical to maintain cognitive efficiency. However, some authors proposed that enhancing slow waves and spindles by auditory stimulation was insufficient to improve memory above sham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ngo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weigenand et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the effects of auditory stimulation on memory are moderate and highly variable inter- and intra-studies, and evidencing that a better understanding of the method is needed.</p><p>Therefore, although a highly promising tool, the precise effects exerted by phase-targeted auditory stimulation at both electrophysiological and behavioral levels are not understood well enough yet. Moreover, effects of long-term interventions, as well as parameters’ optimization, remain to be addressed. These limitations can partly be attributed to the lack of a closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) paradigm in animals to facilitate both basic and preclinical research. For the first time, we explored here the effects exerted by phase-targeted CLAS of slow waves on slow-wave activity (SWA) in healthy rats. We conceptualized that up-phase CLAS will boost delta power during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the sleep state rich in slow waves in animals, while down-phase CLAS will have the opposite effect. As a functional readout of CLAS of slow waves, we evaluated learning performance in the single-pellet reaching task (SPRT).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CLAS’ precision and phase detection</title><p>To study the effect of CLAS of slow waves in healthy rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we recorded animals during an undisturbed 24 hr baseline (BL) period and, thereafter, delivering up-phase, mock, or down-phase auditory stimulation continuously for 16 days, while undergoing behavioral training in the SPRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Online NREM sleep staging is a crucial step during CLAS of slow waves. Briefly, our online NREM sleep staging tool consists of three real-time decision features: root mean square (rms) of delta and beta frequency bands, and electromyogram (EMG). In a separate cohort (14 animals: up-phase [n = 5], mock [n = 4], or down-phase [n = 5]), we assessed the performance of our online NREM sleep staging process, as well as the accuracy of our phase detector. Overall, online NREM sleep staging had a mean sensitivity of 12%, indicating how strictly the staging tool identifies sustained NREM sleep, and specificity of 98%, highlighting the high rejection rate of events in disagreement with NREM characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, see detailed methods ‘EEG/EMG offline scoring and online staging validation’ section). Regarding online precision of NREM sleep staging, 70% of epochs on average were confirmed offline as NREM sleep, whereas 18% were later identified as wakefulness and 2% as REM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Artefacts, i.e. EEG/EMG perturbations related to environmental interference rather than changes in brain state, constituted roughly 10% of epochs labelled online as NREM sleep. Phase histograms of a different cohort showed high accuracy in trigger distribution relative to the intended targets of 65° and 270° for up- and down-phase stimulation, respectively. Although different phases were targeted in this cohort, the phase detector is, in its core and performance, the same. Up-phase paradigm revealed <italic>M</italic> = 74.97° (SD = 38.10°; Var = 12.67°) while down-phase stimulation indicated a mean target <italic>M</italic> = 280.55° (SD = 49.67°; Var = 19.75°). In mock animals, we confirmed onset of muted triggers around the positive peak of the slow wave (<italic>M</italic> = 101.20°; SD = 46.89°; Var = 19.19°) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The difference in variances reflects the gradual loss of accuracy when higher phases are being targeted, an intrinsic characteristic of our phase-detection feature. Additionally, we explored the distribution of triggers across sleep stages and observed that up-phase-stimulated animals received more sound triggers during NREM sleep than down-phase-stimulated subjects (up-phase: M = 4959, SD = 3063; down-phase: M = 3148, SD = 2719; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Nonetheless, the proportion of triggers did not differ between stimulation groups for any of the sleep stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The breakdown of CLAS triggers through pre- and motor-training phases shows that NREM sleep targeting by day (number and proportion) remained constant within each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of electroencephalogram/electromyogram (EEG/EMG) headpiece, closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) concept, and computational pipeline.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Dorsal skull schematic of the two subdural (differential) channels for cortical EEG and one nuchal EMG.

Neither up-phase nor down-phase stimulation disturbed total NREM amount compared to mock condition (two-way repeated measures analysis of variance [RM-ANOVA], <italic>time</italic> * <italic>condition</italic> interaction, <italic>F</italic>(32, 215) = 0.929, p=0.582, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Moreover, we observed no evidence of abnormal NREM sleep fragmentation in any stimulation group over time (RM-ANOVA, <italic>time</italic> * <italic>condition</italic> interaction, <italic>F</italic>(32, 228) = 0.830, p=0.730, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). On third day of motor training (M-T<sub>3</sub>), 24 hr EEG power spectra in NREM exhibited increased delta activity in the up-phase-stimulated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), whereas down-phase-stimulated animals showed a trend towards decreased delta-frequency activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Power spectral density in mock animals did not present distinctive changes on day M-T<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Notably, the stimulation design was accompanied by large interindividual variability with respect to EEG power in NREM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To highlight the global effect of each modulatory paradigm, we pooled the daily results for the various sleep-frequency bands, from P-T<sub>1</sub> to M-T<sub>3</sub> days, and analyzed the average change from BL. Across the spectrum, delta (***p&lt;0.001), sigma (11–16 Hz, <italic>***</italic>p&lt;0.001), and beta (16–30 Hz, *p=0.045) bands were significantly increased in up-phase-stimulated subjects. On the contrary, down-phase stimulation decreased delta (***p&lt;0.001), alpha (8–11 Hz, *p=0.037), and sigma (*p=0.012) power during P-T<sub>1</sub> – M-T<sub>3</sub> days, collectively. Mock animals showed altered power in the sigma band (**p=0.002, one-sample Hotelling’s T<sup>2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), an apparent effect of the skill learning task performed daily. This effect was corroborated by examining sigma activity during the N-T period — 4 days without motor skill training — in all three groups: mock animals returned to BL indices (p=0.672), whereas up-phase (**p=0.002) and down-phase (*p=0.028)-stimulated groups showed increased and decreased sigma activity, respectively (one-sample t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Taking into account that auditory stimulation was delivered phase-locked to the EEG’s left derivation, we further investigated the possibility of interhemispheric asymmetries upon CLAS. Average power spectral density from stimulated animals was normalized to that of mock to account for effects associated with procedural or instrumental factors unrelated to CLAS, and subsequently compared to a null change (change in percentage points, multiple unpaired t-test followed by Holm–Sidak corrections). Evaluation of protocol day M-T<sub>3</sub> showed that both up- and down-phase-stimulated animals presented relatively symmetrical spectral power during wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep (Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–f). Additionally, we evaluated the impact of behavioral laterality in EEG power, specifically the delta and sigma bands that were found most altered upon CLAS. After splitting the animals within each CLAS paradigm into right- or left-pawed, we considered four scenarios for combined effects of CLAS and handedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vyazovskiy and Tobler, 2008</xref>) in regards to modulation of EEG activity from the left in relation to the right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Under up-phase CLAS, delta activity was higher on the left EEG derivation in right-pawed animals (case i) than left-pawed ones (case ii), presumably reinforced by the added effect of handedness on the left hemisphere, contralateral to the preferred paw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Consistently, down-phase-stimulated animals showed slightly less reduced delta power in the left hemisphere of right-pawed animals (case iii) than subjects preferring the left paw (case iv) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>).

With this paradigm, we delivered auditory triggers to healthy rats continuously over a period of 16 days. We observed a mild but specific average increase of 6.9% (up to 23% during the light period) in delta power per 24 hr on stimulation days compared to BL. This effect was stable over the entire stimulation period evaluated, with no signs of decay nor facilitation effects over time. Reverse effects (<italic>M</italic> = –4.5%, down to –17.5% by the end of the dark period) were observed during down-phase stimulation.</p><p>Notably, application of CLAS in human subjects has often failed to demonstrate an overall inter-night effect (unperturbed night vs. stimulated night) of stimulation on power spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papalambros et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papalambros et al., 2019</xref>), while comparison between same-night ON- and OFF-stimulation windows yielded significant stimulation effects that positively correlated with subsequent memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papalambros et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we provide first evidence of a long-term effect when comparing unperturbed 24 hr (BL) vs. stimulated 24 hr in a paradigm of continuous stimulation, somewhat challenging the proposition that the effect of CLAS is mediated by qualitative transient reorganization of SWA rather than of a general SWS or SWA enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papalambros et al., 2017</xref>). CLAS elicited, however, a modest effect in both up- and down-conditions in our rats, without evidence of either build-up or adaptation mechanisms to regulate the impact of the stimulation across the days. Interestingly, chronic sleep deprivation studies in rodents demonstrate a comparable effect, suggesting that strong homeostatic compensatory mechanisms may be at play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leemburg et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To achieve a greater effect, further refined CLAS paradigms must be evaluated. For instance, although the CLAS protocol employed in this study accomplished 70% NREM precision for sound triggering and clear phase-target accuracy, future NREM online staging and CLAS pipelines shall be optimized in terms of detection of particular EEG events, such as slow oscillations, spindles, or arousals. Triggers would ideally be delivered only during sustained NREM sleep, but motion behaviors with a rhythmic nature (e.g., grooming, feeding, and drinking) may have been major factors contributing to wakefulness and artifact epochs being identified online as NREM sleep, and consequently reducing precision. Thus, further artifact-rejection features shall be considered, such as auxiliary EMG information (e.g., piezo-electric sensors), especially in long-term experiments where attrition of implanted EEG/EMG headsets is unavoidable. In addition, very strict thresholds for NREM sleep online identification drastically limited sensitivity of the algorithm (12%). Nonetheless, the CLAS paradigm introduced here produces stable sleep modulation effects over time and successfully replicates the timing accuracy so far obtained in some methods of human CLAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fattinger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papalambros et al., 2017</xref>). Also like in humans studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krugliakova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papalambros et al., 2017</xref>), we observed an additional modulatory effect of CLAS on power in the sigma-frequency band in rats. Sigma modulation was, just like CLAS-dependent delta changes, phase-target-specific and steady over the 16 days of stimulation. Finally, further assessments indicated that exclusively targeting slow waves in the left hemisphere did not manipulate SWA during NREM sleep to a different extent in that brain area. However, a left predominance of SWA—presumed to correspond with the naturally higher occurrence of right-pawed animals—has been reported in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vyazovskiy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vyazovskiy and Tobler, 2008</xref>), and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that this natural characteristic mounts up with CLAS effect and entangles with our results.</p><p>We explored the size of trains of triggers and ISIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Santostasi et al., 2016</xref>)—proxies for length and distribution of delta wave trains—to explore whether CLAS altered natural slow-wave patterns and if this could be the potential underlying process by which CLAS exerted its modulatory effect over delta power. In comparison to mock, down-phase-stimulated animals showed an increased number of single triggers, decreased proportion of trains of two triggers, and decreased density of &lt;2 s ISIs, in contrast to maintained levels in the up-phase-stimulated group, potentially indicating that down-phase CLAS has disarrayed the natural pattern of delta wave trains.</p><p>In agreement with the apparent preservation of the slow-wave pattern with up-phase CLAS, and opposite effect with down-phase CLAS, analysis of ERPs indicated the occurrence of a post-trigger slow wave when targeting 60°, whereas a post-trigger pattern disruption arises from 180° target stimulation. Peak-to-peak amplitude did not differ between up- and down-phase groups, although we cannot reject a possible tapering of the physiological response from stimuli outside of the desired phase. Taken together, these findings suggest that CLAS of rodent slow waves may be altering the natural slow waves’ pattern rather than significantly affecting their amplitude.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional validation rodent CLAS: altered behavioral performance upon phase-targeted CLAS in healthy rats</title><p>Phase-targeted CLAS produced significantly altered learning performance in the SPRT in healthy rats, mainly in the down-phase condition. Moreover, we found that the mean delta activity change in motor-training days 1–4 in relation to BL correlated positively with SR on motor-training day 4 in the SPRT. Through the positive correlation found between the number of triggers—that is, extent of closed-loop auditory stimuli delivered—and delta power changes in up- and down-phase groups, we confirmed indeed that delta activity changes during motor-training days 1–4 are actually driven by CLAS. Overall, these results suggest that CLAS-dependent delta activity levels drive next-day performance in healthy rats. Furthermore, we observed that the level of proficiency achieved at motor-training day 4 was maintained in all groups after 5 days without training. This observation suggests that CLAS modulated sleep-dependent skill acquisition and retention only immediately following a motor-training session. In short, without prior active task engagement or performance saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kvint et al., 2011</xref>), up-phase CLAS per se seems insufficient to induce a significant performance enhancement at the present conditions, whereas there was no evidence of skill decay induced by down-phase CLAS either. Two sleep-dependent mechanisms may explain the observed effect of modulated slow waves on behavioral performance in our paradigm. Sleep-mediated synaptic downscaling, or recovery, after learning has been deemed critical to maintaining behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fattinger et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that targeting slow waves with CLAS might have altered (up-: increased; down-: decreased) the normal recovery process after learning during wakefulness in our rats. In support of this argument, we observed that the number of attempts in the down-phase group seems lower than in the other groups at motor-training day 1, potentially indicating that before any memory consolidation process took place, these animals already performed worse than their counterparts did. On the other hand, memory consolidation, a process at least partially mediated by spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>) in which specific synapses are strengthened, is also potentially sensitive to CLAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krugliakova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ngo et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papalambros et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, we did observe positive correlations between sigma—potentially a proxy for spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holz et al., 2012</xref>)—during motor-training days 1–4 and SR on motor-training day 4. The two theories, however, are certainly not mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilckens et al., 2018</xref>) and sleep-dependent memory benefit could well complementarily rely on them both. Our tool, thus, may be utilized to disentangle the exact effects of CLAS-modulated SWS on rodent cognition. Further, CLAS can be strategically combined with other tools, such as multiunit-activity recording, and provide crucial insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms of auditory-modulated slow waves and sigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krugliakova et al., 2020</xref>), and their functional role on learning and memory.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations</title><p>An experimental limitation is the fact that we did not actively apply randomization, nor exclusion criteria, in relation to the paw preference in our experimental groups of all-male rats. Thus, as we solely tracked the left-hemisphere EEG derivation for CLAS, distinct local network dynamics determined by paw dexterity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanlon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vyazovskiy and Tobler, 2008</xref>) may have potentially affected closed-loop stimulation features in an uncontrolled manner in left- or right-pawed experimental subjects and contributed synergistically or in opposition to the CLAS modulatory effects. Larger group numbers allowing for exclusion or efficient randomization of this confounder variable shall be considered in future efforts. Lastly, in our temporal analysis of the delta power changes per 24 hr, we observed a clear pattern showing that animals in all groups present distinctively decreased delta power levels in the few hours before the behavioral test. Whether this activity pattern, likely attributable to food anticipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Northeast et al., 2019</xref>), might have compounded with our CLAS-specific delta power findings remains to be determined and, ideally, further controlled in future experiments. Finally, in relation to the lack of effect of phase-targeted rodent CLAS on ERP amplitudes, as others demonstrated earlier, the broad range achieved by our phase-tracking algorithm might have contributed to the observed variable effects of CLAS across animals at the ERP level, ultimately leading to high interindividual variability on delta activity modulation, result that agrees with previous studies using non-adaptive prediction algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fattinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fattinger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ngo et al., 2013a</xref>).

Overall, this novel tool provides successful grounds to not only further study the substrate mechanisms by which CLAS affects SWA and associated outcomes, such as cognition, but to additionally assess its effect on models of brains disease. Ultimately, CLAS of slow waves in rodents may help pave the way to the clinical implementation of this novel technique in the context of brain/body disorders that may be targeted with sleep-based therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arora and Taheri, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cook et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fung et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals, surgeries, and husbandry</title><p>To develop this tool, we used 23 young adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (Charles River, Italy) weighing 200–220 g and group-housed them in standard IVC cages (T2000) prior to interventions.

For monitoring of muscle tone, we inserted into the rats’ neck muscle a pair of gold wires that served as EMG electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). All electrodes were connected to stainless steel wires, further connected to a headpiece (Farnell, #M80-8540842, Switzerland) and fixed to the skull with dental cement.

Phase-target CLAS in humans typically uses 50 ms stimulus duration for a dominant slow oscillatory component of 0.8 Hz.

Bearing in mind that, during the testing period, the circadian cycle of the last animal of each batch was shifted 9 hr in relation to the first, the entire batch was given a 10-day adaptation to the new routine, as well as to the recording chamber and cables. We kept the animals on a feeding schedule in which they daily received 50 g/kg of regular chow after training throughout the entire experiment. This feeding schedule did not cause any significant weight loss. Water was available ad libitum. Following 24 hr of BL recording, we initiated a 16-day auditory stimulation protocol in parallel with a fine motor-skill learning task (see ‘Single-pellet reaching task protocol’ section).

We sampled all EEG/EMG signal at 610.35 Hz, amplified (PZ5 NeuroDigitizer preamplifier, TDT) after applying an anti-aliasing low-pass filter (45% of sampling frequency), synchronously digitized (RZ2 BIOAMP processor, TDT), recorded using SYNAPSE software (TDT), and stored locally (WS-8 workstation, TDT). We filtered real-time EEG between 0.1 and 36.0 Hz (second-order biquad filter, TDT), and EMG between 5.0 and 525.0 Hz (second-order biquad filter and 40 dB notch filter centered at 50 Hz, TDT), and feed the signals to real-time detection algorithms for NREM staging and phase detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Online NREM staging</title><p>Parallel rule-based NREM staging and phase detection features were continuously running alongside EEG/EMG recording, that is, sound triggers were presented at every instance the stimulatory truth function compounding these features was reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For online sleep staging, a nonlinear classifier compounds two major decision nodes: power in EEG and power in EMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamrahi et al., 2001</xref>). Briefly, we computed high-beta (20–30 Hz) and delta (0.5–4 Hz) bands’ rms on a sliding window of 1 s using an algorithm written in RPvdsEx (Real-Time Processor Visual Design Studio, TDT). Once the ratio rms<sub>delta</sub>/rms<sub>high-beta</sub>, hereinafter referred to as NREMratio, crossed a threshold individually identified during the BL recording, we further confronted EMG rms to a threshold, as well as defined during BL, in order to rule out movement artefacts. The abovementioned NREMratio and the EMG power thresholds for online NREM staging during auditory stimulation, suggestive of sustained SWS during NREM, were extracted individually and immediately after the BL recording: 24 hr EEG/EMG data was automatically scored (SPINDLE, ETH Zurich, Switzerland) and fed to a custom-written MATLAB (ver. R2016b) script. In short, a strict estimate of NREMratio threshold during NREM was established as +1.0 SD over the mean (representing the 84.1% percentile) of the NREMratio of all NREM epochs during BL. Similarly, EMG power in NREM was delimited to values –1.0 SD below the mean (threshold at 15.9% percentile) of the EMG rms values during offline-scored NREM sleep. These two values marked the transition into consolidated NREM sleep in each subject during online NREM staging and were introduced to our customized SYNAPSE (TDT) project.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Phase-targeted auditory closed-loop stimulation</title><p>For phase-targeted auditory stimulation of slow waves, SYNAPSE combines the online NREM staging feature with a phase detector.

We predetermined slow wave’s 0° as the rising zero-crossing, 90° to the positive peak, and 270° to the slow-wave trough. At every identified positive zero-crossing on the filtered signal, the phase detector resets to 0° and calculates any of the selected target phases based on the number of elapsed samples since the zero-crossing. This method offers the chance to recognize slow waves consistently across conditions, independently of the target phase. We divided the animals into three different phase-targeted stimulation approaches: up-phase stimulation targeting 60°, down-phase stimulation targeting 180°, and mock stimulation flagging slow waves at 0° (arbitrarily chosen) with no delivery of sound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

Additionally, epochs containing data outliers or signal perturbations related to environmental interference rather than changes in brain state were labeled as artefacts in wakefulness, NREM, or REM sleep. Wakefulness was defined based on high or phasic EMG activity for more than 50% of the epoch duration and low-amplitude but high-frequency EEG. NREM sleep was characterized by reduced or no EMG activity, increased EEG power in the frequency band &lt;4 Hz, and the presence of SOs. REM sleep was defined based on high-theta power (6–9 Hz frequency band) and low-muscle tone. To validate our online NREM staging method, we contrasted all recording outputs (NREMratio ∧ EMG power) with offline scores from SPINDLE. Since online staging categorizes ongoing signal in 1 s steps, these were grouped in blocks of four in order to match the length of offline scored epochs. Online scores (i.e., blocks of four values corresponding to each 1 s online assessment) were categorized as NREM sleep every time two or more 1 s values were validated true for NREM sleep. To attest for performance, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, and precision between the online and offline arrays. <italic>Sensitivity</italic> was assessed as the ratio between online-labeled NREM epochs confirmed offline as NREM sleep (true positives) and the total NREM epochs detected offline (true positives + false negatives), and reveals how strictly the pipeline identified sustained NREM sleep using the thresholds defined at BL. <italic>Specificity</italic> was calculated as the ration between online non-NREM epochs confirmed offline as other than NREM sleep (true negatives) and the total non-NREM epochs detected offline (true negatives + false positives), and measures how well the online tool can exclude all that it is not NREM sleep. Lastly, we evaluated <italic>precision</italic> as the proportion of online-labeled NREM epochs confirmed offline as NREM sleep (true positives) among all online NREM labels (true positives + false positives).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Postprocessing of EEG</title><p>Time spent in NREM sleep was determined as an absolute number of minutes for BL and all subsequent 16 days under CLAS. We also calculated an NREM sleep fragmentation index, expressed as the number of NREM sleep bouts/total number of NREM sleep epochs, with higher index values expressing higher fragmentation. Furthermore, we extracted measures of global spectral responses in specific bandwidths by processing the left-hemisphere EEG signal with a custom MATLAB routine (ver. R2016b). Briefly, the EEG signal was resampled at 300 Hz, and multiplied with a basic Fermi window function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>50</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> , to gradually attenuate the first and last 2 s (n = 600). Next, we filtered the signal between 0.5 and 48 Hz using low- and high-pass zero-phased equiripple FIR filters (Parks–McClellan algorithm; applied in both directions [<italic>filtfilt]</italic>; order<sub>high</sub> = 1880, order<sub>low</sub> = 398; –6 dB [half-amplitude] cutoff: high-pass = 0.28 Hz, low-pass = 49.12 Hz). The signal was visually inspected for regional artefacts (2 hr sliding window) not detected during automatic scoring: within scored NREM sleep, brief portions (&lt;10 sample points at 300 Hz) of signal &gt; ± [8× interquartile range] were reconstructed by piecewise cubic spline interpolation from neighboring points. We performed spectral analysis of consecutive 4 s epochs (FFT routine, Hamming window, 2 s overlap, resolution of 0.25 Hz) and normalized the power estimate of each frequency bin in relation to the total spectral power (0.5–30 Hz). To access potential interhemispheric asymmetries, we additionally extracted spectral density power from the EEG’s right derivation for each sleep stage and calculated the perceptual change from BL. To normalize for effects related to procedural factors, we subtracted the changes observed in the mock group from the stimulated groups. In order to appreciate the longitudinal CLAS effect, we calculated the daily activity changes in each frequency band—delta (&gt;0.5–4 Hz), theta (&gt;4–8 Hz), alpha (&gt;8–11 Hz), sigma (&gt;11–16 Hz), and beta (&gt;16–20 Hz)—as the daily mean power of NREM sleep epochs using the abovementioned digital filters (order<sub>high</sub> = 3758 and order<sub>low</sub> = 3861), normalized by the daily total power (0.5–30 Hz). Relative 24 hr delta- and sigma power were calculated in a similar fashion for M-T days and subsequently grand-averaged for that period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Postprocessing of sound triggers and evoked-response potentials</title><p>We analyzed the trigger distribution during pre- and motor-training days in several aspects: the daily number of triggers in wakefulness, NREM sleep and REM sleep; the ratio between the number of triggers in each sleep stage and the total number of triggers; trains of triggers as the count of any size sequences of triggers 1 s or less apart (as SOs in rats occur at a peak frequency of 1.35 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mölle et al., 2009</xref>); and ISI as the time between triggers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Analysis of the evoked auditory ERPs was performed computing EEG snippets across all auditory triggers in NREM, within a 3.5 s window time-locked to the trigger onset, and a post-stimulus cutoff of 2 s. Only triggers with a post-ISI &gt;1 s were included in this analysis. To assess the ability of the runtime paradigm to target 60° (up-phase) and 180° (down-phase), we filtered the left EEG channel between 0.5 and 2 Hz (same fashion as previous digital filters: order<sub>high</sub> = 3758, order<sub>low</sub> = 3861; –6 dB [half-amplitude] cutoff: high-pass = 0.39 Hz, low-pass = 1.91 Hz), followed by a Hilbert transform to define instantaneous phase. We averaged the instantaneous phase for all triggers delivered in NREM during the 16-day stimulation period and plotted the results in histograms with six bins of 60°. Counts were normalized to the total number of counts in each animal. Summary statistics were computed using the CircStats toolbox in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berens, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Single-pellet reaching task protocol</title><p>We used a 15 × 40 × 30 cm (W × L × H) acrylic-glass chamber with a vertical window (1 cm wide, lower edge 5 cm above the cage floor) in the front wall. This window was covered by a motorized sliding door, connected to an inductive sensor in the back wall. The rat could open the mentioned door by poking the nose to the sensor in the back wall of the cage. The training procedure consisted of two phases: (1) habituation to the testing chamber and instrumental- or pre-training during which the rat is taught to operate the motorized door (further called P-T), and (2) reaching- or motor-training during which the rat is taught to use a single paw to obtain food pellets (further called M-T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). In detail:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>P-T: We food-restricted the animals for 24 hr before the first day of the protocol to ensure engagement in the task. We introduced all animals to the testing chamber for 3 days, during 60 min daily, and allowed familiarization to the cage and the positioning of the food pellets (45 mg, Bioserve Inc, Frenchtown, USA). On the fourth day and for 4 days, we started the pre-training routine by guiding all animals to the nose-poke sensor in the back of the cage, enabling the motorized door covering the front window to open. This routine was rewarded with a single-food pellet placed at the window edge, easily reached using the tongue. Each P-T session consisted of 100 trials—opening the window and retrieving a pellet—or 60 min, whichever occurred first.</p></list-item><list-item><p>M-T: Subsequent skilled reaching training was similar to P-T, but we placed the pellet on a pedestal (7 mm diameter), located 1.5 cm outside of the cage. In this position, the rat could only use a forelimb to retrieve the pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). On the first day, each animal quickly (during the first 5–10 reaches) demonstrated a forelimb preference, determining the placement side of the pedestal (left side if right forelimb was preferred and vice versa). The right forelimb was preferred in five subjects in the up-phase group (n = 8), six in the down-phase group (n = 8), and two in the mock group (n = 6). In addition, in the mock group, two subjects showed equal preference for left and right grasping, to which we placed the pedestal on the left. Overall, we rarely saw the animals using the non-preferred forelimb. A trial ended when the pellet was grasped or pushed off the pedestal, automatically closing the door within 1 s (via built-in inductive sensor on the pedestal that sensed the presence of the pellet). We scored a reaching attempt, or occasionally the last of multiple reaching attempts per pellet, as either successful (pellet is retrieved from the pedestal and eaten), failed (pellet is pushed off the pedestal), or drop-in (rat grasps the pellet but drops it during paw retraction outside or inside the cage). Each M-T session consisted of 100 attempts or 60 min, whichever occurred first, divided into five bins of 20 pellets or 12 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Single-pellet reaching task analysis</title><p>We defined SR and FR as the number of successes or fails (excluding drop-ins) out of 100 possible attempts.

Rats that failed to achieve a minimum SR of 10% at M-T<sub>2</sub> or after would be excluded, but no subject met this criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We present all data as the mean ± SEM, unless stated otherwise.

We performed power calculations (R 4.0.2, <italic>power.anova.test</italic>) based on human literature using the same stimulation paradigms. We expected a standard deviation of 15% for all group estimates referent to delta activity change from BL (up-phase = + 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ngo et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papalambros et al., 2017</xref>]; mock = 0%; down-phase = –10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fattinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ngo et al., 2013a</xref>]), to which we obtained a sample size n = 8 (for sigma level = 0.05 and power = 0.80). Multiple RM-ANOVA (adjusted using the Greenhouse–Geisser correction when necessary) was used to assess the influence of <italic>time</italic> (days, or bins in the SPRT analysis) and <italic>condition</italic> (up-phase vs. mock, and down-phase vs. mock) on NREM proportions, time course of delta and sigma, and SR on last protocol day. Paired Wilcoxon rank tests were applied to NREM amount relative to BL values since data did not follow a normal distribution for the plotted protocol days. We used a one-sample Hotelling’s T<sup>2</sup> test to explore whether the daily changes in all frequency bands have a mean equal to a null change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oja, 2010</xref>). Differences on the time course of delta- and sigma frequencies in relation to BL were tested using multiple paired t-tests, corrected with Holm–Sidak method for multiple comparison. Phase targeting was evaluated using circular statistics from the CircStat toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berens, 2009</xref>). For the analysis of SPRT counts, Poisson distribution or, if dispersion was larger than expected, negative binomial distribution was fit to the data. Both models provide IRR for which the expected counts were estimated and analyzed using mixed regression models (fixed factors: days and groups; random factor: subjects) followed Tukey’s multiple comparison tests. Significance for the models’ fixed effects was estimated with type II Wald chi-square tests. Associations were tested using one-tailed Spearman’s rank correlations, underlying established one-directional hypotheses.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This manuscript provides a set of proof-of-concept data for a rodent model of closed-loop auditory stimulation during sleep as a method for augmenting NREM sleep thalamocortical oscillations. There is translational value to this approach as this has been previously used in human subjects- altering slow wave oscillation to modulate memory consolidation. Applying this tool to rodent research in future studies may allow for bridging some of the putative mechanisms underlying memory consolidation and behavioral changes observed with sleep.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Closed-loop auditory stimulation method to modulate sleep slow waves and motor learning performance in rats&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers agreed that this manuscript was well suited for a Tools and Resource paper. They were enthusiastic about the contribution of this CLAS method to the field, particularly for providing a tool for future investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying sleep and behavior (e.g., cognition). However, there were several concerns list below that would need to be addressed before consideration for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have 4 EEG channels recorded from each animal. The authors state that they report only left hemisphere. It is unclear which of the two left hemisphere EEG channels is used, or whether this represents an average of both. The 4 channels are the major source of neurobiological information for the study, and provide the primary basis for assessing effects of CLAS. One can only conclude that the authors have not maximized their use of available data, and there is no clearly stated reason why. The authors should clearly describe and defend why any EEG channels were excluded. Moreover, they should provide analysis of data across the various recorded channels. For example, how does CLAS affect coherence of oscillations between the EEG sites? Are there region-specific changes in CLAS effects on oscillations? How does motor learning and handedness of task performance affect each of the 4 recording locations? All of these questions can and should be clearly addressed, using the data presently available, in the results. Having this information would make interpretation of all of the other data more straightforward.</p><p>2) The authors don't seem extremely forthright in discussing their obvious lack of effect of upstate-targeted CLAS on motor learning. They should just state this clearly in the abstract, as well as the results. The framing of the results seems unbalanced. For example, the title of Figure 7: &quot;Up-phase stimulated animals attempt more, succeed more and fail less over time, whereas down-phase stimulated rats show a significantly reduced success-rate.&quot; There is no clear evidence that &quot;attempts&quot; are any different between upstate CLAS and sham CLAS animals, so this is not a fair statement (which seems to attribute attempts increasing to upstate CLAS, rather than attempts decreasing to downstate CLAS). Moreover, these differences are present on the first day of training, suggesting they are in no way related to learning. Indeed, all of the actual effects on motor task performance seem driven by deficits in the downstate-targeted rates. And all of those effects could be attributable to something very non-specific (which is not discretely tested here) such as fatigue in downstate-targeted rats. Thus I cannot agree with the way that the behavioral results are presented. Some features such as the success and failure numbers in Figure 7 are totally irrelevant in light of the attempt numbers being a variable. Success and failure rates (normalized to attempts) and changes in those rates across the multi day training are the only relevant variables. These should be measured and discussed in more concrete terms.</p><p>3) The methodology for the CLAS itself is the major novel contribution, and it would be nice to have more detailed analysis of this in the results. The early description can easily be misconstrued by readers as being targeted to NREM, however, on closer reading it is clear that the triggering can occur in any state. It would be useful to get a sense of how many (and proportion) of the CLAS triggers occur in wake and REM, and what effects these off-target triggers have on EEG activity. Is this what is being shown in 3b? It is unclear whether this is showing offline sleep scoring overall, or targeting. The targeting by day should also be shown, rather than a grand mean.</p><p>4) Regarding the accuracy of CLAS triggering reported in Figure 3, there are several points of confusion. For example, the definition of &quot;sensitivity&quot; (as opposed to &quot;precision&quot; should be outlined here, as well as in the results, readers, like myself, will have no idea what this means. In Figure 3a, it is not clear what these individual data points are, are these days of recording, or hours, or what?</p><p>5) The scoring of sleep in the various groups is inadequate. Each day should be scored, and each animal should be scored. For example, why are there only 3 data points in the sleep architecture measure in Figure 4 a-c? The sleep architecture should be shown for each and every animal, and be shown longitudinally. This would address my concern that all of the behavioral effects of CLAS (i.e., deficits in downstate CLAS rats) are driven by gradual disruption or fragmentation of NREM, or conversely by accumulated cognitive effects of disrupting NREM oscillations over days.</p><p>6) In Figure 5, there are additional points that need clarifying. I am assuming this is for offline scored NREM only? why not say this in the Figure legend? In Figure 5d-f, the choice of only pt8 (omitting pt1-7) seems a bit arbitrary to me, why not include all non-training days here?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68043.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have 4 EEG channels recorded from each animal.

Figure 1a illustrates both pairs of screws corresponding to left and right EEG derivations. The right EEG channel, diametrically opposed to the left one, was initially excluded from the analysis based on the assumption of a minor interhemispheric asymmetry in animals under regular sleep conditions. Based on the Reviewer request, we have now analyzed the remaining channel for protocol-day M-T3 and additionally split the subjects into right and left-pawed for separate analysis (<italic>Derivation symmetry</italic> in page 6 and 7, lines 145-152 of Results and Figure 4—figure supplement 1, and <italic>handedness effect</italic> in page 7, lines 152-163 of Results and Figure 4—figure supplement 2).

We have down-toned the claim in relation to the behavioral results appropriately as suggested by the Reviewer. We also included more detailed statistical assessments for this task, and revised and adapted its general presentation to address the Reviewer’s concerns (Abstract: page 2, line 37; Results: pages 10 and 11, lines 232-261 and new Figure 7; Discussion: page 15, lines 359-360, 370-371; Materials and methods: page 26, lines 649-650; Figure legend: page 34, lines 831847).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The methodology for the CLAS itself is the major novel contribution, and it would be nice to have more detailed analysis of this in the results.

Indeed, this more broad analysis was initially skipped and we judge prudent to include it now, as pointed out by the Reviewer, auditory triggers also occurred during offline-scored REM and WAKE periods. This data was integrated now in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, including the number and proportion of triggers in each stage for up- and down-state stimulation groups, grand averaged and per protocol-day (Results: page 5, lines 102-109; Materials and methods: page 24, lines 601-603).</p><p>In Figure 3b we analyze the precision (proportion of NREM sleep epochs correctly identified online) per group, in order to visualize the distribution of epochs mislabeled online across stages.</p><p>The existing figure legend was adapted for enhanced clarity and a figure legend added for the new data (page 30 and 31, lines 740-744 -existing legend- and 746-753 -new legend-).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Regarding the accuracy of CLAS triggering reported in Figure 3, there are several points of confusion.

In Figure 3a, the data points represent days of recording (12 days) from all stimulated animals (up- (n = 7) and down-state (n = 8) groups), more specifically, (7+8) * 12 data points. The figure legend was adapted for increased clarity (page 30, lines 740-744).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The scoring of sleep in the various groups is inadequate.

Initially, we decided to only show the most meaningful protocol-days related to the training routine of the single-pellet reaching task. To meet the Reviewer’s concern, we now present sleep architecture longitudinally (Results: page 6, lines 121-130 and new Figure 4a, b; Figure legends: page 31, lines 755-761).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 5, there are additional points that need clarifying.

We have now clarified this further in the figure legend (page 32, line 787-788).</p><p>In relation to Figure 5d-f, the choice of presenting data from protocol-day P-T8 was not arbitrary. We included day P-T8 along with the MT1-4 in the grand-average of the motor-training phase with the intention to always show δ-activity 1 day before and after each SPRT session. This objective related to the well-accepted notion that not only δ activity may change the performance on a behavioral test but also the training/testing has an effect on following SWA, therefore, making a point of interest evaluating both time windows. This was now more explicitly explained in the figure legend (page 32, lines 794-797).</p></body></sub-article></article>
