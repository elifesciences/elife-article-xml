However, it is not known whether there are ES cell-specific mechanisms regulating mitotic fidelity. Here we showed that Autoimmune Regulator (<italic>Aire</italic>), a transcription coordinator involved in immune tolerance processes, is a critical spindle-associated protein in mouse ES(mES) cells. BioID analysis showed that AIRE associates with spindle-associated proteins in mES cells. Loss of function analysis revealed that <italic>Aire</italic> was important for centrosome number regulation and spindle pole integrity specifically in mES cells. We also identified the c-terminal LESLL motif as a critical motif for AIRE’s mitotic function. Combined maternal and zygotic knockout further revealed Aire’s critical functions for spindle assembly in preimplantation embryos. These results uncovered a previously unappreciated function for <italic>Aire</italic> and provide new insights into the biology of stem cell proliferation and potential new angles to understand fertility defects in humans carrying <italic>Air</italic>e mutations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28131.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28131.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28131.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before the cells in our body separate to create copies of themselves, they need to duplicate their genetic material. To do so, they construct a machine called the spindle apparatus to divide their DNA evenly. In the embryo of mammals, embryonic stem cells – cells that can create all the cell types in adults – divide swiftly. This makes them prone to make mistakes that could affect the health of the organism they will develop into. To limit the number of errors, the embryonic stem cells divide more stringently and have more effective machineries to create a spindle apparatus.</p><p>Together with a team of researchers, Gu previously showed that a gene and its protein called the ‘autoimmune regulator’, or AIRE for short, are highly active in embryonic stem cells and embryos. The autoimmune regulator usually plays an important role in helping immune cells to distinguish the body's own proteins from those of foreign invaders. It was also shown that some people suffering from fertility problems carry mutations in the AIRE gene. However, until now, it was not known if AIRE also had a specific role in embryonic stem cells.</p><p>Using mouse embryonic stem cells and early embryos that were modified to either completely lack the AIRE gene or to produce a defective AIRE protein, Gu et al. now discovered a new purpose for AIRE. The AIRE protein interacted with a group of proteins that are associated with the spindle apparatus and was needed so that the spindle could form properly. When cells lacked the AIRE gene, a faulty spindle apparatus was assembled. Moreover, when a defective AIRE protein was produced, the structure of spindle apparatus in embryonic stem cells was also disrupted.</p><p>A next step will be to further investigate how AIRE mutations could affect stem cell maintenance and fertility, which could lead to better ways to detect fertility defects in the future.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28131.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28131.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>Aire</kwd><kwd>early embryo</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-143334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name><name><surname>Cockburn</surname><given-names>Katie</given-names></name><name><surname>Rossant</surname><given-names>Janet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008453</institution-id><institution>Ontario Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009326</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambert</surname><given-names>Jean-Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN143301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambert</surname><given-names>Jean-Philippe</given-names></name><name><surname>Gingras</surname><given-names>Anne-Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>AIRE played novel roles in the mitosis process in embryonic stem cells and early embryo cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Self-renewal capability, defined as the ability of cells to proliferate while sustaining differentiation potential, is one of the defining features of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martello and Smith, 2014</xref>). Robust proliferation ability, not only rapid cell division but also stable karyotype maintenance, ensures the maintenance and expansion of stem cell populations. Embryonic stem (ES) cells, the in vitro counterpart of preimplantation epiblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boroviak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boroviak and Nichols, 2014</xref>), possess particularly robust self-renewal capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martello and Smith, 2014</xref>). Unlike most somatic stem cell types that divide relatively infrequently, ES cells undergo constant proliferation while accumulating few karyotypic abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suda et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weissbein et al., 2014</xref>). ES cells undergo specialized embryo-like cell cycles, characterized as rapid cell cycles with brief gap phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kareta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coronado et al., 2013</xref>). Unlike in most somatic cells where coordinated fluctuation of Cyclin-CDK activities drive the cells through the cell cycle, ES cells possess higher and constant activity of most Cyclin-CDK pairs except for Cyclin B-CDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stead et al., 2002</xref>). These cell cycle patterns have been proposed to limit the window in which ES cells are responsive to differentiation cues, therefore promoting self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dalton, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</xref>). However, it also subjects the mitosis process to additional stress since the fluctuating activity of Cyclin-CDKs is vital for aspects of mitotic fidelity, such as centrosome maturation/amplification and kinetochore microtubule stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lacey et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haase et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Given that ES cells actually show remarkable karyotypic stability, this might suggest that they possess additional specific molecular mechanisms to ensure mitosis fidelity.</p><p>Autoimmune Regulator (<italic>Aire</italic>) is a central coordinator of immune tolerance. It is specifically expressed in medullary thymic epithelium cells (mTECs) and mediates negative selection against auto-reactive T cells by inducing promiscuous expression of tissue specific antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ramsey et al., 2002</xref>). However, it has long been known that <italic>Aire</italic> is also expressed in germ cell progenitors and that mutations of <italic>Aire</italic> could cause fertility defects in mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Finnish-German APECED Consortium et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hubert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schaller et al., 2008</xref>). Fertility defects were frequently attributed to aneuploidy in embryo cells, originating from meiotic or mitotic errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tempest and Martin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Webster and Schuh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Daughtry and Chavez, 2016</xref>), implying a possible role of Aire in these processes. We and others have reported the expression of <italic>Aire</italic> in mouse ES cells and early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nishikawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bin et al., 2012</xref>). The expression of <italic>Aire</italic> was specific to undifferentiated mouse ES cells and gradually diminished with differentiation at both mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gu et al., 2010</xref>). Among embryo-derived stem cell lines, <italic>Aire</italic> expression was specific to pluripotent ES cells and not found in extraembryonic trophoblast stem cells (the counterpart of postimplantation extraembryonic ectoderm(EXE) progenitor cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roberts and Fisher, 2011</xref>) or eXtraembryonic Endoderm cells (our unpublished data) at both mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, <italic>Aire</italic> has also been shown to be up-regulated during the final stage of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) formation when iPS clones become transgene-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hussein et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of <italic>Aire</italic> mRNA has been detected in mouse oocytes and all preimplantation stages and early postimplantation stages(up till E6.5) embryos but the expression levels and patterns at the protein level are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nishikawa et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, it was recently shown that <italic>Aire</italic> mRNA is highly expressed in peri-implantation (E4.5–5.5) mouse epiblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boroviak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), the in vivo cell type that naïve ES cells most likely represent. We have previously shown that knocking down <italic>Aire</italic> in mouse ES cells caused self-renewal and karyotype defects, suggesting a role for <italic>Aire</italic> in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gu et al., 2010</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism remained elusive.</p><p>AIRE is not a canonical transcription factor that recognizes specific DNA sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mathis and Benoist, 2009</xref>), and so there is considerable interest in understanding how AIRE functions in inducing promiscuous expression and other processes. Identifying its interaction partners is critical for revealing the molecular pathways in which AIRE is involved. Through different methods including GST pulldown, yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, a number of interacting partners, including DAXX, P-TEFb and ATF7ip-MBD1, have been identified for AIRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meloni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oven et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Waterfield et al., 2014</xref>). The general conclusion from these studies is that AIRE performs its transcriptional function by acting as a hub protein, coordinating chromatin remodeling, general transcription, RNA processing and nuclear transport, to induce promiscuous gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramson et al., 2010</xref>). However, most of these studies were performed in somatic cell lines lacking endogenous <italic>Aire</italic> expression, which may not reveal its natural interactome. Moreover, the co-immunoprecipitation methods used in most of these studies are more efficient in identifying soluble proteins, rather than proteins tightly bound to insoluble structures like condensed chromosomes or mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lambert et al., 2015</xref>). Other approaches are more suited for capturing partners of insoluble components. BioID is an in vivo proximity biotinylation based assay for identifying proximity partners of a protein of interest. In this assay the protein of interest (bait protein) is expressed as a fusion protein with an abortive biotin ligase (BirA R118G or BirA*) which effectively catalyzes the formation of locally-concentrated activated biotin that covalently labels proximal proteins, the labeled proteins can be recovered under harsh solubilizing conditions, purified by avidin affinity purification and then identified by mass spectrometry analysis. BioID has been employed to identify proximity interactions in relatively insoluble structures including chromatin, nuclear envelope and centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lambert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). We reasoned that identification of AIRE’s partners with BioID methods in ES cells could help reveal its full function in stem cells and uncover new regulatory aspects of stem cell self-renewal.</p><p>We characterized the proximal protein partners of AIRE in mouse ES(mES) cells using BioID technology and found that, besides proteins functioning in known AIRE-related processes such as general transcription and RNA processing, AIRE also interacts with a group of mitotic spindle-associated proteins. We present evidence that AIRE is a spindle-associated protein in mES cells where it is essential for spindle assembly, centrosome number and structural maintenance. We further showed that the last LxxLL(LESLL) motif, a multifunctional motif that has been implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Plevin et al., 2005</xref>), is critical for the mitotic function of AIRE in mES cells and that a known human disease mutation specifically affecting this motif could induce mitotic defects. We also present data showing that maternal-zygotic <italic>Aire</italic> knockout embryos have mitosis defects at the blastocyst stage. These results provide a new insight into <italic>Aire</italic>’s non-immune functions in stem cells and suggest novel ES-specific mechanisms for regulating mitotic fidelity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AIRE is a spindle-associated protein in mES cells</title><p>To identify the interaction partners of AIRE in ES cells, we conducted BioID analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). ES cells expressing <italic>mCherry-BirA<sup>*</sup></italic> were used as controls to exclude promiscuous biotinylation activities of the BirA<sup>*</sup> enzyme and <italic>Aire-BirA*</italic> expressing ES cell samples were used to identify interaction partners. As shown by streptavidin-FITC staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, mCherry-BIRA<sup>*</sup> biotinylated proteins distributed evenly in cells, while AIRE- BIRA<sup>*</sup> biotinylated proteins showed an interesting mitotic spindle association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> arrowheads and magnified images). Western blotting analysis confirmed that the expression level of mCherry-BIRA<sup>*</sup>/AIRE-BIRA<sup>*</sup> and biotinylated protein amounts were similar between controls and samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The biotinylated proteins were then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis and a high confidence list of AIRE-interacting partners was generated using the SAINT algorithm with FDR ≤ 1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Teo et al., 2014</xref>). Strikingly, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of AIRE-interacting partners revealed that the two most enriched Biological Processes (BP) were ‘mitotic nuclear division’ and ‘cell division’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As for Cellular Compartment (CC), mitosis-related terms such as ‘cytoskeleton’, ‘microtubule’ ‘centrosome’, ‘spindle pole’ and ‘spindle’ were enriched(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The interactors included proteins functioning in three crucial aspects of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>): (i) kinase cascade regulation of the mitotic process (eg. AURKB, CDK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wieser and Pines, 2015</xref>), (ii) centrosome/spindle pole maturation and integrity (eg. SPICE1, HAUS5, HAUS8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Comartin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lawo et al., 2009</xref>) and (iii) regulation of microtubule dynamics in spindles (eg. CKAP2, CLASP1,CLASP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bratman and Chang, 2008</xref>). These data suggested spindle localization and mitosis-associated functions of AIRE in ES cells. Additionally, proteins functioning in general transcription processes and RNA processing were also identified, suggesting that <italic>Aire</italic> may also play a similar role in ES cells as in immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Duolink signal between anti-Flag M2 antibody and antibodies against respective candidate partners in mES cells before doxycycline induction of 3XFlag-AIRE were used to control background signal and Duolink signal between 3XFlag-AIRE and AURKA, a protein not identified as AIRE’s proximity partner but highly related to an identified partner AURKB, was used as negative control.

Immunostaining with an antibody against mouse AIRE showed co-localization of AIRE with α-tubulin (TUBA)-marked mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further corroborate this finding, we generated <italic>Aire</italic>-3XFlag mice (C-terminal 3XFlag-Tag fusion to endogenous <italic>Aire</italic>) using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and derived ES cells from these mice. Co-staining with the M2 anti-Flag antibody and β-tubulin(TUBB) antibody showed that AIRE co-localized with the mitotic spindle apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To gain further insight into the precise localization of AIRE on the spindle, we performed Structured Illumination Microscope (SIM) analysis. We found AIRE presented as localized foci along the spindle microtubules during metaphase and anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). It also formed a cloud-like structure covering the spindle pole and its peripheral region, suggesting a role in spindle pole/centrosome functions. In mitotic telophase cells, AIRE localized to the base of the mid-spindle, sparing the central part of midbody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating a possible role in cytokinesis. These results identify AIRE as a bona fide spindle associated protein during mitosis in ES cells, in addition to its earlier reported nuclear foci localization in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gu et al., 2010</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28131.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>AIRE localizes to mitotic spindles in ES cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining of AIRE and α-tubulin (TUBA) in AmES8 cells.

Wild type and six truncated forms of Flag-tagged AIRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) were introduced into ES cells as doxycycline (Dox) inducible transgenes and the spindle localization was investigated following addition of Dox by immunofluorescence staining. We found that the removal of either the HSR/CARD domain or the SAND domain abrogated the spindle localization of AIRE, while deletions of any of the two PHD domains or the C-terminal 70 amino acid(aa) flexible tail region (AIRE<sup>Δc70</sup>) had no effect on localization to the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, defective spindle morphology and decreased colony formation ability were observed upon 12 hr overexpression of the AIRE<sup>Δc70</sup> truncated form, indicating a dominant negative effect on spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The expression of core pluripotency factors OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 was not changed at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

In 2000, a rare mutation, AIRE 33031delG, was reported from Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ishii et al., 2000</xref>). The mutation resulted in a frame-shift in the Ala505 codon, an amino acid sequence change thereafter and premature termination at amino acid 520, which eliminated the LESLL motif (aa 516–520 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Since the premature termination codon was located 7 bp upstream of the last Exon-Exon junction, the mRNA would likely escape nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the last LESLL motif. We investigated the function of this mutation in mouse ES cells by overexpressing a murine <italic>Aire</italic> version mimicking the AIRE 33031delG-induced truncation) (AIRE505fs). We found that the truncated protein caused similar spindle defects and mitotic arrest in mES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Therefore the last LESLL motif is essential for the mitotic function of Aire in mouse ES cells and a human mutant AIRE lacking the c-terminal residues containing LESLL motif could potentially lead to mitotic defects during human reproduction and development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Aire is essential for centrosome number maintenance and spindle pole integrity in ES cells</title><p>The BioID data showed that Aire established proximal interactions with a number of proteins functioning in centrosome duplication and maturation, including SPICE1, HAUS5 and HAUS8. We also observed extra γ-tubulin positive foci of various sizes on defective spindles in both <italic>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Therefore we investigated the centrosome and spindle pole structure under SIM with γ-tubulin/Nedd1 double staining. Interestingly, both <italic>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpressing ES cells possessed extra centrosomes in S/G2 phases, while the size of the centrosome was not obviously different (images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref> and quantifications in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). During mitosis, spindle poles with increased size consisting of multiple aggregated centrosomes were frequently observed in <italic>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, while in AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpressing ES cells, spindle poles were obviously fragmented (images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref> and quantifications in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpression caused stronger proliferation and mitosis phenotypes, we further investigated the microtubule organization center (MTOC) functions of mitotic centrosomes in these cells. We found that instead of forming bipolar spindles, the spindle microtubules formed a disorganized meshwork with fragmented γ-tubulin rings upon AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpression, suggesting the abrogation of MTOC functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The spindle pole/centrosome defect observed here could be either due to malformed centrioles or to failed organization and maintenance of pericentriolar material (PCM) integrity. Using SIM, we imaged centriole and pericentriolar material by double staining mES cells for acetyl-tubulin and γ-tubulin. We did not observe any obvious morphological defects of centrioles in AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpressing cells in both S/G2 and M phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, although the γ-tubulin-marked pericentriolar material compactly surrounded the mitotic centriole in all the control groups, it failed to cover the centriole in mitotic AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Using the BioID method, we identified proximity partners for AIRE in ES cells. In addition to proteins functioning in general transcription and RNA processing, processes in which Aire was already known to function in somatic cells such as mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mathis and Benoist, 2009</xref>), we identified many spindle associated proteins interacting with AIRE in ES cells. Indeed, spindle associated proteins were more enriched among AIRE-interacting proteins than were transcription-associated proteins. We then showed that AIRE localized to mitotic spindles in ES cells and determined that the HSR and SAND domains were responsible for spindle recruitment. The HSR domain has been proposed to be important for the self-dimerization of AIRE and for the localization of human <italic>AIRE</italic> to filamentous/microtubule cytoskeletal structures in somatic cell lines during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rinderle et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pitkänen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Halonen et al., 2004</xref>). However, mitotic spindle localization was not investigated in previous studies. The SAND domain is generally considered a DNA binding domain; however, in AIRE the critical amino acid residues for DNA binding are not conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Purohit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bottomley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Perniola and Musco, 2014</xref>). Rather, our data suggest that the SAND domain plays a specific role in spindle localization of AIRE in ES cells.</p><p>Using conditional knockout strategies, we showed that <italic>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ES cells and <italic>m-z-</italic> preimplantation embryo cells formed spindles with multiple centrosomes in mitosis, suggesting a critical function of <italic>Aire</italic> in centrosome sustenance and spindle assembly. To our knowledge this is a novel function for <italic>Aire</italic> and one that is likely to be ES cell/embryo specific since <italic>Aire</italic> is only expressed in a few restricted somatic cell types in adults and those cell types, such as mTECs, are generally not proliferative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hubert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gardner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yamano et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is difficult at this point to exclude the possibility of <italic>Aire</italic> playing similar mitotic functions in rare populations of somatic stem cell types since the full range of expression of <italic>Aire</italic> is largely unknown.</p><p>We have previously shown that knocking down <italic>Aire</italic> in ES cells using shRNA caused proliferation and karyotype defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gu et al., 2010</xref>). Here we show that both proliferation and colony formation were impaired in <italic>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ES cells. <italic>Aire m-z-</italic> preimplantation embryos also showed proliferation defects but early lineage segregation was not apparently disrupted. The fact that cell proliferation can still continue, albeit in an impaired form in Aire mutant ES cells and embryos, despite the clearly disturbed spindle and centrosome morphologies is not inconsistent with what is known about the roles of centrosomes in early embryonic cell cycles. It is known that cells can proliferate in the presence of multiple centrosomes by centrosome congregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ring et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Quintyne et al., 2005</xref>), and in the absence of centrosomes, so long as a p53-mediated G1 checkpoint is somehow compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lambrus et al., 2015</xref>). That checkpoint is likely compromised in ES cells and only begins to function at midgestation stages in mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Suvorova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aladjem et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014</xref>). In the preimplantation embryo, early mitotic divisions involve meiotic-like acentrosomal spindle assembly, while regular somatic-like mitosis where spindle poles are organized around centrosomes is only established around the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Courtois et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Both germ cell-specific <italic>Aire</italic> knockout males and females were fully fertile, suggesting that at least in the genetic background investigated (CD1) the depletion of Aire in germ cells was not sufficient to induce a consistent infertile phenotype, as had been reported before in <italic>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></italic> conventional knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ramsey et al., 2002</xref>). It is plausible that the infertility defects reported in conventional <italic>Aire</italic> mutants may actually result from the combination of auto-immune and strain-dependent embryonic defects. Since human APECED patients also show high variability between individuals with regard to fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Finnish-German APECED Consortium et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Perheentupa, 2006</xref>), the relationship between autoimmune defects, germline and embryo defects and genetic strain/background factors still remain to be dissected. It is not clear whether the proliferation delay and spindle defects observed in <italic>Aire m-z-</italic> blastocysts would result in later problems in development, given that both human and mouse embryos can overcome a certain level of mitotic and karyotypic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Echten-Arends et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We found the last LxxLL motif (LESLL) to be critical for the mitotic function of Aire in ES cells. Truncations involving this motif (AIRE<sup>Δc70</sup>, AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup>, AIRE505fs) all perturbed centrosome numbers and spindle pole integrity when overexpressed in ES cells. Interestingly, the effect seemed to be specific to ES cells since the overexpression of the same AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> in NIH3T3 cells did not cause mitotic defects. These data support the idea that Aire plays a specific role in mitotic processes in ES cells relative to somatic cells Interestingly, not many spindle-associated proteins were identified as interaction partners of Aire in previous studies using somatic cell lines overexpressing Aire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meloni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Waterfield et al., 2014</xref>). This could also support an ES cell-specific mitotic function for Aire but could also be related to technical differences between the BioID method used in this study and the co-immunoprecipitation or yeast two-hybrid methods used by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lambert et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The mitosis-disrupting effect of overexpressing AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> was more severe than the phenotype following Aire depletion in ES cells. The reasons for this are not entirely clear. However, our BioID data suggest that Aire may act in a multi-protein complex, including SPICE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Archinti et al., 2010</xref>), Human Augmin Complex (HAUS) complex proteins (Haus5 and Haus8) and CLASP proteins (CLASP1 and CLASP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lawo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bratman and Chang, 2008</xref>), which have all been reported to function in centrosome maturation/duplication and mitotic spindle organization. Removal of AIRE from the complex by gene knockout could result in a partially functional complex, while replacement with a dominant negative form like AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> could disrupt the conformation of that complex and cause a more complete loss of function, as have been shown before in other experimental systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Veitia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Papp et al., 2003</xref>). Another possible explanation for the observation of more severe mitotic phenotype in AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpressing cells than Aire depleted cells is the existence of redundant pathways. To this end, a particularly interesting gene is Deaf1, another SAND domain containing transcription regulator structurally related to Aire that conducts similar functions to activate expression of auto-antigen genes in the peripheral lymphoid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yip et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, Deaf1 has been shown to be expressed in embryos and ES cells and maternal zygotic depletion of Deaf1 homolog in Drosophila embryos caused early embryo arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Veraksa et al., 2002</xref>). It would be interesting to study the effect of depletion of Deaf1 or combined depletion of Aire and Deaf1 to understand the function of this group of genes in mES cells. It is also important to point out that a previously reported disease causing mutation (AIRE505fs) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ishii et al., 2000</xref>) results in the deletion of the LESLL motif. Mouse AIRE proteins with an analogous truncation produced a mitosis-disrupting phenotype similar to AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> in ES cells. This suggests that some patient mutations might have mitosis-disrupting effects in early embryos, which might be related to the reported fertility phenotypes.</p><p>The mechanism by which Aire sustained the centrosome number stability and structure integrity in mES cells is not clear at this point. However, the acquisition of multiple centrosomes, especially in the situation of AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpression, occurred within 12 hr of doxycycline induction, which is less than one cell cycle of mES cells. This suggests excess duplication of centrosomes. CDK2 has been identified as a proximity partner of AIRE in mES cells. Elevated centrosome associated CDK2 activity in a p53 deficient cellular environment has been shown to cause centrosome over-duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tarapore and Fukasawa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adon et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, mES cells possess sustained elevated CDK2 activity and have inefficient p53 functions but normally manage to maintain normal centrosome numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stead et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aladjem et al., 1998</xref>). We speculate that, by interacting with CDK2, AIRE somehow limits the centrosome over-duplication that would be activated by the sustained elevated CDK2 activity. Furthermore AIRE also interacts with a group of centrosome associated proteins including SPICE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Archinti et al., 2010</xref>) and Human Augmin Complex (HAUS) complex proteins (Haus5 and Haus8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lawo et al., 2009</xref>) which have been shown to function in maintenance of centrosome number and integrity. Disruption of this interaction could also contribute to the centrosome phenotypes of Aire depletion and AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpression in mES cells. However, since AIRE also interacted with proteins in mES cells that function in processes such as transcription regulation and RNA processing, it is still possible that defects in those processes upon Aire depletion or AIRE <sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpression indirectly contributed to the mitotic phenotype. Further study is required to separate out the different functions of Aire in mES cells and embryos.</p><p>Aside from the implications in mitosis regulation in ES cells and early embryos, this study also raises an interesting speculation concerning the evolution of the immune system. As a relatively newly evolved system, the immune system frequently co-opts proteins from basic processes like cell proliferation and embryonic development. For example, the Toll receptor plays a role in the formation of the dorsal-ventral axis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Valanne et al., 2011</xref>) and the Toll-like receptors not only form the basis of innate immunity, but have also been shown to play a role in proliferation in cell types including ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2010</xref>). Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a critical enzyme for somatic hypermutation, gene conversion, and class-switch recombination in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peled et al., 2008</xref>), has also been shown to function in epigenetic reprogramming of primordial germ cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhutani et al., 2010</xref>). The possibility of a similar, multi-functional role of Aire is especially intriguing because a central tolerance system coordinated by activating promiscuous gene expression is not required until the evolution of the adaptive immune system and its diversification of immune receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schatz and Swanson, 2011</xref>). Organisms may have adapted molecules like Aire from existing biological processes to establish a tolerance mechanism and cope with the random immune receptor diversification. It would be an interesting question to trace the molecular evolution of Aire and determine its function in embryo development in lower organisms.</p><p>In conclusion, this study uncovered a novel role of Aire in regulating mitosis in ES cells with implications for the biology of proliferation regulation in ES cells and early embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Sources of materials and DNA sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">2</xref>.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs</title><p>To generate the C-terminal Aire-3XFlag-tag expression construct, the full length coding sequence (CDS) of Aire transcription variant 1(longest variant) was amplified from mES cDNA and cloned into the pCMV-3Xflag 14 vector ((Sigma, Oakville, Canada)).

After three washes in flow buffer (DPBS containing 1% BSA), the cells were incubated in Propidium Iodide (PI)/RNase Staining Solution (Cell Signaling Technology) in the dark for 30 min at 37°C and then stored at 4°C before analysis (cells could be stored for up to 1 week). The cells were then analyzed on a BD LSRII-CFI BGRV and the data were analyzed by Flowjo software (FlowJo, LLC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Realtime PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen) and cDNAs were synthesized with QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen).

Embryos were flushed from uterus at E3.5 and fixed in 4% PFA and imaged under a stereoscope for blastocyst rate analysis. Embryos derived from each female were considered as one experimental unit for blastocyst rate analysis. The embryos were then permeabilized with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) containing 0.5% TritonX-100 for 15 min and blocked in DPBS containing 0.1% TritonX-100% and 5% FBS (Blocking Buffer(BB) for 1 hr at room temperature. After removing the zona pellucida with EmbryoMax Acidic Tyrode's Solution (Millipore), the embryos were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C as indicated in Figures and Figure legends. The next day, embryos were washed in BB three times and stained with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) for 45 min at room temperature.

For cellular expriments, 2–3 biological replicates were performed. For 4-OH-tamoxyfen or Doxycycline treatment experiment, independent sets of control and treated cells were considered as biological replicates. For mouse fertility test, 2–3 breeding pairs of corresponding genotypes were analyzed. For blastocyst rate analysis, embryos isolated from 10 to 20 females from each groups were analyzed. For blastocyst cell number analysis, embryos collected from at least three females were analyzed in each group. For spindle analysis in blastocysts, 20–30 mitotic cells from at least 10 blastocysts of each genotypes were analyzed. The experiments were not blinded from investigators: the identities of the samples were known throughout the experiment. All statistics were performed with Prism software(GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA. USA). For cell growth, colony formation and qPCR, Wilson’s t-test was performed. For other data, data were first tested with D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test, then Wilson’s t-test or Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test were used for data that passed or did not pass the normality test respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CHIR grant #FDN-143334) (JR).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor.

The speculated mechanisms are addressed in Discussion section as:</p><p>‘The mechanism by which Aire sustained the centrosome number stability and structure integrity in mES cells is not clear at this point. […] Disruption of this interaction could also contribute to the centrosome phenotypes of Aire depletion and AIRE<sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpression in mES cells.’</p><p>And the speculation that Deaf1 gene could be a redundant gene with Aire in mES cells were addressed in Discussion section as:</p><p>“Another possible explanation for the observation of more severe mitotic phenotype in AIRE<sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpressing cells than Aire depleted cells is the existence of redundant pathways. […] It would be interesting to study the effect of depletion of Deaf1 or combined depletion of Aire and Deaf1 to understand the function of this group of genes in mES cells.”</p><p><italic>&quot;As the authors noted, and as their immunofluorescence data shows, AIRE is present in cellular foci in addition to the spindle pole even during mitosis. This raises the issue that the interactome includes interacting partners which are disconnected from the spindle pole, and that phenotypes in the mutant cells cannot be unequivocally distinguished between the spindle phenotype and other cellular phonotypes. &quot;</italic> </p><p>We thank reviewer 2 Dr. Andrews for pointing out and agree that at this point we could not unequivocally distinguish between a direct effect on spindle assembly and indirect effects from defects of other processes that Aire participates in in mES cells. We addressed this in Discussion section as:</p><p>“However, since AIRE also interacted with proteins in mES cells that function in processes such as transcription regulation and RNA processing, it is still possible that defects in those processes upon Aire depletion or AIRE<sup>ΔLESLL</sup> overexpression indirectly contributed to the mitotic phenotype. Further study is required to separate out the different functions of Aire in mES cells and embryos.”</p><p><italic>Finally reviewer 2 notes that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> does not convincingly support claims of specific AIRE expression in the ICM. The figure should be replaced or the claims modified, and the relationship between expression in the embryo and TE or ES stem cell lines clarified.</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;The authors note that AIRE staining in embryos was observed in both TE cells and in ICM cells (subsection “Aire is critical for spindle integrity in preimplantation embryos”).

The ICM seems not to express AIRE at all. This should be clarified.&quot;</italic> </p><p>We thank reviewer 2 Dr. Andrews for pointing out the confusion about the contradiction between the claim of Epiblast specific expression in embryos and the pan-blastocyst expression showed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and we totally agree that we were not clear in the statements. In fact, we didn’t try to claim Epiblast specific expression of Aire in mouse early embryos. In Introduction we did report that we observed specific expression of Aire in mouse ES cells relative to TS and Xen cells. However, TS cells to a larger extend represents post-implantation extraembryonic-ectoderm(EXE) progenitor cells (now stated in Introduction section, second paragraph) and the molecular characteristics are rather different from preimplantation TE. For example, TS cells highly express Sox2 while TE cells don’t and TS cells highly express Elf5 while TE cells only express it at very low level. Therefore, we actually only claimed that Aire was differentially expressed between the three types of in vitro stem cell lines but didn’t make any claim about the expression pattern in mouse preimplantation embryos/blastocysts. To further clarify it, we stated in Introduction section that ‘The presence of Aire mRNA have been detected in mouse oocytes and all preimplantational stages and early postimplantational stages (up till E6.5) embryos but the expression levels and patterns at protein level are unknown.”</p><p>Therefore to our knowledge our immunostaining data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> is the first strictly controlled data (with a m-z- staining control) that revealed the expression pattern of AIRE in mouse blastocysts at protein level. We agree that the protein level of AIRE in mouse blastocysts is relatively low, however, with exactly same imaging acquisition and displaying parameters, it showed obvious positive signals in both ICM and TE relative to the m-z- embryos. We apologize for the dim looking pictures on original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, probably caused by the image transformation to PDF. We have replaced the picture with a more clear version.</p></body></sub-article></article>
