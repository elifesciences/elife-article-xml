This study explores the role of the Serine/Threonine kinases PIM1 and PIM2 in controlling mouse CD8 T lymphocyte antigen receptor-mediated activation and differentiation in response to the cytokines Interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-15. We show that the PIM kinases are dispensable for antigen-receptor and IL-15 controlled differentiation programs, but that they play a selective role in IL-2 regulated CD8 T cell fate. One key insight was that PIM kinases controlled the migratory capabilities of effector CD8 T cells, with <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficient CD8 T cells unable to fully switch off the naive T cell chemokine and adhesion receptor program during effector differentiation. PIM kinases were also needed for IL-2 to sustain high expression of the glucose transporters SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 and to maintain activity of the nutrient-sensing kinase mTORc1. Strikingly, PIM kinases did not have a dominant impact on IL-2-driven transcriptional programs but rather selectively modulated protein synthesis to shape cytotoxic T cell proteomes. This study reveals a selective role of PIM kinases in IL-2 control of CD8 T cells and highlights how regulated changes in protein synthesis can impact T cell phenotypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>PIM kinase</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>protein translation</kwd><kwd>IL-2</kwd><kwd>IL-15</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/205023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cantrell</surname><given-names>Doreen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/202950</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cantrell</surname><given-names>Doreen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 1543-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marchingo</surname><given-names>Julia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1120748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marchingo</surname><given-names>Julia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/705984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marchingo</surname><given-names>Julia M</given-names></name><name><surname>Cantrell</surname><given-names>Doreen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Their clonal expansion and differentiation to cytotoxic effector or memory CD8 T cells is controlled by signalling pathways initiated by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), co-stimulatory molecules, and cytokines. Receptor engagement by immune stimuli triggers the activation of cytosolic tyrosine kinases that then direct the activity of a diverse network of Serine/Threonine kinases, disseminating signals from plasma membrane to cell interior. The Src family and ZAP70 Tyrosine kinases initiate this process downstream of the TCR, with the Janus kinases (JAK) as the main signal transducer for important cytokine regulators of T cell differentiation, IL-2 and IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantrell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saravia et al., 2020</xref>). The subsequent network of Serine/Threonine kinases that is engaged beyond these initiating events coordinates phosphorylation of a diverse array of protein targets. These protein targets include chromatin regulators, transcription factors, translation machinery, cytoskeletal proteins, and metabolic enzymes, which then control the changes in transcriptional, translational, and metabolic programs that drive effector and memory T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Locard-Paulet et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>CD8 T cells express ∼200 Serine/Threonine protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Navarro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howden et al., 2019</xref>). There is a good understanding of the roles of some Serine/Threonine kinases in CD8 T cells, including the role of the diacylglycerol regulated kinases, MAP kinases ERK1 and 2, Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate- controlled kinases PDK1 and AKT, and the nutrient-sensing kinases mammalian Target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORc1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finlay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rolf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blagih et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantrell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hukelmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howden et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saravia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Damasio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spinelli et al., 2021</xref>). However, beyond these core kinases there is much still to learn about how many of the ~200 Serine/Threonine kinases expressed in CD8 T cells contribute to the control of T cell function. In this context, the PIM kinases are a family of Serine/Threonine kinases that are strongly and rapidly induced in T cells responding to immune stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peperzak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackson et al., 2012</xref>). The PIM family contains three Serine/Threonine kinases, PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3, of which T lymphocytes predominantly express PIM1 and PIM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mikkers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). As PIM kinases are constitutively active, their participation in signalling cascades is dictated by regulated changes in their protein expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Warfel and Kraft, 2015</xref>). PIM1 and PIM2 have little to no expression in naïve T cells but are induced by T-cell receptor activation and costimulation (e.g. CD27) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wingett et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peperzak et al., 2010</xref>). PIM kinases are also direct transcriptional targets of JAK/STAT signalling pathways and as such PIM1 and/or PIM2 are rapidly induced in T cells downstream of a diverse array of cytokines, including multiple common cytokine receptor γ-chain family cytokines, IL-6 and IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matikainen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Warfel and Kraft, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchacher et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>There have been some analyses of how deletion of PIM kinases impacts CD8 T cell function. A mild reduction in <italic>Pim1/Pim2/Pim3</italic>-deficient CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation has been observed in response to sub-optimal TCR stimulation and IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mikkers et al., 2004</xref>), and there is evidence that PIM1 and PIM2 control survival pathways in naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells in concert with mTORc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Pim1/Pim2/Pim3</italic> deletion is reported to promote expression of stemness and memory-associated transcription factors including Bcl6 and Tcf7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee et al., 2019</xref>), and PIM kinase activity has been linked with maintenance of memory CD8 T cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knudson et al., 2017</xref>). It has also been shown recently that <italic>Pim1/Pim2</italic> deficiency prevented mTORc1 activation and the proliferation of non-conventional intra-epithelial gut CD8 T lymphocytes (IEL) in response to the cytokine IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Elevated PIM kinase expression has been noted in patient T cells for a number of autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis and coeliac disease, and PIM kinase inhibition has been proposed as a possible intervention to dampen autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maney et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2022</xref>). PIM kinase inhibitors have also entered clinical trials to treat some cancers (e.g. multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukaemia, prostate cancer), and although they have not been effective as a monotherapy, there is interest in combining these with immunotherapies. This is due to studies showing PIM inhibition reducing expression of inhibitory molecules (e.g. PD-L1) on tumour cells and macrophages in the tumour microenvironment and a reported increase of stem-like properties in PIM-deficient T cells which could potentially drive longer lasting anti-cancer responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clements and Warfel, 2022</xref>). However, PIM kinase inhibition has also generally been shown to be inhibitory for T cell activation, proliferation, and effector activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fox et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mikkers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackson et al., 2012</xref>) and use of PIM kinase inhibitors could have the side effect of diminishing the anti-tumour T cell response. Given the role of CD8 T cells in anti-cancer immunity, it is important to understand how these kinases control CD8 T cell function. However, there has not yet been a systematic analysis of the role of PIM kinases in conventional CD8 T cells as they activate and differentiate to form effector and memory cells. Accordingly, the current study, uses high-resolution quantitative analysis of <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficient CD8 T cell proteomes and transcriptomes to obtain a comprehensive and unbiased understanding of how PIM kinases control CD8 T cell TCR-driven activation, and IL-2 or IL-15-driven proliferation, and differentiation. The study reveals a selective role for PIM kinases as mediators of IL-2 signalling to control CD8 T cell trafficking and effector functionality. We uncover that the dominant impact of PIM kinase loss was to shape effector CD8 T cell proteomes rather than transcriptomes, reflecting PIM kinase modulation of protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PIM1 and PIM2 are strongly induced by antigen receptor engagement but are dispensable for T cell activation</title><p>T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-driven activation of naive T cells initiates their clonal expansion and differentiation into effector and memory cells. Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of naive OT1 CD8 T cell stimulated with their cognate peptide over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marchingo et al., 2020</xref>) showed that PIM1 protein was strongly induced within 3 hr of TCR engagement, which was sustained at a 24-hr time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

However, their role in IL-15 responses in conventional antigen receptor activated CD8 T cells is not known. We therefore first examined the impact of <italic>Pim1/Pim2</italic>-deficiency on IL-15-driven conventional CD8 T cell expansion. Antigen experienced WT CD8 T cells show a robust proliferative response to IL-15 such that there is an ~90-fold expansion of the CD8 T cells between days 2 and 6 of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Immune activated Pim dKO CD8 T cells also proliferated strongly in response to IL-15, but showed a moderate proliferative disadvantage resulting in an ~4-fold difference in total cell number by day 6 of the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). There was no impact of <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency on the ability of IL-15 to sustain CD8 T cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Antigen-primed CD8 T cells expand in IL-15 to generate memory phenotype CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weninger et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore examined whether <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency had any impact on the ability of IL-15 to induce memory differentiation. Accordingly, we performed parallel bulk RNAseq and high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyse the transcriptome and proteome of IL-15 expanded WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells. The RNAseq analysis quantified ~14,000 unique polyA+ RNA and using a cut off of &gt;1.5 fold-change and q-value &lt;0.05 we saw that the abundance of 381 polyA+ RNA was modified by <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A</xref>). Of the 381 RNA that were detected as differentially expressed (FC &gt;1.5, q&lt;0.05) only ~30% were detected with an average expression over 10 transcripts per million (TPM), of these gene ~36% were non-coding RNA, uncharacterised genes or pseudogenes, leaving only 72 substantially expressed protein coding mRNA that were differentially expressed in Pim dKO versus WT IL-15 expanded CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>). These data indicate that Pim1/Pim2-deficiency has very little effect on IL-15 induced protein-coding mRNA expression in differentiated T cells. We then specifically examined if Pim dKO T cells had any differences in mRNA that are known to be critical for memory cell differentiation. We found that <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency did not decrease expression of mRNA levels for critical memory T cell genes such as the adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors, <italic>Sell</italic> (CD62L), <italic>Ccr7</italic> and <italic>S1pr1</italic> that direct the trafficking of CD8 T cells to secondary lymphoid tissue.

Of note, the mitochondrial proteome composition of IL-15 expanded WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). This is pertinent because one key feature of how IL-15 controls memory T cells is via mitochondrial remodelling to support energy production via oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buck et al., 2016</xref>), and it has been described that PIM kinases can control mitochondrial phenotypes in cancer cell lines and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Din et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chauhan et al., 2020</xref>).

We therefore examined the role of PIM1 and PIM2 in the IL-2 signalling pathways that control the differentiation of effector CTL. The data show that Pim dKO antigen activated CD8 T cells responded normally to IL-2 to induce STAT5 Y694 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). They also express normal levels of the IL-2-receptor alpha chain, CD25, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which is sustained by STAT5. Antigen activated WT CD8 T cells have a strong survival and proliferative response to IL-2 producing an ~270-fold expansion between days 2 and 6 of culture in saturating IL-2 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

To examine this hypothesis, we first interrogated our proteomics and transcriptomics data. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed a small reduction in ribosome protein content in Pim dKO CTL, which scaled with the reduction in total protein content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Moreover, the translational repressor PDCD4 was increased in Pim dKO CTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This could be confirmed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>) and was underpinned at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similarly, 24 hr inhibition with pan PIM kinases inhibitors was sufficient to substantially increase PDCD4 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>). We also noted that there was a small decrease in the expression of EIF4A1, a key component of the eIF4F translation initiation complex, in Pim dKO IL-2 maintained CTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). PDCD4 inhibits translation by binding EIF4A1 in a 2:1 ratio, preventing its interaction with the EIF4F complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>). Together the changes in both proteins equated to an approximate halving of the ratio between EIF4A1 and PDCD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). These data all support that loss of PIM kinases could reduce protein synthesis in IL-2 maintained CTL. To test this hypothesis, we used a single-cell assay that quantifies the incorporation of an analogue of puromycin (OPP) into newly synthesized protein chains in the ribosome to assess cellular rates of protein synthesis. We found that 24 hr of treatment with pan-PIM kinase inhibitors PIM447 or AZD1208 caused a quantitative reduction in protein synthesis rates of IL-2 expanded CTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). This data is consistent with PIM kinase effects on protein expression being via control of protein translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PIM1 and PIM2 regulate mTORc1 and sustain lymphoid homing in Pim1/Pim2-deficient effector CTL</title><p>The pattern of proteome remodelling in Pim dKO CTL had some phenotypic features in common with the previously reported changes that occur following inhibition of the Serine/Threonine kinase mTORc1 in CTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hukelmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howden et al., 2019</xref>).

In these experiments, we compared the phosphorylation of S6K1 (p70 S6-kinase 1) on its mTORC1 substrate sequence T389 in WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells by western blot. These data show a modest reduction of mTORc1 activity in the Pim dKO T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Thus, the reduced expression of glucose transporters and reduced activity of mTORc1 in Pim dKO IL-2 expanded CTL provides a potential explanation for the striking phenotype shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, that IL-2 maintained Pim dKO CTL retain high levels of CD62L/L-selectin. The IL-2 CTL transcriptomics data showed there is increased expression of CD62L at the mRNA level in IL-2 maintained PimdKO CTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). The expression of <italic>Sell</italic> (CD62L) mRNA is controlled by the transcription factor KLF2 and the expression of <italic>Klf2</italic> mRNA is also increased in IL-2 maintained Pim dKO CTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) as are mRNA levels for other KLF2 targets: the chemokine receptors <italic>Ccr7</italic> and <italic>S1pr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>CD62L/L-selectin controls T cell adhesion to the endothelium of high endothelial venules and is essential for lymphocyte transit from blood into secondary lymphoid tissue such as lymph nodes. CCR7, and the S1P1 receptor also direct migration by controlling T cell entry and egress respectively into secondary lymphoid tissue. In this context, the loss of CD62L, CCR7 and S1PR1 expression following immune activation reprograms the trafficking of effector T cells away from lymphoid tissue toward sites of inflammation in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sinclair et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nolz et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, the differences between Pim dKO and WT CTL in terms of CD62L expression could indicate that in addition to having reduced effector protein expression, Pim dKO CTL also do not switch their trafficking behaviour to that of a fully differentiated effector CTL and rather retain the capacity to home to lymphoid tissues. To test this possibility in vivo, we performed adoptive transfer experiments comparing the ability of WT effector CTL and Pim dKO CTL to home to secondary lymphoid tissues. In these experiments, αCD3/αCD28 activated WT or Pim dKO T cells were differentiated in IL-2 and cells were then labelled with either CFSE or CTV dyes; mixed at a ratio of 1:1, and adoptively transferred into C57BL/6 hosts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> shows that Pim dKO CTL, but not WT CTL, retained substantial capacity to home to secondary lymphoid organs and, hence, accumulated in lymph nodes and spleen: PIM kinases are thus required for the normal reprogramming of CTL trafficking.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The objective of the present study was to use quantitative analysis of T cell proteomes and transcriptomes to explore how deletion of the Serine/Threonine kinases PIM1 and PIM2 impacts CD8 T cell activation and differentiation. The expression of PIM1 and PIM2 is induced during immune activation of CD8 T cells by antigen and co-stimulation and then sustained to varying degrees by the cytokines IL-2 or IL-15. The loss of PIM1 and PIM2 was shown to have no effect on the CD8 T cell programs controlled by antigen receptor/co-stimulation and had very little impact on the IL-15-driven transcriptional and proteomic programs in memory differentiated CD8 T cells. However, PIM1 and PIM2 were required for IL-2 programming of effector CD8 T cell differentiation. IL-2 controls essential cytolytic effector and metabolic programs in CTL, is a key cytokine for CD8 T cell anti-viral immunity and is also used to produce cytotoxic T cells for anti-cancer immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalia and Sarkar, 2018</xref>). The understanding that PIM kinases mediate IL-2 control of the expression of glucose transporters, lipid metabolic enzymes and key cytolytic proteins such as granzymes A and B in effector CD8 T cells is thus fundamental information about how this key cytokine controls T cells. It was also important to understand that PIM kinases did not control the transcriptional programs that direct expression of glucose transporters and effector enzymes and hence the full consequences of PIM kinase deletion could only be assessed by in depth analysis of the proteomes of <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficient CTL and not from mRNA sequencing. The loss of PIM kinase activity reduced protein synthesis rates in CTL which explains the discordance between mRNA and protein reported herein. The reduction in protein synthesis was modest but previous studies have shown that modest reductions in protein synthesis and loss of mTORc1 activity impact CD8 T cell differentiation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cornish et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hukelmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howden et al., 2019</xref>). PIM kinase regulation of protein translation has been reported previously in mouse B cell lymphoma and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schatz et al., 2011</xref>) and some of the key examples of proteins we found to be unaltered at the mRNA level but down-regulated at the protein level have prior reports of sensitivity to translational regulation in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fehniger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ricciardi et al., 2018</xref>). Reduced protein synthesis capacity in cells lacking PIM kinases could be caused by reduced mTORc1 activity combined with increased expression at the mRNA and protein level of the translational repressor PDCD4. Moreover, protein synthesis is highly energetically demanding and once CTL have reduced glucose transporter expression this would reduce glucose availability to fuel protein production. These data collectively point towards modulation of protein translation as an important target of PIM kinase activity downstream of IL-2 in CD8 T cells.</p><p>One other important insight from the current work is that PIM kinases are required for IL-2 to fully repress expression of the adhesion molecule CD62L and the chemokine receptors CCR7 and S1PR1. These molecules play a key role in controlling T cell homing to secondary lymphoid tissue and are expressed at high levels in naive and memory T cells. IL-2 induces down regulation of CD62L, CCR7, and S1PR1 expression as part of a program that causes effector cells to lose their capacity to home to secondary lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sinclair et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nolz et al., 2011</xref>). The present data show that PIM kinases can mediate this IL-2 repression of lymph node homing receptors and the ability of IL-2 to switch off the naive T cell trafficking program. IL-2 maintained Pim dKO CD8 effector T cells thus retain the capacity to home to secondary lymphoid tissues in vivo. This lymph-node homing pattern is also a memory CD8 T cell phenotype but here it is pertinent that the current in-depth analysis of the transcriptomes and proteomes of <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficient IL-2 differentiated CD8 T cells show that the loss of PIM kinases does not cause effector T cells to differentiate instead into memory cells. For example, IL-2 maintained Pim dKO CD8 T cells do not re-express key molecules that maintain the stem-like properties of memory cells such as the transcription factor TCF7 and IL-7 receptor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Nor do Pim dKO CTL cultured in IL-2 have the mitochondrial proteome of a memory T cell and PCA plots of IL-15 and IL-2 proteomics and RNAseq data show that Pim dKO IL-2 expanded CTL are still much more similar to IL-2 expanded WT CTL than to IL-15 expanded CTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency prevents optimal differentiation of effector CTL but does not cause these cells to fully switch to a memory phenotype. This is worth knowing as pan-PIM kinase inhibitors are in development as anti-cancer drugs and it has been suggested that PIM inhibitors might be used as a strategy to generate more stem-memory-like CD8 T cells in combination with cancer immunotherapy treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clements and Warfel, 2022</xref>). Information about how the loss of PIM kinases will impact CD8 T cells is very relevant to informed usage of such drugs.</p><p>Finally, the selectivity of PIM kinases for IL-2 control of conventional CD8 T cell differentiation with no evidence that PIMs were important for IL-15 responses beyond a modest effect on cell proliferation was interesting. This failure to see a role for PIM signalling in conventional peripheral CD8 T cell differentiation is in contrast to observations that PIM1 and PIM2 direct IL-15 control of the metabolic programming of intestinal IEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James et al., 2021</xref>). A notable difference between these scenarios was that in IEL, IL-15 was being used individually to drive immune activation and was sufficient to strongly induce PIM1 and PIM2 expression. In contrast, in our conventional CD8 T cell system we uncovered that IL-15 does not sustain high levels of PIM kinases, which could possibly explain this discrepancy. However, high levels of PIM expression alone are not inevitably predictive of their importance. In this study, we observed very high levels of both PIM1 and PIM2 in antigen activated CD8 T cells yet loss of PIM kinases there had no functional impact. Previously, it was suggested that mTORc1 could compensate for PIM kinase deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). However, we found no evidence for this, and in fact observed that PIM kinases were required to maximally stimulate mTORc1 activity in IL-2 expanded CTL. Thus, this examination of the role of PIM kinases in multiple signalling situations reveal cell context-dependent regulatory roles for PIM kinases rather than hard wired functions that apply to every stimulatory situation in T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Pim1KO/Pim2KO</italic><break/>(<italic>Pim1/2</italic> dKO)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8233823/">8233823</ext-link>, PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15199164/">15199164</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Pim1</italic> and <italic>Pim2</italic> KO strains generated on the FVB/N background in references listed and backcrossed to C57BL/6 background in this paper</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6 J (WT)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River UK</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TCR α-; P14 TCRVα2Vβ8<break/>(P14)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2573841/">2573841</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">maintained in house as an P14 TCR transgene heterozygote</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6-Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb<break/>(OT1)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8287475/">8287475</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">maintained in house as an OT1 TCR transgene heterozygote on a CD45.1 (Ly5.1) background</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6 J Ly5.1 (Ly5.1)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River UK</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-CD3 (armenian hamster, monoclonal, 145–2C11)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #

After trap enrichment, peptides were eluted onto an EASY-Spray PepMap RSLC nanoViper, C18, 2 µm, 100 Å column (75 µm, 50 cm; Thermo Scientific) using the buffer gradient: 2% B (0–6 min), 2% to 35% B (6–130 min), 35% to 98% B (130–132 min), 98% B (132–152 min), 98% to 2% B (152–153 min), and equilibrated in 2% B (153–170 min) at a flow rate of 0.3 µl/min. The eluting peptide solution was automatically electrosprayed using an EASY-Spray nanoelectrospray ion source at 50° and a source voltage of 1.9 kV (Thermo Scientific) into the Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro; Thermo Scientific). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode. Full-scan MS survey spectra (mass/charge ratio, 335–1800) in profile mode were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000. Data were collected using data-dependent acquisition: the 15 most intense peptide ions from the preview scan in the Orbitrap were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (normalized collision energy, 35%; activation Q, 0.250; activation time, 10ms) in the LTQ after the accumulation of 5000 ions. Precursor ion charge state screening was enabled, and all unassigned charge states as well as singly charged species were rejected. The lock mass option was enabled for survey scans to improve mass accuracy. (Using Lock Mass of 445.120024)”.</p><p>~0.2 µg of peptide was analysed per sample by single shot DDA Mass Spectrometry for 24 hr pan-PIM kinase inhibitor treated, day 6 IL-2 expanded CD8 T cell samples.</p><p>Samples were injected onto a nanoscale C18 reverse-phase chromatography system (UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano, Thermo Fisher Scientific) then electrosprayed into a Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A 2–35% B gradient comprising of eluent A (0.1% formic acid) and eluent B (80% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) was used to run a 120 minute gradient per sample. With the mass spectrometer in positive mode the top 20 most intense peaks from a mass range of 335–1800 m/z in each MS1 scan with a resolution of 60,000 were then taken for MS2 analysis at a resolution of 15,000. Spectra were fragmented using Higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD).</p><p>2 µg of peptide was analysed per sample by Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) Mass Spectrometry for the IL-2 and IL-15 expanded CD8 T cell proteomics samples. For label-free DIA proteomics of Day 6 IL-2 and IL-15 expanded WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells peptide samples were analysed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sollberger et al., 2023</xref> with some minor differences. Peptides were injected onto a nanoscale C18 reverse-phase chromatography system (UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano, Thermo Scientific) then electrosprayed into an Orbitrap Exploris 480 Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). For liquid chromatography buffers were as follows: buffer A (0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)). Sample were loaded at 10 μL/min onto a trap column (100 μm×2 cm, PepMap nanoViper C18 column, 5 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The trap column was washed for 3 min at the same flow rate with 0.1% TFA then switched in-line with a Thermo Scientific, resolving C18 column (75 μm×50 cm, PepMap RSLC C18 column, 2 μm, 100 Å). The peptides were eluted from the column at a constant flow rate of 300 nL/min with a linear gradient from 3% buffer B to 6% buffer B in 5 min, then from 6% buffer B to 35% buffer B in 115 min, and finally to 80% buffer B within 7 min. The column was then washed with 80% buffer B for 4 min and re-equilibrated in 3% buffer B for 15 min. Two blanks were run between each sample to reduce carry-over. The column was kept at a constant temperature of 40 °C.</p><p>The data was acquired using an easy spray source operated in positive mode with spray voltage at 2.1 kV and the ion transfer tube temperature at 275 °C. The MS was operated in DIA mode. A scan cycle comprised a full MS scan m/z range from 350 to 1650, with RF lens at 40%, AGC target set to custom, normalised AGC target at 300%, maximum injection time mode set to custom, a maximum ion injection time of 20ms, microscan set to 1 and source fragmentation disabled. MS survey scan was followed by MS/MS DIA scan events using the following parameters: multiplex ions set to false, collision energy mode set to stepped, collision energy type set to normalized, HCD collision energies set to 25.5, 27, and 30%, orbitrap resolution 30000, first mass 200, RF lens 40%, AGC target set to custom, normalized AGC target 3000%, microscan set to 1 and maximum injection time 55ms. Data for both MS scan and MS/MS DIA scan events were acquired in profile mode.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Proteomics data analysis</title><p>The 24 hr TCR WT and Pim dKO CD4 and CD8 T cell DDA proteomics data and 24 hr pan-PIM kinase inhibitor treated Day 6 IL-2 expanded CD8 T cell DDA proteomics data were processed, searched, and quantified with the MaxQuant software package, version 1.6.10.43. For the protein and peptide searches, we generated a hybrid database consisting of all manually annotated mouse SwissProt entries, combined with mouse TrEMBL entries with protein level evidence available and a manually annotated homologue within the human SwissProt database as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marchingo et al., 2020</xref>. For the 24 hr TCR activated data, this was from the Uniprot release 2020_06, for the 24 hr PIM kinase inhibitor data this was from the Uniprot release 2019_08. Search parameters were as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marchingo et al., 2020</xref>: “The following MaxQuant search parameters were used: protein N-terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation, glutamine to pyroglutamate, and glutamine and asparagine deamidation were set as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was selected as a fixed modification; Trypsin and LysC were selected as the enzymes with up to two missed cleavages permitted; the protein and PSM false discovery rate was set to 1%; matching of peptides between runs was switched off”.</p><p>Data filtering and protein copy number quantification was performed in the Perseus software package, version 1.6.6.0.

At this point biological replicate 3 from Pim dKO CD4 T cells was excluded from further analysis due to poor sample quality (e.g. protein sequence coverage was an average of 13.9% compared to an average of 18.2–24.6% for all other samples and estimated total protein content per cell was ~1/3rd of that observed in the other two biological replicates for that condition, despite no obvious difference in FSC measured when FACS sorting).</p><p>The day 6 IL-2 and IL-15 expanded WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cell DIA proteomics data files were searched using Spectronaut version 14.7. Data was analysed using a library-free approach. Raw proteomics data files were searched using the Pulsar tool within Spectronaut using the following settings: 0.01 FDR at the protein and peptide level with digest rule set to ‘Trypsin’P’. A maximum of two missed cleavages and minimum peptide length of 7 amino acids was selected. Carbamidomethyl of cysteine was selected as a fixed modification while protein n-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were selected as variable modifications. Manufacturer default settings were used for identification, with protein and precursor q-value set to 0.01 using default decoy strategy. For quantification settings, the MS-Level quantity was set to ‘MS2’, major group Top N and minor group Top N were set as ‘False’ and profiling was set as ‘False’.

These two serine/threonine kinases belong to a large network of Serine/Threonine kinases that acts following engagement of the TCR and of cytokine receptors and phosphorylates proteins that control transcriptional, translational and metabolic programs that result in effector and memory T cell differentiation. The expression of PIM1 and PIM2 is induced by the T-cell receptor and several cytokine receptors. The present study capitalized on high-resolution quantitative analysis of the proteomes and transcriptomes of Pim1/Pim2-deficient CD8 T cells to decipher how the PIM1/2 kinases control TCR-driven activation and IL-2/IL-15-driven proliferation, and differentiation into effector T cells.</p><p>Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of naive OT1 CD8 T cell stimulated with their cognate peptide showed that the PIM1 protein was induced within 3 hours of TCR engagement and its expression was sustained at least up to 24 hours. The kinetics of PIM2 expression was protracted as compared to that of PIM1. Such TCR-dependent expression of PIM1/2 correlated with the analysis of both Pim1 and Pim2 mRNA. In contrast, Pim3 mRNA was only expressed at very low levels and the PIM3 protein not detected by mass spectrometry. Therefore, PIM1 and 2 are the major PIM kinases in recently activated T cells. Pim1/Pim2 double knockout (Pim dKO) mice were generated on a B6 background and found to express lower number of splenocytes. No difference in TCR/CD28-driven proliferation was observed between WT and Pim dKO T cells over 3 days in culture. Quantitative proteomics of &gt;7000 proteins further revealed no substantial quantitative or qualitative differences in protein content or proteome composition. Therefore, other signaling pathways can compensate for the lack of PIM kinases downstream of TCR activation.</p><p>Considering that PIM1 and PIM2 kinase expression is regulated by IL-2 and IL-15, antigen-primed CD8 T cells were expanded in IL-15 to generate memory phenotype CD8 T cells or expanded in IL-2 to generate effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Analysis of the survival, proliferation, proteome, and transcriptome of Pim dKO CD8 T cells kept for 6 days in IL-15 showed that PIM1 and PIM2 are dispensable to drive the IL-15-mediated metabolic or differentiation programs of antigen-primed CD8 T cells. Moreover, Pim1/Pim2-deficiency had no impact on the ability of IL-2 to maintain CD8 T cell viability and proliferation. However, WT CTL downregulated expression of CD62L whereas the Pim dKO CTL sustained higher CD62L expression. Pim dKO CTL were also smaller and less granular than WT CTL. Comparison of the proteome of day 6 IL-2 cultured WT and Pim dKO CTL showed that the latter expressed lower levels of the glucose transporters, SLC2A1 and SLC2A3, of a number of proteins involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, and CTL effector proteins such as granzymes, perforin, IFNg and TNFa. Parallel transcriptomics analysis showed that the reduced expression of perforin and some granzymes correlated with a decrease in their mRNA whereas the decreased protein levels of granzymes B and A, and of the glucose transporters SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 did not correspond with decreased mRNA expression. Therefore, PIM kinases are likely required for IL-2 to maximally control protein synthesis in CD8 CTL. Along that line, the translational repressor PDCD4 was increased in Pim dKO CTL and pan-PIM kinase inhibitors caused a reduction in protein synthesis rates in IL-2 expanded CTL. Finally, the differences between Pim dKO and WT CTL in terms of CD62L expression resulted in that Pim dKO CTL but not WT CTL retained the capacity to home to secondary lymphoid organs. In conclusion, this thorough and solid study showed that the PIM1/2 kinases shape the effector CD8 T cell proteomes rather than transcriptomes and are important mediators of IL2-signalling and CD8 T cell trafficking.</p><p>Weaknesses: None</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have been able to provide in their rebuttal letter fair answers to most of the queries primarily raised by Reviewer 2 and they have incorporated the corresponding results in the revised text.

The authors key finding is that PIM1/2 enhance protein synthesis in response to IL-2 stimulation, but not IL-15, in CD8+ T cells. Loss of PIM1/2 made T cells less 'effector-like', with lower granzyme and cytokine production, and a surface profile that maintained homing towards secondary lymphoid tissue. The cytokines the authors focus on are IL-15 and Il-2, which drive naïve CD8 T cells towards memory or effector states, respectively. Although PIM1/2 are upregulated in response to T-cell activation and cytokine stimulation (e.g., IL-15, and to a greater extent, IL-2), using T cells isolated from a global mouse genetic knockout background of PIM1/2, the authors find that PIM1/2 did not significantly influence T-cell activation, proliferation, or expression of anything in the proteome under anti-CD3/CD28 driven activation with/without cytokine (i.e., IL-15) stimulation ex vivo. This is perhaps somewhat surprising given PIM1/2 are upregulated, albeit to a small degree, in response to IL-15, and yet PIM1/2 did not seem to influence CD8+ T cell differentiation towards a memory state. Even more surprising is that IL-15 was previously shown to influence the metabolic programming of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, suggesting cell-type specific effects from PIM kinases. What the authors went on to show, however, is that PIM1/2 KO altered CD8 T cell proteomes in response to IL-2. Using proteomics, they saw increased expression of homing receptors (i.e., L-selectin, CCR7), but reduced expression of metabolism-related proteins (e.g., GLUT1/3 &amp; cholesterol biosynthesis) and effector-function related proteins (e.g., IFNy and granzymes).

These two serine/threonine kinases belong to a large network of Serine/Threonine kinases that acts following engagement of the TCR and of cytokine receptors and phosphorylates proteins that control transcriptional, translational and metabolic programs that result in effector and memory T cell differentiation. The expression of PIM1 and PIM2 is induced by the T-cell receptor and several cytokine receptors. The present study capitalized on high-resolution quantitative analysis of the proteomes and transcriptomes of Pim1/Pim2-deficient CD8 T cells to decipher how the PIM1/2 kinases control TCRdriven activation and IL-2/IL-15-driven proliferation, and differentiation into effector T cells.</p><p>Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of naïve OT1 CD8 T cell stimulated with their cognate peptide showed that the PIM1 protein was induced within 3 hours of TCR engagement, and its expression was sustained at least up to 24 hours. The kinetics of PIM2 expression was protracted as compared to that of PIM1. Such TCRdependent expression of PIM1/2 correlated with the analysis of both Pim1 and Pim2 mRNA. In contrast, Pim3 mRNA was only expressed at very low levels and the PIM3 protein was not detected by mass spectrometry. Therefore, PIM1 and 2 are the major PIM kinases in recently activated T cells. Pim1/Pim2 double knockout (Pim dKO) mice were generated on a B6 background and found to express a lower number of splenocytes. No difference in TCR/CD28-driven proliferation was observed between WT and Pim dKO T cells over 3 days in culture. Quantitative proteomics of &gt;7000 proteins further revealed no substantial quantitative or qualitative differences in protein content or proteome composition. Therefore, other signaling pathways can compensate for the lack of PIM kinases downstream of TCR activation.</p><p>Considering that PIM1 and PIM2 kinase expression is regulated by IL-2 and IL-15, antigen-primed CD8 T cells were expanded in IL-15 to generate memory phenotype CD8 T cells or expanded in IL-2 to generate effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Analysis of the survival, proliferation, proteome, and transcriptome of Pim dKO CD8 T cells kept for 6 days in IL-15 showed that PIM1 and PIM2 are dispensable to drive the IL-15mediated metabolic or differentiation programs of antigen-primed CD8 T cells. Moreover, Pim1/Pim2-deficiency had no impact on the ability of IL-2 to maintain CD8 T cell viability and proliferation. However, WT CTL downregulated the expression of CD62L whereas the Pim dKO CTL sustained higher CD62L expression. Pim dKO CTL was also smaller and less granular than WT CTL. Comparison of the proteome of day 6 IL-2 cultured WT and Pim dKO CTL showed that the latter expressed lower levels of the glucose transporters, SLC2A1 and SLC2A3, of a number of proteins involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, and CTL effector proteins such as granzymes, perforin, IFNg, and TNFa. Parallel transcriptomics analysis showed that the reduced expression of perforin and some granzymes correlated with a decrease in their mRNA whereas the decreased protein levels of granzymes B and A, and the glucose transporters SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 did not correspond with decreased mRNA expression. Therefore, PIM kinases are likely required for IL-2 to maximally control protein synthesis in CD8 CTL. Along that line, the translational repressor PDCD4 was increased in Pim dKO CTL and pan-PIM kinase inhibitors caused a reduction in protein synthesis rates in IL-2expanded CTL. Finally, the differences between Pim dKO and WT CTL in terms of CD62L expression resulted in Pim dKO CTL but not WT CTL retained the capacity to home to secondary lymphoid organs. In conclusion, this thorough and solid study showed that the PIM1/2 kinases shape the effector CD8 T cell proteomes rather than transcriptomes and are important mediators of IL2-signalling and CD8 T cell trafficking.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>None identified by this reviewer.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Using a suite of techniques (e.g., RNA seq, proteomics, and functional experiments ex vivo) this paper extensively focuses on the role of PIM1/2 kinases during CD8 T-cell activation and cytokine-driven (i.e., IL-2 or IL-15) differentiation. The authors' key finding is that PIM1/2 enhances protein synthesis in response to IL-2 stimulation, but not IL-15, in CD8+ T cells. Loss of PIM1/2 made T cells less 'effector-like', with lower granzyme and cytokine production, and a surface profile that maintained homing towards secondary lymphoid tissue. The cytokines the authors focus on are IL-15 and Il-2, which drive naïve CD8 T cells towards memory or effector states, respectively. Although PIM1/2 are upregulated in response to T-cell activation and cytokine stimulation (e.g., IL-15, and to a greater extent, IL-2), using T cells isolated from a global mouse genetic knockout background of PIM1/2, the authors find that PIM1/2 did not significantly influence T-cell activation, proliferation, or expression of anything in the proteome under anti-</p><p>CD3/CD28 driven activation with/without cytokine (i.e., IL-15) stimulation ex vivo. This is perhaps somewhat surprising given PIM1/2 is upregulated, albeit to a small degree, in response to IL-15, and yet PIM1/2 did not seem to influence CD8+ T cell differentiation towards a memory state. Even more surprising is that IL-15 was previously shown to influence the metabolic programming of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, suggesting cell-type specific effects from PIM kinases. What the authors went on to show, however, is that PIM1/2 KO altered CD8 T cell proteomes in response to IL-2. Using proteomics, they saw increased expression of homing receptors (i.e., L-selectin, CCR7), but reduced expression of metabolism-related proteins (e.g., GLUT1/3 &amp; cholesterol biosynthesis) and effector-function related proteins (e.g., IFNy and granzymes).

We think an ideal experiment would be to use naïve cord blood derived CD4 and CD8 cells as a model to avoid the impact of variability in adult PBMC and to really look at what PIM kinases do as T cells first respond to antigen and cytokines. In this context there is good evidence that the signalling pathways used by antigen receptors or the cytokines IL-2 and IL-15 are not substantially different in mouse and human. We have also previously compared proteomes of mouse and human IL-2 expanded cytotoxic T cells and they are remarkably similar. As such we feel that mature mouse CD8 T cells are a genetically tractable model to use to probe the signalling pathways that control cytotoxic T cell function. To repeat the full set of experiments observed within this study with human T cells would represent 1-year of work by an experienced postdoctoral fellow.</p><p>Unfortunately, the funding for the project has come to an end and there is no capacity to complete this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would also be good for the authors to include a few experiments where PIM1/2 have been transduced back into the PIM1/2 KO T cells, to see if this reverts any differences observed in response to IL-2 - although the reviewer notes that the timeline for altering primary T cells via lentivirus/CRISPR may be on the cusp of being practical such that functional experiments can be performed on day 6 after first stimulating T cells.</p></disp-quote><p>A rescue experiment could indeed be informative, though of course comes with challenges/caveats with re-expressing both proteins that have been deleted at once and ability to control the level of PIM kinase that is re-expressed. This work using the Pim dKO mice was performed from 2019-2021 and was seriously impacted by the work restrictions during the COVID19 pandemic. We had to curtail all mouse colonies to allow animal staff to work within the legal guidelines. We had to make choices and the Pim1/2 dKO colony was stopped because we felt we had generated very useful data from the work but could not justify continued maintenance of the colony at such a difficult time. As such we no longer have this mouse line to perform these rescue experiments.</p><p>We have however, performed a limited number of retroviral overexpression studies in WT IL-2-expanded CTL, where T cells were transfected after 24 hours activation and phenotype measured on day 6 of culture. We chose to leave these out of the initial manuscript as these were overexpression under conditions where PIM expression was already high, rather than a true test of the ability of PIM1 or PIM2 to rescue the Pim dKO phenotype. A more robust test would also have required doing these overexpression experiments in IL-15 expanded or cytokine deprived CTL where PIM kinase expression is low, however, we ran out of time and funding to complete this work.</p><p>We have provided Author response image 1 below from the experiments performed in the IL-2 CTL for interested readers. The limited experiments that were performed do support some key phenotypes observed with the Pim dKO mice or PIM inhibitors, finding that PIM1 or PIM2 overexpression was sufficient to increase S6 phosphorylation, and provided a small further increase in GzmB expression above the already very high levels in IL-2 expanded CTL.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>PIM1 or PIM2 overexpression drives increased GzmB expression and S6 phosphorylation in WT IL-2 CTL.</title><p>OT1 lymph node cell suspensions were activated for 24 hours with SIINFEKL peptide (10 ng/mL), IL-2 (20 ng/mL) and IL-12 (2 ng/mL) then transfected with retroviruses to drive expression of PIM1-GFP, PIM2-GFP fusion proteins or a GFP only control.

To note the Pim1/2 dKO mice are smaller than normal wild type mice (discussed further below) and clearly have complex phenotypes. An ideal experiment would be to make mice with floxed Pim1 and Pim2 alleles so that one could use cre recombinase to make a T cell-specific deletion and then study the impact of this in in vivo models. We did not have the budget or ethical approval to make these mice. Moreover, this study was carried out during the COVID pandemic when all animal experiments in the UK were severely restricted. So our objective was to get a molecular understanding of the consequences of losing theses kinases for CD8 T cells focusing on using controlled in vitro systems. We felt that this would generate important data that would guide any subsequent experiments by other groups interested in these enzymes.</p><p>We do accept the comment about bulk population proteomics. Unfortunately, single cell proteomics is still not an option at this point in time. High resolution multidimensional flow cytometry is a valuable technique but is limited to looking at only a few proteins for which good antibodies exist compared to the data one gets with high resolution proteomics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alongside this, performing a PCA of bulk RNA seq/proteomes or Untreated vs. IL-2 vs. IL-15 of WT and PIM1/2 knockout T cells would help cement their argument in the discussion about PIM1/2 knockout cells being distinct from a memory phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this very good suggestion.

Are the thymus and lymph nodes showing the same trend?</p></disp-quote><p>We’re happy to clarify on this.</p><p>Since we were focused on T cell phenotypes in the paper this is what we have plotted in this figure, however there is also a reduction in total number of B, NK and NKT cells in the Pim dKO mice (see James et al, Nat Commun, 2021 for additional subset percentages). We find that all immune subsets we have measured make up the same % of the spleen in Pim dKO vs WT mice (we show this for T cell subsets in what was formerly Fig S1C and is now Fig S1A), the total splenocyte count is just lower in the Pim dKO mice (which we show in what was formerly Fig S1B and is now Fig S1C). To note, the Pim dKO mice were smaller than their WT counterparts (though we have not formally weighed and quantified this) and we think this is likely the major factor leading to lower total splenocyte numbers.</p><p>We have not checked the thymus so can’t comment on this. We can confirm that lymph nodes from Pim dKO mice had the same number and % CD4 and CD8 T cells as in WT.</p><p>For our in vitro studies we have made sure to either use co-cultures or for single WT and Pim dKO cultures to equalise starting cell densities between wells to account for the difference in total splenocyte number.

Why then would you use an inhibitor in cancer settings? This needs better clarification for readers, with reference to T cells, particularly given this is an important justification for looking at PIM kinases in T cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the lack of clarity in our explanation here.</p><p>PIM kinase inhibitors alone are proposed as anti-tumour therapies for select cancers to block tumour growth. However so far these monotherapies haven’t been very effective in clinical trials and combination treatment options with a number of strategies are being explored. There are two lines of logic for why PIM kinase inhibitors might be a good combination with an e.g. anti-PD1 or adoptive T cell immunotherapy. (1) PIM kinase inhibition has been shown to reduce inhibitory/suppressive surface proteins (e.g. PDL1) and cytokine (e.g. TGFbeta) expression in tumour cells and macrophages in the tumour microenvironment. (2) Inhibiting glycolysis and increasing memory/stem-like phenotype has been identified as desirable for longer-lasting more potent anti-tumour T cell immunity. PIM kinase inhibition has been shown to reduce glycolytic function and increase several ‘stemness’ promoting transcription factors e.g. TCF7 in a previous study. Controlled murine cancer models have shown improvement in clearance with the combination of pan-Pim kinase inhibitors and anti-PD1/PDL1 treatments (Xin et al, Cancer Immunol Res, 2021 and Chatterjee et al, Clin Cancer Res 2019).</p><p>It is worth noting, this is seemingly contradictory with other studies of Pim kinases in T cells that have generally found Pim1/2/3 deletion or inhibition in T cells to be suppressive of their function.</p><p>We have clarified this reasoning/seeming conflict of results in the introductory text as follows (lines 90-101):</p><p>“PIM kinase inhibitors have also entered clinical trials to treat some cancers (e.g. multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukaemia, prostate cancer), and although they have not been effective as a monotherapy, there is interest in combining these with immunotherapies. This is due to studies showing PIM inhibition reducing expression of inhibitory molecules (e.g. PD-L1) on tumour cells and macrophages in the tumour microenvironment and a reported increase of stem-like properties in PIM-deficient T cells which could potentially drive longer lasting anti-cancer responses (Chatterjee et al., 2019; Xin et al., 2021; Clements and Warfel, 2022). However, PIM kinase inhibition has also generally been shown to be inhibitory for T cell activation, proliferation and effector activities (Fox et al., 2003; Mikkers et al., 2004; Jackson et al., 2021) and use of PIM kinase inhibitors could have the side effect of diminishing the anti-tumour T cell response.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 93 - The use of 'some cancers' is rather vague and unscientific - please correct phrasing like this.

The authors put a good amount of effort in to showing that mouse T cells do not exhibit differences from knocking out pim1/2 i.e., Efforts have been made to address this using activation markers and cell size, cytokines, and proliferation and proteomics of activated T cells. What do the resting T cells look like though? Although TCR signalling is not impacted, other pathways might be. Resting-state comparison may identify this.</p></disp-quote><p>In all experiments <italic>Pim3</italic> mRNA was only detected at very low levels and no PIM3 protein was detected by mass spectrometry in either wild type or PIM1/2 double KO TCR activated or cytokine expanded CD8 T cells (See Tables S1, S3, S4). There was similarly no change in Pim3 mRNA expression in RNAseq of IL-2 or IL-15 expanded CD8 T cells (See Tables S2, S6). While we have not confirmed this in resting state cells for all the conditions examined, there is no evidence that PIM3 compensates for PIM1/2 deficiency or that PIM3 is substantially expressed in T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1A&amp;B - Does PIM kinase stay elevated when removing TCR stimulus? During egress from lymph node and trafficking to infection/tumour/autoimmune site, T cells experience a period of 'rest' from T-cell activation so is PIM upregulation stabilized, or does it just coincide with activation? This could be a crucial control given the rest of the study focuses on day 6 after initial activation (which includes 4 days of 'rest' from TCR stimulation). Nice resolution on early time course though.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. Unfortunately, we do not know how sensitive PIM kinases are to TCR stimulus withdrawal, as we have not tried removing the TCR stimulus during early activation and measuring PIM expression.</p><p>Based on the data in Fig 2A there is a hint that 4 hours withdrawal of peptide stimulus may be enough to lose PIM1/2 expression (after ~36 hrs of TCR activation), however, we did not include a control condition where peptide is retained within the culture. Therefore, we cannot resolve this question from the current experimental data, as this difference could also be due to a further increase in PIMs in the cytokine treated conditions rather than a reduction in expression in the no cytokine condition. This ~36-hour time point is also at a stage where T cells have become more dependent on cytokines for their sustained signalling compared to TCR stimulus.</p><p>It is worth noting that PIM kinases are thought to have fairly short mRNA and protein half lives (~5-20 min for PIM1 in primary cells, ~10 min – 1 hr for PIM2). This is consistent with previous observations that cytotoxic T cells need sustained IL-2/Jak signalling to sustain PIM kinase expression, e.g. in Rollings et al (2018) Sci Signaling, DOI:10.1126/scisignal.aap8112 . We would therefore expect that sustained signalling from some external signalling receptor whether this is TCR, costimulatory receptors or cytokines is required to drive Pim1/2 mRNA and protein expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1D - the CD4 WT and Pim dKO plots are identical - presumably a copying error - please correct.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the copying error and have amended the manuscript to show the correct data.

This is likely the main reason for total splenocytes being lower in the Pim dKO mice - every organ is smaller. It is not a phenotype reported in Pim1/2 dKO mice on an FVB background, though has been reported in the Pim1/2/3 triple KO mouse before (see Mikkers et al, Mol Cell Biol 2004 doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.13.6104-6115.2004).</p><p>The % cell type composition of the spleen is equivalent between WT and Pim dKO mice and as mentioned above, was controlled for when setting up of our in vitro cultures.</p><p>We have revised the main text and changed the order of the panels in Fig S1 to make this caveat clearer as follows (lines 138-144):</p><p>“There were normal proportions of peripheral T cells in spleens of Pim dKO mice (Fig S1A) similar to what has been reported previously in Pim dKO mice on an FVB/N genetic background (Mikkers et al., 2004), though the total number of T cells and splenocytes was lower than in age/sex matched wild-type (WT) mouse spleens (Fig S1B-C). This was not attributable to any one cell type (Fig S1A; James et al., 2021) but was instead likely the result of these mice being smaller in size, a phenotype that has previously been reported in Pim1/2/3 triple KO mice (Mikkers et al., 2004).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S1C - why are only 10-15% of the cells alive? Please refer to this experiment in the main text if you are going to include it in the supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>With regards what was previously Fig S1C (now Fig S1A) we apologise for our confusing labelling. We were quoting these numbers as the percentage of live splenocytes (i.e. % of live cells). Typically ~80-90% of the total splenocytes were alive by the time we had processed, stained and analysed them by flow cytometry direct ex vivo. Of these CD4 and CD8 T cells made up ~%10-15 of the total live splenocytes (with most of the rest of the live cells being B cells).</p><p>We have modified the axis to say “% of splenocytes” to make it clearer that this is what we are plotting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S1 - Would be good to show that the T cells are truly deficient in PIM1/2 in your mice to be absolutely sure. You could just make a supplementary plot from your mass spec data.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion and we have now included this data as supplementary figure 2.</p><p>To note, due to the Pim1 knockout mouse design this is not as simple as showing presence or absence of total PIM1 protein detection in this instance.</p><p>To elaborate: the Pim1/Pim2 whole body KO mice used in this study were originally made by Prof Anton Berns’ lab (Pim1 KO = Laird et al Nucleic Acids Res, 1993, doi: 10.1093/nar/21.20.4750, with more detail on deletion construct in te Riele, H. et al, Nature,1990, DOI: 10.1038/348649a0; Pim2 KO = Mikkers et al, Mol Cell Biol, 2004, DOI: 10.1128/MCB.24.13.6104-6115.2004). They were given to Prof Victor Tybulewicz on an FVB/N background. He then backcrossed them onto the C57BL/6 background for &gt; 10 generations then gave them to us to intercross into Pim1/2 dKO mice on a C57BL/6 background.</p><p>The strategy for Pim1 deletion was as follows:</p><p>A neomycin cassette was recombined into the Pim1 gene in exon 4 deleting 296 Pim1 nucleotides. More specifically, the 98th pim-1 codon (counted from the ATG start site = the translational starting point for the 34 kDa isoform of PIM1) was fused in frame by two extra codons (Ser, Leu) to the 5th neo codon (pKM109-90 was used). The 3'-end of neo included a polyadenylation signal. The cassette also contains the PyF101 enhancer (from piiMo +PyF101) to ensure expression of neo on homologous recombination in ES cells.</p><p>Collectively this means that the PIM1 polypeptide is made prior to amino acid 98 of the 34 kDa isoform but not after this point. This deletes functional kinase activity in both the 34 kDa and 44 kDa PIM1 isoforms. Ablation of PIM1 kinase function using this KO was verified via kinase activity assay in Laird et al. Nucelic Acids Res 1993.</p><p>The strategy to delete Pim2 was as follows:</p><p>“For the <italic>Pim2</italic> targeting construct, genomic BamHI fragments encompassing <italic>Pim2</italic> exons 1, 2, and 3 were replaced with the hygromycin resistance gene (<italic>Pgp</italic>) controlled by the human <italic>PGK</italic> promoter.” (Mikkers et al Mol Cell Biol, 2004)</p><p>The DDA mass spectrometry data collected in Fig 1 G-H and supplementary table 1 confirmed we do not detect peptides from after amino acid residue 98 in PIM1 (though we do detect peptides prior to this deletion point) and we do not detect peptides from the PIM2 protein in the Pim dKO mice. Thus confirming that no catalytically active PIM1/PIM2 proteins were made in these mice.</p><p>We have added a supplementary figure S2 showing this and the following text (Lines 155-156):</p><p>“Proteomics analysis confirmed that no catalytically active PIM1 and PIM2 protein were made in Pim dKO mice (Fig S2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2A - I found the multiple arrows a little confusing - would just use arrows to indicate predicted MW of protein and stars to indicate non-specific. Why are there 3 bands/arrows for PIM2?</p></disp-quote><p>The arrows have now been removed. We now mention the PIM1 and PIM2 isoform sizes in the figure legend and have left the ladder markings on the blots to give an indication of protein sizes. There are 2 isoforms for PIM1 (34 and 44 kDa) in addition to the nonspecific band and 3 isoforms of PIM2 (40, 37, 34 kDa, though two of these isoform bands are fairly faint in this instance). These are all created via ribosome use of different translational start sites from a single Pim1 or Pim2 mRNA transcript.</p><p>The following text has been added to the legend of Fig 2A:</p><p>“Western blots of PIM1 (two isoforms of 44 and 34 kDa, non-specific band indicated by *), PIM2 (three isoforms of 40, 37 and 34 kDa) or pSTAT5 Y694 expression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2A - why are the bands so faint for PIM1/2 (almost non-existent for PIM2 under no cytokine stim) here yet the protein expression seems abundant in Figure 1B upon stim without cytokines? Is this a sensitivity issue with WB vs proteomics? My apologies if I have missed something in the methods but please explain this discrepancy if not.</p></disp-quote><p>There is differing sensitivity of western blotting versus proteomics, but this is not the reason for the discrepancy between the data in Fig 1B versus 2A. These differences reflect that Fig 1B and Fig 2A contrast PIM levels in two different sets of conditions and that while proteomics allows for an estimate of ‘absolute abundance’ Western blotting only shows relative expression between the conditions assessed.</p><p>To expand on this… Fig 1B proteomics looks at naïve versus 24 hr aCD3/aCD28 TCR activated T cells. The western blot data in Fig 2A looks at T cells activated for 1.5 days with SIINFEKL peptide and then washed free of the media containing the TCR stimulus and cultured with no stimulus for 4 or 24 hrs hours and contrast this with cells cultured with IL-2 or IL-15 for 4 or 24 hours. All Fig 2A can tell us is that cytokine stimuli increases and/or sustains PIM1 and PIM2 protein above the level seen in TCR activated cells which have not been cultured with cytokine for a given time period. Overexposure of the blot does reveal detectable PIM1 and PIM2 protein in the no cytokine condition after 4 hrs. Whether this is equivalent to the PIM level in the 24 hr TCR activated cells in Fig 1B is not resolvable from this experiment as we have not included a sample from a naïve or 24 hr TCR activated T cell to act as a point of reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4F - Your proteomics data shows substantial downregulation in proteomics data for granzymes and ifny- possibly from normalization to maximise the differences in the graph - and yet your flow suggests there are only modest differences. Can you explain why a discrepancy in proteomics and flow data - perhaps presenting in a more representative manner (e.g., protein counts)?</p></disp-quote><p>The heatmaps are a scaled for ‘row max’ to ‘row min’ copy number comparison on a linear scale and do indeed visually maximise differences in expression between conditions. This feature of these heatmaps is also what makes the lack of difference in GzmB and GzmA at the mRNA heatmap in Fig 5C quite notable.</p><p>We have now included bar graphs of Granzymes A and B and IFNg protein copy number in Figure 4 (see new Fig 4G-H) to make clearer the magnitude of the effect on the major effector proteins involved in CTL killing function. It is worth noting that flow cytometry histograms from what was formerly Fig 4G (now Fig 4I) are on a log-scale so the shift in fluorescence does generally correspond well with the ~1.7-2.75-fold reduction in protein expression observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4G - did you use isotype controls for this flow experiment? Would help convince labelling has worked - particularly for low levels of IFNy production.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not use isotype controls in these experiments but we are using a well validated interferon gamma antibody and very carefully colour panel/compensation controls to minimise background staining. The only ways to be 100% confident that an antibody is selective is to use an interferon gamma null T cell which we do not have. We do however know that the antibody we use gives flow cytometry data consistent with other orthogonal approaches to measure interferon gamma e.g. ELISA and mass spectrometry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5M - why perform this with just the PIM kinase inhibitors? Can you do this readout for the WT vs. PIM1/2KO cells too? This would really support your claims for the paper about PIM influencing translation given the off-target effects of SMIs.</p></disp-quote><p>Regrettably we have not done this particular experiment with the Pim dKO T cells. As mentioned above, due to this work being performed predominantly during the COVID19 pandemic we ultimately had to make the difficult decision to cease colony maintenance. When work restrictions were lifted we could not ethically or economically justify resurrecting a mouse colony for what was effectively one experiment, which is why we chose to test this key biological question with small molecule inhibitors instead.</p><p>We appreciate that SMIs have off target effects and this is why we used multiple panPIM kinase inhibitors for our SMI validation experiments. While the use of 2 different inhibitors still doesn’t completely negate the concern about possible off-target effects, our conclusions re: PIM kinases and impact on proteins synthesis are not solely based on the inhibitor work but also based on the decreased protein content of the PIM1/2 dKO T cells in the IL-2 CTL, and the data quantifying reductions in levels of many proteins but not their coding mRNA in PIM1/2dKO T cells compared to controls.</p></body></sub-article></article>
