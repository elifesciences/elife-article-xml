Fundamental to these beneficial effects is the ability of the heart to intermittently and substantially increase its performance without incurring damage, but the underlying homeostatic mechanisms are unclear. We identify the ROS-generating NADPH oxidase-4 (Nox4) as an essential regulator of exercise performance in mice. Myocardial Nox4 levels increase during acute exercise and trigger activation of the transcription factor Nrf2, with the induction of multiple endogenous antioxidants. Cardiomyocyte-specific Nox4-deficient (csNox4KO) mice display a loss of exercise-induced Nrf2 activation, cardiac oxidative stress and reduced exercise performance. Cardiomyocyte-specific Nrf2-deficient (csNrf2KO) mice exhibit similar compromised exercise capacity, with mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction. Supplementation with an Nrf2 activator or a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant effectively restores cardiac performance and exercise capacity in csNox4KO and csNrf2KO mice respectively. The Nox4/Nrf2 axis therefore drives a hormetic response that is required for optimal cardiac mitochondrial and contractile function during physiological exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>Nox4</kwd><kwd>Nfe2l2</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Norwegian Health Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>6412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hafstad</surname><given-names>Anne D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105663142</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110159/Z/ 15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PG/12/26/29477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Ajay M</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG/13/11/30384</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Ajay M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CH/1999001/1173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Ajay M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cardiomyocyte Nox4 is a crucial physiological mediator of Nrf2 activation during acute exercise, triggering an adaptive response that preserves redox balance, mitochondrial and cardiac function to support normal physical exercise.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regular physical exercise has widespread beneficial effects on multiple body systems in healthy individuals and increases quality of life and lifespan. It is one of the most effective ways of preventing cardiovascular disease through reduction in risk factors such as obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome and by enhancing vascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mann and Rosenzweig, 2012</xref>). Regular exercise also reduces morbidity and mortality in conditions such as chronic heart failure and dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). Fundamental to these beneficial effects of exercise is the capacity of the heart to substantially increase its performance and output during exercise, safely and without detriment to the heart itself. The intrinsic mechanisms that underlie the physiological adaptation of the heart to regular exercise are therefore crucial to its overall beneficial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vega et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies show that intrinsic pathways that mediate cardiac adaptive responses to exercise are triggered rapidly, even after just 1–3 bouts of consecutive exercise, and are sufficiently robust to provide significant cardioprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Demirel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Powers et al., 2008</xref>). Among the candidate pathways involved in the adaptive response to acute exercise are those that maintain a balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and endogenous antioxidant defences. The maintenance of a physiological redox state is crucial for all cellular functions and is likely to be especially important when cardiac workload and the activity of metabolic pathways that support it are changing rapidly during exercise. Myocardial ROS levels rise transiently during acute exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Muthusamy et al., 2012</xref>), which is thought to be related to enhanced activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain during increases in cardiac contractility. Excessive levels of ROS (oxidative stress) could cause damage to membranes, proteins and DNA and lead to detrimental consequences such as mitochondrial, metabolic and cellular dysfunction. However, these potentially detrimental effects are limited by endogenous antioxidant defences, and exercise has been found to increase antioxidant capacity in the heart and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Powers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Radak et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, low-level increases in ROS may themselves induce a response that counteracts oxidative stress (termed hormesis), which represents a physiological adaptive mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Radak et al., 2017</xref>). However, the sources of ROS that may be involved and their regulatory roles in this process remain elusive.</p><p>Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor which is a master regulator of cellular redox balance. It binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoter regions of its target genes which include enzymes involved in glutathione biosynthesis and maintenance such as glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and glutathione reductase; antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), thioredoxin reductases (TRXRs) and haem oxygenase-1, and detoxification enzymes such as NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Niture et al., 2014</xref>). Nrf2 normally undergoes rapid turnover through ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. However, upon exposure to oxidants or electrophiles, its associated protein Keap1 is modified and enables Nrf2 to be stabilised and then accumulate in the nucleus to mediate gene transcription. Previous work implicates the upregulation of Nrf2 and endogenous antioxidant defences as an adaptive response to exercise in heart and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Done and Traustadóttir, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Muthusamy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Oh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>NADPH oxidase-4 (Nox4) is a member of the Nox family proteins, which generate ROS by catalysing electron transfer from NADPH to molecular O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lassègue et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike other ROS sources such as mitochondria, uncoupled nitric oxide synthases and xanthine oxidases, the Nox enzymes produce ROS as their primary function and have been shown to be involved in diverse redox signalling pathways. In contrast to other mammalian Nox isoforms, Nox4 is constitutively active and is regulated mainly by its abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies show that cardiac Nox4 levels rise in response to diverse cellular stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lassègue et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), in part as a transcriptional response to ATF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Santos et al., 2016</xref>). In the disease setting of chronic pressure overload, the upregulation of Nox4 promotes adaptive cardiac remodelling through effects that include a preservation of myocardial capillary density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and an Nrf2-dependent enhancement of myocardial redox state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smyrnias et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is not known whether Nox4 plays any physiological role in the heart.</p><p>Here, we report that cardiomyocyte Nox4 is an essential mediator of the physiological activation of the Nrf2 pathway during acute exercise, triggering an adaptive response that preserves redox balance, mitochondrial function and exercise performance. Our findings identify a novel physiological pathway that is required for the heart to safely and efficiently support physical exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nox4 is required for a physiological exercise response</title><p>It was previously shown that Nox4 mRNA and protein levels are low in the adult mouse heart but are upregulated by chronic hemodynamic overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). We first analysed whether myocardial Nox4 levels change in response to physiological exercise. In mice subjected to 2 bouts of 1500 m moderate intensity treadmill exercise on consecutive days, there was a significant increase in myocardial Nox4 mRNA and protein levels as compared to sedentary mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

It has long been recognized that adaptations that facilitate the heart’s ability to safely undertake repetitive exercise begin to be triggered very rapidly, after just 1–3 episodes of consecutive exercise. One of the most important of such adaptations may be the maintenance of a physiological redox balance, given that this is crucial for mitochondrial energy metabolism and heart contractile performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Powers et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we identify cardiomyocyte Nox4 as the physiological driver of exercise-induced upregulation of endogenous antioxidants, serving to preserve mitochondrial redox state and respiratory function and thereby facilitate optimal cardiac contractile performance and exercise capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We show that consecutive episodes of exercise upregulate myocardial Nox4 levels and lead to the activation of an Nrf2-dependent transcriptional program that boosts endogenous antioxidants and mitigates oxidative stress during exercise. The cardiomyocyte-specific loss of either Nox4 or Nrf2 results in a significant reduction in exercise cardiac performance and maximal exercise capacity in healthy adult mice. The exercise defect in cardiomyocyte-specific <italic>Nox4</italic>-deficient mice is corrected by a small molecule Nrf2 activator, sulforaphane, placing Nrf2 activation downstream of Nox4. On the other hand, the defect in exercise capacity in cardiomyocyte-specific <italic>Nrf2</italic>-deficient mice can be rescued by a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, confirming that it relates to a disruption of mitochondrial redox balance.

Previous studies show that an increase in Nox4 abundance is induced by diverse pathological stresses such as hypoxia, ischaemia and haemodynamic overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). In the current study, cardiac Nox4 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased after two bouts of moderate intensity exercise on consecutive days. The precise stimulus for the increase in Nox4 levels with exercise was not studied. However, the transcriptional induction of Nox4 by ATF4 was recently identified as an important mechanism for its stress-induced upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Santos et al., 2016</xref>), and it is of interest that exercise is reported to upregulate ATF4 in human skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drummond et al., 2011</xref>). An increase in levels of Nox4 as a ROS-producing protein complex might be envisaged to generate detrimental oxidative stress. However, it has been found that Nox4 mediates protective effects in pathological stress situations, such as chronic hemodynamic overload or nutrient starvation in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sciarretta et al., 2013</xref>) and angiotensin II-induced remodelling or atherosclerosis in the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Craige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schröder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schürmann et al., 2015</xref>). These effects typically involve localized redox signalling without overt oxidative stress. In fact, Nox4 was found to specifically activate Nrf2 during load-induced cardiac remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smyrnias et al., 2015</xref>) and during angiotensin II-induced vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schröder et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we show that myocardial Nox4 mediates a similar activation of Nrf2 during acute exercise – representing to the best of our knowledge the first physiological function of cardiac Nox4 that has so far been identified. The Nox4-dependent activation of Nrf2 was required for optimal cardiac function and running capacity during maximal exercise, as evidenced by the restoration of normal exercise responses in <italic>Nox4</italic>-deficient animals that were treated with the Nrf2 activator, sulforaphane. Notably, we observed no increase in cardiac contractility as assessed by fractional shortening in <italic>Nox4</italic>-deficient mice at peak exercise whereas there was a 24% increase in wild-type animals.</p><p>Nrf2 is a master transcriptional regulator of antioxidant and stress-defense proteins and previous studies found that it is activated in the heart upon acute exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Muthusamy et al., 2012</xref>). A canonical mechanism for Nrf2 activation is in response to redox signals which result in its post-translational stabilisation. In principle, Nrf2 activation could be activated by diverse sources of ROS, such as mitochondria or different Nox isoforms. However, here we find that endogenous Nox4 is an essential and indispensable regulator of myocardial Nrf2 activation during physiological acute exercise. As such, the acute increase in myocardial Nrf2 protein levels and its major downstream targets (such as antioxidants and GSH-generating enzymes) was markedly inhibited in the hearts of <italic>Nox4</italic>-null mice or csNox4KO mice. Furthermore, this was accompanied by a significant redox imbalance as assessed by the GSH/GSSG ratio and by evidence of oxidative stress as assessed by the levels of 4-HNE adducts, along with a reduced maximal exercise capacity. Therefore, the absence of Nox4 resulted in redox imbalance during exercise as a result of impaired Nrf2 activation and impaired antioxidant reserve, and led to a significant impairment of exercise performance. The increased ROS levels in this setting most likely emanated from mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Radak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saborido et al., 2011</xref>), as evidenced by experiments using the mitochondria-targeted redox probe MitoB and the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant MitoQ.</p><p>To more specifically establish the role of cardiomyocyte Nrf2 in exercise-induced cardiac adaptation and determine how it enhances exercise performance, we developed a new mouse model with cardiomyocyte-specific deficiency of Nrf2. These animals had a normal heart structure and function at baseline but displayed a significant impairment of cardiac performance and running capacity upon maximal exercise, similar to the phenotype observed in <italic>Nox4</italic>-deficient animals. The csNrf2KO mice, however, developed a similar elevation in cardiac Nox4 levels upon exercise to that observed in control mice, consistent with Nox4 being upstream of Nrf2. Investigation of cardiac mitochondrial function in csNrf2KO mice revealed that the respiratory capacity at maximal exercise was significantly impaired compared to control animals, without any differences in mitochondrial mass or membrane integrity. Although emerging data suggest that Nrf2 can have multi-faceted effects on mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dinkova-Kostova and Abramov, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Holmström et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Merry and Ristow, 2016b</xref>), we found no difference in cardiac mitochondrial function between sedentary csNrf2KO and control mice, indicating that the difference between genotypes was specific to exercise. Further analyses revealed that the csNrf2KO mouse hearts failed to increase the mitochondrial antioxidants PRXIII, TRXR2 and SOD2 upon exercise, in contrast to control animals. In parallel, we found that mitochondrial ROS levels were lower after exercise in control mice (consistent with increased antioxidant levels) but that this response was absent in csNrf2KO mouse hearts. Taken together, these results indicate that an Nrf2-dependent induction of mitochondrial antioxidants is critical to maintain redox balance during acute exercise. Our study also shows that cardiomyocyte Nox4 is the essential activator of this adaptive response, resulting in the maintenance of optimal mitochondrial respiration and cardiac function during maximal exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Whether antioxidant supplementation improves exercise performance is a controversial question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Merry and Ristow, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ristow et al., 2009</xref>). A reduction in excessive oxidative stress resulting from mitochondrial ROS production is likely to be beneficial but if ROS-mediated adaptive responses are inhibited by antioxidants, this might be detrimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lauer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sachdev and Davies, 2008</xref>). Previous studies have identified several ROS-mediated adaptive responses during exercise. The current study suggests that what is ultimately most important is the redox balance during exercise, especially at the level of the mitochondria. Targeted antioxidants such as MitoQ that primarily reduce mitochondrial ROS levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oyewole and Birch-Machin, 2015</xref>) may be more likely to have beneficial effects than non-specific antioxidants that might inhibit Nrf2 activation. Interestingly, we did not find any beneficial effects of either sulforaphane or MitoQ in the control animal groups, suggesting that there is limited scope for further enhancement of the adaptive exercise redox response in healthy adult mice with normal Nox4/Nrf2 activation, at least in the relatively acute setting. This is consistent with prior findings that MitoQ did not enhance aerobic training adaptations or skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in young healthy men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shill et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is possible that the Nox4/Nrf2/mitochondrial antioxidant pathway could be usefully augmented in older individuals or those with disease-related impairment of this response.</p><p>Taken together, these data identify cardiomyocyte Nox4 as a crucial physiological mediator of Nrf2 activation, triggering an adaptive response that maintains redox state, mitochondrial function and cardiac contractile performance to support normal physical exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

All the mouse lines studied were on a C57BL/6 background. Global Nox4KO mice were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) and were compared to littermate wild-type controls. Inducible cardiomyocyte-specific Nox4KO mice (csNox4KO) were generated by crossing <italic>Nox4</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> female mice with male α-MHC-MerCreMer mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Tamoxifen was administered by i.p. injection (20 mg/kg/day) for 5 days to induce Cre expression. csNox4KO mice were compared with tamoxifen-treated Cre-negative Flox littermates, with the groups subjected to the exercise regime 1 week after completion of tamoxifen treatment. Tamoxifen treatment itself had no effect on cardiac function (data not shown).</p><p>The generation of <italic>Nrf2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice was commissioned from Taconic-Artemis (Germany). In brief, the targeting vector was generated using BAC clones from the C57BL/6 RPCI-23 BAC library. The LoxP sites flanked exons 2 and 5 and the vector included an FRT (neomycin resistance) and F3 (puromycin resistance) site. The targeting vector was transfected into C57BL/6 Tac embryonic stem (ES) cell lines and recombinant clones were identified by PCR and Southern blotting, then injected into blastocysts. Heterozygous Floxed mice obtained from germline chimeras were bred with C57BL/6 Flp-deletor mice to excise the resistance cassettes. Mice were backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 background. Cardiomyocyte-specific <italic>Nrf2</italic> knock-out mice (designated as csNrf2KO) were obtained by crossing <italic>Nrf2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with Cre-recombinase expressing mice under the control of a cardiomyocyte-specific Mlc2v promoter (Mlc2vCre). csNrf2KO and littermate <italic>Nrf2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> controls were obtained by intercrossing Mlc2vCre<sup>+/-</sup>/<italic>Nrf2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with <italic>Nrf2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Acute exercise regimes</title><p>We studied female <italic>Nox4</italic>-null mice, csNox4KO mice or csNrf2KO mice and their respective littermate controls. Mice of age approximately 8 weeks were acclimatized to and trained on a 12.5° uphill Exer 3/6 open treadmill (Columbus Instruments) for 2 days. On both training days, mice ran for a total of 10 min, with a continual increase in speed up to a final speed of 15 m/min. Mice were then randomly assigned into a sedentary or exercise group. The exercise regime used in the study is a moderate intensity protocol as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hafstad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Muthusamy et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, on day 3 and 4 (experimental days 1 and 2), mice in the exercise group were subjected to a single bout of running at 15 m/min at a gradient of 12.5° for a total of 1500 m. Tissues for analyses of gene expression or immunoblotting were obtained after the second prolonged period of exercise.</p><p>Exercise capacity tests were performed on day 5 (experimental day 3). Mice started running at an initial treadmill speed of 15 m/min for 30 min. The speed was then increased at 1 m/min every 10 min for another 30 min, followed by a 1 m/min increase every 5 min until the mice were exhausted. Exhaustion was defined as the point at which mice spent more than 5 s on the electric shocker without attempting to resume running. The total running distance and running time were calculated for each mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">He et al., 2012</xref>).

Can this protein therefore be excluded on the basis of Nox2 content? &quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Hancock et al. present a thorough study, performed in a murine model, to support an important role of Nox4 and Nrf2 in cardioprotection during exercise. This paper is specifically focused on delineating mechanisms that lead to the protective (and non-damaging) effects of exercise to the heart. Specifically, oxidative stress is increased during exercise, due to the higher metabolic requirements. This creates ROS overload that the heart is capable of managing. This paper demonstrates through the use of mostly Western blotting and functional measurements in transgenic animals that Nox4 regulated exercise performance by activating Nrf2, which in turn activates mitochondrial antioxidants. Overall, I find this study to be thorough and I have several questions that could further improve the work:</p><p>1) It would be useful to compare mitochondria density and structure in WT and csNrf2KO by TEM to rule out the possibility of other mitochondrial defects.</p><p>2) Figure 2—figure supplement 1, shows rather small differences in cardiac function at peak exercise. Although this might show up as significant in a statistical test, I wonder if it is of any biological relevance.</p><p>3) It would be good to see the entire Western blots in the supplement. Lanes are good in the main text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors convincingly demonstrate that cardiac Nox4 mediates the cardiac response to exercise. Up until now, the role of Nox4 in the heart has been probed only in pathological conditions; this is the first study to show a physiological role for Nox4 in the heart, as the authors correctly point out. The study is state-of-the-art, especially with respect to the animal models and the fact that mechanism was investigated in vivo. In general, the data support the conclusions; however, a better characterization of the new csNrf2KO mice is needed before they can truly claim cardiomyocyte specificity.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Why do the csNrf2KO look like heterozygotes? Both RNA and protein are only reduced by 50%? If this is because samples were taken from whole heart and include non-cardiomyocytes, please be specific. In addition, some confirmation that Nrf levels are not affected in other tissues is necessary before you conclude cardiomyocyte specificity.</p><p>2) The only unconvincing data are those shown in Figure 4B. While it is clear that exercise induces a decrease in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, the slight decrease in baseline in csNrf2KO and the reported levels after exercise do not appear to be different from exercise in WT mice. So perhaps H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels are already low in csNrf2KO mice and exercise doesn't reduce them further. Please either provide statistics showing that these values are in fact different from WT-exercise or soften this conclusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper provides data indicating that cardiac NADPH oxidase-4 (Nox4) is an essential regulator of exercise performance in mice. The authors provide evidence that myocardial Nox4 levels increase during acute exercise and trigger activation of the transcription factor Nrf2, with the induction of multiple endogenous antioxidants. Furthermore cardiomyocyte-specific Nox4-deficient (csNox4KO) mice or Nrf2-deficient (csNrf2KO) mice exhibit similar compromised exercise capacity with mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction. They hypothesise that Nox4/Nrf2 axis therefore drive a hormetic response that is required for optimal cardiac mitochondrial and contractile function during physiological exercise. While the data are generally compelling there are number of issues with the paper:</p><p>1) Severity of exercise studied. The relevance of the data to physiological responses is dependent upon the nature of the exercise protocol for mice, which the authors describe as acute, moderate aerobic exercise. It is difficult to know how this description is justified. For habitually sedentary caged mice, the protocol described appears to be a severely incremental exercise regimen. Some consideration of this is required.</p><p>2) Studies of mitochondrial respiratory capacity were undertaken on cardiac mitochondria isolated after exercise.

The co-author Anne Dr Hafstad and colleagues have extensive experience of exercise-intensity controlled protocols in mice on a C57Bl6 background (e.g. Hafstad et al., 2013; Hafstad et al., 2011). High intensity exercise protocols in C57Bl6 mice are typically conducted at a higher inclination (25%) and higher running speeds, and the mice can only sustain high intensity running for a few minutes. Continuous running for ~100min (&gt; 1500m) is only possible with moderate intensity protocols. We have now clarified that this was a moderate intensity protocol in the Materials and methods (subsection “Acute exercise regimes”), Results (paragraph one) and Figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Studies of mitochondrial respiratory capacity were undertaken on cardiac mitochondria isolated after exercise. Due to the time required for isolation, do the changes reported merely reflect damaged mitochondria?</p></disp-quote><p>Mitochondrial preparations were isolated using the same methodology in all groups (KO and controls) and we allowed a 40 min rest period before experiments, so the differences are unlikely to be related to the isolation protocol or time. There were no differences among groups in the mitochondrial yield (protein concentration) and we know from previous work in the lab that respiratory function is stable for at least 2-3 hours after isolation (Hafstad et al., 2011). Furthermore, we formally tested for mitochondrial membrane integrity by examining the response to cytochrome C – which showed no significant differences among groups. These data are now shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and referred to in the Results (subsection “Mitochondrial function is impaired in csNrf2KO mice after exercise”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please consider an important comment by reviewer 3: &quot;A lack of change in cardiac Nox2 content (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) is cited as evidence for a lack of involvement of this protein in exercise responses, but Nox2 activity is regulated (differently to Nox4) by assembly and activation of the NADPH oxidase complex rather than protein content. Can this protein therefore be excluded on the basis of Nox2 content?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s comment that Nox2 activation requires assembly of the oxidase complex and cannot therefore be inferred merely from Nox2 levels. We have now performed additional experiments in which we quantified the protein levels of the essential subunit p47<sup>phox</sup> in the membrane fraction. Translocation of p47<sup>phox</sup> to the membrane is a key step in Nox2 activation and is therefore a good surrogate for complex assembly and oxidase activation. The results showed no differences in membrane levels of p47<sup>phox</sup> with exercise, indicating that there was no significant activation of Nox2. These new results are now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and described in the Results (paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Hancock et al. present a thorough study, performed in a murine model, to support an important role of Nox4 and Nrf2 in cardioprotection during exercise. This paper is specifically focused on delineating mechanisms that lead to the protective (and non-damaging) effects of exercise to the heart. Specifically, oxidative stress is increased during exercise, due to the higher metabolic requirements. This creates ROS overload that the heart is capable of managing. This paper demonstrates through the use of mostly Western blotting and functional measurements in transgenic animals that Nox4 regulated exercise performance by activating Nrf2, which in turn activates mitochondrial antioxidants. Overall, I find this study to be thorough and I have several questions that could further improve the work:</p><p>1) It would be useful to compare mitochondria density and structure in WT and csNrf2KO by TEM to rule out the possibility of other mitochondrial defects.</p></disp-quote><p>Guided by the editorial summary, we have not pursued this experiment in the current paper. However, please note that we now show data from experiments with cytochrome C addition to assess mitochondrial membrane integrity (Figure 3—figure supplement 3), which suggest that mitochondrial integrity is preserved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2—figure supplement 1, shows rather small differences in cardiac function at peak exercise. Although this might show up as significant in a statistical test, I wonder if it is of any biological relevance.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the differences are indeed physiologically relevant. In awake echocardiography, we found a 24% increase in LV fractional shortening (FS) in the control group at peak exercise whereas csNox4KO mice actually showed a 6% decrease (Figure 2C). Given the high heart rates (&gt;600 beats/min), this translates into a substantial change in cardiac output. The physiological relevance of this difference in cardiac function in cardiac-specific KO mice is also evident in the marked differences in exercise duration (our intervention in this experiment is cardiac-specific). We have now emphasised the significant differences in cardiac fractional shortening response in the Discussion (paragraph two).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be good to see the entire Western blots in the supplement. Lanes are good in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided full images of all Western blots in Supplementary figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>In this manuscript, the authors convincingly demonstrate that cardiac Nox4 mediates the cardiac response to exercise. Up until now, the role of Nox4 in the heart has been probed only in pathological conditions; this is the first study to show a physiological role for Nox4 in the heart, as the authors correctly point out. The study is state-of-the-art, especially with respect to the animal models and the fact that mechanism was investigated</italic> in vivo<italic>. In general, the data support the conclusions; however, a better characterization of the new csNrf2KO mice is needed before they can truly claim cardiomyocyte specificity.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Why do the csNrf2KO look like heterozygotes? Both RNA and protein are only reduced by 50%? If this is because samples were taken from whole heart and include non-cardiomyocytes, please be specific. In addition, some confirmation that Nrf levels are not affected in other tissues is necessary before you conclude cardiomyocyte specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, the mRNA and protein levels were in whole heart and the residual presence of Nrf2 is likely to mainly reflect expression in non-myocytes. We have now specifically commented on this point (subsection “Cardiomyocyte Nrf2 is required for optimal increments in heart performance during exercise”). We also checked Nrf2 mRNA levels in other organs to confirm cardiac-specific expression and now show these results in Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The only unconvincing data are those shown in Figure 4B. While it is clear that exercise induces a decrease in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, the slight decrease in baseline in csNrf2KO and the reported levels after exercise do not appear to be different from exercise in WT mice. So perhaps H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels are already low in csNrf2KO mice and exercise doesn't reduce them further. Please either provide statistics showing that these values are in fact different from WT-exercise or soften this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that exercise induces a decrease in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in control mice whereas no such decrease occurs in csNrf2KO mice – consistent with the increase in endogenous antioxidants in control mice but no change in the KO mice. Indeed, the main point that we wished to highlight here was the different response to exercise rather than the absolute levels in each group. We have now re-phrased this sentence to make this clearer:</p><p>“We found in normal mouse hearts that mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were significantly lower immediately upon cessation of peak exercise than in the non-exercising state (Figure 4B) – consistent with a reduction in ROS at peak exercise due to an enhanced antioxidant state. In marked contrast, there was no decrease in mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels with exercise in csNrf2KO mice, in line with the failure to enhance mitochondrial antioxidants.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) Severity of exercise studied. The relevance of the data to physiological responses is dependent upon the nature of the exercise protocol for mice, which the authors describe as acute, moderate aerobic exercise. It is difficult to know how this description is justified. For habitually sedentary caged mice, the protocol described appears to be a severely incremental exercise regimen. Some consideration of this is required.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response in Essential Revision above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Studies of mitochondrial respiratory capacity were undertaken on cardiac mitochondria isolated after exercise.

Since MitoQ targets to the mitochondria, it is not surprising that it should have no effect on Nox4 actions in a different location. From the perspective of the overall exercise response and the effect of interventions on mitochondrial ROS, our results suggest that there is limited scope for enhancement of the adaptive exercise response in healthy adult mice with normal Nox4/Nrf2 activation, at least in the relatively acute exercise setting. However, this may be different in settings where Nox4/Nrf2 activation is impaired.
