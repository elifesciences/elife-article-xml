phagotrophic organisms supplies the nutrients necessary for growth. Wildtype <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> amoebae feed on bacteria, but for decades laboratory work has relied on axenic mutants that can also grow on liquid media. We used forward genetics to identify the causative gene underlying this phenotype. This gene encodes the RasGAP Neurofibromin (NF1). Loss of NF1 enables axenic growth by increasing fluid uptake. Mutants form outsized macropinosomes which are promoted by greater Ras and PI3K activity at sites of endocytosis. Relatedly, NF1 mutants can ingest larger-than-normal particles using phagocytosis. An NF1 reporter is recruited to nascent macropinosomes, suggesting that NF1 limits their size by locally inhibiting Ras signalling. Our results link NF1 with macropinocytosis and phagocytosis for the first time, and we propose that NF1 evolved in early phagotrophs to spatially modulate Ras activity, thereby constraining and shaping their feeding structures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04940.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04940.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04940.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> amoebae are microbes that feed on bacteria living in the soil. They are unusual in that the amoebae can survive and grow in a single-celled form, but when food is scarce, many individual cells can gather together to form a simple multicellular organism.</p><p>To feed on bacteria, the amoebae use a process called phagocytosis, which starts with the membrane that surrounds the cell growing outwards to completely surround the bacteria. This leads to the bacteria entering the amoeba within a membrane compartment called a vesicle, where they are broken down into small molecules by enzymes. The cells can also take up fluids and dissolved molecules using a similar process called macropinocytosis.</p><p>With its short and relatively simple lifestyle, <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> is often used in research to study phagocytosis, cell movement and other processes that are also found in larger organisms. For example, some immune cells in animals use phagocytosis to capture and destroy invading microbes. Most studies using <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>as a model have used amoebae with genetic mutations that allow them to be grown in liquid cultures in the laboratory without needing to feed on bacteria. The mutations allow the ‘mutant’ amoebae to take up more liquid and dissolved nutrients by macropinocytosis, but it is not known where in the genome these mutations are.</p><p>Here, Bloomfield et al. used genome sequencing to reveal that these mutations alter a gene that encodes a protein called Neurofibromin. The experiments show that the loss of Neurofibromin increases the amount of fluid taken up by the amoebae through macropinocytosis, and also enables the amoebae to take up larger-than-normal particles during phagocytosis.</p><p>The experiments suggest that Neurofibromin controls both phagocytosis and macropinocytosis by inhibiting the activity of another protein called Ras. Neurofibromin is found in animals and many other organisms so Bloomfield et al. propose that it is an ancient protein that evolved in early single-celled organisms to control the size and shape of their feeding structures.</p><p>In humans, mutations in the gene that encodes the Neurofibromin protein can lead to the development of a severe disorder—called Neurofibromatosis type 1—in which tumours form in the nervous system. Given that tumour cells can use phagocytosis and macropinocytosis to gain nutrients as they grow, understanding how this protein works in the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> amoebae may help to inform future efforts to develop treatments for this human disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04940.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04940.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>amoeba</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd><kwd>macropinocytosis</kwd><kwd>phagocytosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Dictyostelium</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105115237</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Robert R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>'Leonardo da Vinci' programme</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sander</surname><given-names>Sophia P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inactivation of the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> orthologue of the tumour suppressor Neurofibromin (NF1) enables amoebae to ingest dissolved nutrients using macropinocytosis more rapidly, and to prey on larger organisms using phagocytosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phagotrophic cells feed by performing large-scale endocytosis. A wide range of unicellular eukaryotes grow in this way, suggesting that it is extremely old in evolutionary terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stanier, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cavalier-Smith, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yutin et al., 2009</xref>). Typically phagocytosis is used by these organisms to engulf solid particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Metchnikoff, 1892</xref>), and nutrients are then extracted from them by lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Duve and Wattiaux, 1966</xref>). Animal cells and amoebae ingest solid material using F-actin driven projections of their plasma membrane, forming pseudopodia and ultimately cup- or crown-shaped ruffles that enclose adhered particles. These cells can also internalise bulk fluid without the guidance of a particle using a closely related process, macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swanson, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Phagocytosis and macropinocytosis are controlled using a large set of cytoskeletal and membrane-associated regulators, notably a variety of small G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bar-Sagi and Feramisco, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ridley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peters et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cox et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martínez-Martín et al., 2011</xref>). Oncogenes such as Src and phosphatidylinositide 3′-kinase (PI3K) have also been linked with regulation of these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Veithen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buczynski et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amyere et al., 2000</xref>). In amoebae, growth and endocytosis have obvious connections since phagocytosed material supplies essentially all their nutrients; in contrast vertebrates are specialised to digest food extracellularly in the gut, and so links are less apparent. However, large-scale endocytosis is extremely important in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Metchnikoff, 1892</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Norbury et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sallusto et al., 1995</xref>), while tumour cells, released from the normal constraints on growth and proliferation, can display pronounced macropinocytotic or phagocytotic uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lewis, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Montcourrier et al., 1994</xref>), and can feed by ingesting extracellular protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Commisso et al., 2013</xref>). While there are clear similarities between large-scale endocytosis in animal cells and amoebae, neither the regulatory architecture nor evolutionary contexts are adequately understood.</p><p>Phagotrophic microorganisms can be difficult to study in the laboratory because of their requirement for other organisms as food. This can be overcome if cells can be cultured axenically (‘a-xenic’ indicating the absence of organisms of another species): in some cases, such as the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, which feeds primarily on bacteria in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vuillemin, 1903</xref>), strains were gradually adapted to growth in complex liquid broth, and ultimately in chemically defined media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sussman and Sussman, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Watts and Ashworth, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Franke and Kessin, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Watts, 1977</xref>). This process involved the selection of mutants that display increased rates of macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Watts and Ashworth, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loomis, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hacker et al., 1997</xref>). Two important mutations, <italic>axeA</italic> and <italic>axeB,</italic> were identified by linkage analysis as being necessary for robust axenic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 1974a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">1974b</xref>), but only the latter is strictly required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17a">Clarke and Kayman, 1987</xref>). Although these axenic mutant strains have been very widely used for over 40 years, the genetic basis of their growth has remained mysterious, since the mutations could not be precisely mapped. We used a forward genetic approach to identify mutations that promote axenic growth in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> using whole genome sequencing. We found that the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> orthologue of the Ras GTPase activating protein (RasGAP) Neurofibromin (NF1), a tumour suppressor that is mutated in the genetic disorder Neurofibromatosis type 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xu et al., 1990</xref>), is a key regulator of both macropinocytosis and phagocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of <italic>axeB</italic>, the major determinant of axenic growth</title><p>To generate fresh axenic strains for sequencing, we cultured wildtype <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells in HL5 growth medium after washing them free of food bacteria. This medium supports the growth of axenic strains such as Ax2 and AX4, but wildtype cells arrest their growth and ultimately die. In order to minimize the number of irrelevant background mutations we avoided mutagenesis and found that spontaneous mutants that are able to grow and proliferate arise frequently among these growth-arrested populations. We selected several independent mutants and sequenced the genomes of three after clonal isolation, along with that of the parental DdB strain, which was chosen because it was also parent to the established axenic laboratory strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloomfield et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>At first, other than two large duplications that do not correlate with axenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we could only identify one mutation affecting coding sequence in any of these strains relative to their parent, a seven basepair deletion in strain HM559 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We noted that the reference genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eichinger et al., 2005</xref>), derived from the axenic mutant strain AX4, also differs from its parent DdB in the same gene model (annotated as DDB_G0279251). Further analysis demonstrated that AX4 has lost almost nine kilobases of this region on chromosome 3, resulting in the deletion of most of the coding sequence of a large gene encoding a homologue of the Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) Neurofibromin (NF1), as well as part of the upstream gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), with a short segment of extraneous sequence inserted. The 7 bp deletion mutation in HM559 lies within the C-terminal region of this NF1 homologue, and we found that another established axenic mutant, Ax2, has exactly the same deletion-insertion mutation as AX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04940.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Mutations in the <italic>axeB</italic> gene in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> axenic mutants</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04940.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04940.003</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Strain</th><th>Mutation</th><th>Effect on <italic>Dd</italic> NF1 protein</th><th>Position in human NF1 protein</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ax2</td><td>c.-1954_6926delinsCM000150.2:1390060_1390808</td><td>Deletion to amino acid 2309</td><td>to 2358</td></tr><tr><td>AX4</td><td>c.-1954_6926delinsCM000150.2:1390060_1390808</td><td>Deletion to amino acid 2309</td><td>to 2358</td></tr><tr><td>HM557</td><td>c.226_230del</td><td>Deletion, frameshift</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>HM587</td><td>c.1015A &gt; T</td><td>Nonsense</td><td>315</td></tr><tr><td>HM591</td><td>c.3033_3040del</td><td>Deletion, frameshift</td><td>∼1060 (in insertion relative to Human)</td></tr><tr><td>NP73</td><td>c.3508del</td><td>Deletion, frameshift</td><td>1228</td></tr><tr><td>HM589</td><td>c.4113G &gt; T</td><td>K &gt; N</td><td>1423</td></tr><tr><td>HM590</td><td>c.4227_4459del</td><td>Deletion, frameshift</td><td>1461–1533</td></tr><tr><td>HM558</td><td>c.6393_6413inv</td><td>DPVVSAIL &gt; EELQKPND</td><td>2182–2189</td></tr><tr><td>HM586</td><td>c.6833_7077del</td><td>Deletion, frameshift</td><td>2325–2481</td></tr><tr><td>HM559</td><td>c.7137_7143del</td><td>Deletion, frameshift</td><td>2525–2529</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Strains are described fully in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.

AX4 derives from another axenic mutant, AX3 (or A3), which was isolated from wildtype cells independently from Ax2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loomis, 1971</xref>).

However, the mutation in <italic>axeB</italic> in Ax2 and AX4 is identical, suggesting that the extant lines of these strains, along with AX3, had a common ancestor that was axenic. It might not be possible to determine the reason for this discrepancy with the literature; one possibility is that very early in these strains' contemporaneous history one line was contaminated with the other and the slower-growing of the two then lost. In formally numbering alleles we have retrospectively assigned allele number ‘3’ to the <italic>axeB</italic> mutation in the historic strain NP73, but follow recent recommendations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dictybase.org/Dicty_Info/nomenclature_guidelines.html">http://dictybase.org/Dicty_Info/nomenclature_guidelines.html</ext-link>) for new strains, and use the same number for gene disruptions using the same knockout construct.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The ubiquity of mutations in the NF1 gene in the axenic strains tested suggested that they must underlie the phenotype we selected for, and the gene's location on chromosome 3 accords with the mapping of the classically defined <italic>axeB</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 1974a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">1974b</xref>).

In contrast, a version in which two consecutive arginine residues were mutated in the ‘arginine finger’ motif required for GAP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmadian et al., 1997</xref>) (NF1-AS) did not retard growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) nor affect macropinosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and localised transiently to membrane ruffles and macropinosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This further supports a role for NF1 GAP activity in limiting macropinocytosis. A full length construct expressing the human NF1 protein also adversely affected growth of mutant cells, but a version with the critical arginine residue mutated to alanine reduced growth by a similar amount, suggesting non-specific effects (unpublished data). Since the spontaneous inversion mutation we identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) affects the C-terminal region of the protein, we also tested whether the core RasGAP-Sec14-PH region of the <italic>D. discoideum</italic> NF1 protein could rescue the NF1 mutant; like the NF-AS version this did not suppress axenic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and displayed an evenly cytosolic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that other regions of the protein are required for its correct localisation. The inactive NF1-AS form of the protein is presumably recruited by strong Ras activity at macropinocytotic crowns that it is then unable to attenuate. This localisation implies that the NF1 protein directly regulates signalling at the plasma membrane during ruffling, and together with the more extensive Ras signalling during macropinocytosis, suggests that this RasGAP regulates a pool of Ras responsible for this feeding process.</p><p>Two <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> Ras proteins have been linked to endocytic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chubb et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoeller et al., 2013</xref>); to examine their involvement in NF1-controlled events we expressed GFP-tagged versions of each in NF1 mutant and wildtype cells.

This results in a markedly different outcome when the cells are incubated in HL5 medium: mutants can grow but the wildtype cannot. One possible explanation is that nutrient-uptake below a certain threshold leads to a growth arrest. To test this idea, we asked whether wildtype cells can maintain growth in an enriched axenic medium, as suggested by earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sussman and Sussman, 1967</xref>).

The further mutations enabling faster growth in the established axenic strains remain to be identified, and their precise effect is still unclear.

NF1 mutants retain a large growth advantage in the more complex medium, and so will still be selected during prolonged culture. Nevertheless, this protocol should be of use for short-term axenic culture of wildtype strains; standard defined medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin also enables slow growth of wildtype strains (unpublished data) suggesting that fully synthetic defined media should be attainable. This further supports the idea that the important effect of serum is the provision of bulk nutrients, preventing the nitrogen starvation that initiates <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marin, 1976</xref>).</p><p>One important focus of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> research is chemotaxis, and key roles for Ras and PIP3 in steering migrating cells have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Artemenko et al., 2014</xref>). Although axenic cells chemotax very well to the best-studied chemoattractant, cyclic-AMP, they are much less efficient than wildtype cells in chemotaxis to folic acid, due to interference from large, PIP3-rich, macropinosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Veltman et al., 2014</xref>). It is now apparent that the reason for this poor chemotaxis is likely to be the inactivation of NF1 in axenic cells, leading to Ras and PI3K hyperactivity. Macropinosomes and intense patches of Ras activity and PIP3 also appear in cells chemotaxing to cyclic-AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parent et al., 1998</xref>) and it will be important to disentangle their contribution to chemotaxis by comparative studies of axenic and wildtype cells.</p><p>Several lines of evidence emphasize the importance of Ras in the feeding process used by <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells. Previous studies in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> showed defects in macropinocytosis and phagocytosis after disruption of Ras genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chubb et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoeller et al., 2013</xref>), and Ras activates PI3K during macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoeller et al., 2013</xref>). Further, Ras activity reporters localise strongly to membrane ruffles during macropinocytosis as well as to nascent phagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sasaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clarke et al., 2010</xref>), and we found that the size of these sites of Ras activity is increased in NF1 mutants. The well-studied NF1 orthologues in mammals and yeast are specific to Ras subfamily small G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tanaka et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 1991</xref>), and one of mutations we found in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> corresponds exactly to one that abolishes the GAP activity of the human orthologue by altering the Ras-binding interface of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poullet et al., 1994</xref>). These data, along with the effect of mutating the ‘arginine finger’ critical for RasGAP activity, suggest that <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> NF1 is most likely Ras-specific, but this remains to be demonstrated biochemically. The specificity of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> NF1 towards different Ras isoforms remains unclear. Since the <italic>rasG</italic> and <italic>rasS</italic> null mutants have defective endocytic feeding but are still viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chubb et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoeller et al., 2013</xref>) it is likely that multiple Ras isoforms are involved, possibly including other less well-characterised genes.</p><p>The biochemical functions of NF1 beyond its GAP activity remain poorly understood. A module comprising a CRAL/TRIO and a PH-like domain is conserved and likely mediates an interaction with lipids within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">D'angelo et al., 2006</xref>), but has not been tied to any function of consequence. Regions of conserved sequence to either side of the relatively well-characterised core of the protein are even more mysterious, but may be important for its function in <italic>Dictyostelium,</italic> perhaps by mediating its dynamic localisation. We find that GFP-tagged full length <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> NF1 localises transiently to macropinocytotic ruffles. This translocation has only been visualised in a mutant form of the protein with the ‘arginine finger’ motif mutated, because over-expression of the active protein almost completely inhibits macropinocytosis. It will be important to identify structural determinants of this localisation as a route towards a better understanding of the cell-biological function of NF1.</p><p>Both macropinosomes and phagosomes are significantly larger in NF1 mutants than in wildtypes, suggesting that NF1 stimulates Ras GTPase activity as endocytic ruffles form and spread, thereby limiting their size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The control of NF1 function is not well understood, but our results suggest that it might be locally inactivated during macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. In an intriguing parallel, growth factor treatment of mammalian cells leads to rapid degradation of NF1 by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cichowski et al., 2003</xref>) and also triggers membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis with similar kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunk et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mellström et al., 1983</xref>). However, we could find no obvious fluid-uptake phenotype in NF1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that NF1 inactivation is not sufficient for stimulation of macropinocytosis in these cells (unpublished data). Given the known involvement of Ras signalling in promoting ruffling and macropinocytosis the possibility remains that NF1 function is conserved in metazoa, but in a context in which Ras activity is more heavily regulated, with additional layers of control not present in amoebae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casci et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04940.031</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic model of NF1 function in Dictyostelium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) While wildtype NF1+ amoebae ingest bacteria most readily, NF1− cells are also able to ingest larger particles such as yeast cells, and accumulate more fluid in macropinosomes.

The presence of these RasGAPs in organisms that display strikingly similar forms of circular ruffling suggests the hypothesis that NF1 and MNF evolved together to control the movements of the exploratory cell projections used in very early eukaryotes during feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boschek et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">John et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hacker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cavalier-Smith, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Macropinocytosis and phagocytosis occur in a well-defined series of stages that are shared between amoebae and vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swanson, 2008</xref>).

Our unbiased forward genetic analysis suggests that NF1 has a fundamental role in governing the feeding processes used by amoebae. The mechanistic parallels between large-scale endocytosis in metazoa and amoebae, as well as their shared history, raise the possibility that this function is conserved. The role of Schwann cells, the cell-type of origin of neurofibromas, as non-professional phagocytes during the repair of nerve damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stoll et al., 1989</xref>) is striking in this regard.

The bound Ras was released by boiling the washed beads in LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies) for 5 min, before immunoblotting and detection with mouse monoclonal anti-pan-Ras antibody (clone RAS 10, Millipore) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody using standard techniques.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Detection of phosphorylated ERK</title><p>Cells of each strain were harvested from mass inoculation cultures grown in association with <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> on SM agar, washed, and resuspended in autoclaved HL5 medium at a density of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per ml in a total of 10 ml in 50 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The flasks were then shaken at 180 rpm and 22°C and aliquots taken at the indicated timepoints. These samples were lysed in LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies) in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, as above; Sodium pyrophosphate, sodium orthovanadate, and ß-glycerophosphate), and separated on NuPAGE polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto PVDF according to standard protocols. Blots were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-Tween and activated ERK kinases detected using an antibody raised against phospho-ERK (anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK rabbit antibody from Cell Signalling Technology, cat #9101), and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>Sequence data have been deposited in European Nucleotide Archive under the accessions HF565448 (<italic>axeB</italic> genomic sequence) and ERP002043 (whole-genome resequencing reads).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the Medical Research Council (MC_U105115237).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript describes the identification of the major genetic switch that prevents natural isolates of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (i.e. wild type, WT) to survive and proliferate by drinking their environment via macropinocytosis. Mutations that incapacitate the protein encoded by the <italic>axeB</italic> gene, an evolutionarily conserved Ras-GAP that is closely related to the human tumour suppressor NF1, leads to oversized ruffles that renders the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> strains axenic. Since <italic>axeB</italic> mutants contain exaggerated macropinosomes, as evidenced by the use by various reporters of active Ras signaling, the authors conclude that the main function of NF1 is to restrict Ras activity at the flanks of the nascent macropinosomes (and related the phagosomes).</p><p>Major criticisms:</p><p>1) It is unclear whether only mutations of NF1 that impact the Ras-GAP activity lead to the axenic phenotype, or are mutations in other domains of this complex protein that do not affect Ras-GAP activity also uncoupling feeding from phagocytosis? Moreover, the data (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) show that WT cells do not accumulate fluid phase tracers, and you conclude that the rate of uptake is reduced; is the lack of tracer accumulation in axenic mutants due to slower uptake, faster efflux, lack of concentration, or all three?</p><p>2) The substrate specificity of the NF1 Ras-GAP is not explored in vitro (and not so directly in vivo), and the experiments based on expression of various Ras mutants do not replace biochemical evidence. You could make this a strong paper by demonstrating that the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> NF1 is a true RasGAP acting on one of the Ras proteins involved in macropinocytosis using recombinant proteins in vitro. You have all necessary genes at hand and RasGAP assays can be easily performed with available assays using radioactivity, HPLC, fluorescence or phosphate binding reporters. Alternatively, you could approach this using genetics by investigating the localization of NF1-AS in single or double mutants lacking RasS or RasG. In case the NF1 does not localize in the mutants it is likely that other, as yet uncharacterized Ras proteins are involved.</p><p>3) If dissection of the core functions of NF1 in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> contributes to understanding of the conserved functions of the human NF1 tumor suppressor, then complementation experiments with human NF1 in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> axenic strains is an easy way to support this claim.</p><p>4) The argument in the Discussion section explaining the lack of localization of NF1-WT in <italic>axeB</italic> mutants is difficult to understand as there is no evidence that over-expression of active NF1 leads to loss of macropinosomes. Shouldn't cells lacking macropinosomes die in liquid medium?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Neurofibromin controls macropinocytosis and phagocytosis in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor), a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that you need to make a few changes to the text, but no further experiments are necessary. You were not able to assay RasGAP activity due to the inability to purify a soluble NF1 fragment. It is therefore risky to call the protein a RasGAP at this point without biochemical evidence. A reviewer noted that he/she recalled a similar scenario for the IQGAPs, which based on a similar degree of sequence similarity, were claimed to be RasGAPs. Biochemical assays however later showed that these proteins lack RasGAP activity. The reviewers therefore suggest relativizing this notion. Why not call it a putative RasGAP, or state that it most likely represents a RasGAP?</p><p>You were unable to show localization of the NF1-probe in the respective Ras-null mutants. Thus, you employed the pan Ras-probe (Raf1-GBD) to show active Ras in macropinosomes in single Ras mutants. From these results you conclude that RasS and RasG act redundantly (and most likely as substrates for NF1). The reviewers felt that you jumped to the conclusion at this point for the following reasons. We do not know whether the Raf1-GBD probe would localize in the RasS/RasG double Ras-null mutant. If this was not the case, then they are apparently right, but if it still does, then it is likely that additional Ras proteins are involved. They suggest rephrasing this part accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04940.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It is unclear whether only mutations of NF1 that impact the Ras-GAP activity lead to the axenic phenotype, or are mutations in other domains of this complex protein that do not affect Ras-GAP activity also uncoupling feeding from phagocytosis</italic>?</p><p>We know of one mutation outside of the GAP domain that leads to the null phenotype: an inversion mutation that results in eight consecutive amino acid changes towards the C-terminus. This is described in the text and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Supporting this, we find that an expression construct truncating the protein before the RasGAP domain after the PH-like domain does not inhibit growth (these data now incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We plan to investigate structure-functional aspects of <italic>Dd</italic> NF1 in a future paper.</p><p><italic>Moreover, the data (e.g.,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>) show that WT cells do not accumulate fluid phase tracers, and you conclude that the rate of uptake is reduced; is the lack of tracer accumulation in axenic mutants due to slower uptake, faster efflux, lack of concentration, or all three</italic>?</p><p>We showed in the original manuscript that wildtype (WT) cells form macropinosomes less frequently than NF1 mutants, and that their macropinosomes are smaller, suggesting a primary effect of the NF1 mutation on the rate of fluid uptake. To test this further, we have measured the initial rate of fluid uptake at the shortest times practicable (set by the need for a signal above noise) and find, as expected, that uptake by the wildtype is much slower than NF1 mutants; uptake is linear at these short times arguing against the existence of a fast-recycling compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). Final imaging of WT cells grown axenically in the presence of serum showed that they are able to concentrate ingested fluid effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). Our model remains that WT cells ingest lower volumes of fluid than mutants, and so their growth is arrested by the conventional starvation response unless high levels of nutrients are present (as supplied by HL5 medium with 10% FBS). We have altered the text to make these points clearer.</p><p><italic>2) The substrate specificity of the NF1 Ras-GAP is not explored in vitro (and not so directly in vivo), and the experiments based on expression of various Ras mutants do not replace biochemical evidence. You could make this a strong paper by demonstrating that the</italic> Dictyostelium <italic>NF1 is a true RasGAP acting on one of the Ras proteins involved in macropinocytosis using recombinant proteins in vitro. You have all necessary genes at hand and RasGAP assays can be easily performed with available assays using radioactivity, HPLC, fluorescence or phosphate binding reporters.

In case the NF1 does not localize in the mutants it is likely that other, as yet uncharacterized Ras proteins are involved.</italic></p><p>We agree that a better knowledge of which Ras proteins are substrates for <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> NF1 would strengthen our paper. While we regard the genetic and homology evidence that NF1 is a RasGAP as compelling, determining which Ras proteins are its substrates has been fraught with difficulty. We had already been attempting to express and purify NF1 fragments for biochemical assays for several months prior to submission of our manuscript, but met with difficulties at every stage, and have so far been unable to purify soluble recombinant protein. Experiments to investigate the localisation of our NF1-AS reporter in mutants lacking different Ras proteins were also unsuccessful because the reporter does not localise in the Ax2 (and AX3) backgrounds where these mutants are available. We note that both RasG and RasS mutants are both partially defective in macropinocytosis and yet the Raf1-RBD reporter still localises to nascent macropinosomes in both strains. This suggests that both RasG and RasS are involved in macropinocytosis (and likely substrates for NF1), but act redundantly.</p><p><italic>3) If dissection of the core functions of NF1 in</italic> Dictyostelium <italic>contributes to understanding of the conserved functions of the human NF1 tumor suppressor, then complementation experiments with human NF1 in</italic> Dictyostelium <italic>axenic strains is an easy way to support this claim.</italic></p><p>We agree that complementation of the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> NF1 mutant with the human protein is a most desirable experiment. Although we have had success with the highly conserved SBDS protein in the past, the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> NF1 is less well conserved (although the clear orthologue of the human protein) and we doubted that NF1 protein of one species would interact sufficiently well with the orthologous binding partners to achieve full complementation. Nevertheless, we engineered a construct to express GFP-tagged full length human NF1, with the codons optimized for <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Expression of this construct did indeed strongly reduce axenic growth of the NF1 mutant; unfortunately, so did a version in which the catalytic arginine residue of the GAP domain was changed to alanine. This experiment will be followed up in various ways but in the meantime we feel it is too difficult to interpret to merit inclusion in the body of the paper. Despite the evolutionary distance between <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and humans, we firmly expect that determination of the basal function of NF1 in cellular contexts closely resembling those in which it first evolved (as we argue from our phylogenetic analysis) will deepen our understanding of its function in metazoan cells.</p><p><italic>4) The argument in the Discussion section explaining the lack of localization of NF1-WT in axeB mutants is difficult to understand as there is no evidence that over-expression of active NF1 leads to loss of macropinosomes. Shouldn't cells lacking macropinosomes die in liquid medium</italic>?</p><p>We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> that expression of the wildtype NF1 protein in the <italic>axeB</italic> mutant strongly reduces growth in axenic medium. We have now quantified macropinosome uptake to substantiate this aspect of the phenotype: uptake of macropinosomes is almost completely abolished, and this reporter always appears to have an even cytosolic distribution. We have clarified the text accordingly.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>All reviewers agreed that you need to make a few changes to the text, but no further experiments are necessary.

We have addressed this by amending the unfortunate construction of the final sentence of the Introduction, and further clarifying the paragraph in the Discussion that outlines the evidence for the specific involvement of Ras subfamily proteins in the phenomena of interest. I should note also that we have reverted to the more usual 'PI3K' as the abbreviation for 'phosphoinositide 3'-kinase' at the insistence of the senior author.</p></body></sub-article></article>
