the role of fatty acids (FAs) remains poorly understood. Recent studies unraveled Mtb’s capacity to acquire saturated and monounsaturated FAs via the Mce1 importer. However, upon activation, macrophages produce polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), mammal-specific FAs mediating the generation of immunomodulatory eicosanoids. Here, we asked how Mtb modulates de novo synthesis of PUFAs in primary mouse macrophages and whether this benefits host or pathogen. Quantitative lipidomics revealed that Mtb infection selectively activates the biosynthesis of ω6 PUFAs upstream of the eicosanoid precursor arachidonic acid (AA) via transcriptional activation of <italic>Fads2</italic>. Inhibiting FADS2 in infected macrophages impaired their inflammatory and antimicrobial responses but had no effect on Mtb growth in host cells nor mice. Using a click-chemistry approach, we found that Mtb efficiently imports ω6 PUFAs via Mce1 in axenic culture, including AA. Further, Mtb preferentially internalized AA over all other FAs within infected macrophages by mechanisms partially depending on Mce1 and supporting intracellular persistence. Notably, IFNγ repressed de novo synthesis of AA by infected mouse macrophages and restricted AA import by intracellular Mtb. Together, these findings identify AA as a major FA substrate for intracellular Mtb, whose mobilization by innate immune responses is opportunistically hijacked by the pathogen and downregulated by IFNγ.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>fatty acids</kwd><kwd>immunomodulation</kwd><kwd>nutrient</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4th-year PhD scholarship from the FRM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laval</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012948</institution-id><institution>Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur, de la Recherche et de l'Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3 year PhD scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laval</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003762</institution-id><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demangel</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003762</institution-id><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3 year doctoral scholarship, Pasteur-Paris University International Doctoral Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pedró-Cos</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> triggers de novo synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids by host macrophages, which promote their antimicrobial responses but feed the intracellular pathogen.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), the causative agent of human tuberculosis (TB), caused 1.6 million deaths in 2017, and it is estimated that 23% of the world’s population has a latent TB infection. This success is due to Mtb evolving sophisticated strategies to survive intracellularly in macrophages, its preferred habitat, for long periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bussi and Gutierrez, 2019</xref>). In particular, Mtb’s capacity to import and metabolize host-derived lipids, including fatty acids (FAs) and cholesterol, contributes to long-term persistence in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nazarova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nazarova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pandey and Sassetti, 2008</xref>). At the macrophage level, Mtb infection triggers the formation of lipid droplets (LDs) whose FA content was proposed to serve as a nutrient source for intracellular Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daniel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). However, this view was challenged by a recent study showing that the IFNγ cytokine promotes LD accumulation by Mtb-infected macrophages while impairing the pathogen’s capacity to acquire host-derived FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knight et al., 2018</xref>). Whether Mtb infection and IFNγ signaling differentially impact on subcellular localization and dynamic redistribution of host FAs is largely unknown.</p><p>Mtb was shown to import fluorescently labeled saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (SFAs and MUFAs, respectively) via a dedicated protein machinery named Mce1, which is coordinated with Mce4-mediated import of cholesterol and plays an important role in Mtb lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Laval et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nazarova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nazarova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilburn et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to SFAs and MUFAs, mammalian cells produce the additional subset of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), whose secondary metabolites shape macrophage effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dennis and Norris, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mayer-Barber and Sher, 2015</xref>). In particular, the catabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) by cyclooxygenases (COX) and lipoxygenases (LOX) yields prostaglandins and lipoxins/leukotrienes, products referred to as eicosanoids that are important signaling molecules modulating inflammation and apoptosis. Interestingly, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induce signal-specific reprogramming of FA synthesis in macrophages, with differential impact on antibacterial immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hsieh et al., 2020</xref>). How Mtb-driven stimulation of TLRs reprograms PUFA and eicosanoid biosynthesis by host macrophages, and whether this promotes anti-mycobacterial immune responses remained to be determined.</p><p>Here, we combined quantitative lipidomics with genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition approaches to assess the importance of the PUFA biosynthetic pathway in innate control of Mtb infection by macrophages. While PUFA biosynthesis contributed to the generation of inflammatory and antimicrobial responses in infected macrophages, its stimulatory effect on macrophage effector functions was not matched by an enhanced capacity to restrict intracellular Mtb infection. This led us to propose that newly generated PUFAs may serve as FA sources for intracellular Mtb. Our in vitro and cellular assays using traceable alkyne-FAs supported this hypothesis by showing that Mtb efficiently internalizes ω6 PUFAs in axenic cultures, and preferentially the eicosanoid precursor AA within macrophages. They also indicated that <italic>in cellulo</italic>, Mce1 partially contributes to Mtb’s uptake of AA and supports intracellular persistence of the pathogen at late stages of infection. Together, our findings reveal the pro-inflammatory function of the PUFA biosynthetic pathway during Mtb infection and identify AA as a major FA source for intracellular Mtb. They support the view that Mtb draws on intracellular free AA generated by infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mtb infection stimulates the biosynthesis of SFAs, MUFAs, and upstream PUFAs by host macrophages</title><p>Mtb’s impact on host FA metabolism was investigated by infecting bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), extracting total and free cellular FAs, and quantifying each FA species by gas chromatography, with normalization to total DNA. Mtb triggered a significant increase in intracellular levels of free SFA palmitic acid (PA) and MUFAs (oleic acid [OA] and vaccenic acid [VA]) after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). With regard to PUFAs, we detected an increased level of the ω6 precursor linoleic acid (LA) that was associated with elevated levels of its conversion product dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), but not the DGLA product AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). On the ω3 PUFA side, α-linolenic acid (ALA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were below detection limit, and the low levels of long-chain ω3 PUFAs docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were not modulated by Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Infection-driven variations in free FA levels were associated with parallel trends in total FA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These changes were not specific of the Mtb pathogen as BMDM infection with the <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG vaccine induced comparable FA profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and they were no longer observed 48 hr post infection.

Conversion of ω6 and ω3 PUFA precursors into downstream PUFAs is jointly controlled by three enzymes: the FA desaturases (FADS)1 and FADS2, and the elongase ELOVL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>Fads1</italic> and <italic>Elovl5</italic> transcript levels were transiently repressed at 6hr post infection with Mtb, while on the opposite those of <italic>Fads2</italic> were increased from 6hr until 24hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The inverse regulation of <italic>Fads1</italic>/<italic>Elovl5,</italic> compared to <italic>Fasn</italic>/<italic>Fads2</italic>, at 6hr post infection with Mtb was surprising since all genes are targets of the LXR and SREBP1 regulators of FA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daemen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Joseph et al., 2002</xref>).

After 24 hr of infection, Mtb’s uptake of PA, OA, LA, and EPA was comparable in resting and IFNγ-activated BMDMs. However, bacterial import of AA was significantly decreased by IFNγ priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). It is interesting to note that increased uptake of AA by intracellular Mtb correlated with a relatively higher internalization of this FA by host macrophages, irrespective of Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Similar differences in cellular and bacterial uptake of PA and AA were observed in human THP-1 macrophages (data not shown). This finding suggested that it is the intracellular bioavailability of AA that determines its import by Mtb, rather than intrinsic bacterial factors.</p><p>Finally, we assessed the role of Mce1 in PUFA uptake by intracellular Mtb using GFP-expressing versions of Mtb <italic>Δmce1D</italic> and <italic>Δmce1D::comp</italic>. In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nazarova et al., 2019</xref>), Mtb’s import of PA and OA was decreased by approximately 40% in the absence of Mce1D and restored by gene complementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Mtb’s import of LA and AA was also reduced by <italic>mce1D</italic> gene knockout, but to lower levels compared to PA and OA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To determine if bacterial import of FAs via Mce1D impacts the host immune response to infection, we compared the growth of <italic>Δmce1D</italic>, WT, and complemented Mtb strains in BMDMs. Although all strains displayed comparable intracellular growth during the first 3 days of BMDM infection (corresponding to the timeframe used in other experiments in this study), that of the <italic>Δmce1D</italic> mutant significantly decelerated after 6 days compared to WT and complemented strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We then asked whether this growth defect correlated with a differential eicosanoid profile by comparing the levels of AA metabolites produced by BMDMs infected with WT and <italic>Δmce1D</italic> Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Compared to WT Mtb, <italic>Δmce1D</italic> Mtb induced less COX-derived PGE2 and TXB2 and more LOX-derived 15-HETE and LXA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), an eicosanoid profile that is considered pro-mycobacterial. Furthermore, transcriptional induction of key inflammatory genes including <italic>Pgts2</italic> was significantly downregulated in macrophages infected with <italic>Δmce1D</italic> Mtb for 24 hr, compared to WT and complemented Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These findings are consistent with the defective pro-inflammatory responses of macrophages exposed to cell wall lipids of an Mtb strain disrupted in the <italic>mce1</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petrilli et al., 2020</xref>). Together, our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> revealed that in the context of macrophages Mtb preferentially imports AA over other host-derived FAs via mechanisms partially depending on the Mce1 transporter. They argue against eicosanoid production being limited by Mtb’s capture of their AA precursor. Rather, they support the view that infection-induced mobilization of AA is opportunistically hijacked by Mtb to support intracellular growth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we show that ω6 PUFAs, a host-specific subset of FAs, can be imported by Mtb via the Mce1 transporter. Our findings are consistent with previous observations that radiolabeled LA and ALA were incorporated into cell wall lipids of Mtb grown under axenic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Morbidoni et al., 2006</xref>), and that AA used as a sole carbon source was able to support Mtb growth in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forrellad et al., 2014</xref>). ω6 PUFAs were imported as efficiently as MUFAs and competed with MUFAs for Mce1-mediated import in Mtb. This suggests that MUFAs and ω6 PUFAs share the same binding site on the Mce1 transporter or use a common accessory FA-binding protein that directs these FAs to the Mce1 transporter. Based on Mce1 gene inactivation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nazarova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilburn et al., 2018</xref>), Mce1A-F proteins are believed to form a channel recognizing FA substrates and shuttling them across the mycobacterial cell wall to deliver them to the putative YrbE1A/B permeases embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane. Our observation that mutations in the <italic>mce1D</italic> and <italic>yrbE1A</italic> genes reduce Mtb’s import of PUFAs by more than 80% in vitro supports the view that these proteins play a critical role in recognition and internalization of PUFAs, similar to SFAs and MUFAs. In comparison to all other FAs, ω3 EPA and DHA were poorly internalized by Mtb in vitro. However, Mtb’s uptake of ω3 PUFAs also depended on Mce1 in axenic cultures. The distinctive conformational properties of natural, <italic>cis</italic> ω3 PUFAs, such as high flexibility, may account for a lower affinity for the Mce1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chu and Wang, 2014</xref>). Notably, OA, LA, and AA competed with each other for transport by Mce1, but none of these FAs did compete with PA. This suggests that Mce1 displays at least two distinct FA-binding sites specialized in recognition of SFAs and MUFAs/PUFAs, respectively, a property that may help Mtb optimize the uptake of host-derived FAs during infection.</p><p>Our lipidomic analyses demonstrated that Mtb infection triggers an increase in intracellular levels of free SFAs and MUFAs preceded by an upregulation of <italic>Fasn</italic> gene expression in host macrophages. We also observed that Mtb represses the expression of <italic>Pparg</italic> and several PPARγ gene targets involved in FA catabolism (<italic>Cpt1a</italic>, <italic>Acox3</italic>, <italic>Lipa</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), which may further promote free SFA and MUFA accumulation in infected macrophages. Recent studies have identified the MyD88 signaling pathway as a major driver of SFA and MUFA metabolism reprogramming in TLR2/4-stimulated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hsieh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oishi et al., 2017</xref>). Cellular levels of SFAs and MUFAs were increased in BMDMs stimulated with TLR2 or TLR4 agonists, supporting the hypothesis that recognition of Mtb pattern by these receptors triggers SFA and MUFA biosynthesis. Likewise, total and free LA levels were upregulated by Mtb or TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation, suggesting an enhanced uptake of this essential ω6 PUFA precursor by host macrophages upon infection.</p><p>While de novo synthesis of SFAs and MUFAs was globally upregulated by Mtb, the early PUFA biosynthetic pathway was stimulated through upregulation of <italic>Fads2</italic> gene expression but repressed at the level of FADS1. These findings are corroborated by a recent lipidomic study that detected a comparable blockade in long PUFA production by BMDMs stimulated with TLR2 or TLR4 agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hsieh et al., 2020</xref>). Despite a decreased biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), free and total AA levels were stable in Mtb-infected BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), implying that AA is mobilized from other sources to meet the cell’s demands. Our studies of FA-pulsed BMDMs indicated that macrophages import exogenous AA with a particularly high efficacy compared to other FAs. Importantly, IFNγ priming of Mtb-infected macrophages fully blocked PUFA biosynthesis by downregulating <italic>Fads2</italic> gene expression. In addition, IFNγ selectively restricted AA import by intracellular Mtb, suggesting that IFNγ signaling activates several mechanisms preventing the pathogen from hijacking this FA.</p><p>An important new discovery was that Mtb imports AA at significantly higher levels, compared to all other tested FAs, in pulsed macrophages. In agreement with previous work by Nazarova et al. using macrophages pulsed with Bodipy-PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nazarova et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>mce1D</italic> contributed to about 40% of total PA uptake by intracellular Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In comparison, <italic>mce1D</italic> deficiency had a lower effect on the uptake of ω6 PUFAs, especially AA. Our observation that the differential uptake of PA and AA by intracellular Mtb correlates with the relative abundance of these FAs in the macrophage cytosol suggests that FA uptake by intracellular Mtb is primarily determined by their local bioavailability. Aside from Mce1, which transporters mediate host FA uptake by intracellular Mtb remains to be determined. Interestingly, intracellular persistence of the <italic>mce1D</italic> mutant of Mtb in macrophages was impaired at late stage of infection. This was not due to the generation of better anti-mycobacterial responses in host macrophages as compared to WT Mtb as the <italic>Δmce1D</italic> mutant was a less good inducer of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines in infected macrophages. Together with our observation that exogenous AA is superiorly imported by macrophages compared to other FAs, these findings support the view that Mce1-mediated import of AA plays an important role in Mtb survival within macrophages.</p><p>The AA pathway has recently emerged as a potential target of host-directed therapeutic strategies for TB. While the pro-inflammatory action of eicosanoids is beneficial to the host at early stages of infection by promoting the intracellular killing of Mtb via induction of TNFα in infected macrophages, it may drive immunopathology at later stages of disease (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Young et al., 2020</xref>). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibiting COX activity are being evaluated in humans as adjunctive therapies to standard TB treatments, with the rationale to limit inflammation-induced tissue pathology. In our study, transcriptional repression of <italic>Fads1</italic> in Mtb-infected macrophages did not prevent the production of AA-derived secondary metabolites, especially the pro-inflammatory COX products PGE2, PGD2, and TXB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Inhibiting FADS2 had a global anti-inflammatory effect during Mtb infection both in vitro and in vivo, which was associated with induction of a pro-mycobacterial eicosanoid profile in infected macrophages. Therefore, iFADS2 may increase the efficacy of COX inhibitors in immunopathological conditions, while depriving Mtb of additional FA sources.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>All solvents for lipid extractions, antibiotics, Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (FA-free BSA), ethyleneglycol- bis(β-aminoethyl)-N,N,Nʹ,Nʹ-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), methylcellulose (Methocel A4M), tyloxapol, Tween 20, and Triton X-100 were from Sigma-Aldrich.

At 1- or 3 days post infection, 5 µM of alkyne-FAs pre-conjugated to 1% FA-free BSA was added to the cells for 1 hr. This pulse was followed by a 1 hr chase in DMEM with 10% complete FBS. BMDMs were harvested, fixed in 4% PFA, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS before staining by click reaction as described above and FACS analysis. For the analysis of FA uptake by intra-phagosomal bacteria, these were isolated using a previously described procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nazarova et al., 2018</xref>). After two washes in PBS-0.05% tyloxapol and one wash in Wash Buffer, isolated bacteria were fixed in 4% PFA. Fixed bacteria were then permeabilized by incubation with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and a click reaction was performed as described above. Stained bacteria were washed three times in ice-cold Wash Buffer and resuspended in 7H9 plus 0.85 g/L NaCl and 0.05% tyloxapol. Flow cytometry data were collected on a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using FlowJo software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>FA quantification by gas chromatography</title><p>BMDMs monolayers cultured in 100 mm cell culture dishes (7–9 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per dish) were infected as described above at a MOI of 2:1 with mycobacteria or treated with 100 ng/mL of LPS or Pam3Csk4. At indicated time points, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS (without Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and harvested in ice-cold methanol/5 mM EGTA (2:1 v/v). For normalization, cellular DNA content was determined using the Quant-iT dsDNA Assay Kit as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dennis et al., 2010</xref>). Respectively 75%/25% of the sample was used for free/total FA extraction using heptadecanoic acid/glyceryl triheptadecanoate (Sigma-Aldrich) as internal standards. Lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bligh and Dyer, 1959</xref>) in dichloromethane/methanol/water (2.5:2.5:2, v/v/v), doped with 2 µg of suitable internal standard. After vortex and centrifugation at 2000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, the organic phase was dried under nitrogen and, for free FAs, directly trans-methylated with 1 mL of 14% boron trifluoride (BF3) in methanol and 1 mL of heptane for 5 min at room temperature. Total FAs were first hydrolyzed with 0.5 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) in methanol for 30 min at 50°C and trans-methylated in BF3-methanol plus heptane for 1 hr at 80°C. Methylated free FAs were extracted with hexane/water (3:1) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stuani et al., 2018</xref>), dried and dissolved in ethyl acetate. 1 µL of methylated free or total FAs was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) on a Clarus 600 Perkin Elmer system using FAMEWAX RESTEK fused silica capillary columns (30 m × 0.32 mm, 0.25 µm film thickness). Oven temperature was programmed from 110°C to 220°C at a rate of 2°C/min, and the carrier gas was hydrogen (0.5 bar). Injector and detector temperatures were set at 225 and 245°C, respectively. Peak detection and integration analysis were done using Azur software. FAs were quantified by measuring their area under the peak and normalizing to the internal standard. These quantities were then normalized by cellular DNA content.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>FADS2 activity assay</title><p>FADS2-mediated bioconversion of deuterated PUFAs was assessed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Varin et al., 2015</xref>). For BMDMs, resting or IFNγ-primed macrophages were treated with 5 µM of iFADS2 or vehicle control, and infected with Mtb as described above for 6 hr before addition of 4 µM LA-d11 pre-conjugated to FA-free BSA to the cell culture media. To check FADS2 knockout, THP-1 monocytes (6.10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL) were cultured in THP-1 media supplemented with 4 µM ALA-d14 pre-conjugated to FA-free BSA. In all cases, after an incubation of 18 hr (BMDM) or 24 hr (THP-1) with the deuterated PUFA, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS. BMDMs were harvested in ice-cold methanol/5 mM EGTA (2:1 v/v), while THP-1 were centrifuged and dry pellets were stored at –80°C. Lipids were extracted as described above, total FAs were hydrolyzed with KOH (0.5 M in methanol) at 50°C for 30 min, and derivatized for 20 min at room temperature with 1% pentafluorobenzyl-bromide and 1% diisopropylethylamine in acetonitrile as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stuani et al., 2018</xref>).

Oven temperature was programmed as follows: 150°C for 1 min, 8°C/min to 350°C, then the temperature is kept constant for 2 min. The carrier gas was helium (0.8 mL/min). The injector, the transfer line, and the ion source temperature were set at 250, 330, and 300°C, respectively. Ionization was operated in negative ionization mode (methane at 1 mL/min) in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode and 1 µL of sample was injected in splitless mode. The abundance of each fatty acid and their isotopologue containing 11 or 14 deuterium were obtained by integrating gas chromatographic signals using Trace Finder software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Lipid mediator profiling</title><p>For lipid inflammatory mediators analysis, resting or IFNγ-primed BMDMs monolayers cultured in 6-well plates were infected with Mtb at a MOI of 2:1.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bavesh Kana as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Helena Boshoff (Reviewer #1); Frederick J Sheedy (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1. It has been demonstrated that interferon-γ stimulation of macrophages drives lipid droplet formation and affects the availability of fatty acids derived from these lipid droplet to Mtb residing in the macrophage (doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006874). Based on this, the authors should investigate if IFN-γ stimulation affects the biosynthesis of the fatty acids (for example PA and DGLA) in infected macrophages? Further, does IFN-γ stimulation affect acquisition by Mtb of newly synthesized fatty acids (eg. Arachidonic acid) from the host macrophage?</p><p>2. The lack of an effect with Fads2 inhibition on Mtb growth in macrophages and mice is perhaps surprising. It is the balance of eicosanoids (eg PGE2 versus LXA4 levels) that determines the outcome on macrophage membrane repair (and other effects in the context of an intact immune system in vivo – doi: 10.1038/ni.1758). An analysis of apoptosis versus necrosis in the BMDM model with or without FADS2 inhibition seems practically feasible to do and would provide important information regarding the effects of the FADS2 inhibitor on eicosanoid dysregulation in this system.</p><p>3. IFN-γ stimulation has a considerable effect on Cox2 expression and eicosanoid production in infected macrophages (doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1600266). The authors should address the question of whether Fads2 inhibition in the context of IFN-γ stimulation affects Mtb survival in the macrophages?</p><p>4. A key experiment uses a specific inhibitor of Fads2 and monitors AA production from labelled exogenous Linoleic Acid. The finding that AA levels are decreased with increasing amounts of inhibitor are used to argue that this inhibitor is specific, but also that endogenous AA is generated from PUFA progenitors (Linoleic Acid and the intermediate, DGCA) during Mtb infection, despite a repression observed in the later desaturase enzyme, FADS1. However, to convincingly demonstrate this, this experiment should be repeated during Mtb infection. Although it is likely that control levels of AA may be low (given the role for AA import in bacterial growth), any differences with increasing amounts of inhibitor would support that this pathway is active during infection and can be targeted. An alternative approach would be to profile Fatty Acids in the same way as before, but after pre-treatment of Mtb-infected BMDM with the FADS2 inhibitor to show effects on Linoleic Acid, DGCA and AA production. This could be particularly interesting, or could be compounded by, the fact that FADS2 may also regulate the generation of Linoleic Acid from Oleic Acid to start with.</p><p>5. Striking effects are observed with the host response when FADS2 is targeted. Although various eicosanoid levels are decreased, which would argue that AA levels are reduced with inhibition, a profound global effect is observed on anti-microbial and inflammatory gene expression, including COX-2, an important upstream regulator of AA and eicosanoids. The observed effects on eicosanoid levels could be due to a broader effect on immune-responsive gene expression, which could be due to other &quot;moon-lighting&quot; roles for some of the PUFA pathway metabolites (LA, DGCA) or the enzymes (FADS2) themselves. Is this profound effect being phenocopied by the siRNA or CRISPR-deletion? This would strengthen the manuscript. What is the effect on eicosanoid production in these models and what happens the induction of inflammatory or anti-microbial genes?</p><p>6. The authors generate a novel bacterial strain in which import of AA is inhibited. However, the subsequent effect of this on bacterial growth in macrophages (by CFU plating) is not performed and could help delineate the various roles played by AA – as a bacterial nutrient or a host immunomodulatory signal. Side by side comparison of growth of the Mce1d mutant and wild-type Mtb strains in BMDM is required, as well as an examination of whether this has an effect on eicosanoid production and inflammatory/anti-microbial gene expression. This would clearly demonstrate competition between host and pathogen for AA, which could determine the outcome of the immune response.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Interferon-γ stimulation of macrophages drives lipid droplet formation and affects the availability of fatty acids derived from these lipid droplet to Mtb residing in the macrophage (doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006874).

How these 2 pathways diverge needs to be examined further and can easily be demonstrated using some of the established tools available.</p><p>1) The authors examine the importance Fatty Acid Desaturase-2 (FADS2), a key enzyme in the PUFA metabolism pathway, which is upregulated after Mtb infection and promotes the generation of Arachidonic Acid from Linoleic Acid. A key experiment uses a specific inhibitor of this enzyme and monitors AA production from labelled exogenous Linoleic Acid. The finding that AA levels are decreased with increasing amounts of inhibitor are used to argue that this inhibitor is specific, but also that endogenous AA is generated from PUFA progenitors (Linoleic Acid and the intermediate, DGCA) during Mtb infection, despite a repression observed in the later desaturase enzyme, FADS1.

The authors generate a novel bacterial strain in which import of AA is inhibited. However, the subsequent effect of this on bacterial growth in macrophages (by CFU plating) is not performed and could help delineate the various roles played by AA – as a bacterial nutrient or a host immunomodulatory signal.

A major aspect of this study is the use of click chemistry to demonstrate uptake of AA by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> from the host during macrophage infection. However, it is well known that tuberculosis imports host fatty acids generally, and furthermore the fact that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> imports AA during macrophage infection was demonstrated in a previous publication (PMID: 10931146). Simply demonstrating uptake of specific FAs from the host does not advance our understanding of pathogenesis without mechanistic implications of this import being described.</p><p>2. One of the main conclusions of the manuscript is that AA is preferentially imported by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> relative to other FAs in the host. The authors own data demonstrate that labeled AA is taken up by macrophages more readily than palmitate (the only other FA evaluated), suggesting that the purported preference for AA by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> simply reflects abundance. The significance of this finding is unclear.</p><p>3. Treatment of mice and macrophages with an inhibitor of FADS2 showed no impact on the outcome of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. The speculation that a pro-mycobacterial usage of PUFAs as nutrient sources by the bacteria masks the importance of AA synthesis by FADS2 for innate immunity is implausible and not substantiated by the data.</p><p>4. The authors claim that import of FAs by the bacteria equates to the utilization of the FA as a carbon source, however this is not necessarily that case. They would need to demonstrate metabolism of the FAs by the bacteria to make this claim.</p><p>5. The significance of the FA competition experiment is unclear and seems unrelated to the rest of the data in the manuscript.</p><p>6. In Figure 5, the requirement for Mce1 for uptake of AA from macrophages is different using the different assays of 5E (flow cytometry) and 5F (microscopy). Can the authors explain this discrepancy?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71946.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1.

Arachidonic acid) from the host macrophage?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we studied the effect of IFNγ stimulation on biosynthesis of FAs by Mtb-infected macrophages. New results are reported p.6, as follows:</p><p>“Macrophage ability to mount efficient anti-Mtb responses relies on their activation by the Th1 cell-derived cytokine IFNγ, recently shown to limit host FA intake by intracellular Mtb (Knight et al., 2018). We thus sought to determine if IFNγ modulates FA biosynthesis by infected macrophages. Stimulating BMDMs with IFNγ prior to infection prevented Mtb-induced expression of <italic>Fasn</italic> and <italic>Scd2</italic> (Figure 2A and 2C), suggesting that IFNγ limits de novo synthesis of SFAs and MUFAs by infected macrophages. The effect of IFNγ on PUFA biosynthetic enzymes was more complex, as the cytokine mitigated both the inhibitory effect of Mtb infection on <italic>Elovl5</italic> and <italic>Fads1</italic> gene expression after 6h, and its stimulatory effect on <italic>Fads2</italic> gene expression (Figure 2C). IFNγ-induced decrease in <italic>Fasn</italic> and <italic>Fads2</italic> expression correlated with reduced <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Dhcr24</italic> transcript levels after 6h of infection (Figure 2D), suggesting that IFNγ prevents Mtb-induced stimulation of FA biosynthesis through downregulation of LXR and SREBP1 activity.</p><p>To assess the effect of such transcriptional changes on PUFA biosynthesis, we quantified macrophage’s ability to convert a deuterated derivative of the ω6 precursor LA into downstream products upon infection with Mtb, with or without IFNγ priming, between 6 and 24h post-infection. All ω6 intermediates (i.e. 20:2-d11, DGLA-d11 and AA-d11) were quantified, allowing us to measure the activity of each enzyme of the PUFA biosynthetic pathway via product to substrate ratios (Figure 3A). The measured percentages of each ω6 PUFA, relative to total deuterated FA, are also shown in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1A. FADS2 activity was not modulated by Mtb in the conditions of the experiment, suggesting that infection-induced upregulation of <italic>Fads2</italic> expression (Figure 2C) takes more than 24h to translate into enhanced enzyme activity. In contrast, decreased <italic>Fads1</italic> expression at 6h post-infection (Figure 2C) correlated with a marked reduction of FADS1-mediated conversion of DGLA in AA (Figure 3A), irrespective of IFNγ stimulation. Likewise, IFNγ-driven repression of <italic>Fads2</italic> gene expression in Mtb-infected BMDMs (Figure 2C) resulted in potent suppression of FADS2 activity (Figure 3A). Neither Mtb infection nor IFNγ stimulation affected the activity of ELOVL5. Therefore, the partial upregulation of the PUFA biosynthetic pathway that we observed in Mtb-infected macrophages is abrogated by cell exposure to IFNγ. In all, these results indicated that IFNγ shuts down the biosynthesis of all FAs in Mtb-infected macrophages.”</p><p>We also performed additional experiments to determine if IFNγ stimulation affects the acquisition of host FAs by Mtb (p.11):</p><p>“Since IFNγ was previously shown to impair Mtb’s import of Bodipy-PA during macrophage infection (Knight et al., 2018), we tested if the cytokine also reduces Mtb’s uptake of other alkyne-FAs. After 24h of infection, Mtb’s uptake of PA, OA, LA and EPA was comparable in resting and IFNγ-activated BMDMs. However, bacterial import of AA was significantly decreased by IFNγ priming (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1C).”</p><p>Discrepancy between our findings and those reported by Knight et al. could be due to the fact that we quantified FA uptake at 24h post-infection (because FA uptake was higher at this timepoint, as shown in Figure 6A), while Knight and colleagues examined PA uptake at 72h post-infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The lack of an effect with Fads2 inhibition on Mtb growth in macrophages and mice is perhaps surprising. It is the balance of eicosanoids (eg PGE2 versus LXA4 levels) that determines the outcome on macrophage membrane repair (and other effects in the context of an intact immune system in vivo – doi: 10.1038/ni.1758). An analysis of apoptosis versus necrosis in the BMDM model with or without FADS2 inhibition seems practically feasible to do and would provide important information regarding the effects of the FADS2 inhibitor on eicosanoid dysregulation in this system.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this pertinent suggestion. The requested analysis was performed, and our revised manuscript now includes new information regarding the effects of the FADS2 inhibitor on eicosanoid dysregulation (p.8):</p><p>“PGE2 and LXA4 production by infected macrophages differentially influence the outcome of Mtb infection, promoting anti- or pro-mycobacterial responses via the induction of apoptotic or necrotic cell death, respectively (Chen et al., 2008; Divangahi et al., 2010; Mayer-Barber and Sher, 2015). Since iFADS2 treatment decreased Mtb-induced production of both PGE2 and LXA4 (Figure 3C and 3D), we tested how FADS2 inhibition affects the relative induction of apoptosis and necrosis in infected BMDMs (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1D). Cell apoptosis and expression of <italic>Syt7</italic>, which is involved in lysosome-mediated membrane repair, were both significantly downregulated by iFADS2 in Mtb-infected BMDMs, while necrosis levels remained unchanged (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1D-E). We concluded that by downregulating PGE2, iFADS2 impairs macrophage membrane repair and apoptosis during Mtb infection. These data supported the view that FADS2 activity favors the generation of an anti-mycobacterial eicosanoid profile.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In line with our transcriptomic data shown in Figure 2, this analysis demonstrates that infection with Mtb induces a decrease in biosynthesis of AA-d11, that is aggravated by pre-exposure of the cells to IFNγ. Contrary to 20:2-d11, neither DGLA-d11 nor AA-d11 could be detected when BMDMs were treated with iFADS2, irrespective of Mtb infection or IFNγ stimulation (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1A). Together, these data establish that (i) endogenous AA is generated from PUFA precursors during Mtb infection in both resting and IFNγ-activated macrophages and (ii) iFADS2 efficiently blocks residual de novo AA biosynthesis in Mtb-infected macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An alternative approach would be to profile Fatty Acids in the same way as before, but after pre-treatment of Mtb-infected BMDM with the FADS2 inhibitor to show effects on Linoleic Acid, DGCA and AA production. This could be particularly interesting, or could be compounded by, the fact that FADS2 may also regulate the generation of Linoleic Acid from Oleic Acid to start with.</p></disp-quote><p>FA analysis did not reveal significant differences in FADS2 product levels between iFADS2-treated and control BMDMs (data not shown), indicating that PUFAs downstream of FADS2 can be mobilized from other sources. Being deficient in δ 12 desaturase, mammalian cells are unable to convert OA into LA, which is therefore essential and must be imported from the extracellular medium (Lee <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016). However, mammalian macrophages have been shown to produce mead acid (20:3ω9) from OA (18:1ω9) when they are deprived of the essential precursors of PUFAs (i.e. LA and ALA). Oleic to mead acid conversion involves the enzymes FADS1, FADS2 and ELOVL5 (Ichi <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014). The method used in our study to profile FA levels did not allow to specifically quantify mead acid. Thus, we cannot exclude that BMDMs produce mead acid in the conditions used, and one would expect that this biosynthetic pathway is impaired by iFADS2 as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Striking effects are observed with the host response when FADS2 is targeted. Although various eicosanoid levels are decreased, which would argue that AA levels are reduced with inhibition, a profound global effect is observed on anti-microbial and inflammatory gene expression, including COX-2, an important upstream regulator of AA and eicosanoids. The observed effects on eicosanoid levels could be due to a broader effect on immune-responsive gene expression, which could be due to other &quot;moon-lighting&quot; roles for some of the PUFA pathway metabolites (LA, DGCA) or the enzymes (FADS2) themselves.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that repression of eicosanoid levels in iFADS2-treated cells could be due to other effects than just the decreased de novo synthesis of their AA precursor. As pointed out by the Reviewer, the decreased <italic>Ptgs2</italic> gene expression in iFADS2-treated BMDMs infected with Mtb may account for the observed decrease in PGE2 production. An additional sentence has been added in the relevant section of Results p.8 to acknowledge this possibility. It is interesting to note that BMDM production of 5-HETE was decreased by iFADS2 treatment after 24h of infection with Mtb (Figure 3D), despite the enhanced expression of <italic>Alox5</italic>, the gene encoding the 5-LOX enzyme that converts AA into 5-HETE (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This result suggests that it is the lack of de novo synthesized AA that causes the drop in 5-LOX products in FADS2-inhibited macrophages (Figure 3D).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Relative mRNA expression of <italic>Alox5</italic> in Mtb-infected BMDMs treated as in Figure 3C, as determined by Nanostring analysis.</title><p>Data are means +/- SD (n=3), *P&lt;0.05, ****P&lt;0.0001 in a two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc multiple comparison tests.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71946-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is this profound effect being phenocopied by the siRNA or CRISPR-deletion? This would strengthen the manuscript. What is the effect on eicosanoid production in these models and what happens the induction of inflammatory or anti-microbial genes?</p></disp-quote><p>To meet this demand, we compared the expression of a panel of genes amongst the most downregulated by iFADS2 treatment (Figure 3E) in BMDMs transduced with siRNA Fads2 or siRNA Ctrl for 48h prior to 6 to 24h of infection with Mtb. The left panel of the figure below shows that a significant drop in <italic>Fads2</italic> expression was achieved after 48h. However, the basal expression of <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Ptgs2</italic> was elevated in cells transduced with siFads2, compared to siCtrl (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, left), suggesting an immunometabolic adaptation to the lack of FADS2 activity. Infection-induced upregulation of <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Ptgs2</italic> was less important in BMDMs transfected with siFads2, compared to siCtrl (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, right). The other studied genes were not differentially induced by Mtb infection (data not shown). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of iFADS2 on inflammatory and anti-microbial genes was incompletely phenocopied by siRNA, potentially because siRNA-mediated silencing of FADS2 is only partial, and because compensatory pro-inflammatory mechanisms are implemented in FADS2-inhibited cells.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Relative mRNA expression of inflammatory genes in Mtb-infected BMDMs transfected with siCtrl or siFads2 for 48h (left panel), and infected with Mtb for the indicated periods of time (middle and right panels), as determined by qRT-PCR.</title><p>Data are means +/- SD (n=3), *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, ***P&lt;0.001 in a two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc multiple comparison tests.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71946-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors generate a novel bacterial strain in which import of AA is inhibited. However, the subsequent effect of this on bacterial growth in macrophages (by CFU plating) is not performed and could help delineate the various roles played by AA – as a bacterial nutrient or a host immunomodulatory signal. Side by side comparison of growth of the Mce1d mutant and wild-type Mtb strains in BMDM is required, as well as an examination of whether this has an effect on eicosanoid production and inflammatory/anti-microbial gene expression. This would clearly demonstrate competition between host and pathogen for AA, which could determine the outcome of the immune response.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised version of our manuscript now includes a side-by-side comparison of the growth of <italic>Δmce1D</italic>, WT and complemented Mtb strains in BMDMs (p.12):</p><p>“To determine if bacterial import of FAs via Mce1D impacts the host immune response to infection, we compared the growth of <italic>Δmce1D</italic>, WT and complemented Mtb strains in BMDMs. Although all strains displayed comparable intracellular growth during the first 3 days of BMDM infection (corresponding to the timeframe used in other experiments in this study), that of the <italic>Δmce1D</italic> mutant significantly decelerated after 6 days, compared to WT and complemented strains (Figure 6F). We then asked whether this growth defect correlated with a differential eicosanoid profile, by comparing the levels of AA metabolites produced by BMDMs infected with WT and <italic>Δmce1D</italic> Mtb (Figure 6G). Compared to WT Mtb, <italic>Δmce1D</italic> Mtb induced less COX-derived PGE2 and TXB2 and more LOX-derived 15-HETE and LXA4 (Figure 6G), an eicosanoid profile that is considered pro-mycobacterial. Furthermore, transcriptional induction of key inflammatory genes including <italic>Pgts2</italic> was significantly downregulated in macrophages infected with <italic>Δmce1D</italic> Mtb for 24h, compared to WT and complemented Mtb (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1E). These findings are consistent with the defective pro-inflammatory responses of macrophages exposed to cell wall lipids of an Mtb strain disrupted in the <italic>mce1</italic> operon (Petrilli et al., 2020). Together, our data in Figure 6 revealed that in the context of macrophages, Mtb preferentially imports AA over other host-derived FAs, via mechanisms partially depending on the Mce1 transporter. They argue against eicosanoid production being limited by Mtb’s capture of their AA precursor. Rather, they support the view that infection-induced mobilization of AA is opportunistically hijacked by Mtb to support intracellular growth.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
