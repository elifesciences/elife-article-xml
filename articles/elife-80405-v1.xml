During late embryonic development in mice, myogenic progenitors migrate to discrete sites to form individual muscles. The detailed mechanism of this process remains unclear. Using mouse levator veli palatini (LVP) development as a model, we systematically investigated how a distinct connective tissue subpopulation, perimysial fibroblasts, communicates with myogenic cells to regulate mouse pharyngeal myogenesis. Using single-cell RNAseq data analysis, we identified that TGF-β signaling is a key regulator for the perimysial fibroblasts. Loss of TGF-β signaling in the neural crest-derived palatal mesenchyme leads to defects in perimysial fibroblasts and muscle malformation in the soft palate in <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. In particular, Creb5, a transcription factor expressed in the perimysial fibroblasts, cooperates with TGF-β signaling to activate expression of <italic>Fgf18</italic>. Moreover, Fgf18 supports pharyngeal muscle development <italic>in vivo</italic> and exogenous Fgf18 can partially rescue myogenic cell numbers in <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> samples, illustrating that TGF-β-regulated Fgf18 signaling is required for LVP development. Collectively, our findings reveal the mechanism by which TGF-β signaling achieves its functional specificity in defining the perimysial-to-myogenic signals for pharyngeal myogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pharyngeal muscle</kwd><kwd>TGF-β signaling</kwd><kwd>soft palate</kwd><kwd>cell-cell interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DE012711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chai</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 DE028729</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chai</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R90 DE022528</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Jifan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unbiased single-cell RNAseq data analysis combined with mouse genetic approaches reveal that TGF-β signaling and perimysial-specific regulators may cooperatively define perimysial-to-myogenic signals in regulating pharyngeal myogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inductive tissue-tissue interaction constitutes a key mechanism for organ development and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Souilhol et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vainio and Müller, 1997</xref>). The interaction and communication of myogenic cells with the surrounding connective tissues are also indispensable for muscle morphogenesis. Although the detailed cellular and molecular aspects of this dialogue remain to be elucidated, the connective tissues have been shown to serve as a signal source and ‘pre-pattern’ for muscle differentiation and patterning during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michailovici et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nassari et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>At the onset of pharyngeal muscle development, myogenic progenitors migrate from cranial paraxial mesoderm into the center of each pharyngeal arch to form the primary myogenic sites surrounded by cranial neural crest (CNC)-derived cells. Later, in coordination with the development of other CNC-derived craniofacial connective tissues, myogenic progenitor cells in these mesodermal cores migrate to the final myogenic sites while being segregated and patterned into discrete muscle masses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noden and Francis-West, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shih et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ziermann et al., 2018</xref>). A distinct regulatory network upstream of myogenesis has been identified during early-stage pharyngeal muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckingham and Rigby, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>), but the regulatory mechanism that establishes the fine-tuned craniofacial muscle anlagen in their final myogenic sites remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noden and Francis-West, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the final stage of pharyngeal muscle formation, the first and second pharyngeal arch mesodermal cores respectively contribute to the muscles responsible for mastication and facial expression; the muscles in the oropharyngeal region crucial for breathing, swallowing, and speaking are derived predominantly from the fourth pharyngeal arch, including all the pharyngeal constrictors and soft palatal muscles except the tensor veli palatini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frisdal and Trainor, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michailovici et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shiba and Chhetri, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sugii et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, interactions between CNC-derived and myogenic cells become more prominent as the CNC-derived cells start to contribute to connective tissues while individual muscles segregate and proceed to their final locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ziermann et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>During this late pharyngeal muscle development in mice, most pharyngeal muscles of the head have already segregated and reached their ultimate locations between E11 and E13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noden and Francis-West, 2006</xref>). In contrast, the soft palatal muscle anlage development starts later, concurrent with the soft palatal shelf primordium formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2019</xref>). From E13.5 onwards, individual soft palatal muscles, particularly the levator veli palatini (LVP), can be clearly detected segregating from the rest of the pharyngeal muscles and populating the soft palate primordium, patterning and migrating towards the midline in parallel to the lateral-to-medial outgrowth of the connective tissues consisting of the CNC-derived palatal mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grimaldi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, soft palatal muscle development provides an optimal opportunity to study the initiation, segregation, and migration of muscle anlage formation during craniofacial development.</p><p>Clinically, the most common congenital craniofacial malformation is cleft lip with or without cleft palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vyas et al., 2020</xref>). When the soft palate is affected, disruption of the soft palatal shelves separating the oral and nasal cavities co-occurs with defects in soft palatal muscle formation and oropharyngeal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carvajal Monroy et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, mouse models have demonstrated that loss of key regulators in the perimysial cells, a subset of the palatal mesenchymal connective tissues closely associated with the muscles, ultimately affects soft palatal muscle differentiation and patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sugii et al., 2017</xref>). These findings suggest that CNC-derived perimysial cells possibly contribute to part of the embryonic myogenic niche for craniofacial muscle development at the later stages. Thus, soft palate development can serve as a useful model for studying how perimysial cells regulate late pharyngeal muscle anlage formation through tissue-tissue interactions.</p><p>In the present work, we investigated the mechanism that regulates perimysial-to-myogenic communication using the development of the pharyngeal muscle LVP as a model. Using unbiased single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data analysis combined with mouse genetic approaches, we identified TGF-β signaling as a predominant and specific signaling activity that enables the perimysial cells to interact with the adjacent myogenic cells during late pharyngeal muscle development. Furthermore, we identified that a perimysial regulator Creb5 cooperates with TGF-β signaling to co-activate the expression of specific perimysial-to-myogenic signals such as Fgf18 to regulate pharyngeal myogenesis. Taken together, our findings reveal that TGF-β signaling and perimysial-specific regulators may cooperatively define perimysial-to-myogenic signals in regulating pharyngeal myogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unbiased screening using scRNAseq data analysis identifies TGF-β signaling as predominant and specific signaling for the perimysial cells within the soft palatal mesenchyme</title><p>During late pharyngeal muscle development, myogenic cells of the soft palatal muscles, particularly those of the LVP, can be observed segregating from the existing myogenic site associated with middle pharyngeal constrictor to populate the soft palatal shelves and pattern alongside the CNC-derived palatal mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In parallel, during this stage, our recent scRNAseq analysis identified that the morphologically homologous palatal mesenchyme is also patterned into heterogeneous cellular domains associated with distinct anatomical locations and gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2021</xref>). We thus hypothesized that the perimysial population, anatomically adjacent to the myogenic cells, serves as a microenvironment or niche for embryonic pharyngeal muscle development. Furthermore, there must be a specific regulatory mechanism that differentiates the perimysial cells from the rest of the palatal mesenchymal cell populations so that the perimysial cells can provide specific signals to define the myogenic site.</p><p>Since signaling pathways have been reported to play critical roles in the patterning and fate determination of craniofacial mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mishina and Snider, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neubüser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vincentz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), we performed an unbiased signaling activity analysis of the cell populations of the soft palate, focusing on identifying key signaling pathways specifically activated in the perimysial cells. Using CellChat’s incoming signaling analysis from scRNASeq data of E13.5-E15.5 soft palate, we identified inferred signaling pathway activities of different cell types based on enriched signaling interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, the signaling activity of all the palatal mesenchymal cell types was categorized into the same group due to the shared expression of similar signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with their common connective tissue identity. Among this group of pathways, Ephrin-Eph (EphA/EphB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benson and Serrano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xavier et al., 2016</xref>), non-canonical Wnt (ncWnt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reynolds et al., 2019</xref>), IGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marchant et al., 2020</xref>), TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iwata et al., 2011</xref>), FGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nie et al., 2006</xref>), and Hedgehog signaling (HH) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Everson et al., 2018</xref>) were previously identified to be required for the development of craniofacial mesenchymal tissues including palatal mesenchyme, so we reasoned that they are more likely to be functionally required by the perimysial cell fate determination, too. We thus next analyzed the intensities of activities of these pathways in the perimysial cells and found that the TGF-β signaling activity was inferred to be the highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, a known TGF-β signaling downstream target, <italic>Tgfbi</italic> (transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein), was among the top 10 conserved marker genes for the perimysial cells across various developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that TGF-β signaling is not only a predominant signaling pathway but also specifically associated with regulating the perimysial cell fate and maintaining a perimysial-derived signal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CellChat analysis of E13.5-E15.5 soft palatal scRNAseq data predicts TGF-β signaling as a key pathway activated in the perimysial cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) UMAP plot of soft palatal cell populations identified by Seurat integration analysis.

Consistent with scRNAseq analysis, TGF-β signaling was present in the palatal shelf mesenchyme primordium during soft palatal development from E12.5 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–H</xref>) and was most active in the cells surrounding the LVP myogenic cells, anatomically identified as perimysial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–L and N–P</xref>), particularly during the early segregation and separation process at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, F, J, and N</xref>) and E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, G, K, and O</xref>). Notably, TGF-β signaling was ubiquitous in the mesenchymal cells close to the pharyngeal wall at E12.5 prior to the arrival of myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, E, I, and M</xref>). This specific activation of TGF-β signaling in the presence of perimysial cells suggested that TGF-β signaling may play a role in patterning perimysial cells to establish a myogenic niche in the specific anatomical location for the LVP.

We therefore sought to further specify the cellular identity of the region with TGF-β signaling activity. After subclustering the perimysial cell population from the E13.5-E15.5 soft palatal scRNAseq data, we found these cells could be further divided into 3 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> expression was most enriched in cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), this cluster appeared to be associated with the perimysial progenitor cells, whereas clusters 0 and 1 appeared to be associated with the perimysial fibroblasts. Within the two perimysial fibroblast clusters, the previously reported marker <italic>Tbx15</italic> was expressed by most cells in cluster 0, but not by the majority of cells in cluster 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Instead, we identified that another perimysial marker, <italic>Smoc2</italic>, labeled both clusters, including the <italic>Tbx15</italic>-negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We confirmed that <italic>Smoc2</italic> expression was specific to the perimysial populations among all the palatal mesenchymal populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Both <italic>Tbx15</italic> and <italic>Smoc2</italic> were expressed in the palatal shelf, but they appeared to overlap with pSmad2+ cells in certain locations. <italic>Tbx15</italic> expression was more restricted to the center of the palatal shelf, thus overlapping with the center region of the pSmad2+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H and K</xref>). <italic>Smoc2</italic> was more extensively expressed and overlapped at the periphery of the pSmad2 expression area, almost complementary to the <italic>Tbx15+</italic> domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I and L</xref>).

By checking the expression patterns of these signaling molecules in E13.5-E15.5 soft palatal scRNAseq data, we found that <italic>Lama4</italic>, <italic>Fgf18</italic>, and <italic>Dlk1</italic> are the top three molecules more enriched in the perimysial fibroblasts than in other cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Thus, we identified <italic>Fgf18</italic> as the most likely perimysial-to-myogenic signal regulated by TGF-β signaling to support myogenesis.</p><p>To better understand the role of perimysial-myogenic signals during myogenesis, we further investigated the <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of <italic>Fgf18</italic> in perimysial cells during LVP development in control and <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. We found consistently enriched expression of <italic>Fgf18</italic> in the location of perimysial fibroblasts most adjacent to the myogenic cells between E13.5-E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K, N–O, and R–S</xref>). Consistent with the scRNAseq analysis, the expression of <italic>Fgf18</italic> in similar locations in the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice was reduced compared to the ones in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–M, P–Q, and T–W</xref>). This reduction of <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression occurred as early as E13.5, during which the defect was apparent in the myogenic cells but not in the palatal mesenchyme, suggesting TGF-β signaling regulates <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression prior to changes to the perimysial cell fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, C, E, and G</xref>). Notably, the reduction of the myogenic cells was correlated with the loss of <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression. In the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> soft palate at E14.5, a reduced number of <italic>Myod1+</italic> myogenic cells was detectable in the location of the remnant <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression compared with the presence of myogenic cells in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O and Q</xref>). Further, at E16.5, the <italic>Myod1</italic> expression became undetectable as <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression disappeared compared with the abundant presence of both signals in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5R–U</xref>). This strong correlation between the perimysial-fibroblast-derived <italic>Fgf18</italic> and <italic>Myod1+</italic> myogenic cells further supported the potential role of Fgf18 in myogenesis. We therefore next evaluated the expression of FGF receptors in the MyoD+ myogenic cells to test whether myogenic cells could receive an Fgf18 signal. Consistent with CellChat predictions, perimysial fibroblast-derived Fgf18 signals were more likely to communicate with Fgfr1 and/or Fgfr4 in the myogenic cells, which did not express <italic>Fgfr2</italic> or <italic>Fgfr3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C, F, and G</xref>). Though <italic>Fgfr1</italic> is expressed extensively in the palatal mesenchymal cells and weakly in myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and E</xref>), <italic>Fgfr4</italic> showed more specific and stronger expression in the myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and H</xref>). To further explore which myogenic subpopulation may respond to the Fgf18 signals, we examined the expression pattern of <italic>Fgfr4</italic> in the myogenic cells from the E13.5-E15.5 soft palatal scRNAseq data. We found that <italic>Fgfr4</italic> expression was mostly enriched in the myogenic cells expressing early myogenic markers <italic>Myf5</italic> and <italic>Pax7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I–K</xref>), but not in the more differentiated cells (<italic>Myog+/Myl1+</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1L and M</xref>). Interestingly, these myogenic progenitor cells also expressed the proliferative marker <italic>Mki67</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1N</xref>), consistent with the proliferative status of myogenic progenitors. Consistent with the scRNAseq analysis, <italic>Myf5+</italic> cells co-expressed <italic>Fgfr4</italic> in the palatal shelf sections <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1O and P</xref>).

We designed a CRISPRi plasmid (<italic>Fgf18</italic> CRISPRi Plasmid) whereby the gRNA guides the CRISPRi complex to target only this Smad2/3 binding site, as other binding sites are located distantly, hence blocking its transcriptional activity. Since gRNAs for CRISPRi are reported to have an optimal target effect within a range of 150 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">MacLeod et al., 2019</xref>), we examined gRNA targeting sites from +150 bp to -150 bp around the TFBS and identifed a gRNA with the highest targeting efficency and lowest off-target rate, targeting very close to (47 bp downstream of) the TFBS. Next, we transfected the <italic>Fgf18</italic> or control CRISPRi plasmid into the cultured soft palatal mesenchymal cells and compared the response of these cells to TGF-β1 treatment. Since cellular response to TGF-β ligands can be transient rather than accumulative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sorre et al., 2014</xref>), we first identified the optimal time to analyze <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression levels in the soft palatal mesenchymal cells following TGF-β1 treatment. Consistent with previous studies which found that pSmad2 activity starts to decline around 5 hr following TGF-β1 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inman et al., 2002</xref>), we found that 4 hr of TGF-β1 treatment led to a significant increase of Fgf18 expression, which reduced when analyzed 18 hr post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, 4 hr post-treatment was used as the time point for evaluating the cellular response to the TGF-β1 treatment in the following experiments. Compared with the control CRISPRi plasmid, <italic>Fgf18</italic> CRISPRi plamid significantly attenuated the increase in expresssion of <italic>Fgf18</italic> following TGF-β1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This finding suggested that the binding to this TFBS in the <italic>Fgf18</italic> promoter region is functionally required for the TGF-β-Smad2/3 signaling cascade to directly activate <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression.</p><p>The biological effects of TGF-β signaling are contextual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morikawa et al., 2016</xref>). One mechanism for cell-type-specific response to TGF-β signaling is through the cooperation with cell-type-specific master transcription factors, which enable TGF-β signaling to specifically affect the cell-type-specific genes bound by these master regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mullen et al., 2011</xref>). To identify master regulators that help TGF-β signaling activate a perimysial-specific response in palatal mesenchymal cells, we performed Single-Cell Regulatory Network Interference and Clustering (SCENIC) analysis using E13.5-E15.5 soft palatal scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2021</xref>). We identified that gene regulatory networks (GRNs) mediated by <italic>Hic1</italic>, <italic>Creb5, Meox1</italic>, <italic>Etv5</italic>, <italic>Tbx15</italic>, <italic>Bach2</italic>, and <italic>Nr2f2</italic> are most associated with perimysial fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The expression patterns of these genes in scRNAseq data indicated that <italic>Hic1</italic>, <italic>Creb5, Meox1, Etv5, Tbx15, and Bach2</italic> are more enriched and specific to the perimysial fibroblasts than other palatal mesenchymal populations, and are thus more likely to be associated with the perimysial fibroblast-specific cell behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Next we explored whether these identfied perimysial factors could interact with TGF-β signaling to activate perimysial-specific TGF-β downstream genes such as <italic>Fgf18</italic>. Among the perimysial-associated factors, Creb5 has been reported to be required for TGF-β signaling to induce <italic>Prg4</italic> expression during chondrocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> expression patterns further validated that, among these regulatory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–N</xref>), <italic>Creb5</italic> was most abundantly expressed in the perimysial fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), similar to that of <italic>Fgf18</italic> and TGF-β signaling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>). Moreover, unlike that of <italic>Tbx15</italic>, <italic>Creb5</italic> expression was present in the palatal mesenchyme as early as E13.5, similar to TGF-β signaling activity and <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Since its expression did not change in the mutant from E13.5 to E14.5, it is likely to function as a partner rather than a downstream target of the TGF-β signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). We thus hypothesized that Creb5 is likely one of the candidates that may function cooperatively with TGF-β signaling to activate perimysial-specific signaling genes such as <italic>Fgf18</italic>. To test the function of Creb5, we first evlauated its role in regulating <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression using E14.5 soft palatal mesenchymal cell culture and found that reduction of <italic>Creb5</italic> in soft palatal mesenchymal cells led to reduction of <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O and P</xref>), indicating that Creb5 can regulate <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression. To evaluate the cooperation of Creb5 and TGF-β signaling, we compared the increase of <italic>Fgf18</italic> following TGF-β1 treatment with or without <italic>Creb5</italic> reduction, and found that reducing <italic>Creb5</italic> signficantly attenuated the increase of <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression in soft palatal mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q</xref>), suggesting that TGF-β signaling requires cooperation with Creb5 to efficiently activate downstream targets like <italic>Fgf18</italic> in the perimysial fibroblasts. Furthermore, we also found that TGF-β signaling activity (pSmad2), <italic>Creb5</italic> and <italic>Fgf18</italic> are also expressed in a similar pattern in the perimysial cells during the development of the other pharyngeal muscles, such as the first pharyngeal arch-derived masseter muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), confirming the possibility that this TGF-β signaling and Creb5 cooperation in regulating perimysial signals, which we identified using the soft palatal muscle model, can plausibly be extended to other craniofacial muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Fgf18 reduction in perimysial cells leads to reduced myogenic cells in the LVP region of <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice while Fgf18 restoration partially rescues myogenic defects in <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> samples</title><p>To test whether perimysial-derived Fgf18 is functionally required for myogenesis, we generated <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice.

In contrast, the sizes of the soft palatal muscles of the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice appeared to be smaller than those of controls, which was especially obvious in the posterior part of the LVP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>). This was probably due to the difference in muscle fiber organization in the anterior and posterior parts of the LVP. The LVP consists of muscle fibers oriented both parallel and perpendicularly to the section plane in the anterior region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>) and predominantly perpendicularly in the posterior region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). While all the fibers appear more sparse in the anterior and posterior LVP of the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J and L</xref>), the perpendicular fibers are significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). This reduction of LVP muscle size was confirmed by reduced muscle cross-section area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M–Q</xref>) and muscle volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7R–V</xref>) in the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice compared with the controls. To further analyze the progression of muscle defects, we assessed the soft palatal and myogenic phenotypes from E14.5 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the MyoD+ myogenic cells appeared comparable in the control and <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> LVP at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>), the myogenic cells in the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice started to appear progressively reduced compared to the control, and this difference became more apparent at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F–J</xref>), confirming the role of Fgf18 in late-stage myogenesis. We also confirmed that the loss of functional Exon1C of <italic>Fgf18</italic> is efficient in the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> soft palatal shelves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1K–N</xref>).

At this stage, the myogenic cells in <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice and controls are rarely apoptotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A and D</xref>), but display proliferative activity in both mutants and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B and E</xref>). Therefore, we focused on analyzing the proliferative status of the myogenic cells. Since <italic>Myf5</italic> expression was mostly associated with proliferating cells with enriched <italic>Fgfr4</italic> expression, we next compared the proliferative status of the <italic>Myf5+</italic> myogenic progenitors specifically in <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and control mice. We could see a significant reduction of proliferation of <italic>Myf5+</italic> cells in <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C, F, and G</xref>), suggesting that loss of <italic>Fgf18</italic> led to reduced myogenic progenitor proliferation in the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, which ultimately led to smaller muscle mass. Furthermore, to confirm that Fgf18 could directly work on myogenic cells, we treated C2C12 mouse myogenic cells, which we maintained as undifferentiated myoblasts in growth medium, with FGF18 and found that the proliferation rate of the C2C12 cells significantly increased in growth medium as early as 1 day later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2H–J</xref>), eventually leading to significantly increased C12C2 cell numbers at 3 days post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2K</xref>), supporting the role of Fgf18 in directly regulating myogenic progenitor proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To test whether Fgf18 treatment could restore some of the severe muscle formation defects following the loss of TGF-β signaling in <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, we optimized an organ culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfaqeeh and Tucker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Humpel, 2015</xref>) to culture 300 μm-thick slices of embryonic head tissues containing the LVP region. This enabled the maintenance of the three-dimensional structure of the pharyngeal region and allowed for efficient nutrient penetration and bead implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7W</xref>). Using this culture system, we found that FGF18 bead treatment in the soft palatal shelves led to increased MyoD+ cells compared with BSA beads in <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> slice cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7X and Y</xref>). This suggests that Fgf18 is one of the key regulators of perimysial-to-myogenic signaling affected in the LVP in the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. Taken together, our studies identified that TGF-β signaling interacts with perimysial regulator Creb5 to specify the perimysial-to-myogenic signaling, such as Fgf18, in individual pharyngeal muscle development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the later stage of pharyngeal muscle development, myogenic progenitors migrate into discrete myogenic sites to form individual muscle anlagen anatomically resembling their adult counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noden and Francis-West, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shih et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ziermann et al., 2018</xref>). How these fine-tuned individual muscles form the right morphology at the right location in order to perform their physiological functions remains largely unknown. Here, using the pharyngeal muscle LVP as a model, our study reveals that an important aspect of this mechanism is the establishment of a distinct pro-myogenic perimysial subdomain adjacent to the myogenic site. The cells in this domain have unique identities and regulatory mechanisms distinct from the rest of connective tissue cell populations within the palatal mesenchyme, enabling perimysial cells to uniquely provide various pro-myogenic signals and define specific myogenic sites to support region-specific myogenesis. Using unbiased screening with scRNAseq analysis combined with mouse genetic approaches, we identified TGF-β signaling as a predominant and specific regulator for perimysial cell fate determination during this stage, and perimysial transcriptional factor Creb5 assists TGF-β signaling to achieve functional specificity in supporting pharyngeal myogenesis via pro-myogenic signals such as Fgf18.</p><p>In early myogenesis, CNC cells have also been shown to induce myogenic differentiation by secreting both BMP and Wnt inhibitors to antagonize the dorsal neural tube-derived BMP and Wnt signaling molecules that repress craniofacial skeletal muscle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tzahor et al., 2003</xref>). In the later developmental stages, when the CNC-derived palatal mesenchymal cells are more differentiated and patterned into distinguishable functional domains, we have the optimal opportunity to explore a specific regulatory mechanism of myogenesis. We found that during the LVP development, the late perimysial population (perimysial fibroblasts) with the most active TGF-β signaling is also distributed according to a muscle-specific pattern in both the fourth pharyngeal arch-derived LVP and first pharyngeal arch-derived masseter muscle; and this TGF-β signaling function is required for the formation of the muscle analgen of both the LVP and masseter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, in limb muscle development, a group of pre-patterned <italic>Tcf4+</italic> limb mesodermal cells also pre-determines the basic pattern of the muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kardon et al., 2003</xref>). This indicates a potentially universal mechanism in which a pre-defined perimysial domain distinct from the rest of the connective tissues is required to establish specific myogenic sites that allow for proper muscle analge specification in late developmental stages.</p><p>By investigating perimysial-to-myogenic communication in this study, we have identified pro-myogenic signaling from the neighboring late perimysial cells (perimysial fibroblasts). It thus appears that these embryonic myogenic progenitors may also require ‘embryonic niches’ to support their contribution to muscle development at specific myogenic sites. In adults, muscle stem cells – satellite cells – reside in specific niches, and their ability to potentiate muscle repair and regeneration is also supported by signals from these niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Relaix et al., 2021</xref>). By comparing the ‘adult muscle stem cell niche’ with the ‘embryonic niche’, more molecular and cellular similarities can be further identified. For example, several perimysial-derived signaling pathways for the embryonic myogenic progenitors are also required for satellite cell fate regulation after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigas and Espinosa, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stantzou et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, while <italic>Hic1+</italic> mesenchymal progenitors in the adult niche coordinate various aspects of skeletal muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2019</xref>), they are also inferred to be regulators of the perimysial cells of the embryonic niche during development. These similarities suggest potentially conserved mechanisms between embryonic muscle development and adult muscle repair/regeneration, consistent with the clinical observation that patients with disrupted soft palatal muscle development also exhibit impaired differentiation and a reduced number of satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carvajal Monroy et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the mechanism we identified during development could also be potentially useful for promoting muscle growth after birth.</p><p>Craniofacial anomalies such as DiGeorge syndrome, as well as other syndromic and non-syndromic forms of cleft lip and palate, often affect pharyngeal muscle formation and lead to difficulties in eating, facial expression, speaking, and swallowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kelly et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kernahan et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carvajal Monroy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scambler, 2000</xref>). While the identification of a detailed Pitx2-Tbx1-Msc-Tcf21 transcription factor regulatory network for the pharyngeal myogenic cells may influence the intrinsic regulatory network within the myogenic cells to promote pharyngeal muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckingham and Rigby, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>), manipulation through paracrine signaling is a more likely mechanism. In this study, we have identified a variety of potential pro-myogenic signaling molecules from perimysial-to-myogenic cell interaction analysis. A ‘chemokine/cytokine cocktail’ may be needed to restore the muscle detects in our cleft soft palate animal model (<italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>). As a proof of concept, we found partial improvement of the muscle defects after Fgf18 restoration and thus confirmed the potential of restoring pharyngeal muscle defects with the combination of pro-myogenic factors we identified in the study. Moreover, some of these molecules, including Fgf18 and Dlk1, have also been suggested to be involved in the development and regeneration of various muscles throughout the body including in the limb, diaphragm, and tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mok et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yue et al., 2021</xref>), extending their potential application to defects in other muscles in the body.</p><p>In summary, our study has been able to decipher the molecular and cellular composition of the embryonic myogenic niche for the development of pharyngeal muscles and potentially other muscles in the body. Our work will contribute to a better understanding of the fine-tuned regulatory network of late-stage muscle morphogenesis and lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for regenerating/repairing muscle defects, particularly in infants with birth defects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

to identify differential signaling pathway activities in the heterogeneous palatal mesenchyme. Identifying TGF-β signaling pathway activity with the perimysial cells, they hypothesize and test whether TGF-β signaling in the perimysial cells might regulate palatal muscle formation. This paper will be of high interest to developmental biologists interested in the molecular regulation of tissue interactions that occur during mammalian palate morphogenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80405.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Bronner</surname><given-names>Marianne E</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05dxps055</institution-id><institution>California Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Clouthier</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.25.493396">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.25.493396v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have elected to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another. The consensus is that the paper has potential but needs better quantitation of the results and additional functional experiments. The full reviews are included below to help with you in revision and the essential revisions are summarized below. We hope you find these comments helpful in revising your manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The manuscript needs to better define and quantitatively document the defects in LVP development in the Alk5cko embryos at the cellular level. Figure 3 needs to include a quantitative analysis of possible defects in migration, proliferation, and/or survival of the myogenic progenitor cells during early LVP development from E13 to E14.5. Figure 4 needs iterative clustering to better define the perimysial cell subpopulations. For example, less than 25% of the cells in the current Tbx15+ cluster show Tbx15 expression in the control samples and there was a clear loss of Tbx15-expressing cells in the Alk5cko mutant sample. Iterative clustering analysis is needed to identify/document more specific markers of each subpopulation and how they are affected in the Alk5cko mutant. Subsequently, experiments need to define whether proliferation and/or survival of specific subpopulations were differentially affected.</p><p>2. More detailed description and data presentation of the network analysis that identified Creb5 as a potential key regulator need to be provided. The function of Creb5 and how it coordinates with TGFb signaling in palate development need to be experimentally defined.</p><p>3. How TGFb signaling regulates Fgf18 expression and the LVP developmental defects in the Fgf18cko embryos need to be better and quantitatively analyzed.</p><p>4. Functional studies in myogenic progenitor cells are needed to validate direct signaling interactions from perimysial to myogenic cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A few points:</p><p>1. If the authors want to suggest that Smads bind to Fgf18, show that the identified elements work in a transcriptional assay (luciferase or similar). Even that is not very direct, since one can make almost any piece of genomic DNA a &quot;reporter&quot; if adding the correct TF for that site. However, it would at least boost the argument that Smads are controlling Fgf18 expression. Alternatively or in addition, the authors could perform Cut and Run in the Alx5 cko background and show that the element is unbound. Otherwise, it is simply supposition that Smads regulate Fgf18 and thus make this data either dispensable or a discussion point.</p><p>2. It is unclear how to fix the problem associated with Creb5, though the authors provide no evidence that Creb5 can regulate Fgf18 expression other than knocking down Creb5. Because this is circumstantial evidence, any statement or discussion about Creb5 being a direct regulator of Fgf18 should be removed. Again, one could probably pick a number of factors that might work with Tgfb signaling. Focusing on Creb5 is fine, though there is no strong evidence to support its role over factors.</p><p>3. It is unclear if scRNA-seq was performed one or two times for the mutant sample. I firmly believe that duplicate scRNA-seq for mutants can not only be laborious and costly, but also superfluous. This is scRNA-seq: every cell is different. The authors just need to be very clear on this point (it is clear that the control set was run twice, as they state how the data sets were combined using agro).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Please indicate n-values for each experiment directly in the figure legends.</p><p>2) In most of the experiments histological samples are indicated and the results appear clear when a whole population of cells is missing or severely reduced. In other cases (ex. Figure 2, 5, etc.) this is less obvious. To avoid misreading the results or the possibility of assaying peripheral sections in some cases, quantifications of cell counts across several sections are necessary to increase confidence in the results.</p><p>3) Figures would be easier to understand for the reader with the addition of schemes depicting the orientation and level of the sections.</p><p>4) The sentence in line 307 &quot;Thus, Fgf18 is a direct target for TGF-B signaling in the late perimysial cells&quot; is inferred from bioinformatic analyses, and not functionally validated. Please qualify this affirmation.</p><p>5) The reduced size of palatal muscles in Osr2-Cre;Fgf18 fl/fl mice is proposed to be due to muscle fiber disorganization in the LVP. Did the authors analyze changes in proliferation/apoptosis in distinct cell populations of these muscles?</p><p>6) In Figure 2 the authors can use a specific marker of perimysial cells in combination with pSMAD2 staining to demonstrate at the cell level activation of TGF-β signaling in this cell population.</p><p>7) In the text it is mentioned &quot;TGF-β signaling (pSMAD2) was efficiently reduced in perimysial cells.&quot; (Line 198), &quot;showed a significant reduction in Tbx15 expression&quot; (Line 223), however, no precise quantification was performed. Please either re-phrase these sentences or provide quantitative data.</p><p>8) In general, there is too much emphasis on the direct interaction between perimysial cells and myogenic progenitors while the role of TGF-β receptors has only been assessed in a descriptive way (Figure 5 – 1). Functional validation in myogenic cells would be required to push this conclusion which remains otherwise correlative with compelling evidence. In this context, given that MyoD is used as a myogenic readout, to what extent is the signaling cascade described patterning vs. commitment to myogenesis vs. differentiation?</p><p>9) The specificity of each perimysial subpopulation marker is not clear (Figure 4A-F). Displaying the most differentially expressed genes would be clearer.</p><p>10) The differences between the levels of Fgf18 and Lama4 (Figure 5C-D) are not evident. Violin plots are not adapted as the perimysial fibroblasts population is much smaller in the mutant, and there are no quantifications.</p><p>11) Figure1: (B) explanation on bottom, &quot;Cell group&quot; &quot;Patterns&quot; to fix ◊ &quot;Patterns&quot; &quot;Signals&quot;.</p><p>12) Figure3: Either in sentences in Result or Figure Legends, please mention the genotyping of &quot;control&quot;.</p><p>13) Figure4: (A-F) Please explain the clustering of scRNA-seq.

We have performed the following experiments to address these questions.</p><p>1) We analyzed E13.5-E14.5 LVP development in the <italic>Alk5 cko</italic> mice and found cell migration defects occurred at E13.5 and proliferation defects at E14.0 in myogenic cells. Furthermore, no myogenic cells were apoptotic in either control or <italic>Alk5 cko</italic> mice; thus, cell survival was not compromised. We have added the results to Figure 3—Figure supplement 3.</p><p>2) To better identify the <italic>Tbx15</italic> negative cell subpoplations that are also affected in the <italic>Alk5 cko</italic> mutant sample, we subsetted and re-clustered the perimysial populations from E13.5-E15.5 soft palatal scRNAseq data, as the perimysial cell subpopulations in this analysis are overall more segregated than in the integrated control and <italic>Alk5 cko</italic> scRNAseq anlysis. By comparing the expression patterns of differentially expressed markers across clusters, we identified <italic>Smoc2</italic> as another perimysial marker that was expressed in the region where <italic>Tbx15</italic> was negative but pSmad2 was positive. More specifically, when comparing with the location of myogenic cells, these two markers showed more clear separation of expression patterns: <italic>Tbx15</italic>+ cells were located predominantly in between the LVP myogenic cells while <italic>Smoc2</italic> expression was present mostly around the periphery of the myogenic site. Consistent with their overlap with pSmad2+ cells, both populations were affected. We added these data to Figure 2—Figure supplement 1 and Figure 4G-H.</p><p>3) To identify whether the proliferation and/or survival of <italic>Tbx15+</italic> and <italic>Smoc2+</italic> subpopulations were differentially affected in <italic>Alk5 cko</italic> mice prior to E14.5, we first analyzed their expression patterns at E13.5-E14.0 control and in <italic>Alk5 cko</italic> mice. We found that <italic>Tbx15</italic> was expressed at late stages in the palatal mesenchyme. <italic>Tbx15</italic> was not detectable at E13.5, and only starting to be activated at a very low level by a few cell­s at E14.0. Its expression increased abundantly in the control at E14.5 but failed to increase in the palate of <italic>Alk5 cko</italic>, suggesting that the loss of Tbx15 expression at E14.5 is a result of failure of activating <italic>Tbx15</italic> expression between E14.0-E14.5. In parallel, <italic>Smoc2</italic> was expressed extensively in the palatal mesenchyme at E13.5, and become more patterned to the center of the palatal shelf at E14.0. While <italic>Smoc2</italic> expression was similar between control and <italic>Alk5 cko</italic> mice at E13.5, <italic>Smoc2</italic> expression started to become reduced in the palate in <italic>Alk5 cko</italic> mice at E14.0. Since the proliferation rates of the palatal shelves and the <italic>Smoc2+</italic> cells were not affected at E13.5, and very few cells were apoptotic in the palatal mesenchyme of both the control and <italic>Alk5 cko</italic> mice, we concluded that the loss of <italic>Smoc2</italic> was likely also due to differentiation defects. These results suggest that TGF-β regulates the differentiation of both <italic>Tbx15+</italic> and <italic>Smoc2+</italic> subpopulations, not proliferation or cell survival, despite the timing of the activation of their expression. We added these results to Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. More detailed description and data presentation of the network analysis that identified Creb5 as a potential key regulator need to be provided. The function of Creb5 and how it coordinates with TGFb signaling in palate development need to be experimentally defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor and reviewers for these comments and made the following changes as suggested:</p><p>1) We have identified multiple potential regulators associated with perimysial fibroblasts from bioinformatic analyses and chose to test <italic>Creb5</italic> as an example to show how these regulators may work as partners for TGF-β signaling. We picked Creb5 as a most likely candidate because it has recently been reported to support TGF-β signaling to induce <italic>Prg4</italic> expression during chondrocyte development (Zhang et al., 2021). In our study, Creb5’s expression pattern also showed that Creb5 is the most abundantly expressed regulator in the perimysial region at E14.5, overlapping with the pSmad2 and <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression area. Moreover, Creb5 expression was present in the palatal mesenchyme as early as E13.5, similar to TGF-β signaling activity and <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression. This temporal and spatial co-localization of <italic>Creb5</italic>, pSmad2, and <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression domains in combination with the literature led us to hypothesize that Creb5 is the most likely candidate partner for TGF-β signaling-mediated <italic>Fgf18</italic> activation. We have edited the text and added this more detailed description to lines 386-396 on page 18.</p><p>2) In this study, we focus on the function of Creb5 in cooperating with TGF-β signaling to induce the expression of <italic>Fgf18</italic> during palate development. We optimized the timing for analyzing TGF-β1 treatment response to 4 hours (instead of 24 hours as used in previous experiments), so that we observed significant increase of <italic>Fgf18</italic> following TGF-β1 treatment. We found that not only Creb5 affected the expression of <italic>Fgf18</italic> by itself, but loss of <italic>Creb5</italic> significantly reduced the increase of <italic>Fgf18</italic> following TGF-β1 treatment, suggesting that Creb5 cooperates with TGF-β signaling to activate <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression in soft palatal mesenchymal cells. Despite the abundant expression of <italic>Creb5</italic> in the palatal shelf mesenchyme from E13.5 to E14.5, the detailed functions of Creb5 in craniofacial development have not been reported in the literature. We plan to generate a <italic>Creb5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mouse model and thoroughly investigate other roles of <italic>Creb5</italic> in palatal/craniofacial development as an independent project following this work. We have updated the data for Figure 6N-O as the revised Figure 6O-Q.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How TGFb signaling regulates Fgf18 expression and the LVP developmental defects in the Fgf18cko embryos need to be better and quantitatively analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor and reviewers for the suggestion to perform more detailed characterization of the regulatory mechanism and <italic>Fgf18 cko</italic> embryo phenotype. We have performed the following experiments to address these questions.</p><p>1) To better understand the functional requirement for Smads and define the identified binding site in the <italic>Fgf18</italic> promoter region, we initially generated an <italic>Fgf18</italic> WT promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid using 2.5 kb upstream of TSS containing the binding site and an <italic>Fgf18</italic> mutant promoter plasmid in which the binding site was mutated from TCCCAGACAC to TCAAATACAC (Itoh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). We transfected the plasmids into NIH3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line, which is similar to our primary soft palatal mesenchymal cells but with higher transfection efficiency and availability. However, the <italic>Fgf18</italic> WT promoter reporter showed low levels of luciferase activity, so we could not draw a definitive conclusion as to whether the mutant promoter reporter had reduced activity. We thus sought an alternative approach for a transcriptional assay and attempted with the recently developed CRISPRi method (Larson et al., 2013), which has also been used for functional analysis of transcription binding sites (Stuart et al., 2021). We generated a CRISPRi plasmid (<italic>Fgf18</italic> CRISPRi plasmid) to target and block transcriptional activity of only this Smad2/3 binding site of interest, as other binding sites are located more distantly from the targeted region. Following transfection of this plasmid into the soft palatal mesenchymal cells, we found that the TGF-β-induced <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression was impaired in the <italic>Fgf18</italic> CRISPRi-treated cells, compared with the scramble control CRISPRi-treated cells. This data suggested that the Smad2/3 binding to this TF binding site in the <italic>Fgf18</italic> promoter region is functionally required for the TGF-β-Smad2/3 signaling cascade to directly activate <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression. We have added these data to pages 17-18 and Figure 6D.</p><p>2) To better quantify the developmental defects of <italic>Fgf18 cko</italic> (<italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) embryos, we first performed quantitative analysis of muscle defects (cross section area and volume) of <italic>Fgf18 cko</italic> and control embryos at newborn stage and confirmed the muscle size was significantly reduced in the <italic>Fgf18 cko</italic> embryos. Next, we analyzed the detailed myogenic defects in the <italic>Fgf18 cko</italic> embryos at earlier stages. We quantified the MyoD+ myogenic cells in the control and <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> LVP at E14.5-E16.5, and found the myogenic cell number in the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice was comparable to that of the control at E14.5, but was significantly reduced at E16.5. More specifically, we found that Fgf18 receptor <italic>Fgfr4</italic> was most enriched in <italic>Myf5+</italic> myogenic cells, possibly associated with proliferative progenitor status. Furthermore, in the <italic>Fgf18 cko</italic> embryos, while the myogenic cell numbers were not affected at E14.5, the proliferation rate of <italic>Myf5</italic>+ myogenic cells was reduced, consistent with the reduced myogenic cell number that occurred at E16.5 and the reduced muscle size at newborn stage. These new results have been added to Figure 7M-V, Figure 5I-P, and Figure 7—figure supplement 1E and J, Figure 7—figure supplement 2A-G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Functional studies in myogenic progenitor cells are needed to validate direct signaling interactions from perimysial to myogenic cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion to clarify whether Fgf18 can directly regulate myogenic cell fate, without the influence of perimysial cells. Due to the limited number of myogenic cells obtained from the primary palate, which also have limited growth potential to be expanded, we used C2C12 mouse myogenic cell line to test the direct function of Fgf18 in myogenic cell fate determination. We particularly focused on the proliferation changes because <italic>Fgf18 cko</italic> embryos exhibited proliferation defects in myogenic cells. We found that, consistent with the reduced proliferation of myogenic progenitor cells following the loss of <italic>Fgf18</italic> in the <italic>Fgf18 cko</italic> mice, adding FGF18 to C2C12 cells directly promoted the proliferation of myogenic cells and eventually increased the total number of C2C12 cells. We added these results in Figure 7—Figure supplement 2H-K.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A few points:</p><p>1.

Given the proliferation defects observed in the <italic>Myf5</italic>+ cells in the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgf18<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, we focused on the direct role of Fgf18 on C2C12 mouse myogenic cell proliferation, and found that Fgf18 regulates the proliferation of these myogenic cells. We have added these data in Figure 5—Figure supplement 1and Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The specificity of each perimysial subpopulation marker is not clear (Figure 4A-F). Displaying the most differentially expressed genes would be clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and performed more detailed marker analysis. Using E13.5-E15.5 control scRNAseq clusters, we have identified <italic>Aldh1a2</italic>, <italic>Smoc2</italic>, and <italic>Tbx15</italic> as perimysial markers with differential expression patterns in vivo. However, for the perimysial subpopulations in the E14.5 control and <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (<italic>Osr2-Cre;Alk5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) integrated perimysial cell clusters (Figure 4A-C), the expression domains of the above clusters are more overlapping, particularly those of the <italic>Tbx15</italic> and <italic>Smoc2</italic> populations. We speculate that the less segregated gene expression patterns could possibly be attributed to integrating the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> cells to the control cells or to the similarity within the perimysial populations at a particular developmental stage. Although we could not identify more specific markers than the three noted above to further subdivide the population, we were able to obtain sufficient resolution to identify the different perimysial populations at this stage and evaluate their expression changes in the <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. We have included these results in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The differences between the levels of Fgf18 and Lama4 (Figure 5C-D) are not evident. Violin plots are not adapted as the perimysial fibroblasts population is much smaller in the mutant, and there are no quantifications.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for identifying this. We have removed the violin plots and used feature plots instead for better visualization of the differences between the expression levels of <italic>Fgf18</italic> and <italic>Lama4</italic> in control and <italic>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (Figure 5C-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure1: (B) explanation on bottom, &quot;Cell group&quot; &quot;Patterns&quot; to fix ◊ &quot;Patterns&quot; &quot;Signals&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We fixed the labelling in the bottom of Figure 1B as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure3: Either in sentences in Result or Figure Legends, please mention the genotyping of &quot;control&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion for clarification of the genotyping.
