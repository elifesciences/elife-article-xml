Males learn to sing by imitating mature conspecifics, but females do not. Absence of song in females is associated with partial atrophy and apparent repression of several vocal learning brain regions during development. However, atrophy can be prevented, and vocal learning retained in females when given early pharmacological estrogen treatment. To screen for candidate drivers of this sexual dimorphism, we performed an unbiased transcriptomic analysis of song learning nuclei specializations relative to the surrounding regions from either sex, treated with vehicle or estrogen until 30 days of age when divergence between the sexes becomes anatomically apparent. Analyses of transcriptomes by RNA sequencing identified song nuclei-specialized gene expressed modules associated with sex and estrogen manipulation. Female HVC and Area X gene modules were specialized by estrogen supplementation, exhibiting a subset of the transcriptomic specializations observed in males. Female robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) and lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN) specialized modules were less dependent on estrogen. The estrogen-induced gene modules in females were enriched for anatomical development functions and strongly correlated to the expression of several Z sex chromosome genes. We present a hypothesis where reduced dosage and expression of these Z chromosome genes suppress the full development of the song system and thus song learning behavior, which is partially rescued by estrogen treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>T. castanotis</italic></kwd><kwd>vocal learning</kwd><kwd><italic>T. guttata</italic></kwd><kwd>sex difference</kwd><kwd>sex chromosomes</kwd><kwd>sex hormones</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF-GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davenport</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarvis</surname><given-names>Erich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DC016224</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsunami</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hormonal manipulation, laser microdissection, and bulk RNA sequencing indicate that Z chromosome dosage in the brain region HVC during development regulates the subsequent sexually dimorphic transcriptional specialization of zebra finch song nuclei.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vocal learning is the ability to imitate heard sounds using a vocal organ and is a necessary and specialized component for spoken language and song. Vocal learning is found in seven nonhuman clades, four mammalian and three avian, each having independently evolved the trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jarvis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jarvis et al., 2014</xref>). Oscine songbirds have proved to be the most tractable for studying vocal learning in the lab, with much of the field focusing on the Australian zebra finch (<italic>Taeniopygia castanotis</italic>). Despite ~300 million years of separation from their common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kumar and Hedges, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Tuinen and Hadly, 2004</xref>), there is remarkable evolutionary convergence between songbird and human vocal learning in terms of behavioral progression, developmental effects of deafening, anatomical connectivity of vocal-motor learning circuits, sites of accelerated evolution within the genome, and genes with specialized up- or downregulated expression in song and speech circuits relative to the surrounding motor control circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jarvis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolhuis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doupe and Kuhl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mooney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pfenning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feenders et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gedman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cahill et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lovell et al., 2008</xref>). Unlike in humans, however, vocal learning is strongly sexually dimorphic in zebra finches and many other vocal learning species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nottebohm and Arnold, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Odom et al., 2014</xref>).

During juvenile development in zebra finch females, HVC and RA atrophy, HVC fails to form synapses in RA, and Area X never appears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nottebohm and Arnold, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bottjer et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garcia Calero and Scharff, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Konishi and Akutagawa, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nixdorf-Bergweiler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nordeen and Nordeen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shaughnessy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holloway and Clayton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mooney and Rao, 1994</xref>). Amazingly, female zebra finches treated with estrogen or a synthetic analog at an early age do not exhibit song system atrophy and instead form a functional neural circuit with all the anatomical components and connections seen in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gurney and Konishi, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gurney, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simpson and Vicario, 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simpson and Vicario, 1991b</xref>).

However, the examination of a rare gynandromorphic zebra finch with lateralized sex chromosome composition indicates that genetically male HVC and Area X are larger than their female analogs independent of gonadal hormone production, implicating sex chromosome gene expression within the song system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agate et al., 2003</xref>). Unlike the mammalian X and Y, birds have a Z and W sex determination system where females are hemizygous (ZW) and males homozygous (ZZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gianaroli et al., 2013</xref>). The relevant transcriptional machinery appears to be set up by post-hatch day 30 (PHD30), after which estrogen fails to masculinize female song nuclei or behavior, and the male song system enlarges while the female song system atrophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bottjer et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Konishi and Akutagawa, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gurney and Konishi, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Konishi and Akutagawa, 1988</xref>). Taken together with the hypothesis that vocal learning in females was lost multiple independent times among songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Odom et al., 2014</xref>), the extant findings suggest genetic drivers of vocal learning loss associated with estrogen, sex chromosomes, and song nuclei gene expression specializations. To screen for potential genetic drivers (loci whose expression/inheritance regulate the trait) and locate their action within the song system, we performed an unbiased analysis of transcriptomes from song nuclei and surrounding motor control regions in zebra finches of either sex chronically treated with 17-β-estradiol (E2) or vehicle from hatch until sacrifice at PHD30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). While the birds for this study were sacrificed prior to the developmental presentation of song behavior, we have previously shown that female finches treated with E2 in the same exact way go on to produce rudimentary imitative songs as adults, consistent with the known induction of vocal learning in females by E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gurney and Konishi, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choe et al., 2021</xref>). We used a new zebra finch genome assembly and annotation produced by the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) containing both the Z and W chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rhie et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of gene expression modules</title><p>We first sought to characterize differences in song nuclei gene expression specializations relative to their immediate surrounding motor brain regions in juvenile males and females with and without E2 treatment. We used RNA-seq data from a previous study by our lab, on the effects of E2 manipulation on the song system in both males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choe et al., 2021</xref>). This E2 treatment program masculinized females sufficiently for them to produce song as adults in a parallel cohort of birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choe et al., 2021</xref>). Birds were sacrificed as juveniles at PHD30, after a 1 hr period of silence to limit activity-dependent gene expression in song nuclei and surrounding motor regions; this developmental age was chosen because it is around the time when both males and E2-treated females start to sing (e.g. subsong), and all four song nuclei are sufficiently developed to be visually apparent in histological sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choe et al., 2021</xref>). The four major song nuclei (HVC, LMAN, RA, and Area X) and their adjacent surrounding motor regions (DN, AN, LAI, and Str, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) were dissected using laser capture. In the case of vehicle-treated females, which lack Area X, a piece of striatum was taken from where Area X would be in males to serve as the Area X sample. In our previous study, we found that these PHD30 vehicle-treated males had larger RAs and HVCs than their female counterparts. Area X was absent in vehicle-treated females, and LMAN was similarly sized in both sexes. Following E2 treatment, E2-treated male RA was significantly smaller than vehicle-treated males, while Area X appeared in E2-treated females, and HVC was significantly larger than in vehicle-treated females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choe et al., 2021</xref>). This past study mapped the RNA-seq reads to an older genome assembly lacking the W sex chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choe et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>With this data, we first remapped RNA-seq reads (from n=3 birds per group) to a new zebra finch assembly (GCF_008822105.2) with both the Z and W chromosomes. As many W chromosome genes are duplicated from the Z chromosome and thus highly similar in sequence, only single-mapped reads were considered to minimize misattributed Z chromosome reads. In our quality control analyses, hierarchical clustering of sample expression vectors revealed two technical outliers, one HVC from a vehicle-treated male and one RA from an E2-treated female, which we excluded from further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to previous PCA and hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choe et al., 2021</xref>), the remapped RNA-seq data expression levels with outliers removed still resulted in separation of song nucleus and surround and some E2-treated female samples, without sufficient resolution at finer group levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To address our questions at finer resolution and in an unbiased way, we performed weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), where we decomposed the transcriptome into actively expressed gene modules using hierarchical clustering of the gene adjacency matrix. This matrix describes the inferred structure of gene networks within our data and was calculated with a soft-thresholding of the matrix of gene-to-gene expression correlations across samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>). After the genes were given initial hierarchical cluster-based module assignment, they were then iteratively reassigned to the module whose aggregate expression they best correlated with until no additional genes met the WGCNA reassignment threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and Materials and methods for parameterization). This reassignment was performed to ensure that genes are matched to the aggregate measure that best represents their expression.</p><p>Of the ~21,000 annotated zebra finch genes, 13,220 were well expressed in the finch telencephalic brain regions sampled, a comparable number of genes to what we have seen expressed in adult zebra finch telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gedman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gedman, 2021</xref>). These 13,220 were assigned to 14 co-expression modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The median observation of unassigned transcripts was 22-fold lower than the median observation of module-assigned transcripts (4.86 vs 0.22 FPKM). Two modules clearly marked single samples from two different birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a and b</xref> - arrows), indicative of technical overfitting; these two modules (not birds) were excluded from further analysis, resulting in a more visibly diverse pattern within and across modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4c, d</xref>). The remaining 12 modules contained 12,444 genes in total; these 12 modules were lettered in descending order of size A through L, containing from 4890 to 127 constituent genes each, which were dynamically expressed across brain regions and treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

MEGs are the first principal component of variance of all genes in a module and are the aggregate measure for each module’s expression across samples. We then tested for statistically significant correlations between MEG expression for each module and the song nuclei specializations relative to their respective surrounds. Each song nucleus in vehicle-treated control males had unique and overlapping specialization of genes in 2–4 modules of the 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The male LMAN specialization relative to the surrounding AN was correlated with modules B, F, and I; male HVC specialization relative to DN consisted of genes in modules B, F, and G; male RA specialization relative to LAI consisted of genes in modules C and L; and male Area X specialization relative to the surrounding Str consisted of genes in modules C, F, G, and I. Area X was the only song nucleus that did not have a specialized module unique to it relative to other song nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In nonvocal learning juvenile females, interestingly, LMAN was specialized relative to AN by the same gene modules as in males (B, F, and I) as well as an additional module G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>); RA was specialized by module A as in males, but not module L and by additional modules A and G.

In the E2-treated juvenile males, the song nuclei-specialized modules overlapped with those seen in vehicle-treated males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a vs c</xref>). Differences were that: in LMAN and Area X, module I was no longer present; in RA, module L was no longer present, module A appeared as seen in females, and module E also appeared. These differences in gene module specializations in the male song system are consistent with the E2 treatment regimen used, causing a slight decrease in vocal learning accuracy in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choe et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, E2-treated females more closely mirrored the gene module specializations seen in the vehicle-treated male song system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a vs d</xref>).

That is, the transcriptional response of female song nuclei to E2 treatment appeared to be far more dramatic than in males.</p><p>We performed an additional test for E2-induced changes to gene module expression in females by comparing E2-treated song nuclei in females to the combination of E2-treated surrounds from the same animals, vehicle-treated female surrounds, and vehicle-treated female song nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). This analysis represents a comparison between samples from vocal learning-capable female samples and nonvocal learning female samples at each node. It revealed 1–3 modules in each song nucleus of E2-treated females that were a subset of some of the strongest correlated modules found in control males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a vs e</xref>). These were: module F in LMAN; module G in HVC; module C in RA; and modules C, F, and G in Area X. That is, these are four core modules for song nuclei that are the most sensitive to E2 induction or enhancement in females and most associated with the presence of vocal learning in females.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Gene modules for telencephalic sex differences</title><p>We next tested whether some modules could be explained by sex differences in the brain, regardless of song nuclei presence or vocal learning status. We compared vehicle-treated male and female song nuclei and surrounds separately and found that module E strongly correlated with higher expression in all male brain regions relative to females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f, g</xref>). Among the song nuclei, module G eigengene expression was significantly higher in male HVC and Area X; conversely, module C expression was higher in female LMAN and RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Among the surrounds, module H eigengene expression (not significant in any other comparison) was significantly higher in female DN, and module C was significantly higher in female AN and Str (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). These findings indicate that module E contains genes that could be explained by a broad transcriptome sex difference in the brain, whereas the expression of other modules is more specific to brain region and/or treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Gene modules with region- and bird-specific expression</title><p>We next quantified the magnitude of module expression differences and observed several gene modules with clear region-specific expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h–k</xref>). Module A, which appeared specialized in RA relative to LAI in several comparisons, was highly expressed in all Area X and Str samples, regardless of treatment or sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>FOXP2</italic>, a gene critical for spoken-language and vocal learning in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lai et al., 2001</xref>) and songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teramitsu and White, 2006</xref>), was a potent member of module A, correlating with the eigengene at r<sup>2</sup>=0.92 across all samples. Module C, which was specialized to RA, HVC, and Area X relative to their surrounds and sexually dimorphic in LMAN and Str, was most highly expressed in arcopallial samples, especially RA, with some increase in HVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). Module F, which was specialized to LMAN relative to its surround in all such comparisons, was highly expressed exclusively in LMAN regardless of sex and E2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>). Module G, which was specialized to HVC in a sex- and E2-dependent manner, was only highly expressed in HVC samples, with males having higher expression than females, and females further split by treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>).</p><p>We also checked if genes in specific modules were enriched in their expression in specific animals or divisions of animals regardless of region. The module E eigengene was highly expressed in all male samples and lowly expressed in all female samples regardless of brain region or treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>), consistent with brain sex differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f, g</xref>). At the other extreme, three small modules showed higher expression specific to individual birds: module J was highly expressed in all samples of animal ‘b’, an E2-treated female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2m</xref>); module K was highly expressed across all samples of animal ‘f’ vehicle-treated female, and at roughly half-dose in animal ‘g’, an E2-treated male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2n</xref>); module L was highly expressed in animal ‘a’, another E2-treated female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2o</xref>). These findings indicate that the three smallest modules, J, K, and L, although with some patterning to RA for the later two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, d</xref>), are strongly animal-specific in their expression. As we can think of no source of technical variation that would produce a broadly distributed shift in the neural expression of a single gene module, this variation is likely attributable to biological interindividual variation. Whether this is genetic or from life history, we cannot say from the present data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Functional enrichment of specialized modules</title><p>We sought to understand the cumulative biological function of genes among the modules. To do this, we mapped the zebra finch genes to their 1:1 human orthologs where possible and then used human gene annotation to examine the Gene Ontology (GO) functions enriched within each module’s constituent genes. Of the 12,444 module-assigned genes, 7909 (63%) had 1:1 human orthologs annotated in Ensembl. We found GO terms significantly enriched in module G, which included ‘DNA binding transcription factor activity’, ‘cell differentiation’, ‘anatomical morphogenesis’, ‘cell-to-cell signaling’, and ‘positive regulation of multicellular organism growth’, indicating that module G genes specialized in male and E2-treated female HVC and Area X potentially act to integrate and differentiate late-born neurons. Other significantly enriched terms were ‘extracellular matrix structural component’, ‘external side of the plasma membrane’, and ‘extracellular space’, indicating that this module may also act to restructure the extracellular matrix, perhaps to accommodate new cells. Module E, which was differential between the sexes for both song nuclei and surrounds, had six significantly enriched terms, of which three pertained to DNA damage repair: ‘nucleolus’, ‘transcription, DNA templated’, and ‘U2-type precatalytic spliceosome’. These results in module E indicate that there is a sexually dimorphic gene expression program broadly distributed across the finch telencephalon that likely acts within the nuclear environment.

To do this as accurately as possible, we performed this analysis using revised chromosomal assignments and structure from the most recent zebra finch genome assembly, bTaeGut_1.4.pri, which better resolves the microchromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that each of the 12 modules was enriched for genes from at least one chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The most striking was module E genes, which were enriched on the Z and W sex chromosomes, with nearly all W expressed genes and ~⅔ of Z expressed genes being members of module E. This is consistent with module E exhibiting higher expression in male samples regardless of treatment or region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d, e</xref>).

These results are particularly interesting given that zebra finch chromosomes 1 and 1A are believed to be the result of a songbird-specific fragmentation of the ancestral chromosome 1 found in chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Itoh and Arnold, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Warren et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Module A, the largest module, which was highly expressed in Area X and adjacent striatum, was enriched across five macrochromosomes (chr1, 2, 3, 4, and 10).

Modules C (most strongly expressed in the arcopallium and part of RA and Area X specializations) and I (a component of the LMAN specialization) were enriched on chromosome 6 and microchromosome 35. Module D, a component of the LMAN specialization in E2-treated females, was enriched across eight small microchromosomes (chr22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31). Most (4 of the 5) of the smallest modules in gene counts were enriched in the microchromosomes: Module H, which was sexually dimorphic only in DN, was enriched on microchromosome 28; module K was significantly enriched on microchromosome 37 and in the ‘other’ category, which includes all remaining unnamed DNA scaffolds in the assembly, such as further microchromosomes; module J was also enriched in ‘other’.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Sex chromosome gene expression across regions</title><p>To better understand the relationship between the sex chromosomes and module E, we examined the distribution of membership in module E with the sex chromosomes separated. WGCNA allows us to consider gene membership in a module as a continuous variable, rather than a binary variable, by correlating each gene’s expression profile to the MEG. Doing this for module E, we found that Z transcripts were positively correlated to the MEG while W transcripts were anticorrelated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). This is consistent with Z chromosome transcripts being generally lower expressed in females relative to males, while W chromosome transcripts were only expressed in female brains.

To do this, we first tested for correlated expression between each sex chromosome transcript to the animals’ sex within each region such that female-enriched transcripts were positively correlated and male-enriched transcripts were anticorrelated with sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f, g</xref>). In these gene sets, we identified between 73 and 82 significantly expressed W chromosome genes and between 433 and 527 significantly depleted Z chromosome genes for each of the surround regions in males relative to females. Examining the union of these gene sets revealed that a total of 95 W and 694 Z chromosome genes were differentially expressed between sexes in at least one brain region, 62% and 65% of annotated sex chromosome genes, respectively. Conversely, the intersection of these regional gene sets contained 58 significantly expressed W chromosome genes and 306 significantly depleted Z chromosome genes in all nonvocal regions in females, representing 38% and 29% of annotated sex chromosome genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h, i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

This allowed us to quantify the extent to which any gene was associated with any module, regardless of initial assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nordeen et al., 1986</xref>).

These findings indicate that the expression levels of Z chromosome genes in module E were predominantly dose regulated, with the abundance of the RNA dictated by the presence vs absence of those specific chromosomes regardless of brain region sampled. However, Z chromosome genes in the other modules whose expression is enriched for one or several brain regions, animals, or treatments exhibited varying degrees of dosage compensation to overcome the Z chromosome difference.</p><p>In contrast, W chromosome genes assigned to module E had on average 6.8% male read mapping counts (median 0.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g, h</xref>). Non-module E-assigned W genes had 33.0% male reads mapped (median 32.7%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g, h</xref>). As the values should be 0% reads from males mapped to the W chromosome, we believe this male read mapping is from less divergent transcript paralogs from the Z chromosome that map to the W chromosome. Examining the data at the level of single genes, we observed that module E-assigned W genes were far more likely than non-module E genes to show no or little putative Z paralog mapping (more genes on or near the 0% line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g, h</xref>).

We observed similar results in module E vs other modules for W expression in song nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i, j</xref>). While the male read mapping of the W genes in modules F, G, and L does appear to shift in the song system relative to the surrounds, each of these modules contains a single W gene, and all three of these genes are lowly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).</p><p>These results demonstrate that rather than being confounded by chromosome dose, WGCNA allowed us to resolve the effects of dose in an unbiased way. Module E grouped together the un-dosage-compensated Z chromosome and W chromosome genes across brain regions. In contrast, the Z chromosome genes placed in modules specialized for one or more song nuclei had some level of dosage compensation in males. This compensation appeared regionally patterned for Z chromosome genes in module G (enriched in two or more song nuclei depending on treatment), which were specialized beyond the normal chromosome dosage only within the song system.

For all four comparisons, we found the higher the correlation of module G genes to the MEG-G, the higher the correlation with the vocal learning specialization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–d</xref>).

The birds were given either a vehicle or E2 from hatching, which induces rudimentary vocal learning behavior in females where it would otherwise be absent. In control females, HVC appeared unspecialized at the level of gene module expression, with no significantly differentially expressed MEGs compared to the surrounding nidopallium. However, in E2-treated females, HVC exhibited a subset of the observed male HVC gene expression specializations. Similarly, in the vehicle-treated females, the striatum located where Area X would also lack any specialized gene module expression, but the E2-treated female Area X had a subset of specialized gene expression as in males. This contrasts with RA and LMAN, which were similarly specialized in males and females in the absence of E2 treatment. Given that lesions of HVC prevent the emergence of Area X in E2-treated females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herrmann and Arnold, 1991</xref>), these results support a model of zebra finch development where transcriptomic masculinization of female HVC by E2 is a critical event which facilitates the emergence of female Area X and ultimately endows these females to produce some rudimentary learned song.</p><p>How did E2 treatment produce the transcriptomic effects we observed with module G in female HVC, and what are the implications regarding sexually dimorphic vocal learning in the zebra finch? One possibility is that this process begins with increased estrogen receptor (ER) activity within developing HVC cells after being provided surplus activating ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frankl Vilches and Gahr, 2018</xref>), followed by altered transcription of ER targets in the genome. Module G contained the AR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), which is believed to be a major downstream effector of the E2 response in female zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nordeen et al., 1986</xref>). This initial transcriptional loading of the system would then have been processed by gene regulatory networks within each cell, spreading in effect through the transcriptome. It is possible that differential module G expression arose purely from traditional gene regulatory networks, where transcription factors form complex, elaborate feedback networks with themselves and the genes they regulate. However, this framework fails to explain why the core 14 vocal learning correlated genes from module G in HVC were enriched for transcripts from a single chromosome: the Z sex chromosome with halved copy number in females.</p><p>We hypothesize that the Z chromosome genes identified here are co-regulated, necessary components of a growth-enabling transcriptional program downstream of ER, represented by module G. This module G transcriptional program could be specialized to developing male HVC by the expression of patterning genes, such as <italic>SIX2,</italic> early in development and maintained through persistent <italic>GHR</italic> signaling. We propose that these Z chromosome transcripts in module G are reduced in females by lower haplotype dosage during development and thus fail to specialize female HVC. Due to the lower abundance of gene products from module G, female HVC may be unable to accommodate new neurons during juvenile development and fail to facilitate the emergence of its downstream target Area X. Similarly, without a sufficiently developed HVC, RA lacks one of its major inputs and may subsequently atrophy. We propose that E2 masculinizes female song behavior by increasing the abundance of these module G transcripts in HVC, increasing specialized HVC growth, and facilitating the emergence of HVC’s other major target, Area X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This model of sex chromosome-influenced song system development is consistent with recent work comparing male and female zebra finch transcriptomes from RA at young juvenile (PHD20) and young adult (PHD50) ages in un-manipulated birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedrich et al., 2022</xref>). While that study proposed that the role of the sex chromosome in maintaining transcriptomic sex differences diminishes across development as the proportion of specialized genes that originate on the sex chromosomes diminishes, this effect was driven by large increases in differentially expressed autosomal genes rather than by any reduction in sex chromosome dimorphism; the percentage of differentially expressed Z chromosome genes increased from 28% at PHD20 to 39% at PHD50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedrich et al., 2022</xref>). This leads us to conclude that sexually dimorphic Z chromosome expression in juveniles precedes the sexually dimorphic expression of the autosomes seen in adults. This is consistent with our hypothesis that sufficient expression of select Z chromosome gene products (GHR, etc.) is necessary for subsequent autosomal song system specializations (module G). Further, our results are consistent with GH’s known role in avian neuroprotection, with elevated signaling associated with the survival of chicken neurons during rounds of pruning in the developing retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harvey et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of sexually dimorphic zebra finch vocal learning.</title><p>We propose that estradiol treatment in female zebra finches masculinizes song behavior by overcoming insufficient Z sex chromosome dosage in HVC to increase the expression of transcripts normally depleted in females. The Z chromosome genes upregulated by E2 are components in a larger proliferative genetic program which prevents HVC atrophy in males and allows for its expansion late in development. The upregulation of these genes allows for the increased specialization of the gene networks they participate in, promoting HVC development sufficiently to enable rudimentary vocal learning in females.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89425-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our results help refine the traditional notion that hormonal signaling organizes the brain to produce sexually dimorphic behaviors independent of neuronal sex chromosome content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Phoenix et al., 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold, 2009</xref>). Instead, our data indicate that sexual dimorphism of the zebra finch song learning ability was likely established by the interaction of sex hormone signaling and sex chromosome gene expression within HVC during development. These findings are thematically similar to work in the Four Core Genotypes mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Vries et al., 2002</xref>), where chromosomal and gonadal sex are separable by translocating the sex-determining <italic>Sry</italic> gene. In these mice, sex chromosome composition regulates sexually dimorphic brain gene expression, circuit anatomy, and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Vries et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McPhie Lalmansingh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox and Rissman, 2011</xref>), though the sex chromosome genes responsible remain unknown. Additional experiments manipulating the candidate genes implicated here in developing HVC to both mimic and prevent the action of E2 in female zebra finches are needed to test these hypotheses.</p><p>In addition to these vocal learning-focused results, performing unbiased gene network analysis with samples taken throughout the zebra finch telencephalon in both sexes revealed a surprisingly strong relationship between the modular organization of telencephalic gene expression and the chromosomal structure of the genome. Each of the 12 modules identified by WGCNA was enriched for genes from at least one chromosome. Of these significant enrichments, those on the micro- and sex chromosomes stood out as particularly strong. Module E encompassed the majority of W and Z chromosome genes and was sexually dimorphic in its expression in all sampled regions. Indeed, we found that roughly ⅓ of sex chromosome transcripts are significantly sexually dimorphic in all nonvocal brain regions, and roughly ⅔ are sexually dimorphic in at least one region. This half-brain-wide and half-regionally patterned sexual dimorphism observed from the sex chromosomes may act as a substrate for the evolution of sexually dimorphic behaviors generally, with brain-wide shifts in expression providing a transcriptional background for the evolution of sex-specific patterning in additional sex chromosome genes. These regionally patterned sex chromosome genes could then recruit gene expression networks from somatic chromosomes, resulting in the sex-specific anatomical patterning of gene expression from throughout the genome. This general model is consistent with local reduction of GHR and other Z chromosome transcripts in the developing HVC lineage, leading to a loss of specialized module G expression in female HVC from somatic chromosomes. This hypothesis of an interaction between sex chromosomes and autosomes linked to the gain and loss of vocal learning in one sex can be tested in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal handling and sample preparation</title><p>The 96 samples used in the present analysis are the E2- or vehicle-treated subset of a previously published RNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choe et al., 2021</xref>).

We tested the statistical significance of Z chromosome enrichment in this core gene list with an upper-tailed hypergeometric test, implemented in phyper, where each core gene is a sampling event without replacement from module-assigned genes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>HM has received royalties from Chemcom, received research grants from Givaudan and received consultant fees from Kao</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The 96 samples used in the present analysis are the E2 or vehicle treated subset of a previously published RNAseq dataset.

Only male zebra finches sing, learn song, and normally have a fully developed song control circuitry, so the study was aimed at further understanding how genetic and hormonal factors contribute to the dimorphism in song behavior and related brain circuitry in this species. Using WGCNA and follow-up correlations to re-analyze published transcriptome datasets, the authors provide evidence that the main variance of several identified gene co-expression modules significantly correlates with one or some of the factors examined, including sex, estrogen treatment, regional neuroanatomy, chromosomal placement, or vocal learning, noting that the latter is largely based on inference due to expression in song control nuclei.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Among the main strengths are the thorough gene co-expression module and correlation analyses, and the inclusion of both song nuclei and adjacent areas, the latter serving as sort of controls for areas that are not dimorphic and likely broadly present in birds in general. In situ hybridization data discussed in a previous publication (Choe et al., Hormones and Behavior, 2021) provides some support for the neuroanatomical specializations of gene expression. It is also significant that the transcriptome re-analysis was performed with an improved genome assembly that also includes the sex chromosomes, thus expanding the Z/W chromosome gene analyses in Friedrich et al, Cell Reports, 2022. The most relevant finding is arguably the identification of some modules where gene expression variation within song nuclei correlates with hormonal effects and/or gene location on sex chromosomes, which are present at different dosages between sexes. Sex differences in gene expression in areas that are not song nuclei may also bring insights into functions other than song behavior or vocal learning. The study also shows how a published RNA-seq dataset can be reanalyzed in novel and informative ways.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The validation of the inferred direction of regulation in the identified co-expression modules is limited to the in situ data mentioned above. Further evidence that representative genes in the main modules differ in expression when comparing sexes or E2- vs VEH-treated tissues using independent samples and/or methods would provide further validation and enhance rigor. Most importantly, E2 is known to exert various actions on brain physiology and neuronal function. Because there was no manipulation of candidate genes, nor assessment/manipulation of vocal behavior or vocal learning, an involvement of the identified candidate genes in setting up the sexual dimorphism of the song system or song behavior was not directly tested in this study. For the latter reason, the implication of the Title (...&quot;gene expression associated with vocal learning...&quot;) is not well supported. While novel insights were gained into brain expression of Z chromosome genes, it cannot be excluded that the higher male expression of some Z genes may not affect brain cell function and thus may not require active compensation (as discussed for nucleus RA in Friedrich et al, Cell Reports, 2022).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89425.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Davenport</surname><given-names>Matthew H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0420db125</institution-id><institution>Laboratory Language Neurogenetics, The Rockefeller University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York City</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Choe</surname><given-names>Ha Na</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00py81415</institution-id><institution>Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Matsunami</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00py81415</institution-id><institution>Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff><aff><institution>Department of Neurobiology, Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jarvis</surname><given-names>Erich D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0420db125</institution-id><institution>Laboratory Language Neurogenetics, The Rockefeller University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York City</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/006w34k90</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chevy Chase</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p><p>This study is useful as it provides further analysis of previously published data to address which specific genes are part of the masculinizing actions of E2 on female zebra finches, and where these key genes are expressed in the brain. However the data supporting the conclusion of masculinizing the song system are incomplete as the current manuscript is a re-analysis of differential gene expression modulated by E2 treatment between male/female zebra finches without manipulation of gene expression. The conclusions (and title) regarding song learning are also incompletely supported with no gene manipulation or song analysis. Importantly, the use of WGCNA for a question of sex-chromosome expression in species without dosage compensation is considered inadequate. As the experimental design did not include groups to directly test for song learning, and there was also no analysis of song performance, these data were also considered inadequate in that regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry the editor felt the manuscript so incomplete and inadequate. Though the tone of this assessment seems more severe than the below reviewer comments, we are also happy to see that the editor has considered our paper further for a revised publication, based on the reviewer’s comments. We address the editor’s comments as follows:</p><p>While we agree that manipulation of some of the genes we discovered, whose expression levels are E2-sensitive in the song system, would take the study further in validating some proposed hypothesis in the discussion of the paper, we don’t think the outcome of gene manipulations would change the major conclusions from the results of the paper. In this study we performed estrogen hormone manipulations, with causal consequences on gene expression in song nuclei and associated song behavior. In a way this is analogous to gene manipulations, but manipulating directly the action of estrogen. The categories of genes impacted, and the differences among the sex chromosomes wouldn’t change.</p><p>For the comment on WGCNA being inadequate for addressing questions on sex chromosome expression in species without dosage compensation, we think the evidence in our data does not bear that out. One main result of this paper is the separation of Z chromosome transcripts whose expression is most strongly regulated by chromosomal dosage (WGCNA module E) across regions from those subject to additional sources of regulation in song nuclei (other modules). It seems to us that rather than being confounded by the lack of dosage compensation, WGCNA allowed us to better resolve the effects of dosage on different genes within the sex chromosomes. We have added a new figure more directly examining sex chromosome transcript abundance within different modules. Briefly, we found that module E assigned Z chromosome genes exhibited almost exactly the male-biased expression ratio expected from no dosage compensation while the Z chromosome genes in song nuclei assigned to other modules were expressed below the dosage predicted value, consistent with module E containing those genes whose expression are most strongly regulated by dose across all brain regions sampled.</p><p>At its core, WGCNA finds sets of correlated genes. The biological reality of the zebra finch transcriptome is that Z chromosome expression is largely anti-correlated with W chromosome due to dosage. However, this dosage effect is not felt equally by all genes and WGCNA provides an unbiased computational framework which can be used to separate dose from other potential sources of gene regulation. This is why roughly ⅓ of Z chromosome genes are not assigned to module E; for example the growth hormone receptor is assigned to module G based on its correlation with genes upregulated within HVC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“As the experimental design did not include groups to directly test for song learning, and there was also no analysis of song performance, these data were also considered inadequate in that regard.”</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning the comment on no analysis on song performance in the paper, all such analyses were conducted on our previous study on the same animals (Choe et al. 2021, Hormones &amp; Behavior). The birds considered here were sacrificed at PHD30, prior to the onset of learned song behavior. However, females treated with E2 the same at the same time and allowed to mature into adulthood, went onto to develop rudimentary song. Further, induction of rudimentary song learning in females following E2 treatment has been well established since the early ‘80s. We have added the following text toward the end of the intro to make this more clear:</p><p>“While the birds for this study were sacrificed prior to the developmental presentation of song behavior, we have previously shown that female finches treated in exactly the say way with E2 go on to produce rudimentary imitative songs as adults (Choe et al 2021), consistent with the known induction of vocal learning in females by E2 (REF).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, this is a wonderfully designed and executed study that takes full advantage of new resources, such as the most complete zebra finch genome assembly yet, as well as the latest methods. I have very few suggestions as to the improvement of the manuscript. They are as follows:</p><p>Results Section:</p><p>In the paragraph &quot;Identification of gene expression modules in song nuclei&quot;:</p><p>&quot;The E2-treated females in this study had similarly sized song system nuclei as males, indicating that E2 treatment prevented atrophy.&quot;</p><p>Clarify if this comparison is to treated and/or untreated males.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. The relative differences in the song nuclei sizes between the E2-treated females and the other groups is more complex that our original sentence implied. We have revised the main the text as follows</p><p>“In our previous study, we found that estradiol treatment in PHD30 females caused HVC to enlarge and Area X to appear when it normally does not develop in females, but both at sizes less than in untreated or treated males.The sizes of PHD30 female LMAN RA were already the sizes as seen in males, as the later has not atrophied yet at this age(25).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the paragraph &quot;Sex- and micro-chromosome gene expression across the telencephalon&quot;: &quot;These animal and chromosome specific shifts in the transcriptomes could represent the systemic effects of allelic chromosomal structural variation...&quot;</p><p>The authors should clarify the meaning of a&quot;llelic chromosomal structural variation&quot; in this context, as it is an unusual phrase. Major chromosomal structural variation seems unlikely to produce these effects. Is it also possible that animal-specific modules with brain-wide higher could also result from laboratory contamination between all samples from one animal? This is not too likely but perhaps should be acknowledged or ruled out.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the word allelic, which was unnecessary. We can’t envision how laboratory contamination could occur such that all of one animal’s samples would be affected to produce the observed result which is module and chromosome specific. An animal wide effect could emerge during sacrifice, but we can think of no reason that would affect these modules and not others. Rather, the most likely explanation is biological natural difference between animals. We have added this consideration of alternative explanations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the section &quot;Candidate gene drivers of HVC specialization in E2-treated females&quot;:</p><p>When discussing GHR's role in cell growth and proliferation, the authors' argument could be expanded by including the documented role of GH signaling in anti-apoptotic protection of neurons from rounds of neural pruning during development as documented in the chicken, e.g. • Harvey S, Baudet M-L, Sanders EJ. 2009.

Then identify the composition of modules that differ between E2 and vehicle-treated females and compare these genes to males. Then from male WGCNA identify the composition of modules that differ between E2 and vehicle-treated males and compare to female modules.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestions. However, we believe it is not as strong as the approach we used, which is grouping data from both sexes in the WGCNA analyses in a study that is looking for sex differences. The reviewer's proposed approach amounts to computing modules twice (once per sex), determining song system specialized modules and E2 responsive modules in both settings, then intersecting the two sets to find corresponding modules, all done to prevent the non-dose compensated sex chromosome genes from being drawn into the same module.</p><p>While WGCNA does group the majority of sex chromosome genes into module E, it does not categorize them all this way (Fig 3). The module classification instead differentiates those sex chromosome genes whose expression are most explained by chromosome dosage / sex across regions (modE) from those whose expression is controlled by other sources of regulation; for an example of the latter, the growth hormone receptor (GHR) is one of several Z chromosome genes classified into modG as its expression better correlates with the genes specialized to HVC than it does with the majority of dosage-dependent Z chromosome genes found in modE. Further, to remove biological sex as a variable in a WGCNA analysis that is focused on sex differences seems counterintuitive.</p><p>Instead, to quantitatively address the reviewer’s concern, we conducted additional analyses, that led to an added new figure, associated text, and tables, that better describes sex/chromosome dosage effects on the abundance (FPKM) and expression ratios of sex chromosome transcripts by module irrespective of brain region (Fig. 5). We find that the Z chromosome genes in modE were expressed at the expected chromosome dosage in the non-vocal surrounding regions (65.06% observed vs 66.6% expected) while in other modules, other Z chromosome genes were expressed at intermediate levels between equal expression and the expected chromosomal dosage. For example, the Z chromosome content of modules D and H exhibited near equal expression between sexes. Within the song system, Z chromosome gene content of modG was highly expressed in males beyond what is expected from chromosome dosage, consistent with modG’s male-specific upregulation in song nuclei relative to surrounds in the absence of E2. These results better demonstrate that in our WGCNA on the combined dataset we are able to separate those Z chromosome genes whose expression is predominantly dosage controlled from those subject to additional regulation such as song system specialization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. S3 Legend: 'Black arrow' -&gt; 'Red arrow'</p></disp-quote><p>Change made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. S5 - What part of the figure shows the 'human convergent signature'?

Given the number of genes per chromosome and genes per module in our data, we computed the fold-enrichment for each intersection (observed intersection size / expected intersection size). To test for the significance of these enrichments, we bootstrapped FDR corrected p values for the enrichment of each chromosome-module pairing by randomizing the mapping of genes to modules to construct a null distribution of fold enrichments for each intersection. Our intent was not to describe the size of the chromosomes themselves, information readily available elsewhere, but to show the disproportionate chromosomal origins of the gene sets considered by this study. Performing this enrichment test using all annotated genes per chromosome would artificially increase enrichment values and make the analysis less conservative by confounding the results with the inherent enrichment for “brain function” in the assigned genes relative to all genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At several places you say &quot;we correlated expression of each sex chromosome transcript with sexual dimorphism within each region, such that expressed W genes would be positively correlated and depleted Z chromosome genes would be anticorrelated.&quot; What was the sexual dimorphism that was being correlated with?

The most relevant findings relate to the presumed actions of hormone treatment and sex chromosome gene dosage in song nuclei, whereas analyses of other brain areas, other chromosomes, or speech-related genes serve more as controls and/or appear as distractions from the main theme. A suggestion to increase the clarity of the presentation and potential impact of the study is to change the order of the presentation, focusing first on the specific analyses and comparisons that most directly speak to the main goals of the study, and then secondarily and more briefly presenting the controls or less related comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s suggestion for the results section organization is exactly what we had tried to do. We opened the first paragraph on identification of modules, then presented the song nuclei specific modules, followed by E2-changes to those modules; and the followed by other specific results for the remainder of the paper, including module enrichments to specific chromosomes. The reviewer mentioned our analyses of “other brain areas” (which we assume to mean the non-vocal surround regions), other chromosomes (which we assume means autosomes) and speech-related genes as controls were a distraction in the paper; but within our analysis, these other brain regions are essential controls needed to assess the song-system specificity of any observed sex differences observed from the very first paragraphs of the results; the autosomes were not controls for sex chromosome results, but primary results in of themselves; the overlap with speech-related genes was also not a control, but a novel discovery. We have revised these points in the paper to make them clearer, and revised some of the section titles and transitions between sections to help increase clarity of the main storyline of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related comment is that many of the inferences drawn from the WGCNA analysis were quite complex, thus independent verification of some predictions would be quite valuable. For example, consider the passage: &quot;In non-vocal learning juvenile females, interestingly LMAN was specialized relative to the AN by the same gene modules as in males (B, F, and I) as well as an additional module G (Fig. 2b); RA was specialized by module A as in males, but not module L and by additional modules A and G. In contrast, neither juvenile female HVC nor Area X exhibited significant gene module expression specializations relative to their surrounds.&quot; Providing in situ hybridization verification of these regional gene expression predictions with a few representative genes seems quite feasible given the group's expertise and would considerably strengthen confidence in the module-based inferences.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed in-situ independent validation of 36 candidate genes in our first study with this dataset (Choe et al 2021). We now mention this validation in the revised paper. The reviewer’s selection of one of our sentences though made us realize that our grammar used to explain the results was not as clear as it needs to be. We thus cleaned up the grammar of our module descriptions so that it should be communicated with less complexity, the main issue noted by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because this is a re-analysis of a previously published dataset, the authors should more explicitly describe somewhere in the Discussion how the present analysis advances the understanding of sex differences in songbird neuroanatomy and behavior beyond the previous analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an additional sentence into the discussion more clearly separating the results of the current study from our previous work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>There is evidence (from Frank Johnson's lab) that RA does not completely atrophy in female zebra finches, but is still present with more preserved connectivity than previously thought, possibly related to non-singing function(s).

Can they clarify whether the VEH-treated females actually had smaller RAs than E2-treated females or VEH-treated males at this age? This is still quite early in development and it is unclear to what extent RA's marked sexual dimorphism in adults or later developmental ages has already taken place in untreated (or VEH-treated) birds. A related comment is that the authors state later on: &quot;We interpret these findings to indicate that: LMAN and RA atrophy later in juvenile female development...&quot; Does this mean these nuclei actually did not show the marked decreases predicted earlier in the text? Clarifying this point would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this discrepancy, which reviewer #1 asked for clarification as well. RA size at this age is similar in males and females. However, HVC and Area X is smaller and absent respectively in females and E2 treatment partially prevents this atrophy.

For example: &quot;... that module A and G genes could be associated with the start of this atrophy; HVC and Area X are likely the first to atrophy or not develop; and lack of any gene module specialization in them at this age could mean that they would be more sensitive to estrogen prevention of vocal learning loss.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have removed this text from the results; these ideas were already presented in the Discussion. We have merged the resulting small paragraph with the preceding paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state: &quot;To assess the effects of chronic exogenous estrogen on the developing song system, we first performed a control analysis of modules in the E2-treated juvenile males.&quot; How can an assessment of estrogen effects be a &quot;control&quot; analysis?

We removed the word “control”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When discussing the GO-enriched terms for module G, it is unclear how the authors reached the conclusion about &quot;proliferative&quot;, as the enriched terms do not refer to processes more directly indicative of proliferation like &quot;cell division&quot; or &quot;cell cycle regulation&quot;. Rather, these terms seem more related to differentiation and growth, which do not necessarily imply proliferation. The authors also refer to &quot;HVC proliferation&quot; later on in the Discussion. However, there is conclusive evidence from several labs that proliferative events associated with postnatal neuronal addition and/or replacement in song nuclei occur in the subventricular zone, not in song nuclei like HVC itself, and that the growth of song nuclei largely reflects cell survival, as well as growth in size and complexity under the regulation of sex steroids.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that “proliferative” may have been a poor word choice here. We did not mean to indicate that cell division was occuring in HVC itself. Instead we meant to indicate that HVC is able to accommodate the new born neurons from the SVZ.

In the instance the reviewer mentions specifically we replaced it with,“...potentially act to integrate and differentiate late born neurons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regard to module E, referring to a telencephalon-wide sexually dimorphic gene expression program seems quite a stretch, given that only a few regions were sampled and compared between sexes.

This is potentially enacted by depleting necessary gene products from the Z sex chromosome, such as GHR, which are already present in only one copy.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have deleted this portion of the text, as the idea is already present in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: To this reviewer, the comparisons of sex differences and of female response to E2 are the most relevant and informative ones, whereas the regional differences between song nuclei and surrounds refer to different cell populations and cell types where other processes may be occurring, independently of what occurs in song nuclei. It thus seems like the intersection analysis in panel 5i may be subtracting out important &quot;core genes&quot; in terms of E2 effects and/or sex differences in the most relevant cell populations, i.e. in this case within song nucleus HVC.</p></disp-quote><p>Song learning and the vocal learning brain regions are specialized behaviors and associated nuclei which have a set of hundreds of specialized genes compared to the surrounds. Our previous findings shows that E2 drives the appearance of these specializations in female zebra finches. Thus, we considered this the most interesting question to focus on, which we have further highlighted. Nevertheless, in response to the reviewers suggestion, we have added a .xlsx supplemental file containing the results from each of the individual tests so readers may examine any single comparison, or set of comparisons, in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>It is unclear what the term &quot;critical period&quot; refers to in: &quot;during the critical period of atrophy for the female vocal circuit&quot;; please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our language was nebulous.

Please clarify. The same comment applies to other uses of &quot;unspecialized&quot; in this paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, unspecialized means lack of difference in gene expression in the song nucleus. To clarify this point, we have reworked that and the following sentence as follows:</p><p>“HVC appeared unspecialized compared to the surrounding nidopallium at the level of gene module expression in control females, with no significantly differentially expressed MEGs . However, in E2-treated females, HVC exhibited a subset of the observed male HVC gene expression specializations. Similarly, the vehicle-treated female striatum located where Area X would be also lacked any specialized gene module expression, but the E2-treated female Area X exhibited a subset of the male Area X specializations, consistent with the known absence of Area X in vehicle-treated females and presence in E2-treated females.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state: &quot;...we surprisingly found that the most specialized genes were disproportionately from the Z chromosome&quot;, when discussing module G in HVC. Why is this so surprising? In a sense, this could be taken as consistent with the findings of Friedrich et al, 2022, where sex differences in the RA transcriptome were predominantly Z related on 20 dph. Arguably 20 dph is still quite close to 30 dph in the present study, when compared to 50 dph in Friedrich et al, when autosomes predominate.</p></disp-quote><p>Our bioRxiv was originally posted in July 2021, prior to the publication of Friedrich et al, 2022; however we had previously added to our discussion that several of our results are consistent with the observations of Friedrich et al..</p><p>We have a different interpretation of Z chromosome gene results in Friedrich et al.. While the percentage of specialized genes from the Z chromosome decreased, the absolute number of specialized Z chromosome genes actually increased over this interval. In Fig. 3a from Friedrich et al. it appears that ~28% of Z chromosome genes were sexually dimorphic in their expression in RA at PHD20 but that ~39% of Z chromosome genes were similarly dimorphic at PHD50. We interpret this result as the Z chromosome genes being among the earliest genes differentially expressed between the sexes, not that their differential expression or role ever subsequently decreased. We have reworked this portion of the discussion to make our point more clear:</p><p>“This model of sex chromosome influenced song system development is consistent with recent observations comparing male and female zebra finch transcriptomes from RA at young juvenile (PHD20) and young adult (PHD50) ages in un-manipulated birds (Friedrich et al. 2022)57. While that study proposes that the role of the sex chromosome in maintaining transcriptomic sex differences diminishes across development, as the proportion of specialized genes that originate on the sex chromosomes diminishes, this effect was driven by large increases in differentially expressed autosomal genes rather than by any reduction in sex chromosome dimorphism; the percentage of differentially expressed Z chromosome genes increased from PHD20 (28%) to PHD50 (39%) (Friedrich et al). This leads us to conclude that sexually dimorphic Z chromosome expression at juvenile ages precedes the sexually dimorphic expression of the autosomes seen in adults. This is consistent with our hypothesis that sufficient expression of select Z chromosome gene products (GHR, etc..) is necessary for subsequent autosomal song system specializations (modG).”</p><p>Further, when we write ”When examining the module G HVC specialization induced by E2-treatment in female HVC, we surprisingly found that the most specialized genes were disproportionately from the Z chromosome” we are referring to the upregulation of module G by E2 in female HVC, not the sex difference described in RA by Friedrich et al. which only utilized un-treated RA samples and thus is more likely related to our observations of module E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The term &quot;sexual dimorphism&quot; has been more traditionally used for sex differences that are very marked, like features that are highly regressed or absent in one sex, most often in females. Quantitative differences in gene expression, including dosage differences like those related to module E, are more appropriately described as sex differences rather than dimorphisms. That usage would be more consistent with most of the literature, and thus preferable.</p></disp-quote><p>We did a google search for common definitions, and found more the opposite. Sexual dimorphism being used more often as differences of degree (with the zebra finch example as one of the top hits), and sex differences being used often as more absolute differences (like presence vs absence of the Y chromosome). Further, as in the reviewer’s first sentence, the definition of sexual dimorphism is a sex difference. That is, the two phrases can be interchangeable. Thus, we prefer to keep sexual dimorphism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several references are incomplete or seem truncated, like 9 and 10.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Table S2: Please examine and take into account the W gene curation presented in Table S3 of Friedrich et al., 2022.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional supplementals (supplemetal_w_chrom_express.csv and supplemetal_z_chrom_express.csv) of the data provided in new Fig 5 incorporating the curation information from Table S3 from Friedrich et al.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data availability:</p><p>Genes for all the main modules identified should be presented in a Supplemental Table, or through a link to a stable data repository.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an additional Supplemental Table supplemental_gene_module_assignment.csv with this information.</p></body></sub-article></article>
