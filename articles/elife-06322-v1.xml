No causal genes except <italic>MVK</italic> have been identified, even though the disease was linked to several genomic loci. Here, we performed massively parallel sequencing and exonic CNV screening of 12 isoprenoid genes in 134 index PK patients (61 familial and 73 sporadic) and identified causal mutations in three novel genes (<italic>PMVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic>, and <italic>FDPS</italic>) in addition to <italic>MVK</italic> in the mevalonate pathway. Allelic expression imbalance (AEI) assays were performed in 13 lesional tissues. At least one mutation in one of the four genes in the mevalonate pathway was found in 60 (98%) familial and 53 (73%) sporadic patients, which suggests that isoprenoid biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of PK. Significantly reduced expression of the wild allele was common in lesional tissues due to gene conversion or some other unknown mechanism. A G-to-A RNA editing was observed in one lesional tissue without AEI. In addition, we observed correlations between the mutations in the four mevalonate pathway genes and clinical manifestations in the PK patients, which might support a new and simplified classification of PK under the guidance of genetic testing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06322.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06322.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06322.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Porokeratosis refers to a group of around twenty skin conditions that involve a build-up of a protein called keratin in skin cells. Keratin forms the tough fibres that give strength to hair and nails, and people suffering from porokeratosis develop hardened skin lesions. Porokeratosis is an uncommon condition; most cases are inherited and have been linked to exposure to ultraviolet light and having a weakened immune system.</p><p>Mutations in one gene called <italic>MVK</italic> are known to cause two forms of the disorder, but it is suspected that other genetic causes of porokeratosis will also be identified. The <italic>MVK</italic> gene encodes an enzyme that is involved in making chemicals called isoprenoids. This large and diverse class of chemicals provides the building blocks for making many other important molecules in all living species. Zhang, Li et al. have now analysed genetic material from 134 different porokeratosis patients to search for mutations in other genes involved in the production of isoprenoids. The patients examined include 61 people with a family history of the disorder, and 73 cases in which the condition seems to be a one-off occurrence.</p><p>This search identified mutations in three additional genes (called <italic>PMVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic> and <italic>FDPS</italic>) that are all linked to porokeratosis. Further analysis of these three genes and <italic>MVK</italic> revealed that about half of the patients with mutations in the <italic>MVK</italic> gene developed large lesions (that were over 5 centimetres in diameter). However, those with mutations in the other three genes did not develop such large lesions. Mutations in some of the newly identified genes were instead linked to porokeratosis affecting specific areas of the body; for example, <italic>PMVK</italic> and <italic>MVD</italic> mutations are linked to porokeratosis localized to the genitals and around the eyes, respectively. This means that, in the future, doctors might be able to simplify the diagnosis of the different varieties of porokeratosis based on information gained via genetic tests.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06322.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06322.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>porokeratosis</kwd><kwd>mevalonate pathway</kwd><kwd>genetic testing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Pujiang Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>none</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhenghua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research special fund for public welfare of health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201002016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhenghua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005890</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Construct Construction of National Key Clinical Specialty in Shanghai, Ministry of Health</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhenghua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mutations in four members of the mevalonate pathway have been identified from 134 index porokeratosis patients, including some that correlate with specific clinical manifestations of the disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Porokeratosis (PK, MIM 175800) is a heterogeneous group of keratinization disorders that exhibit an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. PK is also a skin-specific autoinflammatory disease which was often inherited and linked to ultraviolet light exposure and immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Schamroth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramovits and Oquendo, 2013</xref>). For example, eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis exemplifies the inflammatory manifestation, and complications to inflammatory conditions such as localized cutaneous amyloidosis are seen in PK patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biswas, 2015</xref>). Indeed, PK and psoriasis share some features at both clinical and molecular levels and sometimes coexist in the same patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>As a histological hallmark that unifies all variants of PK, cornoid lamella (CL) is a vertical ‘column’ of parakeratosis. The pattern of CL can be slender, broad, or confluent, which is related to epidermal hyperplasia and dermal inflammation. However, CL is not a unique feature of PK because it can be seen in some inflammatory and inherited cutaneous disorders and also as an incidental finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biswas, 2015</xref>).</p><p>PK is currently classified according to the clinical manifestations, such as number, size, morphology, and distribution of the histological lesions. A better system of classification is expected because some variants of PK are fraught with confusing terminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Schamroth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sertznig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biswas, 2015</xref>). For example, it is sometimes hard to completely differentiate disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) from disseminated superficial porokeratosis (DSP) by age of onset and sun-exposed areas.</p><p>In addition to the heterogeneity in clinical manifestations, genetic heterogeneity is also observed in PK. At least five linkage loci (i.e., 12q23.2-24.1, 15q25.1-26.1, 18p11.3, 1p31.3-p31.1, 16q24.1-24.3) have been reported for the disseminated forms of PK which include DSAP, DSP, porokeratosis palmaris et plantaris disseminata (PPPD), and immunosuppression-induced porokeratosis (ISIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Schamroth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9c">Luan et al., 2011</xref>). However, only one causal gene, the mevalonate kinase gene (<italic>MVK</italic>) at 12q24, has been identified in DSAP and porokeratosis of Mibille (PM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9b">Li and Zhang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zeng et al., 2014</xref>). Here we performed genetic analysis in 134 index patients with PK to identify additional causal genes and to establish new parameters for better differential diagnosis of PK. Allelic expression imbalance (AEI) and cDNA mutation were analyzed in 13 pairwise lesional tissues (LTs) and neighboring normal-appearing skin (NNS) to investigate the underlying pathogenicity of PK.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Co-segregation of mevalonate (diphospho) decarboxylase (<italic>MVD</italic>) mutation with PK</title><p>We previously identified a linkage locus for DSAP on chromosome 16q24.1-24.3 in a four-generation Chinese DSAP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9c">Luan et al., 2011</xref>).

The extension primer has a 5′ exonuclease-resistance modification and the block probe has a 5′ phosphorate and 3′exonuclease-resistance modification. These two oligos are mixed with genomic DNA, heat-denatured, and then annealed to the same strand of the target DNA fragment. The primer extends and stops until it meets the block probe, and the extension product is then ligated with the block probe by a thermal stable ligase. The above procedure can be repeated n times on the PCR machine using a two-step PCR cycling program. The extension and ligation product is then purified by an exonuclase mixture digestion to remove any DNA fragment with no exonuclease-resistance modification at both ends such as remained primers or probes, primer dimers and genomic DNA, and then amplified using universal NGS PCR primer pairs. A CPELA reaction can include hundreds of extension primer-blocking probe sets and simultaneously amplify hundreds of target DNA fragments for subsequent massively parallel sequencing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06322.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06322.010</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06322-fig3-figsupp2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig3s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06322.011</object-id><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>The principle of CNVplex technology.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06322.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06322.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06322-fig3-figsupp3-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Large deletion mutations in <italic>MVK</italic> and <italic>FDPS</italic> were identified in PK patients</title><p>For 27 samples with no confirmed point mutation in <italic>MVK</italic>, <italic>PMVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic>, and <italic>FDPS</italic> genes, large deletion or duplication mutations were interrogated by analyzing the copy number of promoters and all exons in these genes.

Recently, mutations in the <italic>SLC17A9</italic> gene were reported to be another genetic cause for DSAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cui et al., 2014</xref>). We sequenced all exons of <italic>SLC17A9</italic> in these 21 patients by Sanger sequencing but found no mutations in <italic>SLC17A9</italic>.</p><p>RNA editing is a process of some discrete changes to specific nucleotide sequences of a RNA molecule which may be critical during normal development and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Witkin, et al., 2015</xref>). G-to-A RNA editing in PK was first reported in our study. Interestingly, the RNA editing seemed to occur selectively on the one copy of <italic>MVK</italic> and this selective editing pattern seemed to be capable of being transmitted during mitosis. The mechanism underlying this observation should be investigated further.</p><p>Using AEI assays, we observed that the expression of wild allele was significantly reduced to various extents in most LTs (&gt;77%). The variation in the expression reduction level might be due to the LT containing various amounts of normal-appearing keratinocytes and other different types of cells. Somatic loss of function of the wild allele in the epidermal stem cells might play a key role in the formation of lesions, and it might occur spontaneously and be induced by environmental factors such as ultraviolet light.</p><p>There was only one RNA editing identified in the LT, therefore the somatic loss of function of the wild allele in LTs of PK could be mainly caused by suppression of the wild allele through gene conversion in a minor proportion of cases or an unknown DNA methylation-independent epigenetic mechanism in most cases. Allelic imbalance of histone methylation modification unlinked to DNA methylation, whose pattern is able to be transmitted during cell mitosis, could be the DNA methylation-independent epigenetic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Further investigation would be necessary to test this hypothesis. We did not find reduced expression or somatic mutation of the wild allele in only two LTs. The reason for this could be that the LT might contain many normal cells affecting the sensitivity of AEI and mutation detection.</p><p>As a starter button of PK, gene conversion of the wild allele to the mutant allele was first identified in this study. This observation is generally consistent with the phenomenon known as ‘revertant mosaicism’, in which the mutant allele is corrected in some stem cells. Revertant mosaicism is mainly identified in blood diseases such as Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome and Fanconi’s anemia, and skin diseases such as ichthyosis and epidermolysis bullosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">May, 2011</xref>). Revertant mosaicism shows the bright side of gene conversion, but our observation revealed the opposite side. Therefore, gene conversion could be a natural ‘rescue angel’ in some recessive diseases or a ‘damaging devil’ in some dominant diseases, which could mostly affect tissues with extensive ability to self-renew for life.</p><p>Our findings support the notion that Mendelian diseases can be caused by multiple genes involved in the same metabolic or signal transduction pathway, or producing proteins on interaction. The four genes <italic>MVK</italic>, <italic>PMVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic>, and <italic>FDPS</italic> are members of the mevalonate pathway, suggesting that this pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of PK. The mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis provides precursors of isoprenoids, which are ubiquitous in living species and diverse in biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Smit and Mushegian, 2000</xref>) and serve as precursors of cholesterol, heme A, ubiquinones, dolichol, and isoprenylated proteins (e.g., RAS and Lamin B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, it is also the subject of many pharmacological regulating drugs such as statins. It is well known that cholesterol is an important constituent of the cell membrane of most eukaryotic cells, and several inherited disorders have been linked to defects in cholesterol biosynthesis. The isoprenylated proteins play a role in the regulation of cell growth, division, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Moir and Spann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zwerger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davidson and Lammerding, 2014</xref>) and are probably associated with the retained nuclei in the stratum corneum (i.e., parakeratosis). We propose that the accumulation of abnormal metabolites or shortage of isoprenoids might predispose patients to idiopathic inflammation of the skin, and that correction of the abnormal isoprenoid biosynthesis might be a novel therapeutic direction for PK. Further functional studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All procedures followed the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration and were approved by the ethics committee and by the Scientific Ethical Committee of Fudan University.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Stylianos Antonarakis (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Helen Hobbs, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper explores the genetic basis of porokeratosis, a genetically heterogeneous autosomal dominant disorder of keratinization that includes both inherited and sporadic forms. Mutations in mevalonate kinase (MVK), a key enzyme in sterol synthesis, were shown previously by these authors to cause the disease in a subset of individuals, but the etiology in most affected individuals has remained unknown. Here the authors test the hypothesis that the disease is due to defective isoprenoid generation and function. First, they used linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing to identify a second defective gene in the mevalonate pathway that causes this disorder, mevalonate decarboxylase (<italic>MVD</italic>). They then sequenced 12 genes in the mevalonate and isoprenoid pathways in 134 index cases and provide evidence that mutations inactivating 3 more genes in the pathway (<italic>PMVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic> and <italic>FDPS</italic>) also cause this disease. Collectively, implicated variants in the 4 genes identified explain disease in 98% of familial cases and 73% of apparently sporadic cases. They also provide evidence for correlation between the underlying gene and selected aspects of clinical presentation.</p><p>The three reviewers agree that the paper is clearly written and the major conclusions of the paper are supported by the data presented. Although this represents an important advance in the molecular characterization of this disorder, and further implicates and refines the disrupted pathway, the paper does not provide sufficient mechanistic insights to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic> and without such data is better suited for a subspecialty journal. How do defects in mevalonate metabolism cause the keratinization defects – toxic intermediary metabolites vs. deficiency of metabolic end-products? Most individuals were heterozygous for a mutation. Since the genes all encode enzymes, is there a mutation in the normal allele, or possibly in another allele in the pathway, in the skin lesions? Providing data to address any one of these questions would suffice.</p><p>Other major concerns:</p><p>1) While the authors describe that complete co-segregation between each putative mutation and disease was observed (and representative pedigrees are shown), these data should be expanded. While it might not be plausible to show pedigrees for all 60 familial cases with a defined mutation, it would be worth noting the size distribution of families for each gene and the number of families that achieved an independent LOD score &gt;2.0 or &gt;3.0, for example.</p><p>2) Curiously, it is stated that the vast majority of cases associated with variation in <italic>PMVK</italic> or <italic>FDPS</italic> were sporadic. If familial segregation was ever seen for these 2 genes, it should be shown. Genetic evidence that at least some of the sporadic mutations are de novo should be provided. It would also be informative to perform a formal burden test for these 2 genes to document enrichment for novel/rare and predicted deleterious variation in association with phenotype.</p><p>3) There is no evidence of pathogenicity for a number of the missense variants listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> aside from the fact that they are present in cases and not controls (or 1 control, in the case of variant 44, <italic>MVD</italic> c.746T&gt;C in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Providing information regarding the presence of these mutations in the public databases would be informative. A formal burden test for each new gene should be performed.</p><p>4) While the authors acknowledge that <italic>MVK</italic> mutations have previously been observed in other disorders, including mevalonic aciduria (MA) and hyper IgD syndrome (HIGDS), the same appears not to be true for the other 3 genes. Curiously, patients with biallelic mutations causing MA or HIGDS do not show porokeratosis, nor do their heterozygous parents. This is particularly puzzling because this group has identified porokeratosis in individuals heterozygous for some of the same mutations. Variation in environmental exposure (e.g. UV light) has been invoked as a potential mechanism, however this seems less tenable given the complete penetrance seen for porokeratosis in the described families. Somatic loss of the other <italic>MVK</italic> allele in skin lesions was previously excluded in a handful of patients, but this should be revisited in this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06322.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) While the authors describe that complete co-segregation between each putative mutation and disease was observed (and representative pedigrees are shown), these data should be expanded.

There were 5 core families (F-1, F-2, F-3, F-19 and F-24) in which more than 10 family members and blood samples were collected. The maximum two-point LOD score of F-1, F-2, F-3, F-19 and F-24 were 5.56 (D12S79), 8.62 (D12S84), 3.73 (D16S3074), 2.78 (D12S1583), 4.61 (D12S84), respectively. There were 40 probands from different PK families during the past 10 years, which could have been used for confirmation. All of them were adult and came to the out-patient department by themselves. We didn’t examine their family members and collected their blood samples. Therefore, it is difficult to calculate a reasonable LOD score in those non-core pedigrees. The sentence “We confirmed the genomic variations by Sanger sequencing in each family member. Each mutation displayed 100% cosegregation with PK phenotype in the family” may be misleading. Therefore, it was replaced with: “We determined the genomic variations by Sanger sequencing in other family members apart from one with unknown mutation. In 20 pedigrees with more than two blood samples collected, all patients carried the same mutation with the proband, on the contrary, no mutation was detected in all family healthy members”.</p><p><italic>2) Curiously, it is stated that the vast majority of cases associated with variation in</italic> PMVK <italic>or</italic> FDPS <italic>were sporadic. If familial segregation was ever seen for these 2 genes, it should be shown. Genetic evidence that at least some of the sporadic mutations are de novo should be provided. It would also be informative to perform a formal burden test for these 2 genes to document enrichment for novel/rare and predicted deleterious variation in association with phenotype</italic>.</p><p>The sentence “In contrast, mutations in <italic>PMVK</italic> and <italic>FDPS</italic> were mainly found in proband or sporadic cases” was misleading. Since only 9 index patients were identified to carry <italic>PMVK</italic> mutations, and 3 of them were familial cases, and only 4 index patients were identified to carry <italic>FDPS</italic> mutations, and 2 of them were familial cases. Those index patients with negative family history were classified as the sporadic cases. Actually, the sporadic case might not be truly the only one patient in his family, because PK could be late-onset, undiscovered in non-exposure region. Therefore, we deleted this sentence in our revised manuscript. All 73 sporadic cases were adult and collected during the past 10 years, which could have been used for confirmation. Most of them lived separately with their parents and were out of touch with us for years. We didn’t examine those parents and get no informed consent and no peripheral blood from them. We are really sorry for that. The formal burden test is generally used for complex diseases with a large number of samples (Nat Genet. 2012, 29;44:623-630; Hum Mol Genet. 2012,21:R1-9). However, it is not suitable for our study.</p><p><italic>3) There is no evidence of pathogenicity for a number of the missense variants listed in</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref> <italic>aside from the fact that they are present in cases and not controls (or 1 control, in the case of variant 44,</italic> MVD <italic>c.746T&gt;C in</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>). Providing information regarding the presence of these mutations in the public databases would be informative. A formal burden test for each new gene should be performed</italic>.</p><p>The highest frequency mutation (c.746T&gt;C in <italic>MVD</italic>) was identified in one control. This control was a 22 year-old male, who took routine medical examination in the hospital. He had no PK lesions till now and gave negative familial history of skin diseases. He could be predicted to develop PK in future. In view of its high frequency of occurence in PK, p-value of this mutation showed significant difference (p=0.00). Including this common mutation, there were 11 mutations had been identified in at least 2 index patients, but not in 270 controls. There are 7 mutations in <italic>MVK</italic> have been reported as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, moreover, 5 mutations of them were identified in at least 2 index patients and 2 mutations of them were identified in 2 different sporadic cases. There were 4 mutations identified only in one family, but more than 2 patients in the pedigree were identified to carry this mutation and other healthy family members were not. Thus, at least 17 mutations in <italic>MVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic> and <italic>PMVK</italic> could be considered as pathogenic with strong evidence.</p><p>A formal burden test for each new gene may not be suitable for our study for the following two reasons: 1) the genetic and phenotypic information could provide solid support of <italic>MVK, MVD</italic> and <italic>PMVK</italic> being pathogenic genes of PK, especially <italic>MVK</italic> and <italic>MVD</italic>; 2) A formal burden test is generally used for complex traits with a large number of samples (Nat Genet. 2012, 29;44:623-630; Hum Mol Genet. 2012,21:R1-9). However, PK is regarded as monogenic disease with obvious dominant inheritance and a pedigree-based analysis could provide a more powerful way to identify the pathogenic genes, moreover, there were only 9 and 4 index patients with PK carrying different mutations in <italic>PMVK</italic> and <italic>FDPS</italic>, respectively.</p><p><italic>4) While the authors acknowledge that</italic> MVK <italic>mutations have previously been observed in other disorders, including mevalonic aciduria (MA) and hyper IgD syndrome (HIGDS), the same appears not to be true for the other 3 genes. Curiously, patients with biallelic mutations causing MA or HIGDS do not show porokeratosis, nor do their heterozygous parents. This is particularly puzzling because this group has identified porokeratosis in individuals heterozygous for some of the same mutations. Variation in environmental exposure (e.g. UV light) has been invoked as a potential mechanism, however this seems less tenable given the complete penetrance seen for porokeratosis in the described families. Somatic loss of the other</italic> MVK <italic>allele in skin lesions was previously excluded in a handful of patients, but this should be revisited in this manuscript</italic>.</p><p>Mevalonate kinase deficiency syndrome (MKD) are early onset (usually &lt;12 months), and it was reported that most hyper IgD syndrome (HIGDS) showed mild features of vasculitis (Arch Dermatol. 1994; 130: 59-65). Actually, it is a puzzle that why the patients with MA and HIGDS do not show PK. From the database of hereditary auto-inflammatory disorders mutations, c.417dupC and c.604G&gt;A in <italic>MVK</italic> were both reported in HIDS and PK. As for those heterozygous parents, the possible reason was that pediatricians and rheumatologists might neglect to examine their skin, since they were not familiar with porokeratosis.</p><p>Somatic deletion of the wild <italic>MVK</italic> allele in skin lesions was not detected in our samples either, however, we observed the reduced expression of the wild allele in most skin lesions and a G-to-A RNA editing on the wild allele in one skin lesion. Therefore, the somatic loss of function, but not somatic deletion, of the wild allele in skin lesions should be common.</p></body></sub-article></article>
