the peritoneal cavity occurs in most initially diagnosed ovarian cancer (OC) patients and accounts for most cancer-related death. However, how OC cells interact with peritoneal stromal cells to evade the immune surveillance remains largely unexplored. Here, through an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we identified IL20RA, which decreased dramatically in OC patients during peritoneal metastasis, as a key factor preventing the transcoelomic metastasis of OC. Reconstitution of IL20RA in highly metastatic OC cells greatly suppresses the transcoelomic metastasis. OC cells, when disseminate into the peritoneal cavity, greatly induce peritoneum mesothelial cells to express IL-20 and IL-24, which in turn activate the IL20RA downstream signaling in OC cells to produce mature IL-18, eventually resulting in the polarization of macrophages into the M1-like subtype to clear the cancer cells. Thus, we show an IL-20/IL20RA-mediated crosstalk between OC and mesothelial cells that supports a metastasis-repressing immune microenvironment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>immune crosstalk</kwd><kwd>IL-20</kwd><kwd>IL20RA</kwd><kwd>IL-18</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81772974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81972882</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFE0114300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>63211137</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Longlong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screen identifies an IL-20/IL20RA-mediated crosstalk between peritoneum mesothelial cells and ovarian cancer cells that promotes the formation of M1-like macrophages to prevent ovarian cancer metastasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ovarian cancer (OC) has the highest mortality among all gynecological malignancies that seriously threatens women's health worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). Among OC, epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most common type accounting for 90% of all cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farley et al., 2008</xref>). EOC is classified by tumor cell histology as serous (52%), endometrioid (10%), mucinous (6%), clear cell (6%), and other rare subtypes. Due to the lack of clear symptoms at the early stage, the spread of cancer cells across the peritoneal cavity occurs in most patients at the initial diagnosis, with approximately 70% of OC patients already at metastatic stage (stages III and IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vaughan et al., 2011</xref>). For OC patients with metastasized cancer cells, current therapies including chemotherapy and targeted therapies can only achieve very limited clinical outcome, with the 5-year survival rate of 20–40% for OC patients at advanced stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Torre et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although OC cells can metastasize to other distant organs through blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, the transcoelomic metastasis of OC occurs most commonly, which includes multiple processes, such as detachment of tumor cells from primary sites, immune evasion of disseminated tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity, and colonization of tumor cells on the omentum and peritoneum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tan et al., 2006</xref>). Disseminated OC cells have to survive in a peritoneal environment constituted by lymphocytes, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, fibroblasts, mesothelial cells, as well as cytokines and chemokines secreted by these cells for a successful transcoelomic metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed and Stenvers, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Worzfeld et al., 2017</xref>). Although the role of the immune microenvironment in peritoneal cavity is indisputable in the metastasis of OC, the molecular network regulating the crosstalk between the disseminated tumors cells and immune microenvironment in peritoneal cavity is still just a tip of the iceberg. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the specific immune microenvironment in the peritoneal cavity for developing more efficient immunotherapeutic strategies against metastatic OC.</p><p>To systematically identify key genes involved in the regulation of the peritoneal metastasis of OC, we performed genome-wide gene knockout screening in an orthotopic mouse model of OC by using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout library, which has been successfully utilized to discover novel genes in the occurrence and development of diseases, especially in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>). We identified interleukin 20 receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA) as a potent suppressor of the transcoelomic metastasis of OC. IL20RA is mainly expressed in epithelial cells and forms the functional receptor, when heterodimerized with interleukin 20 receptor subunit beta (IL20RB), to bind immune cell-produced IL-20 subfamily of cytokines IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24, which have essential roles in regulating epithelial innate immunity and tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rutz et al., 2014</xref>). IL20RA and IL20RB are also detected in tumors of epithelial origin including breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and bladder cancer, while IL-20 subfamily of cytokines has been reported to have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressing roles depending on tumor types and the local immune environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gopalan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pestka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rutz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Whitaker et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, we discovered a novel IL-20/IL20RA-mediated crosstalk between disseminated OC cells and peritoneum mesothelial cells that eventually promotes the generation of M1-like inflammatory macrophages to prevent peritoneal dissemination of OC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>IL20RA</italic> is an anti-transcoelomic metastasis gene in OC identified by a genome-scale knockout screening in vivo</title><p>To screen key genes regulating transcoelomic metastasis of OC, we utilized human epithelial OC cell SK-OV-3 with relatively low metastatic capacity to set up the orthotopic transplant tumor model in NOD-SCID mice. Prior to the inoculation of these cells into the mouse ovaries, SK-OV-3 cells were transduced with the human CRISPR knockout library (GeCKO v2.0) made by Feng Zhang et al., which contains sgRNAs specifically against 19,050 protein-encoding genes and 1864 miRNA genes and 1000 non-targeting control sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>). Peritoneal metastasized SK-OV-3 cells in the intraperitoneal cavity were isolated and expanded in vitro for next runs of orthotopic transplant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After three runs of in vivo screening, highly metastatic SK-OV-3 cells were subjected to high-throughput sgRNA library sequencing to reveal the sgRNA representations. The RNAi Gene Enrichment Ranking (RIGER) p-value analysis was used to identify significantly enriched sgRNAs in metastasized (sgRNA<sup>Met</sup>) or primary (sgRNA<sup>Pri</sup>) OC xenografts. By using the criteria of the number of enriched sgRNAs targeting each gene ≥3, p-value&lt;0.05 and the normalized enrichment score (NES) &lt;−1.2, we got two high-ranked genes, namely <italic>IL20RA</italic> and <italic>TEX14</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Given all the six sgRNAs targeting IL20RA in GeCKO library were enriched with high NES, we chose IL20RA for further investigation on its function in the transcoelomic metastasis of OC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High-throughput CRISPR screen identified IL20RA as a suppressor of the transcoelomic metastasis of ovarian cancer (OC).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of experiment design to screen metastasis-related genes using CRISPR/Cas9 library in OC orthotopic murine model.

In the SK-OV-3 orthotopic mouse OC model, silencing IL20RA greatly promoted the transcoelomic metastasis of OC and the formation of ascites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>), while in ID8 syngeneic mouse OC model, reconstitution of IL20RA in ID8 cells dramatically reduced the volumes of ascites and the numbers of metastatic nodules in diaphragm, peritoneum, and mesentery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate whether IL20RA suppresses transcoelomic metastasis of OC at the later stage when OC cells have disseminated into the peritoneal cavity, we directly injected ID8 cells into the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 mice. We were still able to observe that IL20RA-reconstituted ID8 cells formed much less metastases on the diaphragm, peritoneum, and mesentery and resulted in much less ascites as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Together, these data suggest that IL20RA is a potent suppressor gene for the transcoelomic metastasis of OC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The IL20RA expression is dramatically decreased in metastases of OC patients and positively correlates with the clinical outcome</title><p>To further get the clinical evidences on the relevance of IL20RA in OC metastasis, we collected primary OC tissues and paired cancer cells isolated from ascites and metastatic nodules in peritoneal cavity from 20 serous OC patients. Analysis of IL20RA protein by western blot shows a dramatic decrease of IL20RA in the transcoelomic spread cancer samples when compared with those from the primary sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>), which is confirmed by the quantitative reverse-transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of <italic>IL20RA</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis also shows the much lower level of IL20RA in metastatic cancer cells than that in the cancer cells at the primary sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). To further investigate the relevance of IL20RA with OC metastasis, we analyzed the correlation between the IL20RA level and the survival of serous OC patients given that metastasis accounts for over 90% of cancer death. High level of IL20RA significantly correlates with the better overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of serous OC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), supporting that IL20RA functions as a suppressor of OC metastasis.

OC cells, when disseminated into the peritoneal cavity, stimulate the mesothelial cells of the peritoneum to produce IL-20 and IL-24, which in turn activate the IL20RA downstream signaling in OC cells to trigger the OAS/RNase L-mediated NLR inflammasome signaling to produce mature IL-18, which consequently promotes the polarization of peritoneal macrophages into M1-like subtype to clear invaded OC cells in peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). Highly metastatic OC cells always block this pathway by decreasing IL20RA expression, suggesting that reactivation of its downstream signaling, such as the application of IL-18, could be a useful strategy for the therapy of OC at advanced stages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The common metastasis mode of OC is transcoelomic metastasis, in which the cancer cells disseminate into the peritoneal cavity and colonize on the peritoneum and abdominal organs. Transcoelomic metastasis occurs in about 70% of OC patients and many other types of cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, endometrial cancer, and colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mikuła-Pietrasik et al., 2018</xref>). Patients with transcoelomic metastasis are diagnosed at stages III and IV, which means high mortality and poor prognosis. The mechanisms, in particular, the peritoneal specific factors, behind this process still remain largely unclear. Here, through a genome-scale gene knockout screening in the orthotopic murine model of OC, we reveal an essential role of IL-20/IL20RA-mediated crosstalk between cancer cells and peritoneum mesothelial cells in regulating the polarization of peritoneal macrophages to prevent transcoelomic metastasis. This peritoneal-specific immune modulation mechanism may also happen in other types of cancers that can disseminate into the peritoneal cavity, such as gastric cancer, endometrial carcinoma, colon cancer, and bladder carcinoma, in which the high expression of IL20RA also correlates with a better clinical outcome of patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), highlighting the importance of IL-20/IL20RA-mediated epithelial immunity in preventing cancer metastasis into the peritoneal environment.</p><p>Immune cell-produced IL-20 subfamily cytokines and their receptors mainly expressed in epithelial cells facilitate the crosstalk between leukocytes and epithelial cells, which has essential functions in epithelial innate immunity for the host defense and tissue repair at epithelial surfaces. Due to the complicated effects of IL-20 subfamily cytokines in inflammation stimulation upon infection or injury and later immunosuppression for wound repair and tissue homeostasis restoration, both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing roles of IL-20 subfamily cytokines have been reported. IL-20 and IL-26 were discovered to promote proliferation and migration of bladder cancer, breast cancer, and gastric cancer cells, while IL-24 was found to inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of melanoma, prostate cancer, and OC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fisher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gopalan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hsu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pradhan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">You et al., 2013</xref>). Although IL-20 subfamily cytokines have been extensively reported to activate STAT3 to exhibit oncogenic effects, STAT3 has also been shown to be able to switch its roles from tumor-promoting at early stages to tumor-suppressing in the invasion process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Musteanu et al., 2010</xref>). The different roles of IL-20 subfamily cytokines in tumor growth and metastasis may depend on the local inflammatory environment that involves a complex network of conversations between cancer cells and various stromal components. For OC metastasized to omentum, cancer cell-mediated conversion of omentum stromal cells, including adipocytes, fibroblasts, macrophages, and mesenchymal stem cells, to cancer-associated stromal cells is of vital importance for the metastatic growth of OC cells on omentum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Motohara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thibault et al., 2014</xref>). The abdominal cavity is lined with a layer of mesothelial cells that form the first line of defense against microbial pathogens through the expression of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like (RIG-I–like) receptors, Toll-like receptors, and C-type lectin-like receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colmont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2007</xref>). Besides, mesothelial cells can secret cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors to regulate the inflammatory responses in peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Isaza-Restrepo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yao et al., 2004</xref>). However, whether and how mesothelial cells response to cancer cells invaded into the peritoneal cavity remain largely unknown. It is more difficult for OC cells to attach to mesothelial cells compared with the extracellular matrix and the fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kenny et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Niedbala et al., 1985</xref>). During the metastatic growth, OC cells can destroy the mesothelial cell layer by promoting the mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT) of mesothelial cells and hence the loss of cell-cell adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iwanicki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kenny et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we revealed, for the first time, that mesothelial cells can actively respond to OC cells invaded into the peritoneal cavity by secreting IL-20 and IL-24 to communicate with OC cells, consequently resulting in a further crosstalk between OC cells and macrophages for the formation of an antitumor microenvironment. This mesothelial-initiated defense mechanism is oftentimes overcome by successfully metastasized OC cells through the downregulation of IL-20/IL-24 receptor IL20RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>) to shut down the communication between OC and mesothelial cells.</p><p>It has been reported that in OC patients the majority of cell types in ascites are lymphocytes (37%) and macrophages (32%), contributing to the progression and metastasis of OC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kipps et al., 2013</xref>). Generally, macrophages have the potential to differentiate into cancer-inhibiting M1-subtype and cancer-promoting M2-subtype. The ratio of M1/M2-subtype macrophages has predictive value for the prognosis of OC patients, with a higher M1/M2-subtype ratio being associated with a better prognosis, while a higher CD163<sup>+</sup> (M2-subtype)/CD68<sup>+</sup> (total macrophages) ratio with a poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reinartz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Re-polarization of macrophages to increase the ratio of M1/M2 macrophages in ascites is a promising strategy for the treatment of OC. It has reported that host-produced histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) could inhibit the growth and metastasis of tumors via re-polarizing the macrophages from M2-subtype to M1-subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rolny et al., 2011</xref>). Nanoparticles encapsulating miR-125b could specifically re-polarize the peritoneal macrophages to M1-subtype, thereby improving the efficacy of paclitaxel in OC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parayath et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we reveal IL20RA as a key receptor in regulating the polarization of peritoneal macrophages, which is silenced in disseminated OC cells for the accumulation of M2-subtype macrophages in the peritoneal cavity for a successful metastatic growth. This indicates that reactivation of IL-20/IL20RA signaling by the application of IL-20 or IL-24 may not be a useful strategy to prevent OC transcoelomic metastasis. However, we also identify the key downstream effector of IL-20/IL20RA signaling that promotes M1-like macrophage, IL-18, which is usually involved in the regulation of innate immune responses against various pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fabbi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>IL-18 is an immunoregulatory cytokine with anti-cancer effect in many types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coughlin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salcedo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zaki et al., 2010</xref>). The normal ovarian and colon epithelia have the capacity to process and release active IL-18, thereby supporting a local antitumor immune microenvironment. However, during the malignant transformation, the ovarian and colon cancer cells lose the ability to process IL-18 as a result of the defective Caspase-1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, OC cells express more pro-IL-18 but poorly produce mature-IL-18. Elevated IL-18 was reported in the ascites and sera of OC patients in a 23 kDa pre-form, whereas the 18 kDa mature and active form was undetectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Orengo et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we show that reconstitution of IL20RA in highly metastatic OC cells can reactivate the production of mature IL-18 via IL-20/IL20RA-OAS1/RNase L-NLR axis, suggesting the silence of IL20RA to be a possible reason for the loss of mature IL-18 in OC. IL-18 has been shown to exert antitumor activity through the activation of T cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fabbi et al., 2015</xref>). Here, our results expand its roles to promote the polarization of macrophages to inflammatory M1-like subtype to exhibit a potent antitumor effect against OC. Several clinical trials testing the antitumor efficacy of IL-18 have been conducted in lymphomas and melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robertson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robertson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tarhini et al., 2009</xref>). Our study shows that the administration of recombinant IL-18 significantly suppresses the metastasis of IL20RA-deficient OC cells, suggesting the great value of IL-18 in the therapy of OC at advanced stages.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The coding sequence of mouse <italic>Il20ra</italic> was synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) and cloned into plasmid pLV-EF1α-MCS-IRES-Bsd (Biosettia). All plasmids were validated by sequencing. The procedures of lentivirus package and infection were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2015</xref>). Cells infected with lentivirus for RNAi or reconstituted expression were selected with 2.5 μg/mL of puromycin and 2.5 μg/mL of blasticidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>CRISPR/Cas9 knockout in vivo screening</title><p>GeCKO v2 human library made by Zhangfeng’s lab was purchased from Addgene (Watertown, MA) amplified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joung et al., 2017</xref>). The library contains 122,756 sgRNAs targeting 19,050 genes and 1864 miRNAs, and 1000 non-targeting sgRNAs. Lentivirus carrying the library were generated and infected SK-OV-3 cells with the multiplicity of infection (MOI) around 0.5. After the selection with puromycin, 2 million SK-OV-3 cells expressing sgRNAs were orthotopically injected into NOD-SCID mice. The mice were sacrificed after 40 days. Primary tumors were dissected. Metastatic nodules in the peritoneal cavity were isolated, in vitro expanded for next run of orthotopic injection. After three rounds of in vivo selection, peritoneal metastatic cells were collected for subsequent high-throughput DNA deep sequencing to identify metastasis-related candidate genes. The RIGER P analysis was used to analyze the data of sgRNA libraries sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Murine OC models</title><p>All of the animals were handled according to approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols of the Nankai University. Animal experiments were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nankai University (ethic approved number: 20180014). All attempts were made to minimize the handling time during surgery and treatment so as not to unduly stress the animals. Animals are observed daily after surgery to ensure there are no unexpected complications. 6–8-week-old female NOD-SCID and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from SPF Biotechnology (Beijing, China). 2 million human SK-OV-3 cells or 5 million murine ID8 cells suspended in 20 μL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were orthotopically injected into the left ovary of NOD-SCID and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. Ascites volumes and the numbers of metastatic nodules were measured, and total cells in ascites were harvested 40 days post-inoculation for the SK-OV-3 OC xenograft model and 60 days post-inoculation for the ID8 OC syngeneic model. For the intraperitoneal OC mouse model, 5 million ID8 cells suspended in 100 μL of PBS were injected directly into the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 mice. At day 45 post-injection, ascites and the number of metastatic nodules were analyzed.</p><p>To investigate the role of peritoneal macrophage in IL20RA-mediated OC metastasis, 5 million ID8 cells alone or together with 1.25 × 10<sup>6</sup> of BMDM (educated by CM from ID8 cells for 72 hr) in 100 μL of PBS were directly injected into the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 mice. In another model, 5 million IL20RA-reconstituted or control ID8 cells were injected into the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 mice. The mice were then intraperitoneal injected with PBS liposomes or clodronate liposomes (100 μL/10 g of mouse weight) (CP-030030, LIPOSOMA, Netherlands) every 3 days from day 4 to day 34 post-injection.</p><p>To identify the source of IL20RA ligands in peritoneal cavity, 5 million ID8 cells in 100 μL PBS (OC) or only 100 μL PBS (control) were directly injected into the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 mice. To investigate whether the intraperitoneal injection of SK-OV-3 cells was able to stimulate the production of IL20RA ligands, 5 million SK-OV-3 cells in 100 μL PBS (OC) or only 100 μL PBS (control) were directly injected into the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 mice. The mice were sacrificed 9 days post-injection. Peritoneal flushing fluid by PBS was collected. Total cells in peritoneal cavity were harvested for sorting the peritoneal macrophages. The total RNAs from intestine, abdominal wall, and ovary were extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for subsequent gene expression analysis.</p><p>To investigate the therapeutic effect of IL-18, 5 million murine ID8 cells suspended in 20 μL PBS were orthotopically injected into the left ovaries of C57BL/6 mice.

The patients’ study was performed in accordance with the ethics committee of Nankai University and Tianjin Center Hospital of Gynecology Obstetrics (ethic approved number: 2018KY032) and conformed to the principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki. All OC patients from the Tianjin Center Hospital of Gynecology Obstetrics provided informed consent. Twenty fresh paired samples, including primary serous OC tissues, ascites, and metastasis nodules in peritoneal cavity, were obtained from OC patients during operation between 2017 and 2019. The inclusion criteria included serous ovarian adenocarcinoma, age &gt;40, and TNM stage III–IV. Primary tumor tissues and metastases samples were dissected into two parts: one stored in 4% paraformaldehyde for IHC staining, the other stored in TRIzol reagent for the extraction of protein and RNA. Cancer cells in ascites were harvested for the extraction of protein and RNA. The histopathology and TNM stages of OC patients were confirmed by pathologists and clinical doctors.</p><p>The analysis on the correlation between the prognosis of OC patients and the expression of IL20RA or IL20RB were performed using the online Kaplan–Meier plotter tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kmplot.com/">http://www.kmplot.com/</ext-link>) on serous OC cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gyorffy et al., 2012</xref>). The co-expression analysis on IL20RA with IL18 and OAS1 in OC patients was examined using the data from TCGA database (Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma, Provisional, n = 530).

metastasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Besides IL20RA, TEX14 was highly ranked in their Crispr screen. The authors should comment if TEX14 is known to be related to IL-20RA-dependent signaling-that is, whether it fits into the same pathway.</p><p>2. They found that silencing IL20RA in SK-OV-3 cells promoted metastasis while reconstituting IL20RA in metastatic ID8 cells reduced metastatic nodules and that IL20RA was decreased in transcoelomic-spread cancer samples compared to primary sites. Thus, high IL20RA expression was beneficial. What are levels of IL20RB? Does knocking down IL20RB have similar effects to targeting IL20RA? Can the authors knock out IL20RB in human SK-OV-3 cells and/or mouse ID8 cells with IL20RA overexpression, and test them in vivo?</p><p>3. The authors used both human and mouse cell lines in a mouse model and obtained similar observations. This is potentially surprising as it suggests that the relevant pathways in human and mouse cells function even when one crosses between two species. Are human and mouse IL-18 pathways known to exhibit species specificity or to cross-react?</p><p>4. CM IL20RA-educated BMDM significantly reduced malignant ascites and nodules, indicating that IL20RA crosstalk between OC cells and macrophages limits metastasis. In macrophage depleted mice, reconstituting IL20RA in ID8 cells did not reduce metastasis, indicating that macrophages are needed for the effect. Interestingly, mesothelial cells in peritoneum produce IL20RA ligands IL20 and IL24 when OC cells are injected. Are these cytokines produced in response to other tumor cells or is the effect specific for OC cells?</p><p>5. IL20/IL20RA activates OAS1A/RNaseL mediated NLR signaling to produce IL18 mRNA and protein with activation of STAT3. There is a bigger effect on OAS1A mRNA than protein but the increase in IL-18 is robust. By ChIP-qPCR, they confirm a STAT3 binding site on the Oas1a gene but what about in the gene encoding IL-18?</p><p>6. Although not essential, more in vivo data would be valuable-e.g., using IL-20/IL-24 double KO mice and IL-18R KO mice to better confirm their findings in vivo.</p><p>7. IL20RA did not affect proliferation or migration of OC cells but resulted in increased M1-like and decreased M2-like macrophages but no change in B cells or T cells. Interestingly, IL-20 had no direct effect on M1 or M2 markers. What about IL-24?</p><p>8. In Figure 4, one might expect that the supernatants from SK-OV-3 would only affect the phenotypes of human macrophage cells, but it impacted macrophage phenotypes in vivo as shown in figure 3F. The authors should discuss/explain.</p><p>9. In Figure 4 and 5, the authors use CM from IL-20 stimulated cells. They should include controls from cells that were not treated with IL-20.</p><p>10. IL-20 and IL-24 produced by mesothelial cells acted on tumor cells. Are levels of these cytokines detectable in the ascites and normal peritoneum fluid?</p><p>11. The scale in figure 7F is misleading--it should start from 0 instead of 12. The difference is obviously small. Moreover, the difference does not appear to be biologically relevant, since in Figure 7K, the authors showed that as low as 5 ng/ml of IL-18 was sufficient to induce M1 markers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. They used the GeCKO v.2.0 CRISPR library. Besides IL20RA, TEX14 was highly ranked in metastasized OC xenografts. Is TEX14 known to be related to IL-20RA-dependent signaling?</p><p>2. They found that silencing IL20RA in SK-OV-3 cells promoted metastasis while reconstituting IL20RA in metastatic ID8 cells reduced metastatic nodules. They also found that IL20RA was decreased in transcoelomic spread cancer samples compared to primary sites. Thus, high IL20RA expression was beneficial. IL20RB was not similarly changed. Although not an essential experiment to perform, do the authors know if knocking down IL20RB would have similar effects to targeting IL20RA?</p><p>3. Mechanistically, IL20RA did not affect proliferation or migration of OC cells but resulted in increased M1-like and decreased M2-like macrophages but no change in B cells or T cells. CM from IL20RA-transduced ID8 cells stimulated expression of M1 markers and decreased M2 markers in RAW 264.7 cells and this also occurred in BM from B6 mice. In THP1 cells, CM form SK-OV-3 cells in which IL20RA is silenced induced M2 and lowered M1. Interestingly, IL-20 had no direct effect on M1 or M2 markers. Is the same true for IL-24?</p><p>4. CMIL20RA-educated BMDM significantly reduced malignant ascites and nodules, indicating that IL20RA crosstalk between OC cells and macrophages limits metastasis. In macrophage depleted mice, reconstituting IL20RA in ID8 cells did not reduce metastasis, indicating that macrophages are needed for the effect. Interestingly, mesothelial cells in peritoneum produce IL20RA ligands IL20 and IL24 when OC cells are injected. Are these cytokines also produced in response to other tumor cells or is the effect specific for OC cells?</p><p>5. IL20/IL20RA activates OAS1A/RNaseL mediated NLR signaling to produce IL18 mRNA and protein with activation of STAT3. There is a bigger effect on OAS1A mRNA than protein but the increase in IL-18 is robust. By ChIP-qPCR, they confirm a STAT3 binding site on the Oas1a gene but what about in the gene encoding IL-18? OAS1, IL-18, and pSTAT3 are lower in metastatic lesions, consistent with less IL-20 signaling. IL-18 when produced increases M1 and decreases M2 and concordant with this administering IL-18 lowers metastasis. Given the biological effect of IL-18, are there is any differences observed in the level of IL-18 receptor expression in situations of greater versus lower metastasis?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>At the cellular and molecular level many of evidence are superficial and only supported with in vitro cell lines or cells not necessary relevant to in vivo settings, without using specific knockout mice such as IL-20/IL-24 double KO mice and IL-18R KO mice, which are essential for building the mechanistic links in vivo. In addition, the authors used both human and mouse cell lines in a mouse model and obtained same observations. This is very strange, which means that all involved pathways in human and mouse cells can perfectly function even when cross two species. This is impossible. For example, it is known human and mouse IL-18 pathways do not cross react. Mouse IL-20 also signal through mouse IL-20Ra/IL-20Rb drastically different from human IL-20Ra/IL-20Rb (Kolumam et al., Plosone 2017). Thus, the proposed mechanisms can't be true concurrently for both of human and mouse cell lines.</p><p>1) To further confirm the important role of IL-20R pathway in the transcoelomic metastatic process, the authors should also knock out IL-20Rb chain in human SK-OV-3 cell line and in mouse ID8 line with IL-20Ra overexpression, and test them in vivo.</p><p>2) The authors need to provide protein expression level of IL-20Rb.</p><p>3) In figure 4, the supernatants from SK-OV-3 could only affect the phenotypes of human macrophage cells. But clearly it impacted macrophage phenotypes in vivo as shown in figure 3F. Thus the proposed mechanisms could not be true in this case.</p><p>4) In figure 4 and 5, the authors should include controls with cells that were not treated with IL-20.</p><p>5) How the IL-20 and IL-24 produced by mesothelial cells acted on tumor cells. These cytokines should be secreted out before they function on targeting cells. The authors should measure the cytokine concentration in the ascites and normal peritoneum fluid.</p><p>6) Normally, p-Stat3 is measured minutes to few hours after cytokine stimulation. It is surprising that the authors measured pStat3 even after 24hr stimulation in Figure 7C and 7D.</p><p>7) The authors also need to provide evidence that both SK-OV-3 and ID8 cells indeed exposed to IL-20 or IL-24 in vivo in these models.</p><p>8) How tumor cells induced the expression of IL-20 and IL-24 from abdominal walls?</p><p>9) The scale in figure 7F is misleading, it should start from 0 but not 12. The difference was actually very small, although it met statistical significance. In fact, the difference was biologically irrelevant, since in Figure 7K, the authors showed that as low as 5 ng/ml of IL-18 was sufficiently induce M1 markers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66222.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We chose IL20RA instead of TEX14 for further investigation because the number of enriched sgRNAs and NES were even higher for IL20RA (number of enriched sgRNAs: 6 for IL20RA and 3 for TEX14; NES: -1.642 for IL20RA and -1.608 for TEX14). According to the literature, TEX14, with the full name as testis expressed 14, functions as an intercellular bridge forming factor in germ cells, which is required for spermatogenesis. TEX14 is an inactive kinase essential for the maintenance of stable intercellular bridges in gametes of both sexes but whose loss specifically impairs male meiosis (Greenbaum MP, <italic>et.al</italic>., PMID: 21669984). TEX14 acts to impede the terminal steps of abscission by competing for essential component CEP55, blocking its interaction in non-germ cells with ALIX and TSG101 (Iwamori T, <italic>et al</italic>., PMID: 20176808). Additionally, TEX14-interacting protein RBM44, whose localization in stabile intercellular bridges is limited to pachytene and secondary spermatocytes, may participate in processes such as RNA transport but is nonessential to the maintenance of intercellular bridge stability (Greenbaum MP, <italic>et.al</italic>., PMID: 21669984). There is still no evidence to show any functional relevance between TEX14 and IL20RA-dependent signaling. To further confirm, we investigated the mRNA levels of Tex14 in IL20RA-reconstituted ID8 cells and IL20RA-silenced SK-OV-3 cells. The results show that the expression of Tex14 is not affected by either the reconstitution of IL20RA or the silencing of IL20RA as shown in the following figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The mRNA levels of Tex14 in IL20RA-reconstituted ID8 cells and IL20RA-silenced SK-OV-3 cells.</title><p>The cells are treated with 2.5 ng/mL recombinant IL-20 protein before qRT-PCR analysis of Tex14 transcription.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66222-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Actually, in our previous studies, we did investigate the impact of IL20RB in the transcoelomic-spread of OC. However, these results were not added in the manuscript. As suggested, we have put these results back into the revised manuscript in the Figure 8—figure supplement 1. The results show that silencing IL20RB in IL20RA-reconsitituted ID8 cells strongly inhibits the activation of the downstream STAT3-NLR signaling (Figure 8—figure supplement 1A-B). And the conditioned medium (CM) of the IL20RB-silenced and IL20RA-reconsituted ID8 cells with IL-20 stimulation can no longer trigger the polarization of macrophages (Figure 8—figure supplement 1C). In the murine model of OC, silencing IL20RB greatly attenuates the beneficial effects of IL20RA reconstitution in inhibiting the formation of malignant ascites and the peritoneal spread of OC cells (Figure 8—figure supplement 1D-G). Taken together, these results suggest that IL-20/IL20RA signaling requires the formation of IL20RA/IL20RB heterodimer as reported (Sascha Rutz, <italic>et al</italic> PMID: 25421700). However, in OC patients, IL20RB expression shows no significant difference between primary and metastatic OC specimen and negatively correlates with the survival of OC patients (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), highlighting that IL20RA is the key subunit of IL20RA/IL20RB heterodimer receptor that is often dysregulated in OC cells for their peritoneal dissemination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors used both human and mouse cell lines in a mouse model and obtained similar observations. This is potentially surprising as it suggests that the relevant pathways in human and mouse cells function even when one crosses between two species. Are human and mouse IL-18 pathways known to exhibit species specificity or to cross-react?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. In our results, we observed the role of IL20RA in preventing the peritoneal dissemination of OC in the murine models of OC established by both human and mouse OC cells, suggesting that the cytokines involved in the process may cross-react. To further confirm, we performed the following experiments:</p><p>(1) We first investigated whether the intraperitoneal injection of SK-OV-3 cells was able to stimulate the production of IL-20 and IL-24. As shown in Figure 8—figure supplement 2A, increased expression of <italic>Il20</italic> and <italic>Il24</italic> from the abdominal wall of C57BL/6 mice upon the intraperitoneal injection of SK-OV-3 cells. In addition, murine IL-20 subfamily cytokines were also shown by Kolumam, G. et al. to be able to cross-react with human receptors. They found that murine IL-20 could induce Stat3 activity in cells expressing human IL20RA and IL20RB (Kolumam, et.al., PMID: 28125663).</p><p>(2) We further investigated whether human IL-18 was able to induce the polarization of murine macrophages. We have identified that murine IL-18 has the capacity to modulate the polarization of RAW 264.7 cells from M2-subtype to M1 subtype (Figure 7J). We used 5 ng/mL human recombinant IL-18 protein to stimulate RAW 264.7 cells for 72 h. The qRT-PCR analyses show that human IL-18 significantly stimulates the expression of M1-like markers while inhibits the expression of M2-like markers in RAW 264.7 cells (Figure 8—figure supplement 2B). In addition, to further answer the relevant question #8, we used the CM of the IL-20-stimulated control SK-OV-3 cells (CM<sup>shCtrl</sup>) and IL20RA-silenced SK-OV-3 cells (CM<sup>shIL20RA</sup>) to treat the RAW 264.7 cells for 72 h. The qRT-PCR analyses show that CM<sup>shIL20RA</sup> can increase the expression of M2-like markers and inhibit the expression of M1-like markers of RAW 264.7 cells (Figure 8—figure supplement 2C). Although the efficiency of human IL-18 on RAW 264.7 cells polarization is not as significant as that of murine IL-18, it indicates that human IL-18 does react on the polarization of murine macrophages.</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that IL-20/IL20RA signaling also works in NOD-SCID mice challenged with SK-OV-3 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The peritoneal dissemination of cancer cells also occurs in other types of tumors, such as gastric cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer and bladder carcinoma. As suggested, we injected five million of CT-26 cells (murine colon cancer cells) into the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice and injected five million of Hepa 1-6 cells (murine hepatocellular carcinoma cells) into the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 mice. The mice were sacrificed 9 days post-injection. The qRT-PCR analyses show that CT-26 cells can also induce the production of <italic>Il20</italic> from the peritoneal mesothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>), while Hepa 1-6 cells show no effects on the induction of IL20RA ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). These results were further confirmed by ELISA analysis of IL-20 and IL-24 cytokines in peritoneal flushing fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2C</xref>,D). These data suggest that the IL-20/IL-24-mediated crosstalk between peritoneal mesothelial cells and OC cells may also occur in some other, but not all, cancer types that have the potential of peritoneal dissemination.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The expression of IL20RA ligands in the abdominal wall challenged by colon cancer cells and hepatocellular carcinoma cells.</title><p>A-B. qRT-PCR analysis of IL20RA ligands from the abdominal wall in mice with the intraperitoneal injection of CT-26 cells (A) and Hepa 1-6 cells (B).

IL20/IL20RA activates OAS1A/RNaseL mediated NLR signaling to produce IL18 mRNA and protein with activation of STAT3. There is a bigger effect on OAS1A mRNA than protein but the increase in IL-18 is robust. By ChIP-qPCR, they confirm a STAT3 binding site on the Oas1a gene but what about in the gene encoding IL-18?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive suggestion. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we further identified the STAT3 binding sites on the <italic>Il18</italic> gene by ChIP-qPCR. The new results have been added in the new Figure 7F,G, which shows two STAT3 binding sites on the promoter of <italic>Il18</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Although not essential, more in vivo data would be valuable-e.g., using IL-20/IL-24 double KO mice and IL-18R KO mice to better confirm their findings in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We agree that the use of IL-20/IL-24 double KO mice and IL-18 KO mice may provide strong support on our findings. Currently, it is difficult for us to get such KO mice in the limited time. To further investigate the essential role of IL-18 in IL-20/IL20RA-mediated downstream signaling to suppress the peritoneal dissemination of OC in vivo, we knocked down IL-18 in IL20RA-reconsitituted ID8 cells and inject ID8<sup>Vec</sup>, ID8<sup>IL20RA</sup> and ID8<sup>IL20RA/shIL-18</sup> cells into the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 mice. The results show that silencing IL-18 abolishes the effects of reconstituted IL20RA in the inhibition of the malignant ascites formation and the peritoneal dissemination of OC cells. Consistently, IL-20/IL20RA-induced the polarization of peritoneal macrophages to M1-like phenotypes is also blocked by the silencing IL-18. We think these data provide additional in vivo evidence to support the essential role of IL-18 downstream IL-20/IL20RA signaling in preventing the OC dissemination. We have added the new results in the new Figure 8. The description and methods of these experiments are added in revised manuscript as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. IL20RA did not affect proliferation or migration of OC cells but resulted in increased M1-like and decreased M2-like macrophages but no change in B cells or T cells. Interestingly, IL-20 had no direct effect on M1 or M2 markers. What about IL-24?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have excluded the possibility that IL-20 directly regulated the polarization of macrophages (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F). As suggested, we treated the RAW 264.7 cells with 5 ng/mL recombinant murine IL-24 protein for 72 h. The qRT-PCR analyses show that IL-24 does not affect the expression of both the M1- and M2-like markers in RAW 264.7 cells as well. We have added the new results in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1G. The description and methods of these results are added in revised manuscript as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure 4, one might expect that the supernatants from SK-OV-3 would only affect the phenotypes of human macrophage cells, but it impacted macrophage phenotypes in vivo as shown in figure 3F. The authors should discuss/explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We used the CM of ovarian cancer cells to treat the macrophages of same species in in vitro experiments. As mentioned in the answer to the question #3, we used the SK-OV-3 CM<sup>shCtrl</sup> and CM<sup>shIL20RA</sup> to treat the RAW 264.7 cells for 72 h and the results are shown in Figure 8—figure supplement 2. We have performed additional experiments to show that the cytokines involved in IL20RA-mediated signaling can cross-react between mouse and human species, indicating that IL-20/IL20RA signaling also works in NOD-SCID mice injected with SK-OV-3 cells (Figure 8—figure supplement 2A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In Figure 4 and 5, the authors use CM from IL-20 stimulated cells. They should include controls from cells that were not treated with IL-20.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive suggestion. We have added the controls in the above-mentioned figure (Figure 4B,E,H). The results show that the polarization of macrophages is not changed under the stimulation of CM from unstimulated IL20RA-reconstituted or IL20RA-silenced OC cells. IL20RA-mediated macrophage polarization needs the prior stimulation of the IL-20.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. IL-20 and IL-24 produced by mesothelial cells acted on tumor cells. Are levels of these cytokines detectable in the ascites and normal peritoneum fluid?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have measured the amount of IL-20 and IL-24 in peritoneal flushing fluid from C57BL/6 mice with intraperitoneal injection of ID8 cells or PBS control. The results show that the amounts of IL-20 and IL-24 in peritoneal flushing fluid are significantly increased upon the injection of OC cells into the peritoneal cavity. We have added the new results in Figure 6D. The description and methods of these results are added in revised manuscript as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The scale in figure 7F is misleading--it should start from 0 instead of 12. The difference is obviously small. Moreover, the difference does not appear to be biologically relevant, since in Figure 7K, the authors showed that as low as 5 ng/ml of IL-18 was sufficient to induce M1 markers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for this constructive comment. As mentioned in the answer to the question #6, we further investigated the essential role of IL-18 in IL-20/IL20RA-mediated downstream signaling to suppress the dissemination of ovarian cancer in vivo. We inject ID8<sup>Vec</sup>, ID8<sup>IL20RA</sup> and ID8<sup>IL20RA/shIL-18</sup> cells into the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 mice, respectively. And we measured the amount of IL-18 in ascites by ELISA. The new results show that IL20RA-reconstituted ID8 cells in intraperitoneal cavity cause significantly higher amount of IL-18 in ascites when compared with empty vector transfected cells. Compared with the previous data, the new results show more significant difference (nearly 10 ng/mL). In addition, the higher amount of IL-18 in ascites induced by IL20RA-reconstituted ID8 cells is significantly inhibited by silencing IL-18. We therefore combined the ELISA data in the old Figure 7F with the new ELISA data to generate the new Figure 8C.</p></body></sub-article></article>
