often cleared, by activated T lymphocytes. The inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) mediates its functions by binding to its ligand ICOSL, enhancing T-cell activation and optimal germinal center (GC) formation. Here, we show that ICOSL is heavily downmodulated during infection of antigen-presenting cells by different herpesviruses. We found that, in murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), the immunoevasin m138/fcr-1 physically interacts with ICOSL, impeding its maturation and promoting its lysosomal degradation. This viral protein counteracts T-cell responses, in an ICOS-dependent manner, and limits virus control during the acute MCMV infection. Additionally, we report that blockade of ICOSL in MCMV-infected mice critically regulates the production of MCMV-specific antibodies due to a reduction of T follicular helper and GC B cells. Altogether, these findings reveal a novel mechanism evolved by MCMV to counteract adaptive immune surveillance, and demonstrates a role of the ICOS:ICOSL axis in the host defense against herpesviruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytomegalovirus</kwd><kwd>herpesvirus</kwd><kwd>t-cell co-stimulation</kwd><kwd>icosl</kwd><kwd>cd275</kwd><kwd>viral immune evasion</kwd><kwd>antigen presenting cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF 2017-87688</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angulo</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTI2018-094440-B-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KK.01.1.1.01.0006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonjic</surname><given-names>Stipan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ICOSL-dependent T-cell co-stimulation contributes to the host defense against herpesvirus infections, and accordingly, these pathogens have developed immune evasion mechanisms to interrupt the ICOSL:ICOS signaling pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A robust host response against viral infections requires the activation of the adaptive arm of the immune system mediated by T lymphocytes. For effective T-cell activation, in addition to the antigen-specific signal delivered by the interaction of major histocompatibility (MHC)-peptide complexes and T-cell receptors (TCR), concerted co-stimulatory signals are essential. These signals come from a number of co-stimulatory molecules upon interaction with their cognate ligands, expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharpe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Flies, 2013</xref>). The B7-CD28 family of ligands and receptors comprises molecules of the Ig superfamily that function as co-signaling molecules modulating T-cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sharpe and Freeman, 2002</xref>). The best characterized co-stimulatory pathway between members of this family is exemplified by the T-cell surface receptor CD28, which binds to the activated APC surface molecules B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86). Another co-stimulatory pathway of this family is the receptor ICOS (inducible co-stimulator, CD278), primarily expressed on activated T cells and at very high levels on T follicular helper cells (Tfh), which mediates its functions by binding to its ligand ICOSL (B7-H2, CD275) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hutloff et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoshinaga et al., 1999</xref>). ICOSL is constitutively expressed on APCs, such as dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and B cells, and it is strongly upregulated by inflammatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aicher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Swallow et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshinaga et al., 2000</xref>). ICOSL presents a different expression profile as compared to CD80 and CD86, and it is induced on non-lymphoid cells, such as endothelial cells or epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khayyamian et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qian et al., 2006</xref>). The ICOS:ICOSL receptor pathway leads to enhanced T-cell activation, proliferation, and Th2 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tesciuba et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast to CD28, which is essential for the activation of naïve T cells, ICOS is more relevant for the regulation of activated and effector T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coyle et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, ICOS co-stimulation plays an essential role in T-dependent antibody responses and germinal center (GC) formation, by inducing IL-21 production and Bcl6 expression, consequently controlling isotype switching, somatic hypermutation, and the generation of memory B cells and plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hutloff, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). ICOS has also been shown to be required for optimal CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation and cytokine production during recall responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wallin et al., 2001</xref>) and NK cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ogasawara et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, although the ICOSL:ICOS axis is a crucial tuner of cell-mediated immune responses, little is known about its role in viral host defence.</p><p>Throughout the process of pathogen-host coevolution, viruses have devised multiple strategies to counteract host immunity. In particular, in order to ensure their prolonged survival in their hosts, persistent viruses need to undermine adaptive immune responses at different levels. A common theme of these viruses is to interfere with the presentation of antigenic peptides by MHC molecules to T cells. To this end, several large DNA viruses, particularly herpesviruses, encode multiple proteins, which usually are not essential for replication in vitro, with the capacity to interfere with the MHC molecules or additional cellular components involved in antigen presentation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schuren et al., 2016</xref>). Given the importance of APCs in triggering and maintenance of adaptive antiviral immune responses, herpesviruses have evolved molecular determinants and mechanisms to impair their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brinkmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gewurz et al., 2007</xref>). Among them, different members of the herpesvirus family have been reported to disrupt the interaction established by co-signaling molecules in infected APCs and their counter receptors, in particular by downregulating CD80 and CD86. This is the case for example of the human and murine cytomegaloviruses (HCMV and MCMV, respectively), which cause the downregulation of these two molecules during their respective infectious courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hertel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loewendorf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mintern et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moutaftsi et al., 2002</xref>). However, whether viruses have evolved immune evasion strategies to counteract the ICOSL:ICOS pathway remains largely unexplored.</p><p>Here, we report that ICOSL-mediated co-stimulation contributes to the development of effective anti-MCMV immune responses. In addition, we demonstrate that ICOSL constitutes a major target of CMVs and other herpesviruses, which potently downregulate its expression on the surface of APCs. We show that MCMV uses its immunoevasin m138/fcr-1 to manipulate this co-signaling molecule, impeding a correct T-cell activation during acute MCMV infection. These results reveal a new mechanism of viral immune evasion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MCMV infection rapidly induces a potent ICOSL downregulation in APCs</title><p>ICOSL is constitutively expressed at high levels on APCs, including DCs and macrophages, which are cell types that are susceptible to MCMV infection. In order to evaluate whether MCMV has the capacity to alter cell-surface expression of ICOSL, we initially mock-infected or infected murine peritoneal macrophages, at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10, with a GFP expressing MCMV (MCMV-GFP). Under these conditions, around 50% of the cells in the culture were infected. Three days later, cultures were analyzed by flow cytometry to measure the expression of cell surface ICOSL. At this time point, as expected, the density of MHC I at the cell surface was strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, a pronounced downmodulation of ICOSL was also observed in GFP+ infected cells as compared with uninfected GFP- cells from the same cultures, or with mock-infected samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Indeed, ICOSL levels decreased to almost undetectable levels, whereas the expression of the adhesion molecule CD62L, used as a negative control, remained unaffected. We next assessed if these findings could be extended to primary bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and dendritic cells (BMDC). Importantly, while robust expression of ICOSL was observed on all uninfected (mock or GFP-) cells, the surface reduction of this molecule in MCMV-infected BMMs and BMDCs was significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar results were also obtained upon infection of the macrophage cell line IC-21, the DC line DC2.4, and the endothelial cell line SVEC4-10, although the extent of downregulation differed between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), being quite dramatic on the IC-21 and DC2.4 cells, and more subtle in the SVEC4-10. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that MCMV infection causes a consistent and specific downmodulation of ICOSL from the surface of APCs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Downregulation of ICOSL upon MCMV infection of antigen-presenting cells (APCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peritoneal macrophages (MΦ) were mock-infected or infected for 72 hr with MCMV-GFP at an moi of 5 and analyzed by flow cytometry for surface expression of ICOSL, MHC I, or CD62L using specific mAbs against each of these molecules.

To this end, peritoneal macrophages were infected for 72 hr (infection rates, approximately 90%) with UV-inactivated MCMV, and the results showed no loss of ICOSL surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that a productive MCMV infection was required to alter ICOSL expression. To determine the kinetics of ICOSL downmodulation, we examined its surface expression levels at different time points following infection of peritoneal macrophages with MCMV-GFP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, by 4 hr post-infection (hpi) the density of ICOSL at the cell surface was substantially reduced, and by 6 hpi there was barely any ICOSL at the surface of infected cells. When a similar kinetics was conducted in BMDC and IC-21 cells, the downregulation of ICOSL differed with respect to timing, beginning to be evident by 8 hpi and 16 hpi, respectively, with the effect becoming more prominent from that time point onwards. Thus, we concluded that MCMV encodes one or more proteins to rapidly lower cell surface levels of ICOSL upon infection of APCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The MCMV m138 gene is responsible for ICOSL downmodulation</title><p>In order to find the viral gene/s mediating the observed effects on ICOSL expression, we screened a panel of GFP-expressing MCMV deletion mutants that lack different regions of the viral genome, and which covered a large number of genes dispensable for viral replication in cell culture. The levels of ICOSL were monitored by flow cytometry 3 days after infection of IC-21 cells with the different mutants. We found that, except for the deletion mutant MCMVΔm128-138, all MCMV mutants tested resulted in the marked downmodulation of ICOSL expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see as an example results for the MCMVΔm1-17 mutant). The viral region deleted in MCMVΔm128-138, expanding from ORF m128 to m138, includes some ORFs with functions still unassigned and others involved in viral-host interactions, such as the m129/m131 chemokine homolog associated with tropism to macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fleming et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stahl et al., 2015</xref>), or the m138 protein, originally described as an Fc receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thäle et al., 1994</xref>), and later reported to be also implicated in the reduction of cell surface expression of the NKG2D ligands H60, MULT-1, and RAE-1ε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arapović et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenac et al., 2006</xref>), and interestingly, of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mintern et al., 2006</xref>), a member of the B7 family to which also ICOSL belongs. Based on this later feature of m138 and the fact that the viral protein is expressed early during infection, we speculated that the gene altering ICOSL expression in MCMV-infected cells might be m138. To directly test the hypothesis, we used an MCMV with a deletion in this gene (MCMVΔm138). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, during infection of IC-21 cells with MCMVΔm138, cell surface expression of ICOSL was maintained to levels similar to mock-infected cells, while the levels of CD84, a molecule targeted by the MCMV m154 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strazic Geljic et al., 2020</xref>), used as a control, markedly decreased. These effects were not due to a growth defect of the mutant virus in IC-21 cells, as indicated in earlier studies where comparable multi-step growth kinetics between an MCMV deleted in m137-m139 and parental MCMV were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavanaugh et al., 1996</xref>). These results revealed that one gene product, m138, is responsible for the complete downregulation of ICOSL during MCMV infection.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of the MCMV gene involved in the decreased cell surface expression of ICOSL.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IC-21 cells were mock-infected or infected for 72 hr with MCMV-GFP, MCMV-GFPΔm128-m138, or MCMV-GFPΔm1-m17 at an moi of 10 and examined by flow cytometry for surface expression of ICOSL.

To this end, we cloned the m138 gene fused at the C-terminus with the GFP protein and used the resulting recombinant plasmid (named m138-GFP) or the parental GFP only-expressing plasmid (CTL-GFP) to transiently transfect IC-21 cells. Flow cytometry analysis 24 hr after transfection showed that cells transfected with the m138-expressing construct (GFP+) exhibited a significant reduction of ICOSL surface expression compared to the untransfected control cells from the same cultures or mock-transfected cells (GFP-; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). In contrast, we could not detect any change in the expression of ICOSL in cells transfected with the GFP only-expressing plasmid (compare GFP+ and GFP- cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel). Therefore, these results indicate that m138 is able to exert its downmodulatory effects on ICOSL expression without requiring the MCMV infection context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Localization of m138 during MCMV infection</title><p>m138 has been predicted to be a 569-aa type I transmembrane glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thäle et al., 1994</xref>). Due to the lack of an m138 monoclonal antibody (mAb), the cellular localization of this viral protein during MCMV infection has so far not been directly assessed. Previous studies relied on cells expressing the m138 protein in isolation, or on the different capacity displayed by cells infected with MCMV or with an MCMV mutant lacking the viral protein to bind Ig. Thus, in order to detect m138 in the infection context, we generated a mAb specific for m138, using 300.19 cells stably transfected with the m138 protein HA-tagged at the N-terminus (HA-m138) as immunogen. Then, NIH3T3 cells were infected with MCMV-GFP, and m138 expression was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence employing this newly generated mAb. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (panels a-c and g), using permeabilizing conditions, the viral protein was detected in perinuclear compartments and cytoplasmic ‘large punctate vesicles’ in GFP+ infected cells. Similar results were obtained in MCMV-GFP infected DC2.4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, these results were consistent with earlier reports in transfected cells, showing the m138 protein being mainly expressed in intracellular compartments together with markers of the ER, protein disulfide isomerase-A1 (PDI) and calnexin, in addition with the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mintern et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thäle et al., 1994</xref>). In contrast, in non-permeabilized infected cells, the mAb against m138 failed to detect the viral protein at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, panels d-f), whereas it could be recognized at this location in the 300.19 cells stably transfected with HA-m138 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left panels). When analyzed by flow cytometry, though, a dim expression of m138 at the cell surface of infected cells could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As expected, the viral protein was also strongly recognized at the plasma membrane of the transfected cell when assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel). Finally, to evaluate whether m138 could be found in lysosomes, NIH3T3 cells were infected with MCMVwt for 24 hr and stained with LysoTracker Red DND99, a fluorescent marker that labels acidic components and is employed to identify lysosomes. Infected cells were then analyzed by immunofluorescence using the m138 specific mAb under gently permeabilizing conditions (0.02% saponin) to preserve the LysoTracker staining. The results, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> (panels c, and d), indicated that m138 colocalized with lysosomes.

Since there are no available antibodies capable to detect murine ICOSL in western blot, we generated an NIH3T3 stable cell line expressing HA-ICOSL. We confirmed by flow cytometry that upon infection with MCMVwt, or following transient transfection with the plasmid expressing GFP-tagged m138, but not after infection with MCMVΔm138, HA-ICOSL levels specifically declined at the plasma membrane of the stable HA-ICOSL expressing cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). NIH3T3 HA-ICOSL cells were then mock-infected or infected with MCMVwt or MCMVΔm138, lysates prepared and western blots performed to examine total ICOSL protein levels by staining for the HA tag. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, two ICOSL specific bands, with apparent molecular masses of ~51 and 70 kDa, were detected in the HA-ICOSL stable cell line as compared to untransfected NIH3T3 cells (compare lanes 1 and 2). Notably, in MCMV-infected cell lysates, the 70 kDa band was drastically reduced (lane 4), whereas it was not substantially altered after infection with MCMVΔm138 (lane 5), suggesting that this band corresponds to the mature surface form of ICOSL. Indeed, a mild treatment of the NIH3T3 HA-ICOSL cells with trypsin, which selectively cleaves the ectodomains of molecules at the cell surface, and therefore resulted in the loss of detection of ICOSL when assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), led to the disappearance of the 70 kDa band in the western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 3). Further demonstration that the larger ICOSL species corresponded to the one present at the cell surface was obtained from a parallel experiment in which we immunoprecipitated lysates from biotinylated HA-ICOSL-transfected cells with the anti-HA mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, m138 was altering the expression of the mature form of ICOSL that reaches the cell surface. In addition, we noted, that the 51 kDa band was more abundantly expressed in the infected samples than in the mock-infected samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, compare lanes 2 with lanes 4 and 5). The fact that ICOSL was slightly induced at the cell surface after treatment with UV-inactivated MCMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), could indicate that virion components or the process of viral binding may be causing these effects. Supporting this observation, an analysis of extracts from NIH3T3 HA-ICOSL cells infected with UV-inactivated MCMV indicated that this was the case, with both the 51 kDa and the 70 kDa bands being considerably more abundant than in the mock-infected samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 4). Thus, MCMV infection initially induces ICOSL expression and m138 subsequently leads to the depletion of cell-surface ICOSL, but not of the overall intracellular levels of this molecule.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>m138 leads to a reduction of the expression of ICOSL on the cell surface of infected cells but not of its overall intracellular levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with HA-ICOSL were mock-infected (gray histograms) or infected with MCMVwt or MCMV∆m138 (brown or pink histograms, respectively) and analyzed by flow cytometry for surface expression of ICOSL and MHC I.

We addressed this issue by co-transfecting NIH3T3 cells with the plasmid encoding for HA-ICOSL together with either the construct expressing m138-GFP or an unrelated GFP protein (CTL-GFP), and analyzing the levels of ICOSL expression by western blot before and after treatment with a combination of two lysosomal inhibitors, leupeptin and bafilomycin. Under these transient transfection conditions, and in contrast to the assays in stably transfected NIH3T3 HA-ICOSL cells, ICOSL and m138 were simultaneously expressed, without previous existence of ICOSL at the cell surface. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, in cells co-transfected with the m138-GFP protein, independently of whether or not the lysosomal inhibitor treatment was applied, the 70 kDa ICOSL band, corresponding to ICOSL on the cell surface, was not observed (lanes 4 and 5). In addition, the results also evidenced that the 51 kDa band, corresponding to intracellular ICOSL, augmented (1.5-fold) after exposure to leupeptin and bafilomycin (compare lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, in cells expressing the CTL-GFP protein, both the 51 and 70 kDa bands were present, and the blockade of the lysosomal pathway did not lead to a substantial alteration (1.1-fold) of any of the two ICOSL forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 3). The presence of the 70 kDa mature form of ICOSL when the CTL-GFP was expressed, and its absence upon expression of m138-GFP under conditions of lysosomal inhibition, pointed out that the viral protein was targeting ICOSL before reaching the cell surface. We then infected NIH3T3 HA-ICOSL cells with MCMVwt and examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy m138 and ICOSL expression. A marked colocalization of ICOSL and the viral protein in perinuclear compartments and in cytoplasmic punctate structures could be observed, being more robust after treatment with the lysosomal inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, panels g and h). Accordingly, the expression signal of ICOSL was also increased after treatment with leupeptin and bafilomycin (compare panels a and e in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The results also showed augmented levels of m138 upon exposure to the lysosomal inhibitors (compare panels b and f), indicating that m138 was getting partially co-degraded with its target. These observations were confirmed by flow cytometry in permeabilized NIH3T3 HA-ICOSL MCMV-infected cells, where significant higher levels of expression of both ICOSL and m138 could be detected after blockade of the lysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

We investigated if this was also the case for m138 to exert its effects on the two co-stimulatory molecules ICOSL and CD80, since this could allow us to dissect the impact of the viral protein on the two pathways of T-cell activation. Thus, we created three different m138-GFP mutants, missing the putative N-terminal Ig domain (Ig1; m138ΔIg1-GFP), the middle Ig domain (Ig2; m138ΔIg2-GFP), or both the middle and membrane-proximal (Ig3) Ig domains (m138ΔIg2/3-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, schematic representation of these constructs).

Taking in consideration m138 effects on the two co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and ICOSL, we sought to assess the contribution of m138 at later times of the acute infection by comparing the in vivo phenotype of MCMVm138ΔIg2 with that of MCMVΔm138 and MCMVwt under conditions that included depletion of NK cells or combined depletion of NK cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Of note, previous work with MCMVm138ΔIg2 showed that this mutant virus was capable to downregulate NKG2D ligands MULT-1 and RAE-1ε, but not H60 cell surface molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arapović et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenac et al., 2006</xref>). The information of the effects that MCMVwt and mutants have on these m138 targeted host molecules on the surface of infected cells is indicated in part C of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. C57BL/6 mice were intravenously (i.v.) infected with 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of the different viruses, left untreated or treated with the antibodies to deplete specific lymphocyte subsets, and viral titers in salivary glands and lungs were quantified 14 days post-infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, schematic representation of the assay). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, in the salivary glands, viral titers of MCMVm138ΔIg2, a mutant which is unable to downregulate H60 and ICOSL, were lower than those of MCMVwt. In fact, the MCMVm138ΔIg2 titers in this organ were below the detection limits for all animals, in a similar way as in MCMVΔm138 infected mice. NK cell depletion led to a substantial increase of both MCMVΔm138 and MCMVm138ΔIg2 infection in this organ, but importantly, MCMVm138ΔIg2, which was downmodulating CD80 but not ICOSL, was still heavily attenuated as compared to MCMVwt under these conditions. This finding indicated that ICOSL targeting by m138 is important for the virus to increase its load in salivary glands. Conversely, the downregulation of CD80 by m138 did not seem to play a major role during MCMV replication in this organ. Furthermore, when besides NK cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were depleted, MCMVm138ΔIg2 growth in the salivary glands was completely restored, indicating that m138 via interference with ICOSL evades T-cell responses. It is important to note that when NK cells together with CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were depleted, MCMVΔm138 seemed to be slightly attenuated. This may suggest that m138 is capable to perform additional immune evasion activities independent of NK and T cells. Similar results were obtained when viral titers were evaluated in the lungs of the infected animals, although in this case the contribution of m138 via ICOSL in the control of the MCMV infection seemed to be less significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>MCMV has been reported to induce the accumulation of virus-specific IL10<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in an ICOSL-dependent manner in salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clement et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we directly addressed the impact of m138 on the evasion of MCMV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responses in various organs.

We approached this, by inhibiting ICOSL:ICOS interaction during the acute MCMVΔm138 infection via the administration of a blocking anti-ICOSL antibody. Groups of BALB/c mice were infected with 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> PFU of MCMVΔm138 and treated with or without an anti-ICOSL mAb, starting 1 day prior infection. Salivary gland draining lymph nodes and spleens were extracted in order to analyze by flow cytometry different T and B lymphocyte subsets, and blood collected, at day 14 post-infection. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, a marked decrease of the percentage of Tfh cells in both spleen and lymph nodes was observed when infected mice were deprived of ICOSL-mediated signals. In addition, while the percentage of follicular B cells was not substantially altered, or was even slightly higher, upon ICOSL blockade, GC B cells in lymph nodes were dramatically reduced. Consistent with these observations, an analysis by immunofluorescence of splenic sections revealed that GCs were smaller in size in the infected mice that received anti-ICOSL antibody as compared to mice that did not received it, whereas this was not the case of the follicles, whose sizes seemed not to be affected by the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). These results, which are in agreement with the phenotype associated with ICOS absence, pointed to a disturbed production of MCMV-specific antibodies during the primary infection under conditions of ICOSL blockade.

In this study, we demonstrate that the ligand for the co-stimulatory molecule ICOS is dramatically diminished from the surface of APCs during infection by different herpesviruses. With a primary focus on MCMV, the most widely used model to study CMV infection, we show that the downregulation of ICOSL restricts the magnitude of MCMV-specific T-cell responses and potentiates viral burden in vivo.</p><p>We describe here that ICOSL expression is slightly induced upon cell exposure to MCMV, presumably due to viral sensing by pattern recognition receptors. However, MCMV rapidly removes this molecule from the surface of infected cells by expressing m138. Infections with an MCMV lacking the <italic>m138</italic> gene, and assays with the viral gene expressed in isolation, indicate that m138 is necessary and sufficient to decrease ICOSL cell surface levels. The early expressed m138 protein, which is an Fc receptor homologue, has been shown not only to bind the constant Fc domain of IgG, but also to downmodulate the expression of three cellular ligands of the activating NKG2D receptor, RAE-1ε, H60, and MULT-1, and another B7 family molecule, CD80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arapović et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenac et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mintern et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thäle et al., 1994</xref>). Consequently, this viral protein holds the potential to control the antiviral function of NK and T cells, as well as the humoral response. Hence, the m138 early glycoprotein provides an excellent example of how CMVs have refined proteins to execute multiple immune-evasion functions. It is becoming increasingly clear that the evolution of multifunctional proteins is not only a hallmark of RNA viruses, with limited genome sizes and relatively small number of genes, but that it is also employed by large DNA viruses to make optimal use of their coding capacity. For instance, MCMV produces the multifaceted immunomodulatory protein m152, which is capable of downregulating MHC class I molecules and different RAE-1 isoforms, as well as modulating the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby evading type I IFN-, NK-, and T cell-dependent immune responses to MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krmpotic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lodoen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stempel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ziegler et al., 1997</xref>).

Consistent with its location at the plasma membrane, the viral protein was shown to perturb the endocytosis of surface RAE-1ε and MULT-1, interfering with the clathrin dependent endocytosis of this later cellular target, altering its recycling and leading to its subsequent degradation in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arapović et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenac et al., 2006</xref>). A different mode of action was reported for m138 in the downregulation of CD80, targeting the cellular molecule when newly synthesized early in the secretory pathway and mislocalizing it to lysosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mintern et al., 2006</xref>). To date, studies on the maturation and posttranslational modifications of ICOSL are still lacking, but our observations are compatible with the notion that, as in the case of CD80, m138 interacts with ICOSL, preventing it to mature and reach the plasma membrane, and driving this molecule to lysosomal degradation. Accordingly, we found that during MCMV infection, m138 and ICOSL colocalize in intracellular compartments, where the viral protein is primarily expressed, and that upon treatment with lysosomal inhibitors the levels of both ICOSL and m138 augment. Moreover, our co-precipitation experiments demonstrate that indeed m138 directly associates with ICOSL. The details on how the interactions of m138 with its structurally diverse targets can potentially occur remain to be elucidated. In this regard, solving the crystal structure of m138 alone or bound to its cellular targets may be of great value for understanding its versatility and different modes of action.</p><p>Due to the multiple cellular targets of m138, dissecting the functional consequences of lessening ICOSL cell surface levels on virally infected cells appeared to be complicated. m138 was predicted to contain an ectodomain with three putative Ig-like domains, exhibiting a relatively low but yet significant sequence homology with the Ig-like domains of murine FcγRs CD16 and CD32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Budt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenac et al., 2006</xref>). Previous work indicated distinct m138 structural requirements to downmodulate the different NKG2D ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arapović et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenac et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mintern et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, by generating versions of the m138 protein devoid of some of its Ig domains, and through the use of MCMV recombinants bearing similar deletions within the viral protein, we determined that the downregulation of the two B7-molecules, ICOSL and CD80, was dependent on the N-terminal m138 Ig domain. However, while the middle and membrane-proximal Ig domains of m138 were largely dispensable for disturbing CD80, they needed to be preserved for ICOSL cell surface removal. This result indicates a distinct mode of action of m138 to target the two costimulatory molecules, and gave us the opportunity to separate the corresponding impacts on T-cell activation. Optimal T-cell activation is characterized by rapid proliferation, cytokine production, and efficient effector functions. Importantly, employing an in vitro antigen presentation assay and the m138 mutant MCMVs, we showed that via ICOSL downmodulation, m138 contributes to impair antiviral CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. This agrees with the earlier evidence that the m138 protein expressed in isolation is capable to reduce the ability of DCs to promote T-cell activation in a CD80-dependent manner, and the fact that applying a blocking anti-CD80 antibody only partially reverted these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mintern et al., 2006</xref>). Our observations, however, in the context of the infection, point to a prominent role of the ICOSL-dependent m138 function compromising T-cell stimulation.</p><p>The m138 protein has not an ortholog in HCMV. However, we demonstrate that following a productive HCMV infection of primary monocyte-derived macrophages or differentiated THP-1 cells, which express high levels of ICOSL, a strong ICOSL cell surface downregulation also takes place, and that this process requires viral gene expression. Using a multiplexed proteomic approach and HCMVs with deletions of each individual ORF of the <italic>US12</italic> viral family, Fielding and co-workers had previously described that members of this family selectively target a number of plasma membrane proteins crucial for NK cell activity, adhesion, and cytokine signaling during HCMV infection of human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fielding et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, in these assays, and despite the low levels of ICOSL in human fibroblasts, no reduction of cell surface ICOSL could be observed after infection with HCMVs deleted in either US16 or US20, strongly suggesting that these two HCMV products are involved in ICOSL downregulation. Our findings also indicate that HCMV not only leads to diminished cell surface ICOSL, but also to an abrogation of its expression in whole cell levels, via a lysosomal degradation-independent process. Importantly, a similar complete loss of ICOSL on differentiated THP-1 cells was observed during infection by two α-herpesviruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2. In this case, though, both the mechanism as well as the identity of the viral proteins involved in this process remain to be defined.</p><p>The importance of the ICOSL:ICOS pathway has been explored in several models of bacterial and parasitic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wikenheiser and Stumhofer, 2016</xref>). However, to date, only a limited number of studies on murine models of infection with RNA viruses (LCMV, VSV, and influenza virus), in conditions of ICOS deficiency or blockade with an ICOSL-Ig molecule, have been reported, and shown that ICOS triggering plays a marginal although significant role in the development of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell effector responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertram et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kopf et al., 2000</xref>). But, persisting DNA viruses, with infections more dependent on cell-mediated immune control, may differ. Besides the role played by ICOS in directing effector T-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation, this molecule has been crucially implicated in the generation of T-dependent antibody responses. Thus, in this study, we examined whether anti-MCMV humoral immune responses were altered in the absence of ICOS signaling. Overall, our data employing a blocking monoclonal anti-ICOSL antibody in the context of the acute MCMV infection revealed a high importance of the ICOSL:ICOS axis in the formation of Tfh cells and subsequent GC B-cell development in spleens and lymph nodes follicles, consistent with what has been previously observed in other in vivo experimental models of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wikenheiser and Stumhofer, 2016</xref>). Importantly, as a consequence of the observed effects, ICOSL blockade was associated with a lower production of MCMV-specific IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies. Furthermore, a decreased capacity of the antibodies generated to neutralize MCMV was also observed. Notably, while the CD80/CD86:CD28 co-stimulatory pathway has been shown to be also involved in the induction of Tfh cells and class switching of MCMV-specific antibodies, we find that this pathway is not capable to compensate the defects observed in the absence of ICOS signaling, evidencing the non-redundant role of the two axis in this scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Welten et al., 2016</xref>). We have not directly addressed here whether the lack of ICOSL co-stimulation is associated with a deficient viral control, due to the highly attenuated phenotype of the MCMV defective in m138 employed in the study. Remarkably, a reduction of splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells was also observed in our assays upon ICOSL blockade, further supporting the potential significance of the ICOSL:ICOS axis in the long-term protection against MCMV. Of interest, ICOS- and ICOSL-deficient patients have been associated with combined T- and B-cell immunodeficiency, and importantly, with an increased susceptibility to viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roussel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schepp et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, while the infectious phenotype of these patients varied, a high incidence of recurrent herpesvirus infections, mostly including herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus infections, was observed.</p><p>It was previously shown that deletion of m138 or both m138 and the CD86 downmodulator m147.5 from MCMV has a dramatic impact on viral load during acute infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crnković-Mertens et al., 1998</xref>). To directly address the potential importance of m138-mediated downregulation of ICOSL on viral growth in vivo, we employed the recombinant MCMV expressing m138 without the middle Ig domain, and therefore able to downmodulate CD80 and CD86 but not ICOSL in infected APCs. The fact that under conditions of NK cell depletion the viral mutant was still attenuated at late times post-infection, particularly in the salivary glands, and the nearly complete reversion of this defective phenotype in the absence of NK cells and T cells, indicated that m138 by interfering with ICOSL contributes to subvert T-cell responses in vivo. By performing adoptive transfer assays of exogenous M25-specific transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into C57BL/6 SCID mice, which were depleted of NK cells, and infected with MCMVwt or the MCMV lacking m138, we evaluated the impact that the viral protein may have on immune evasion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in various organs. We observed that m138 clearly contributes to diminish M25-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation in spleen and lungs of infected mice, but not in salivary glands, where virus specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are important for control of the viral infection. It must be noted, however, that since in the study we only measured M25-specific responses, we cannot discard that in the salivary glands m138 may be influencing in a different way CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses specific for other MCMV epitopes. Altogether, our results support the notion that downmodulation of ICOSL by m138 represents an effective immune evasion strategy during the acute MCMV infection. Taking in account these observations, an aspect that deserves to be explored is whether these ICOSL-related activities can be employed by additional herpesviruses or other viral pathogens as a mean to escape host immune surveillance.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study, we present a novel viral tactic to impair T-cell activation, based on the interference with the ICOS:ICOSL co-stimulation pathway. To this end, the herpesviruses analyzed so far seem to exploit ‘self’ proteins, evolved during co-evolution with their hosts, being in the case of murine CMV, a multitasking immunoevasin. Ultimately, the study of these immunoevasins should provide not only new insights into viral pathogenesis, but also enlighten us about critical biological and immunological processes that promote viral control.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell cultures</title><p>NIH3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), SVEC4-10 (SV40-transformed mouse endothelial cells), HFF (human foreskin fibroblasts), HEL299 (human embryonic lung fibroblasts), MEFs (primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts), MEFs immortalized with p53 (kindly provided by Dr. Jay Nelson [Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, USA]), and Vero cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 U/mL of penicillin, 50 g/mL of streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

At least two independent experiments were carried out for each subject of analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>NIH3T3 cells and 300.19 cells, either untransfected or stably transfected with HA-ICOSL or HA-m138, respectively, were cultured on glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates. When specified, NIH3T3 cells were MCMV infected and exposed to lysosomal inhibitors as indicated for the Western blot analysis. At 24 hpi, cells were washed in PBS and fixed and permeabilized using 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% Triton X-100 (for intracellular staining), or just fixed in paraformaldehyde (for cell surface detection), and subsequently blocked with PBS 6% FBS. Cells were stained with anti-m138 mAb or anti-ICOSL, using as secondary antibodies an anti-mouse IgG-A555 or an anti-rat IgG-A488. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI reagent (Invitrogen). In assays where the LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes) was used, cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 hr with 100 nM of the fluorescence dye, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, gently permeabilized with 0.02% saponin, and immediately processed as indicated above. In this case, the anti-m138 mAb and an anti-mouse IgG-A488 were used. The samples were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope at 405 nm (DAPI), at 555–565 nm (A555), and at 495–518 (A488). GFP was observed at 450–490. Fluorescence images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon) or an inverted Leica DMI6000B microscope and the LAS AF software from Leica Microsystems (Leica, Wetzlar). A Zeiss LSM880 laser scanning spectral confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena) equipped with an Axio Observer seven inverted microscope, blue diode (405 nm), Argon (488 nm), diode pumped solid state (561 nm) and HeNe (633 nm) lasers and a Plan Apochromat 63x oil (NA 1.4) immersion objective lenses was also used. DAPI, A-488 and A-555 images were acquired sequentially using 405, 488, and 561 laser lines, AOBS (Acoustic Optical Beam Splitter) as beam splitter and emission detection ranges 415–480, 500–550 nm, and 571–625 nm, respectively, and the confocal pinhole set at 1 Airy units. Spectral detection was performed using two photomultipliers and one central GaAsP detector. Analysis of the co-localization of m138 and the LysoTracker red fluorescence was determined using the ImageJ software analyzing 20 cells from each sample. Colocalization was assessed using Coloc2 plugin from FIJI/ImageJ program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). A macro of instructions was created to process and automate colocalization quantification. Briefly, red and green channel images were background substracted with Rolling Ball Radius of 50 and colocalization was quantified from a region of interest delimiting the cell contour. Manders coefficients were analyzed from each image. M2 Manders colocalization coefficient indicates the percentage of m138 colocalizing with lysosomes, and M1 Manders coefficient the percentage of lysosomes colocalizing with m138. At least two independent experiments were carried out for each subject of analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice were euthanized at the indicated time points and spleens immediately collected within O.C.T. (Sakura) cryo-embedding media at −80°C. Consecutive tissue sections of 2.5 µm were obtained in the cryostat and fixed/permeabilized in acetone. Unspecific binding was prevented with PBS 6% FBS blocking solution. Antigens were detected with a rat anti-mouse CD45R/B220 and PNA (peanut lectin) biotin (Sigma-Aldrich). After 1 hr of incubation at room temperature, B220 antigen was revealed with anti-rat IgG- A488 and PNA with streptavidin-A555. Labeled tissue sections were visualized with a fluorescence microscope. Four consecutive tissue sections were evaluated from three representative mice of each experimental group. Follicle and GC areas were calculated from the total spleen sections of one representative mice of each group using ImageJ software. At least two independent experiments were carried out for each subject of analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Mouse infections, antibody treatment, and determination of viral titers</title><p>Four-week-old BALB/c mice (females and males) were obtained from Harlan (Netherlands) and housed in the vivarium of the Medical School of the University of Barcelona under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. Eight-to-twelve-week-old C57BL/6, TCR transgenic mice specific for M38 (Maxi mice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Torti et al., 2011</xref>), TCR transgenic mice specific for M25-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mandaric et al., 2012</xref>), C57BL/6 SCID and BALB/c mice were housed and bred under SPF conditions at the Central Animal Facility of the Medical Faculty of the University of Rijeka. When specified, ICOSL was blocked by i.p. injection of a rat anti-mouse ICOSL monoclonal antibody (clone HK5.3) at a concentration of 100 µg per mouse. The monoclonal antibody was administrated 1 day before infection and on days 2, 5, 8, and 11 after infection. The efficacy of the in vivo ICOSL blockade was assessed by cytofluorometric analyses of spleen cells from treated mice using an anti-ICOSL recognizing the same epitope than the antibody used in the in vivo assay. For these assays, mice were i.p. inoculated with 2.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mouse of tissue culture-propagated MCMVΔm138. Mice were observed and weighed during all the experiment and at 14 days post-infection, animals were sacrificed, and specific organs were removed, and their sera collected. Salivary gland and lungs were harvested as a 10% (weight/volume) tissue homogenate. Tissue homogenates were sonicated and centrifuged, and viral titers from the supernatants of individual mice were determined by standard plaque assays in MEFs, including a centrifugal enhancement of infectivity step. In experiments evaluating the in vivo effect of MCMV infection on ICOSL surface levels, mice were i.p. inoculated with 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mouse of MCMV-GFP, and 2 days after infection, cells present in the peritoneal cavity were harvested with 5 mL of PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. In depleting assays, 8-to-12-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected i.v. with 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU/mouse of MCMVwt, MCMVΔm138, or MCMVm138ΔIg2. On the day of infection and on days 5th and 10th after infection, indicated groups of mice were injected i.p. with 250 µg of anti-mouse NK1.1, 150 µg of anti-CD8, or 150 µg anti-mouse CD4 depleting antibodies. At day 14 post-infection, mice were sacrificed and viral titers in salivary glands and lungs of individual mice were determined by standard plaque assays. To obtain high-dose systemic infection, BALB/c mice were inoculated i.p. with 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mouse of MCMVwt or MCMVΔm138 for 6 hr after which peritoneal exudate cells were isolated according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ray and Dittel, 2010</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ian R Humphreys (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript, &quot;Cytomegalovirus restricts ICOSL expression on APCs disabling T cell co-stimulation and contributing to immune evasion,&quot; Angulo et al. identify a new viral immune evasion strategy in which herpesviruses interfere with T cell stimulation by antagonizing with the ICOS-ICOSL co-stimulatory activation pathway. The primary focus of the study in murine cytomegalovirus where the authors identify that m138 targets ICOSL for lysosomal degradation and this facilitates virus persistence in vivo. They go on to demonstrate that HCMV and HSV also target ICOSL and, in the case of HCMV, provide evidence supporting a role for the HCMV US16 protein in targeting ICOSL.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Strengthen lysosomal degradation and ICOSL- m138 localisation:</p><p>a) Reviewer #1: While the authors cite previous studies that colocalize LAMP1 and m138, those studies used different cell systems and did not actually quantify colocalization with Pearson coefficients. A key mechanistic argument of this study is m138-mediated targeting of ICOSL to lysosomes. It would seem appropriate for the authors to establish and quantify this colocalization in their specific system. (Additionally, the Thale 1994 paper referenced does not appear to match the statement its associated with.)</p><p>b) Reviewer #2: Given the focus of DCs in this study, why did the authors use NIH 3T3 cells for the localizations studies? Some justification should be given and/or key observations should be repeated in these cell types.</p><p>2) Clarify leupeptin/Bafilomycin blocking studies:</p><p>a) Reviewer #1: In Figure 4G,4H, the authors claim that Leu+Baf results in &quot;significant increase of the 51kDa band&quot;. An increase is apparent, though without quantitation, the designation as &quot;significant&quot; is premature. Also, do the authors have a lighter exposure of the blot, as it's possible this could be overexposed. In 4H (panel c vs d), the authors again claim from single cell images that Leu+Baf increases ICOSL levels. From this data, this claim is premature and should be quantified by FACS or confocal if it is meant to be a major point of the study.</p><p>b) Reviewer #3: Evidence for lysosomal degradation of ICOSL Figure 4 parts G and H. I found the argument with regard to the blocking of the lysosomal pathway by leupeptide and bafilomycin difficult to follow. The results Figure 4F show that with MCMV infection 70KDa ICOSL band is degraded however, blockage of the lysosomal pathway did not restore the band. Figure 4H while showing co-localization of ICOSL and m138 does not provide definitive evidence that this is in lysosomes. Taken together the definitive statement of redirection to lysomes for degradation is not fully supported. I think the results text could be edited to more clearly describe the experiments and the authors logic and the conclusion softened unless further evidence of lysosomal localisation and degradation is available.</p><p>3) Strengthen in vivo data. Where appropriate, ex vivo studies would be sufficient.</p><p>a) Reviewer #2: A significant assumption made by the authors is that ICOSL down-regulation occurs in DCs in vivo. ICOS-L expression by endothelial and epithelial cells has been described (e.g. doi:10.1073/pnas.092576699, doi:10.1002/eji.200535253). However, they provide no evidence for this, only bone marrow-derived cells and cell lines. The authors should demonstrate evidence for MCMV-induced down-regulation of ICOSL by primary mouse DCs (e.g. enriched primary splenic DCs, DC subsets in the peritoneum, or splenic DCs after high-dose systemic infection to enable detection of infected cells). Also, there needs to be discussion of the potential variation in infectivity of BM-DCs versus primary DCs (see PMID: 25120535).</p><p>b) Reviewer #2: The authors should strengthen the link between the impact on virus load in the salivary gland and m138 attenuation. The data regarding the impact of m138 on follicular T cell and antibody development is interesting and may influence control of virus reactivation, but it unlikely to explain the phenotype in the salivary gland given the apparent absence of antibody in control of primary MCMV infection. Indeed, it was been previously published that salivary gland IL-10+ CD4 T cell accumulation is ICOS-dependent in C57BL/6 mice (PMID: 27926930). Given that these cells are Th1 derived, it seems likely that m138 may promote virus persistence via antagonizing development of mucosal Th1 cell responses. The authors should therefore measure the impact of m138 attenuation on virus-specific CD4 T cells.</p><p>c) Reviewer #3 (Related to point b above): 2. It is clear that m138 is an important immune evasion protein with multiple functions and dissecting these in an in vivo model is challenging because of this. The experiments detailed in Figure 7 attempt to do this, however I found the description of the results and the logic to support the conclusions difficult to follow. In part this is because the wt MCMV and m138 mutants effect different immune evasion pathways relevant to NK Cells (m138 downregulates MULT1 and RAE1 but not H60 and T cells m138 downregulates CD80 and ICOSL). Monitoring late viral titres with these viruses, in addition to removing NK cells and NK cells with T cells adds to the complexity of the experiment. I think that an addition to the figure of a panel that details the effects on relevant molecules of the immune system by each virus mutant would be helpful and that the results text should be redrafted to more fully explain the observed results for each of the mutants.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59350.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Strengthen Lysosomal degradation and ICOSL- m138 localisation:</p><p>a) Reviewer #1: While the authors cite previous studies that colocalize LAMP1 and m138, those studies used different cell systems and did not actually quantify colocalization with Pearson coefficients. A key mechanistic argument of this study is m138-mediated targeting of ICOSL to lysosomes. It would seem appropriate for the authors to establish and quantify this colocalization in their specific system. (Additionally, the Thale 1994 paper referenced does not appear to match the statement its associated with.)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that, being an important point in the manuscript, data regarding m138-mediated targeting of ICOSL to lysosomes need to be strengthen. To address this issue we have carried out several experiments. We have performed confocal microscopy studies on MCMV infected cells staining with the red fluorescence marker LysoTracker DND-99, and show now in Figure 3D, that m138 can be detected in lysosomal compartments during infection. Using the Coloc2 plugin from FIJI/ImageJ program we have quantified the m138/lysosome colocalization, obtaining Manders colocalization coefficients of M1=0.76 and M2=0.80 (indicated in the text). In addition, we have examined more precisely the colocalization of m138 and ICOSL in the infection context by confocal microscopy, in the presence and absence of the lysosomal inhibitors leupeptin and bafilomycin, and quantified the abundance of this cellular receptor in both conditions by flow cytometry. In panel B of the new Figure 5, which substitutes the original Figure 4H, we present confocal microscopy images illustrating that m138 and ICOSL colocalize. In addition, a stronger fluorescent signal corresponding to both ICOSL and m138 can be appreciated upon treatment with the lysosomal inhibitors. Moreover, in Figure 5C we show now the results of the quantification of the levels of ICOSL in permeabilized MCMV infected cells by flow cytometry, demonstrating that the expression of both ICOSL and m138 significantly increases after lysosomal inhibitor exposure.</p><p>As indicated, the Thale et al., 1994 reference after the statement mentioning earlier reports showing m138 localization in intracellular compartments in transfection assays has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Reviewer #2: Given the focus of DCs in this study, why did the authors use NIH 3T3 cells for the localizations studies? Some justification should be given and/or key observations should be repeated in these cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason of using NIH3T3 cells for the colocalization studies was mainly due to the fact that these assays were done in parallel with the Western blot analysis, which allowed us to discern between intracellular ICOSL (the 51 kDa band) and ICOSL at the cell surface (the 70 kDa band). The absence of an appropriate antibody that permitted us to specifically detect ICOSL by Western blot required us to generate and employ a stable NIH3T3 HA-ICOSL cell line to perform the assays. However, taking into consideration the reviewer comment, we have now performed a new assay in DC2.4 cells to show that m138 also localizes in perinuclear compartments and cytoplasmic large punctate vesicles (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clarify leupeptin/Bafilomycin blocking studies:</p><p>a) Reviewer #1: In Figure 4G,4H, the authors claim that Leu+Baf results in &quot;significant increase of the 51kDa band&quot;. An increase is apparent, though without quantitation, the designation as &quot;significant&quot; is premature. Also, do the authors have a lighter exposure of the blot, as it's possible this could be overexposed. In 4H (panel c vs d), the authors again claim from single cell images that Leu+Baf increases ICOSL levels. From this data, this claim is premature and should be quantified by FACS or confocal if it is meant to be a major point of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer comment on the increase of the intracellular levels of ICOSL upon treatment with lysosomal inhibitors, which is related to issue 1a from reviewer #2 and that, as indicated above, we have now addressed obtaining results that more strongly support our conclusions.</p><p>Regarding Figure 5A (Figure 4G in the original manuscript), we proceeded to quantify the 51 kDa band for the different samples analyzed in the Western blot. A 1.5-fold increase on the levels of the 51 kDa ICOSL band was obtained after leupeptin and bafilomycin treatment in cells co-transfected with the m138-GFP protein, whereas the addition of the lysosomal inhibitors did not alter substantially (1.1-fold increase) that band in the cells co-transfected with the CTL-GFP protein. These values have been incorporated in the text corresponding to the figure in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Concerning the suggestion of presenting a lighter exposure of the Western blot in Figure 5A, we prefer to retain in the manuscript the exposure that we had in the original submitted version. This exposure permits to clearly visualize that the 70 kDa ICOSL band, which is observed in the absence of m138 (lanes 2 and 3) cannot be detected in the presence of the viral protein (lanes 4 and 5).</p><p>As indicated to reviewer #1 (in the response to comment 1a) we have examined more precisely the expression of ICOSL during MCMV infection in the presence and absence of the lysosomal inhibitors leupeptin and bafilomycin. On one hand, we used confocal microscopy and present now, in the new Figure 5B, images (with more than one cell per field) showing a more intense staining of ICOSL upon treatment with the lysosomal inhibitors. In addition, as suggested, we have quantified the abundance of ICOSL in MCMV infected cells under both conditions by flow cytometry, demonstrating in Figure 5C that the expression of ICOSL significantly increases upon lysosomal inhibitor exposure, from MFI values of 11.628 to 17.682, in NIH3T3 HA-ICOSL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Reviewer #3: Evidence for lysosomal degradation of ICOSL Figure 4 parts G and H. I found the argument with regard to the blocking of the lysosomal pathway by leupeptide and bafilomycin difficult to follow. The results Figure 4F show that with MCMV infection 70KDa ICOSL band is degraded however, blockage of the lysosomal pathway did not restore the band. Figure 4H while showing co-localization of ICOSL and m138 does not provide definitive evidence that this is in lysosomes. Taken together the definitive statement of redirection to lysomes for degradation is not fully supported. I think the results text could be edited to more clearly describe the experiments and the authors logic and the conclusion softened unless further evidence of lysosomal localisation and degradation is available.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in previous answers to issues 1a to reviewer #1 and issue 2a to reviewer #2, we present in the revised version of the manuscript new data to more robustly support our conclusions related to the m138-induced degradation of ICOSL during MCMV infection. In addition, the corresponding text in this section has been slightly modified so it could be followed better.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Strengthen in vivo data. Where appropriate, ex vivo studies would be sufficient.</p><p>a) Reviewer #2: A significant assumption made by the authors is that ICOSL down-regulation occurs in DCs in vivo. ICOS-L expression by endothelial and epithelial cells has been described (e.g. doi:10.1073/pnas.092576699, doi:10.1002/eji.200535253). However, they provide no evidence for this, only bone marrow-derived cells and cell lines. The authors should demonstrate evidence for MCMV-induced down-regulation of ICOSL by primary mouse DCs (e.g. enriched primary splenic DCs, DC subsets in the peritoneum, or splenic DCs after high-dose systemic infection to enable detection of infected cells). Also, there needs to be discussion of the potential variation in infectivity of BM-DCs versus primary DCs (see PMID: 25120535).</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer comment we have conducted additional experiments in which we analyzed the downmodulation of ICOSL, as well as that of CD80, induced by MCMV on infected peritoneal DCs (CD11<sup>+</sup> MHC II<sup>+</sup> CD3<sup>-</sup> CD19<sup>-</sup> NKp46<sup>-</sup> cells) of BALB/c infected mice. More importantly, to assess whether the effects were caused by m138, we also included in the assays infections with MCMV∆m138. The results, which have been incorporated in Figure 8B of the new version of the manuscript, show that MCMV downmodulates ICOSL and CD80 in these primary DCs during the in vivo infection, and confirmed the involvement of m138 in this process.</p><p>With regards to the potential variation in the infectivity ratio between BM-DCs and DCs in peritoneum, the amount of virus, number of DCs and time of infection need to be taken into account. Thus, for example, in our hands, when BM-DCs were infected in vitro with 3 PFU/cell for 24 hours, we usually got an infectivity rate of 15-20%. On the other hand, the number of DCs in the mouse peritoneum is low. In two individual experiments, we detected 15% of total DCs (live CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHC II<sup>+</sup> CD3<sup>-</sup> CD19<sup>-</sup> NKp46<sup>-</sup> cells) among peritoneal exudate cells of uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This percentage dropped to 2-4% of total DCs when mice were given a high dose of virus (10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mice) for 6 hours. Since in these conditions, DC infection rate varied between 5-15%, this means that less than 1% of peritoneal exudate cells corresponded to infected DCs. This number is in line with previous publications where MCMV-GFP virus was used (Hsu et al., 2009). Importantly, and despite these low numbers of infected DCs in mouse peritoneum, we managed to show the influence of the m138 protein on ICOSL and CD80 levels in infected DCs in vivo at early times post-infection (Figure 8B).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(A) Percentage (%) and (B) number (#) of total peritoneal DCs (live Lin<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHC II<sup>+</sup>) and MCMV-infected DCs (m04<sup>+</sup> cells from total DCs).</title><p>BALB/c mice were i.p. infected with 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mice of MCMVwt and MCMVΔm138.

We performed adoptive transfer assays of TCR-transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for the M25 protein (M25-II, Mandaric et al., PLoS Pathog 2012) into C57BL/6 SCID mice, NK cell-depleted, one day prior to infection with either MCMVwt or MCMV∆m138, and analyzed the expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD45.1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup>) 7 days after infection in spleen, lungs and salivary glands. In this mouse model, after NK depletion, only endogenous mononuclear phagocytes are present, and thereby we can exclude the potential role in viral clearance of m138-dependent endogenous lymphocytes. The results of the assay, now included in the new Figure 8—figure supplement 1, show: i) the expansion of the transferred exogenous M25-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells upon antigen encounter (MCMV), and ii) that m138 contributes to diminish the proliferation of these virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in spleen and lungs of infected mice, but not in the salivary gland.</p><p>Although the data argue against a role of m138 in evasion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in salivary glands, it must be taken in account that we have only analyzed CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses specific to the M25 epitope, and that m138 might be influencing in a different way CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell responses specific for other MCMV epitopes. In addition, since CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (and not CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) are crucial for the control of MCMV infection in the salivary glands, data could indicate that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are more efficient in virus elimination in MCMVΔm138- than in MCMVwt-infected mice, at early days post-infection. This will result in less virus in the salivary glands of MCMVΔm138-infected mice at 7 days p.i. As M25-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation in salivary glands is dependent on antigen load, this could explain why there are no differences in the percentage of M25-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells between the two groups of infected mice.</p><p>The text describing the results of Figure 8—figure supplement 1 and the corresponding discussion have been now included in the modified version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Reviewer #3 (Related to point b above): 2.
