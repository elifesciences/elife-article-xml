However, the underFlying molecular mechanism that controls mRNA expression in the round spermatids remains elusive. Here, we identify that FBXO24, an orphan F-box protein, is highly expressed in the testis of humans and mice and interacts with the splicing factors (SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9) to modulate the gene alternative splicing in the round spermatids. Genetic mutation of FBXO24 in mice causes many abnormal splicing events in round spermatids, thus affecting a large number of critical genes related to sperm formation that were dysregulated. Further molecular and phenotypical analyses revealed that FBXO24 deficiency results in aberrant histone retention, incomplete axonemes, oversized chromatoid body, and abnormal mitochondrial coiling along sperm flagella, ultimately leading to male sterility. In addition, we discovered that FBXO24 interacts with MIWI and SCF subunits and mediates the degradation of MIWI via K48-linked polyubiquitination. Furthermore, we show that FBXO24 depletion could lead to aberrant piRNA production in testes, which suggests FBXO24 is required for normal piRNA counts. Collectively, these data demonstrate that FBXO24 is essential for sperm formation by regulating mRNA alternative splicing and MIWI degradation during spermiogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FBXO24</kwd><kwd>MIWI</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>piRNA</kwd><kwd>spermiogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82001620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhiming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82171605</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Shuiqiao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC1004500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Liquan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Open Research Fund of the National Center for Protein Sciences at Peking University in Beijing</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KF-202205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhiming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Open Research Fund of Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020B1212060029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhiming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82371627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhiming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Animal models and molecular data reveal how FBXO24 regulates mRNA expression and MIWI degradation in the round spermatids.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spermatogenesis is a dynamic but well-organized process in which germ cells develop in the seminiferous tubules of the testis. Spermatogenesis comprises three phases: mitosis of the spermatogonia, meiosis of spermatocytes, and differentiation of round spermatids into mature sperm. The third phase is also known as spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, round spermatids undergo many significant changes, including the loss of cytoplasm, migration of cytoplasmic organelles, formation of the acrosome and flagellum, condensation of nuclei, and reorganization of mitochondria around the sperm midpiece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jha et al., 2017</xref>). In mice, spermiogenesis is subdivided into 16 steps based on changes in acrosome structure and nuclear compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed and de Rooij, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meistrich and Hess, 2013</xref>). Coordinated regulation of gene expressions in the round spermatids is essential for sperm formation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that controls mRNA expression during spermiogenesis remains elusive.</p><p>FBXO24 (F-Box Protein 24) is a member of the F-box protein family characterized by an F-box domain. The F-box proteins constitute one of the subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCF (SKP1-cullin-F-box). The interaction between FBXO24 and the SCF subunits is unknown. The F-box domain recruits the F-box protein to the SCF complex, and the carboxy-terminal domain is a putative proteinâprotein interaction domain. According to the different substrate recognition domains, F-box protein was generally divided into three subclasses: F-box/WD repeat-containing protein (FBXW), leucine-rich repeat protein (FBXL), and F-box only protein (FBXO) with/without other unknown domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kipreos and Pagano, 2000</xref>). Compared with the studies of FBXW and FBXL, the roles of most members of the FBXO subfamily have yet to be defined. FBXO24 belongs to the FBXO class. Previous studies demonstrated some FBXO proteins could regulate spermatogenesis. For example, FBXO47 has been reported to be essential for meiosis I progression in the spermatocytes of mouse testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hua et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tanno et al., 2022</xref>), and FBXO43 was associated with male infertility and teratozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, FBXO24 has been reported to recognize deacetylated nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NDPK-A) to enhance its degradation in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). In H1299 cells, FBXO24 could promote cell proliferation by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). However, the molecular and biological functions of FBXO24 remain unclear, especially its role in male fertility and sperm formation.</p><p>In this study, we find that the transcripts encode FBXO24 are abundantly expressed in the testis of humans and mice. The loss function of FBXO24 in mice resulted in male sterility, with sperm possessing a collapsed mitochondrial sheath and uncompacted chromatin. We revealed that FBXO24 interacts with splicing factors (e.g., SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9) to mediate gene expressions during spermiogenesis. Unexpectedly, we discovered that FBXO24 mediates MIWI ubiquitination and regulates the chromatoid body (CB) architecture and piRNA production. Together, our study demonstrated that FBXO24 plays a critical role in controlling gene expression in haploid spermatids and sperm formation during spermiogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FBXO24 expressed in haploid spermatids during spermiogenesis</title><p>Interestingly, qPCR (Realtime quantitative PCR) analysis of multiple mouse organs showed that FBXO24 mRNA was predominantly expressed in mouse testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Multi-alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that <italic>Fbxo24</italic> encodes a highly conserved protein expressed in mammals, including humans and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). FBXO24 has two domains, F-box and regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1), which were also highly conserved in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent with this result, transcription expression of analysis of FBXO24 in various human organs from the GE-mini database revealed FBXO24 also a testis-enriched expression in human testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Further qPCR analysis of the testis at different developmental stages and purified testicular cells showed that FBXO24 mRNA was highly expressed in the round spermatids and elongating spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). We used the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-editing system to generate a mouse model containing the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> gene with a C-terminal HA epitope tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). To examine the protein level of FBXO24 in testes, we then characterized the tissue expression pattern of FBXO24 in various organs from adult <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-tagged transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Consistent with the mRNA expression showing a testis-enriched expression of FBXO24, FBXO24<sup>HA-Tag</sup> protein was exclusively expressed in the testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting FBXO24 plays a role in sperm formation. To explore the subcellular localization of FBXO24 in male germ cells, we performed immunofluorescence analysis by co-staining of FBXO24<sup>HA-Tag</sup> protein with Î³-H2AX (a marker of meiotic DNA damage response) or PNA (an acrosome marker) in adult <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-Tagged transgenic mouse testes. The results showed that FBXO24<sup>HA-Tag</sup> protein was exclusively localized in the nuclei and cytoplasm of spermatids at stages VIâIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>), demonstrating FBXO24 expressed in the round and elongating spermatids at steps 6â9. These results indicate that FBXO24 is an evolutionarily conserved testis-enriched protein specifically expressed in haploid spermatids during spermiogenesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression profiles of FBXO24 during testicular development and spermatogenesis in mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) qPCR analysis of FBXO24 mRNA levels in multiple organs in mice. <italic>n</italic> = 3/group.

Two small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed to target exon 3, which encodes the conserved F-box domain. To validate nucleotide deletion at the targeted loci, the corresponding genomic regions of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> were evaluated by PCR. qPCR analysis verified the mRNA expression of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> was almost undetectable in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mouse testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). To test the fecundity of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, we crossed <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice with fertility-proved wild-type (WT) mice for at least 6 months. The fertility test results showed that <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO males were completely infertile, but the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO females were fertile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed the testis size and the ratio of testis weight to body weight were comparable between <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO males and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with these observations, histological analysis of adult testes and epididymis showed no obvious abnormalities in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). However, in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, we found fewer elongating spermatids (at stages IXâX) and condensing spermatids (at stage XII) and a reduced number of condensed spermatids (at stages IIâVIII) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), concomitant with increased apoptotic signals detected in late spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E,F</xref>), which suggesting FBXO24 deficiency could affect spermatid development during spermiogenesis. To further demonstrate the critical function of FBXO24 during spermiogenesis, we attempted to use the <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-tagged transgenic mice to rescue sperm formation and fertility in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO males. As expected, we found that expression of the transgenic FBXO24 could rescue the defects in spermiogenesis and infertility observed in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G</xref>), which confirmed the specific targeting of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> in the mutants and the true role of FBXO24 in spermiogenesis.

The results showed that the sperm count and motility were significantly reduced in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Inspiringly, we found that most of the spermatozoa in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice displayed a disorganized mitochondrial sheath and had abnormal bending of the flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In WT spermatozoa, the midpiece connected smoothly to the principal piece; however, in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa, a gap in the midpiece can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), leading to many sperm with an abrupt bending of the tail in the region of the neck and midpiece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, we observed the midpiece length was significantly shorter in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mouse spermatozoa compared with WT (21.67 Â± 1.524 Î¼m in WT vs. 14.80 Â± 3.430 Î¼m in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To better reveal spermatozoon abnormalities in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, we decided to examine the ultrastructure of the spermatozoa using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In WT spermatozoa, the midpiece was normally populated with many mitochondria in a spiraling fashion. However, in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa, mitochondria near the annulus were absent, resulting in a shorter mitochondrial sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) further confirmed that mitochondria were not present near the annulus or neck and left apparent gaps along the mitochondrial sheath in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), indicating mitochondrial sheath formation was disrupted. In addition, some mitochondria in the midpiece of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa appeared large and vacuolar. To determine whether the failure in the assembly of the mitochondrial sheath could cause disrupted flagellar development, we examined cross-sections of the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO sperm flagellum. In the midpiece, well-defined outer dense fibers (ODFs) and the axoneme consisting of the typical â9 + 2â microtubules were observed in WT spermatozoa, whereas the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa displayed incomplete axonemes with missing axonemal microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

We ectopically expressed FBXO24-mCherry in HEK293T cells and incubated FBXO24-mCherry with the testicular protein lysate. MIWI and CUL1 were detected in FBXO24 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), suggesting that FBXO24 could bind MIWI and CUL1 in vivo. To confirm that FBXO24 endogenously interacted with its candidates, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) with the testis of <italic>Fbxo24</italic>-HA-tagged transgenic mice. Through co-immunoprecipitation assays, we identified that FBXO24 indeed interacts with MIWI and SCF subunits, including CUL1, SKP1, and RBX1. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). To further dissect the binding abilities between FBXO24 and MIWI, we examined which domain was responsible for the interaction through the truncated proteins of FBXO24, which only contain the F-box or RCC1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The IP results showed that both the F-box and RCC1 domains of FBXO24 could bind with MIWI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Furthermore, we found that FBXO24 leads to a decreased level of MIWI in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting FBXO24 modulates the degradation of MIWI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Because K48- and/or K63-linked polyubiquitination was reported to be responsible for degradation, trafficking, and phosphatase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tracz and Bialek, 2021</xref>), we then asked which kind of modification participates in MIWI ubiquitination. We found that overexpression of FBXO24 enhanced polyubiquitination of MIWI in the presence of Ub (K48) but did not enhance polyubiquitination of MIWI in the presence of Ub (K63) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that FBXO24 contributes to the decreased expression of MIWI in a ubiquitin-dependent manner, and the ubiquitin level of MIWI appeared to be reduced in FBXO24 KO round spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,H</xref>).

To define its biological roles in vivo, we generated genetically engineered <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO and <italic>Fbxo24</italic> HA-tagged transgenic mouse models. Our functional study demonstrated that FBXO24 is essential for spermiogenesis and piRNA production. FBXO24 deficiency leads to remarkable histone retention and the disruption of histone-to-protamine transition in the mature sperm. A growing number of studies have demonstrated impaired chromatin condensation can cause nuclear damages as DNA denaturation or fragmentation often associated with male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filatov et al., 1999</xref>). The molecular basis of nuclear condensation is related to key events such as the expression of testis-specific histone variants, post-translational modifications of histones, and transient DNA strand breaks. Indeed, we found that, in the current study, FBXO24 could modulate the homeostasis of the histone-to-protamine transition regulators PHF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), TSSK6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jha et al., 2017</xref>), and RNF8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2010</xref>), while RNF8 was reported to be independent to the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Although the abnormalities of mitochondrial sheaths are observed in infertile men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kubo-Irie et al., 2005</xref>), the key proteins implicated in sperm mitochondrial sheath formation largely remain unclear due to a lack of good animal models with the typical phenotype. Notably, we found that the round spermatids and spermatozoon of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice have impaired mitochondrial architecture, with mitochondrial size heterogeneity and a more open structure of the mitochondria with less crista. The defective mitochondria were associated with energetic disturbances and reduced sperm motility. Using MitoTracker staining and an electron microscope, we demonstrated the mitochondrial structure is severely disrupted in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa. Previous studies showed abnormalities of the annulus (<italic>Sept4</italic> and <italic>Sept12</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kissel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shen et al., 2017</xref>), and chromatid bodies (<italic>Tssk1</italic> and <italic>Tssk2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dirami et al., 2015</xref>) can disrupt abnormal mitochondrial coiling. The CB was considered to migrate to the caudal end of the developing middle piece of the flagellum, moving in front of the mitochondria that are engaged in mitochondrial sheath morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fawcett et al., 1970</xref>). This study revealed that FBXO24 regulates spatiotemporal mitochondrial dynamics during spermiogenesis. FBXO24 might serve as a critical protein in regulating sperm mitochondrial sheath formation, which expands the knowledge of sperm mitochondria formation. In addition, we found that FBXO24 is indispensable for proper flagellum formation, such as axoneme and ODFs. Therefore, the reduction of sperm motility of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO male mice observed in this study might attribute to the uncompleted mitochondrial formation of the middle piece and defective flagellum assembling.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the RNA-seq data of the round spermatids showed that FBXO24 ablation leads to dysregulation in the mRNA expression of many genes related to chromatin, mitochondria, and flagellum. We found mRNA expression changes were related to the mRNA alternative splicing in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO round spermatids. Combined with our IP evidence of molecular interactions between FBXO24 and the key splice factors (SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9), it is reasonable to infer that dysregulation of these splicing factors inevitably would lead to more splicing errors in their target genes, thus amplifying the initial adverse effects and generating a vicious circle of aberrant splicing. Of note, many genetic changes identified in this study have been closely associated with sperm formation. For example, <italic>Zmynd12</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dacheux et al., 2023</xref>), <italic>Bbs7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and <italic>Ube2j2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koenig et al., 2014</xref>) were required for flagellum function and male fertility. <italic>Map7d1</italic> facilitates microtubule stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kikuchi et al., 2022</xref>) and <italic>Mfn1</italic> deficiency leads to defects in mitochondrial activity and male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Phf7</italic> modulates BRDT stability and histone-to-protamine exchange during spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Kat5</italic> encodes an essential lysine acetyltransferase, which is involved in regulating gene expression and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gehlen-Breitbach et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>Nucb2</italic> suppresses the acrosome reaction in sperm within the mouse epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, our study, for the first time, provides evidence that FBXO24 interacts with the splicing factors to regulate the alternative splicing of mRNA involved in round spermatid development. However, the exact regulatory mechanism of how FBXO24 facilitates the mRNA alternative splicing needs further study.</p><p>MIWI and piRNAs are highly abundant in round spermatids, but their levels start to decline normally in elongating spermatids and are completely eliminated in matured sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng and Lin, 2002</xref>). Interestingly, Mo-Fang Liu et al. reported that piRNA-triggered MIWI degradation occurs in late spermatids through the APC/C-26S proteasome pathway in vitro, which in turn leads to piRNA elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). As many piRNAs also appear to have the capacity to target diverse mRNA, they demonstrated that piRNAs act extensively as siRNAs to degrade specific mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zuo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gou et al., 2014</xref>). Overexpression of a piRNA cluster in the mouse genome can reduce the expression of mRNA required for spermatogenesis, leading to male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goh et al., 2015</xref>). The level of 29â31 nt piRNAs was remarkably increased in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes, which raises a possibility that piRNA-related transcriptional repression might contribute to the reduction of mature sperm in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice. In the current study, we identified that testis-enriched FBXO24 could interact with MIWI and mediate its degradation via the K48-linked ubiquitination, which provides new insight into MIWI degradation during spermiogenesis.</p><p>In summary, this study revealed a novel role for FBXO24 in controlling mRNA alternative splicing of round spermatids and MIWI/piRNA pathway, and demonstrated that FBXO24 is required for mitochondrial organization and chromatin condensation in mouse spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The results disclosed FBXO24 interacts with splicing factors to regulate the mRNA splicing of some essential genes required for spermiogenesis, which probably functionally connects the dysregulation of genes involved in mitochondria migration and histone removal during spermiogenesis. FBXO24 interplays with the subunits of the SCF complex and mediated MIWI degradation.

The beads were washed with IP buffer and then boiled in 2Ã SDS loading buffer for western blotting analysis.</p><p>For cell line IP experiments, the HEK293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). After 48 hr, IP was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2022</xref>). 25 Î¼l mCherry-Trap bead 50% slurry (AlpaLife, ktsm1331, China) was used and all wash steps were performed with washing buffer (10 mM TrisâHCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid). mCherry-Trap beads were washed with dilution buffer prior to addition to the cell lysate. Beads were incubated with cell lysate at 4Â°C for 2 hr following another wash step. To elute the proteins from the beads, 40 Î¼l sample buffer (120 mM TrisâHCl pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.04% Bromophenol blue, 10% Î²-mercaptoehanol) was added and boiled at 95Â°C for 5 min. mCherry-tagged proteins were detected by western blotting using an anti-mCherry antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Spermatogenic cell isolation</title><p>Spermatogenic cells were isolated from the whole mouse testis using the STA-PUT method described previously with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BellvÃ©, 1993</xref>). In brief, testes were collected from 8-week-old mice WT and <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice and decapsulated with collagenase treatment to remove Leydig cells. The dispersed seminiferous tubules were then digested with trypsin and DNase I to single-cell suspensions. Next, Sertoli cells were separated from germ cells by filtration through a 40-mm cell strainer and by adhesion to lectin-coated culture plates. Store the cells in the 1Ã Krebs buffer on ice. Different germ cell populations were separated using a manually prepared 0.5â5% discontinuous BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) density gradient for velocity sedimentation sediment. After sedimentation (1.5 hr, 4Â°C), enriched fractions of the cell were manually collected, and the cell concentration was determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>RNA isolation and quantitative qPCR</title><p>Total RNAs were extracted from purified germ cell fractions using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, UK) following the manufacturerâs procedure. The purity and concentration of RNA samples were determined using a Nanodrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Madison, USA). Reverse transcription of 500 ng purified total RNA was performed by PrimeScript RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Dalian, China). RT-qPCR was performed with SYBR green master mix (Takara, Dalian, China) on the ABI Step One System (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturersâ procedure. The relative gene expression was quantified using the comparative cycle threshold method, with the <italic>Gapdh</italic> expression used for normalization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>RNA-seq analysis</title><p>1 Î¼g of total RNA was used from each group to prepare the mRNA libraries using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kit Set A (Cat. No. RS-122-2101, Illumina) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. All libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. The FASTX-Toolkit was used to remove adaptor sequences, and low-quality reads from the sequencing data. To identify all the transcripts, we used Tophat2 and Cufï¬inks to assemble the sequencing reads based on the UCSC mm10 mouse genome. The differentially expression analysis was performed by Cuffdiff. The differential expressed genes were set with the threshold of p &lt; 0.05 and fold change &gt;2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Small RNA-seq and annotation</title><p>For small RNA-seq, the total RNA from adult testes was gel fractionated, and those 16â40 nt in length were enriched by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and purified for small RNA-seq. The small RNA libraries were constructed using the Digital Gene Expression for Small RNA Sample prep kit (Illumina). Sequencing of the small RNA library was performed by Illumina HiSeq Xten. Small RNA annotation was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuramochi-Miyagawa et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are presented as mean Â± standard deviation unless otherwise noted in the figure legends.

The authors demonstrated that FBXO24 deficiency impairs sperm head formation, midpiece compartmentalization, and axonemal/peri-axonemal organization in mature sperm, which causes sperm motility defects and male infertility. In addition, FBXO24 interacts with various mRNA splicing factors, which causes altered splicing events in Fbxo24-null round spermatids.

The final part of spermatogenesis is called spermiogenesis, in which spermatids differentiate into mature sperm by developing an acrosome and a motile flagellum, which are required for reaching and successfully penetrating the oocyte. This process of spermatogenesis is based on a coordinated regulation of gene expressions in round spermatids. In the current study, FBXO24 was identified as a highly expressed protein in human and mouse testis. To define its biological role in vivo, the authors generated genetically engineered Fbxo24 knockout and Fbxo24-HA-labeled transgenic mouse models.</p><p>To elucidate the causes of the observed sterility in Fbxo24-KO males, the authors performed molecular and phenotypic analyses that revealed aberrant histone retention, incomplete axonemes, oversized chromatoid bodies (CB), and abnormal mitochondrial coiling along the sperm flagella. These results support the causal role of the FBXO24 gene in sperm motility.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors carefully characterized by SEM, TEM and western blot analyses that deletion of FBXO24 leads to incomplete histone-to-protamine exchange and defective chromatin interaction during spermiogenesis. In addition to increased MIWI expression, the authors show that FBXO24 interacts with SCF subunits and mediates the degradation of MIWI via K48-linked polyubiquitination.</p><p>This is a solid work demonstrating the role of FBXO24 in modulating alternative mRNA splicing, MIWI degradation and normal spermiogenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91666.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This work is carried out by the research group led by Shuiqiao Yuan, who has a long interest and significant contribution in the field of male germ cell development. The authors study a protein for which limited information existed prior to this work, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, FBXO24. The authors generated the first FBXO24 KO mouse model reported in the literature using CRISPR, which they complement with HA-tagged FBXO24 transgenic model in the KO background. The authors begin their study with a very careful examination of the expression pattern of the FBXO24 gene at the level of mRNA and the HA-tagged transgene, and they provide conclusive evidence that the protein is expressed exclusively in the mouse testis and specifically in post-meiotic spermatids of stages VI to IX, which include early stages of spermatid elongation and nuclear condensation. The authors report a fully sterile phenotype for male mice, while female mice are normal. Interestingly, the testis size and the populations of spermatogenic cells in the KO mutant mice show small (but significant) reduction compared to the WT testis. Importantly, the mature sperm from KO animals show a series of defects that were very thoroughly documented in this work by scanning and transmission electron microscopy; this data constitutes a very strong point in this paper. FBXO24 KO sperm have severe defects in the mitochondrial sheath with missing mitochondria near the annulus, and missing outer dense fibers. Collectively these defects cause abnormal bending of the flagellum and severely reduced sperm motility. Moreover, defects in nuclear condensation are observed with faint nuclear staining of elongating and elongated spermatids, and reduction of protein levels of protamine 2 combined with increased levels of histones and transition protein 1. All the above are in line with the observed male sterility phenotype.</p><p>The authors also performed RNASeq in the KO animal, and found profound changes in the abundance of thousands of mRNAs; changes in mRNA splicing patterns were noted as well. This data reveals deeply affected gene expression patterns in the FBXO24 KO testis, which further supports the essential role that this factor serves in spermiogenesis. Unfortunately, a molecular explanation of what causes these changes is missing; it is still possible that they are an indirect consequence of the absence of FBXO24 and not directly caused by it.</p><p>The finding that Miwi protein levels are increased in the FBXO24 KO testis is an important point in this work, and it is in agreement with the observed increased size of the chromatoid body, where most of Miwi protein is accumulated in round spermatids. This finding is well supported with experiments performed in 293T cells showing that Miwi ubiquitination is FBXO24 dependent in this ectopic system. Moreover, the authors detect reduced ubiquitination of endogenous Miwi protein immunoprecipitated from FBXO24 KO testis. Consistent with an increase in Miwi protein levels, Miwi-sized piRNAs show increased abundance in total RNA from FBXO24 KO testis. It has been documented that Piwi proteins stabilize their piRNA cargo, so the increase in piRNA levels in 29-32 nt sizes is most likely not a result of altered biogenesis, but increased half-life of the piRNAs as a result of Miwi upregulation. piRNAs have been involved in the regulation of mRNAs in the post-meiotic spermatid, but it is unclear how increased Miwi protein and its piRNA cargo at the levels observed in this study contribute to the complete infertility phenotype of the FBXO24 KO male mice.</p><p>Therefore, a well-reasoned narrative on if and how the absence of FBXO24 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase is responsible for the observed mRNA and protein differential expression is largely absent. If FBXO24-mediated ubiquitination is required for normal protein degradation during spermiogenesis, protein level increase should be the direct consequence of genuine FBXO24 targets in the KO testis. Apart from Miwi, the possible involvement of ubiquitination was not shown for any other proteins that the authors found interact with FBXO24 such as splicing factors SRSF2, SRSF3, SRSF9, or any of the other proteins whose levels were found to be changed (reduced, thus the change in the KO is less likely due to absence of ubiquitination) such as ODF2, AKAP3, TSSK4, PHF7, TSSK6 and RNF8. Interestingly, the authors do observe increased amounts of histones and transition proteins, but reduced amounts of protamines, which directly shows that histone to protamine transition is indeed affected in the FBXO24 KO testis, consistent with the observed less condensed nuclei of spermatozoa. Could histones and transition proteins be targets of the proposed ubiquitin ligase activity of FBXO24, and in its absence, histone replacement is abrogated? Providing experimental evidence to address this possibility would greatly expand our understanding on why FBXO24 is essential during spermiogenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91666.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhiming</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong University of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xingping</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong University of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong University of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yuanyuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong University of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Liquan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong University of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Shuiqiao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong University of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>However, there are several concerns to be explained more in this study.

Do the heterozygous males and their sperm have any physiological defects like FBXO24-deficient mice?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question. We did the phenotype analysis and found that heterozygous males are all fertile, and their sperm do not have any physiological defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Fbxo24-KO sperm carries swollen mitochondria. How do the mitochondria affect sperm function?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this interesting question. Based on our data and published literature, the defective mitochondria were associated with energetic disturbances and reduced sperm motility, as shown on Page 12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) TEM images show that Fbxo24-KO spermatids carry swollen mitochondria and enlarged chromatoid bodies. How the swollen mitochondria and enlarged chromatid are defective for sperm motility and flagellar development, requires more explanation. In addition, it is unclear how the enlarged diameter of the chromatoid body is critical for normal sperm development.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. The chromatoid bodies are considered to be engaged in mitochondrial sheath morphogenesis. Analysis of the chromatoid bodies' RNA content reveals enrichment of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), further emphasizing the role of the chromatoid bodies in post-transcriptional regulation of spermatogenetic genes. We added this explanation on Page 12-13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors only show band images to compare the protein amounts between WT and KO sperm and round spermatids. As the blots for loading controls are not clear, the authors should quantify the protein levels and perform a statistical comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We quantified the protein levels and performed a statistical comparison, as shown in Figure S3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors show the defective sperm head structure from Fbxo24-KO sperm in Figure 5. However, the Fbxo24-KO sperm heads seem quite normal in Figure 3. How many sperm show defective sperm head structure? In addition, the authors observed altered histone-to-protamine conversion in sperm, but it is unclear whether the altered nuclear protein conversion causes morphological defects in the sperm head.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comments. In our study, we found over 80% of Fbxo24 KO sperm showed defective structure in the sperm head. Altered histone-to-protamine conversion caused the decondensed nucleus of Fbxo24 KO sperm. Notably, in many knockout mice studies, impaired chromatin condensation is frequently associated with abnormal sperm head morphology, as shown in reference 15 of Page 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors compare the protein levels of RNF8, PHF7, TSSK6, which participate in nuclear protein replacement in sperm. However, considering the sperm is the endpoint for the nuclear protein conversion, it is unclear to compare the protein levels in mature sperm. The authors might want to compare the protein levels in developing germ cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Yes, we actually detected the protein levels of RNF8, PHF7, and TSSK6 in the testes, not in sperm. We have corrected it in the Figure 5E. We apologize for our carelessness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7)This reviewer suggests describing more rationales for how the authors focus on the MIWI protein. Also, it is wondered whether MIWI is also detected from testis co-IP mass spectrometry.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this suggestion. Since MIWI was a core component of CB and also identified as an FBOX24 interacting partner from our immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) (Table S1), we focused on the examination of MIWI expression between WT and Fbxo24 KO testes. We have added this description in the revision (see lines 191-193 on page 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors need to provide a more detailed explanation for how the altered piRNA production affects physiological defects in germ cell development. In addition, it will be good to describe more how the piRNAs affect a broad range of mRNA levels.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. The previously published studies have demonstrated that piRNAs could act as siRNAs to degrade specific mRNAs during male germ cell development and maturation. We have cited these studies on lines 369-372 of Page 13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The authors observed an altered splicing process in the absence of FBXO24. However, it is a little bit confusing how the altered splicing events affect developmental defects. Therefore, the authors should state which mRNAs have undergone abnormal splicing processes and provide ontology analysis for the genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the ontology analysis and showed the new data in Figure S4D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>(1) Figure 1A-C - Statistical comparison is missed.

However, the description is unclear and the sperm shown in Figure 3C seems quite normal. The authors should clarify the abnormal bending pattern of the tail and show quantified results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. In Fbxo24 KO sperm, abnormal bending of the sperm tails mainly included neck bending and midpiece bending. We have shown them in Figure S3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors mention that Fbxo24-KO sperm have swollen mitochondria at the midpiece, but this is also unclear. How many mitochondria are swollen in Fbxo24-KO sperm?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question. However, since it is very difficult to observe all of the mitochondria in each sperm using the electronic microscope, we could not quantify the swollen mitochondria in Fbxo24 KO sperm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Scale bar information is missed - Fig 3C insets, Fig 3D, Fig 3F insets, 4A insets, Figure 4C insets.</p></disp-quote><p>All the scale bars have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) How many sperm have annulus defects? In Figure 3F, WT sperm does not have an annulus, which could be damaged during sample preparation. Is the annulus defects in Fbxo24-KO sperm consistent?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for asking these questions. Based on our results, about 30% of Fbxo24 KO sperm showed defective annulus structure. Since both TEM (Figure 3F) and SEM (Figure 3G) results clearly showed the defective annulus structure of Fbxo24 KO sperm, we believe the annulus defects are consistent and highly unlikely caused by sample preparation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) A Cross-section image for the endpiece of Fbxo24-KO sperm is not suitable. There is a longitudinal column structure of the principal piece.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. It is difficult to observe a completely longitudinal structure of sperm tail under TEM. The cross-section of the endpiece and principal piece allowed us know the structure of the axoneme, ODFs and fibrous sheath (FS).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) The endpiece of Fbxo24-KO sperm seems to have a normal axoneme. Do all endpieces of Fbxo24KO sperm have normal axoneme? Also, the authors need to describe whether an axonemal structure is damaged and disrupted in all Fbxo24-KO sperm.</p></disp-quote><p>Our TEM data showed the axonemal structure was impaired in the endpiece of Fbxo24 KO sperm (See right panels of Figure 3H). Moreover, based on the ultrastructure analysis of TEM, we found over 90% of Fbxo24 sperm had a damaged axonemal structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Reference blots in Fig 3I, 3J, 4E (left), 5C and 5E are quite faint. The authors should replace the blot images.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this.

As suggested, the schematic of the HA-Fbxo24 knock-in strategy has been supplemented in Figure S2A. The description of using the transgenic mouse has been added to the results, as shown on page 4 of lines 102-103.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is not clear to what extent the phenotypic and molecular characterization of HA-transgenic mice is performed. For example, Lines 134-139: The use of Fbxo24-HA labeled transgenic mice results in the rescue of spermatogenesis and fertility as shown in Figure 2F by measuring the litter size. It is not clear how this observation leads the author to state that this rescues defects in spermiogenesis. Please clarify how and what other measures are taken to support this conclusion. Is the observed infertility due to defects in spermatogenesis or spermiogenesis?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. We crossed FBXO24-HATag males with FBXO24â/â females to obtain FBXO24â/â; FBXO24-HATag males. We examined the testes volume and histological morphology of FBXO24â/â; FBXO24-HATag males and found that they were similar to FBXO24+/â; FBXO24-HATag littermates, indicating that spermatogenesis was restored, as shown in Figure S2H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 107 vs Line 114: Please use the terminology spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis consistently throughout the text. Earlier in the introduction, the authors clearly defined that spermatogenesis involves three phases, with the third phase referred to as spermiogenesis. However, the author concludes in the first line that &quot;FBXO24 plays a role during spermatogenesis&quot; while summarizing at the end of the paragraph that this protein is &quot;expressed in haploid spermatids specifically during spermiogenesis&quot;. Therefore, it is not clear whether the authors conclude that FBXO24 is important for all of spermatogenesis (line 107) or only for part of spermiogenesis (line 114). Another example is line 219 vs. 238: At this point in the manuscript, it is again unclear whether the authors want to study molecular changes during spermatogenesis or spermiogenesis upon FBXO24 depletion. Many examples of such cases throughout the text, and it is recommended to be consistent in using more restrictive terminology whenever applicable for a clear interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for your careful review.
