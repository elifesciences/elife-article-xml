response to replication stress and is best known for ensuring the fidelity of homologous recombination. Using single-molecule tracking in live fission yeast to investigate Smc5/6 chromatin association, we show that Smc5/6 is chromatin associated in unchallenged cells and this depends on the non-SMC protein Nse6. We define a minimum of two Nse6-dependent sub-pathways, one of which requires the BRCT-domain protein Brc1. Using defined mutants in genes encoding the core Smc5/6 complex subunits, we show that the Nse3 double-stranded DNA binding activity and the arginine fingers of the two Smc5/6 ATPase binding sites are critical for chromatin association. Interestingly, disrupting the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding activity at the hinge region does not prevent chromatin association but leads to elevated levels of gross chromosomal rearrangements during replication restart. This is consistent with a downstream function for ssDNA binding in regulating homologous recombination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SMC proteins</kwd><kwd>single-molecule microscopy</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110047/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carr</surname><given-names>Antony M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P018955/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliver</surname><given-names>Antony W</given-names></name><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Johanne M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vivo single-molecule imaging demonstrates that Smc5/6 chromatin association depends on ATP hydrolysis and dsDNA binding, requires Nse6 and is modulated by Brc1 after DNA damage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) complexes – cohesin, condensin, and Smc5/6 – are critical for the correct organisation of chromosome architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>). Whereas the functions of cohesin and condensin are increasingly well understood, the exact function of Smc5/6 complex remains relatively ambiguous. Smc5/6 is conserved across all eukaryotes and is best known for its role in the cellular response to DNA damage by ensuring the fidelity of homologous recombination repair (HRR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murray and Carr, 2008</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragón, 2018</xref>). Smc5/6 has been reported to promote replication fork stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Irmisch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ampatzidou et al., 2006</xref>) and facilitate DNA replication through natural pausing sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Menolfi et al., 2015</xref>). Biochemically, the complex can regulate pro-recombinogenic helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xue et al., 2014</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonner et al., 2016</xref>). It has also been proposed to monitor DNA topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeppsson et al., 2014</xref>) and recently been shown to restrict viral transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niu et al., 2017</xref>). Hypomorphic mutants show significant defects in sister-chromatid HRR, display replication fork instability, are sensitive to a wide range of genotoxins, and accumulate unresolved recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Irmisch et al., 2009</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Piccoli et al., 2006</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bermúdez-López et al., 2010</xref>). Intriguingly, complete inactivation of the Smc5/6 complex in a variety of organisms leads to cell death, and this essential nature suggests that it possesses additional functions beyond HR (homologous recombination) as deletions of core HR factors are viable.</p><p>Like all SMC complexes, the core of Smc5/6 is composed of two folded proteins, Smc5 and Smc6, which form a heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each subunit comprises a long coiled-coil arm with a hinge region at one end and a globular ATPase head at the other end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>). All three SMC heterodimers interact at the hinge and ATP binding/hydrolysis occurs in two pockets formed between the heads of the two subunits. For all SMC complexes, ATP turnover is essential for cell viability and has been proposed to bring about conformational changes in the arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirano and Hirano, 2006</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diebold-Durand et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muir et al., 2020</xref>). The ATPase activity is also key to the interaction of SMC’s with DNA: cohesin’s ATPase is required for both loading and dissociation from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elbatsh et al., 2016</xref>), whilst condensin is dependent on its ATPase activity for translocating along DNA and forming loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Terakawa et al., 2017</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elbatsh et al., 2019</xref>).

Disruption of these regions by mutation results in sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. The Smc5/6 ATPase heads are bridged by a sub-complex of three <underline>n</underline>on-<underline>S</underline>MC <underline>e</underline>lements (Nse), Nse4 (kleisin), and two kleisin-interacting tandem winged-helix element (KITE) proteins, Nse1 and Nse3. Nse1 has a RING finger and, in association with Nse3, has been shown to have ubiquitin ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doyle et al., 2010</xref>). The winged-helix domain of Nse3 possesses double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding activity, which is essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zabrady et al., 2016</xref>). The dsDNA binding has been predicted to provide the basis for initial chromatin association and loading of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zabrady et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the Nse1/3/4 subcomplex, Nse2, a SUMO ligase, is associated with the Smc5 coiled-coil arm. DNA association of the Smc5/6 complex is required to activate the Nse2 SUMO ligase, which SUMOylates a range of targets within and outside of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Varejão et al., 2018</xref>). Two further proteins, Nse5 and Nse6, also associate with the Smc5/6 complex in yeasts (both <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>). However, unlike the other Nse proteins, Nse5 and Nse6 have not been identified as part of a Smc5/6 holo-complex in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pebernard et al., 2006</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin loading of the structurally related cohesin complex requires accessory proteins, the cohesin-loader complex Scc2–Scc4 (<italic>sp</italic>Mis4–Ssl3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ocampo-Hafalla and Uhlmann, 2011</xref>). A loading complex for Smc5/6 has not yet been defined, but recent work in fission yeast has shown that its recruitment to sites of replication fork collapse occurs via a multi-BRCT domain protein, Brc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oravcová et al., 2018</xref>). Brc1 binds to γ-H2A and interacts with the Nse5–Nse6 subcomplex (which associates with Smc5/6 but is not part of the core complex), providing a potential mechanism by which Smc5/6 is recruited and loaded. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the N-terminal four BRCT domains of the Brc1 homologue, Rtt107, have also been shown to bind Nse6 amongst a number of other proteins in the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wan et al., 2019</xref>). In human cells, recruitment of Smc5/6 to inter-strand cross-links was shown to depend on interactions between SLF1 – another multi-BRCT domain protein – and SLF2 – a distant homologue of Nse6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Räschle et al., 2015</xref>). These observations suggest that recruitment of Smc5/6 through Nse6 and a BRCT-domain mediator protein has been conserved through evolution.</p><p>Understanding how Smc5/6 is recruited to, and associates with, the chromatin is an important step in defining how it regulates recombination processes and other potential DNA transactions. To date, the study of Smc5/6 chromatin association has been mostly limited to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based methodologies. Recent studies have shown single-particle tracking (SPT) microscopy can provide robust measurements of chromatin interacting proteins in vivo and offer complementary data to genome-wide approaches.</p><p>Here, we perform SPT using photoactivated localisation microscopy (PALM) in live fission yeast cells to monitor chromatin association of Smc5/6. Using a range of <italic>smc</italic> and <italic>nse</italic> mutants, we investigated the role of its ATPase activity, DNA interaction sites, and protein binding partners in promoting chromatin association. This highlighted that ATPase activity and dsDNA binding are both crucial for chromatin association. In contrast, interaction with ssDNA at the hinge is not required for stable chromatin loading, but we show that it is important to prevent gross chromosomal rearrangements at collapsed replication forks. We also establish that the Nse5–Nse6 sub-complex is required for almost all chromatin association, whereas Brc1 is required for only a proportion of the association. These data define the Brc1–Nse6-dependent sub-pathway of chromatin interaction and identify parallel Nse6-dependent but Brc1-independent sub-pathway(s).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Smc5/6 is chromatin associated in unchallenged cells</title><p>To monitor Smc5/6 chromatin association in living yeast cells we used photoactivated localisation microscopy combined with SPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manley et al., 2008</xref>). We created a fission yeast strain that endogenously expressed the kleisin subunit Nse4 fused to the photoconvertible fluorophore mEos3 and verified this allele had no measurable impact on cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We imaged photoconverted subsets of Nse4–mEos3 in live yeast cells at high temporal resolution (20 ms exposure) and created trajectories by localising and tracking individual fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nse4–mEos3 localisations and trajectories showed nuclear confinement consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pebernard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the chromatin association of Smc5/6 from our data, we used the recently described ‘Spot-On’ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>) (see Materials and methods). Spot-On implements a bias-aware kinetic modelling framework and robustly extracts diffusion constants and sub-populations from histograms of the molecular displacements that make up each trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We tracked Nse4–mEos3 in asynchronous live cells and created displacement histograms over four time intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The profiles show a clear peak of short displacements (&lt;100 nm) indicative of a chromatin-bound fraction of Nse4–mEos3 in unchallenged cells. Spot-On kinetic modelling revealed a fraction bound of about 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The displacement distributions were best described with a three-state fit which, in addition to bound and freely diffusing species, included an intermediate slow-diffusing population. This may describe transient interactions with chromatin or anomalous diffusion as a result of a crowded molecular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woringer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, Materials and methods).

This suggests that Smc5/6 can still associate with chromatin in the absence of Nse6, albeit at a severely reduced level.

We tagged both Nse5 and Nse6 with mEos3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and compared their behaviour to Nse4. In contrast to Nse2 and Smc6, which show similar chromatin association to Nse4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), both Nse5 and Nse6 displayed a broader range of displacements and were subsequently less chromatin associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>).

However, the complex is essential in yeast, which suggests that it possesses additional functions beyond HR as deletions of core HR factors are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragón, 2018</xref>). The recruitment of Smc5/6 to DNA and ATP binding/hydrolysis at both the ATP sites are thought to be essential for each of its cellular roles. Understanding the molecular details of how Smc5/6 associates with DNA and/or chromatin is therefore an important step in elucidating how Smc5/6 regulates recombination and other potential DNA transactions. Here, we have established SPT as a method to probe Smc5/6 dynamics in live cells, and coupled with yeast genetics and structural studies, we uncover the key requirements for its association with chromatin.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Smc5/6 complex features required for stable chromatin association</title><p>The Smc5/6 complex contains two separate ATP binding and hydrolysis sites. Both are formed when the Smc5 and Smc6 head domains interact. In common with all SMC complexes, the ATP binding pockets have an arginine finger, which is proposed to regulate DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. We show that mutating either of the Smc5 or Smc6 arginine fingers resulted in an increase in sensitivity to DNA damage and replication stress. This correlated with decreases in the fraction of bound Smc5/6 detected in SPT experiments. Interestingly, Smc5 and Smc6 arginine fingers were not equivalent as we uncovered an underlying asymmetry in the requirement of the two ATP binding sites for stable chromatin association. This asymmetry is in line with observations made for cohesin and condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elbatsh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hassler et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>One of the original <italic>smc6</italic> mutants, <italic>smc6-74</italic> (A151T), maps to the residue adjacent to the arginine residue in the arginine finger domain, suggesting it is compromised in ATP hydrolysis. Using a structural model based on the <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> SMC head domain, we engineered a series of structurally informed mutations designed to compromise the arginine finger to various degrees. This allowed us to dial in sensitivity to DNA damaging agents that robustly correlated with a reduced ability of Smc5/6 to associate with chromatin. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that ATPase activity stimulated by DNA binding is pre-requisite for Smc5/6 complex DNA/chromatin association and function.</p><p>Recent structural and biophysical data for the ssDNA-binding activity of the Smc5/6 hinge domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alt et al., 2017</xref>) and the dsDNA-binding Nse1/3/4 module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zabrady et al., 2016</xref>) allowed an investigation of the role for each of these two functions in promoting Smc5/6 chromatin association. The introduction of defined mutations into fission yeast demonstrated that dsDNA binding by Nse3 is required for DNA/chromatin association of the Smc5/6 complex, whereas the ability to bind ssDNA at the hinge is dispensable. Since ssDNA-binding mutants are sensitive to a range of genotoxic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alt et al., 2017</xref>), we therefore predicted that ssDNA binding most likely plays a role in downstream processes once the complex has initially bound to dsDNA/chromatin. This would be an analogous situation to cohesin, whereby after initial DNA binding to dsDNA, capture of a second DNA moiety is only achievable for ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>). This prediction is supported by results from our site-specific replication stall experiments, which indicate that increased levels of ectopic recombination occur in Smc5/6 mutants that lack the ability to interact with ssDNA correctly. This is much higher than in mutants that fail to stimulate ATPase activity and do not correctly associate with chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interacting factors influencing Smc5/6 chromatin association</title><p>Both Brc1 and Nse6 have been implicated in recruiting Smc5/6 to regions of γ-H2A at stalled/collapsed replication forks in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oravcová et al., 2018</xref>). We demonstrate here that deletion of either one of these factors reduces the in vivo levels of chromatin-associated Smc5/6, in both unchallenged cells and cells after exposure to MMS. Interestingly, deletion of <italic>brc1</italic> or preventing histone H2A phosphorylation did not generate as severe a defect in chromatin association as deletion of <italic>nse6</italic>. This is in agreement with recent ChIP experiments performed at discreet genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oravcová et al., 2018</xref>) and demonstrates that there is at least one alternative Brc1-independent pathway for recruitment of Smc5/6 to chromatin.</p><p>To explain the data, we consider two possible modes of chromatin association: directed and non-directed association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Directed association occurs when the complex is recruited to discrete genomic loci via interaction between the Nse5/6 subcomplex and chromatin-associated factors. This occurs via Brc1 at sites of γ-H2A, but alternative Nse5/6-interacting partners may exist to bring the complex to specific DNA structures, including stalled replication forks, HR intermediates, and double-strand breaks.</p><p>Association with the chromatin may also occur in a non-directed manner via Smc5/6’s intrinsic ability to associate with DNA through the dsDNA binding site of Nse3. In this scenario, Smc5/6 initially binds DNA structures directly via Nse3 and the Nse5/Nse6 subcomplex acts transiently to stabilise this interaction. This would help explain some important observations. Firstly, while Smc5, Smc6, and Nse1-4 are all essential proteins, fission yeast cells can survive without Nse5/Nse6. In the absence of Nse5/Nse6, the complex still possesses dsDNA binding activity, but the association with the chromatin is unstable. Secondly, deletion of <italic>nse6</italic> is synthetically lethal with the hypomorphic dsDNA binding mutant <italic>nse3-R254E</italic>, suggesting the dsDNA binding activity is sufficient to retain viability in the absence of exogenous DNA damage or replicative stress. If Nse5/6 is required to stabilise DNA/chromatin association after an initial recruitment by dsDNA binding, it would explain both the essential nature of the dsDNA binding activity of Nse3 and the observations that dsDNA binding site is tightly linked to chromatin association.</p><p>These two modes are not mutually exclusive, and, in both cases, the Nse5/6 heterodimer may be acting transiently to regulate structural configurations of the complex that promote stable association with the chromatin (‘loading’), much like the model for Mis4-Ssl3 being the loader for cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ocampo-Hafalla and Uhlmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furuya et al., 1998</xref>). Our SPT experiments show that Nse5 and Nse6 are more mobile than components of the core Smc5/6 complex suggesting alternative kinetics. This would be analogous to the cohesin-loader Scc2, which displays different dynamics to the cohesin complex and ‘hops’ between chromatin-bound cohesin molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rhodes et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, two recent studies have demonstrated that Nse5/6 negatively regulates the ATPase activity of Smc5/6 in vitro, and binding to the core complex causes conformational alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hallett, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Steigenberger et al., 2021</xref>). Taken together with our observations that DNA-stimulated ATPase activity is required for stable loading to the chromatin, this provides an Nse5/6-dependent mechanism by which ATPase activity is repressed until a DNA substrate is encountered. We predict that once Nse5/6 inhibition of Smc5/6 ATPase is relieved, it is then released from the core complex.</p><p>In summary, by conducting a detailed characterisation of Smc5/6 chromatin association in live cells, we demonstrate that SPT is a powerful approach for studying this enigmatic complex. This methodology, when coupled with structure-led mutational analysis and yeast genetics, has provided new insights into Smc5/6 behaviour as well as clarifying previous observations from past genetic and molecular genetic experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Methylmethane sulfonate</td><td valign="top">Sigma–Aldrich</td><td valign="top">129925–25G</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Hydroxyurea</td><td valign="top">Sigma–Aldrich</td><td valign="top">H8627-100G</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">5-Fluoroorotic acid</td><td valign="top">Formedium</td><td valign="top">5FOA10</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Agarose, Type I-A, low EEO</td><td valign="top">Sigma–Aldrich</td><td valign="top">A0169-25G</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Circular coverslips: #1.5H, ∅25 mm</td><td valign="top">Thorlabs</td><td valign="top">CG15XH</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">UV-Ozone cleaning system</td><td valign="top">Novascan</td><td valign="top">PSD-UV</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">GDSC SMLM</td><td valign="top">Fiji plugin update site</td><td valign="top">GDSC SMLM2</td><td valign="top">Underlying source-code is freely avaliable at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/aherbert/gdsc-smlm">https://github.com/aherbert/gdsc-smlm</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Prism 9</td><td valign="top">Graphpad software</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>S. pombe</italic> strain construction</title><p><italic>S. pombe</italic> strains were constructed using Cre-lox-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watson et al., 2008</xref>).

study the dynamics of these complexes in live fission yeast cells at single molecule resolution by single-particle tracking photo-activated localization microscopy (sptPALM). Specific point mutations affecting the dsDNA binding, ssDNA binding or ATPase activity of the SMC5/6 complex or the interacting factors Brc1 and Nse6 were analyzed by sptPALM and genetic assays to measure DNA damage survival, mutation rates, and genomic rearrangements at stalled replication forks. The authors propose a model of two modes of chromatin association of the Smc5/6 complex by direct binding to dsDNA and indirect recruitment through Brc1 bound to γ H2A.

Specifically, the authors find that Brc1 and Nse6 both promote chromatin loading of Smc5/6 but with brc1∆ having a less dramatic defect than nse6∆. The role of Brc1 is consistent with a recent report by (Oravcova et al., 2019). Consistent with Brc1 being recruited to chromatin by binding γ-H2A (Williams et al., 2010), brc1∆ and hta-SA mutants exhibit comparable defects in chromatin association of Smc5/6. Next, the authors show that mutation of each of the two ATP binding sites cause DNA damage sensitivity and defective chromatin association. Importantly, the authors find that dsDNA but not ssDNA binding is required for loading Smc5/6 on chromatin but not for prevention of gross chromosomal rearrangements.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and the data of high quality, but it does not advance the field much in terms of our understanding of the role of Smc5/6 in DNA repair. Moreover, the sptPALM method is not compared sufficiently with existing methods (ChIP and cytological analysis of foci), which appear to have a better dynamic range that sptPALM, to allow readers to choose between these methods for their experiments. Moreover, there are a number of technical issues that need clarification and resolution.</p><p>The key points to be addressed in case the authors elect to re-submit the manuscript:</p><p>1. This manuscript represents the first time sptPAML is used to derive the dynamic behavior of the Smc5/6 complex in live cells. There are a number of technical concerns that should be addressed.</p><p>• Lines 119/120: The authors state that DNA-bound proteins have constrained diffusion, which is clearly correct. The question is whether all constrained diffusion is caused by DNA binding, or whether binding to other stationary nuclear structures, such as the nuclear pore complex, or confinement in phase-separated compartments, could also lead to constraints?</p><p>• Line 162 ff: The authors document significant differences between cohesin and Smc5/6 mobility and mention ChIP experiments that suggest co-localization. This discrepancy should be examined and discussed more than is done on lines 374/5?</p><p>• What does it mean to be 50% chromatin bound be the sptPALM method? Does FRAP (or chromatin/soluble fractionation) also show a similar immobile fraction?</p><p>• The higher displacement value observed for Nse6-mEos3 compared with Nse4 could be due to the tag differentially affecting different subunits, particularly given that Figure S1 showed that cells containing Nse6-mEos3, but not Nse4-mEos3, are sensitive to MMS.</p><p>• Could the different displacement values of Nse4-mEos3 between brc1∆ vs nse6∆ cells be due to the mutant cells accumulating at different cell cycle phases given the slow growth of the mutants?</p><p>• Could the different mutants tested affect Nse4-mEos3 protein levels thus may affect data?</p><p>• Could the nse3-R254E or hinge mutants tested affect the Smc5/6 complex stability, thus affecting the signals?</p><p>• Figure 1B, the result raised the question whether the Rad21-mEos3 expression level is greatly reduced compared to the endogenous Rad21. Does mEos3 fusion affect the protein levels of the examined Smc5/6 subunits? Clarification of protein levels of the fusion proteins is important for this work, as the sptPAML data can be affected by protein levels.</p><p>• Figure 1C, it is unclear how cells in mitosis vs. interphase were assigned. Also, what are criteria for determining nucleus vs cytoplasm in these images?</p><p>• Judging from Figure 2C and S1B, Nse4 and Rad21 appear to be present mostly in large bright clusters, though significant amounts of weaker signals are also visible, particularly for Nse4. This could suggest that two populations of proteins (within and outside the clusters) exist. Do data in Figure 2A and B represent only the signals within the cluster or exhibiting weaker signals, or both (averaged).</p><p>2. What is the functional significance of the observed asymmetry in use of the two ATP binding sites? Moreover, the conclusion that &quot;DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by the two binding pockets is not equivalent&quot; could be strengthened by a direct assessment of the ATPase activity of the Smc5 (smc5-R77A) or Smc6 (smc6-R150A).</p><p>3. Why does suppression of gross chromosomal rearrangements require ssDNA binding but apparently not chromatin binding? The authors propose a model for HRR by Smc5/6 where dsDNA binding happens first and independent of DNA damage and ssDNA binding happens during DNA repair. It would strengthen the impact of the manuscript to test this model. For example: can DNA damage sensitivity and the chromatin association defect of dsDNA binding nse3-R254E mutant be rescue by fusion of Nse4 or Nse6 to Brc1? What distinguishes resistance to replication stress and suppression of gross chromosomal rearrangements?</p><p>Additional points for the authors to consider:</p><p>4. Figure 3 C, D: The results beg the question of the phenotype of the brc1 nse6 double mutant. This could be very informative to start addressing the models developed in the discussion.</p><p>5. Figure 3E: The treatment with MMS is rather long (5 hours). How was this time chosen? Likely DNA lesions would have been processed and perhaps even repaired and some cells dead at 5 hours. I therefore suggest to do a time course for Smc5/6 chromatin association. The kinetics of chromatin association might simply be different in the brc1∆ and nse6∆ mutants.</p><p>6. Figure 3F: The model in A predicts epistasis between the brc1 and the γ H2AX mutants, which should be tested here or has this been tested before?</p><p>7. Figure 5, the Alt 2017 paper suggests that while smc5-R609, 615E abolishes ssDNA binding, smc5-Y612G or smc6-x, and to a large extent Smc6-F528A, exhibit close to wild-type level of ssDNA binding. Here, these mutants showed similar Nse4 sptPALM behavior. Thus, these observations would argue that features other than ssDNA binding affect Nse4-chromatin association.</p><p>8. Figure 6B: The fluctuation tests lack error bars. Since Figure S6 is labeled as a repeat of Figure 6B left, I assume these are single determinations. The data should be reported as mean of n=3. The rate difference between Figure 6B left and Figure S6 are unusually large for a rate determination, which is usually quite robust. All the more a reason to bolster these data with n=3.</p><p>Text changes or clarifications:</p><p>9.

In addition, Nse6 appears to be more dynamic than Nse2, Nse4, and Smc5 or 6. The authors further examined several mutants in this assay. They found several mutants show defects of Nse4 chromatin associated and these include: 1) brc1∆ (or H2A-SA) and nse6∆ with only nse6∆ exhibit a complete defect, regardless of MMS treatment. 2) Smc5 or 6 ATP hydrolysis mutants, with Smc6 mutant exhibiting stronger effects. 3) a Nse3 mutant reduce in vitro dsDNA binding, and 4) hinge mutant defective afffecting ssDNA binding exhibiting defect only after MMS treatmen. Lastly, the authors show that the smc6-x and -74 increased rates of DNA deletion due to fork stalling (HR based events). Overall, this is an interestingly work that for the first time uses sptPAML to derive the dynamic behavior the Smc5/6 complex in live cells and using this assay to assess how different mutants of the complex can influence such behavior. While several conclusions are expected from previous reports, a few potentially significant conclusions are drawn. The work could benefit from technique clarifications and adjustment in interpretations as detailed below.</p><p>Given data are mostly acquired using sptPALM, an expert of this technique and analyses (spot-on, model fitting, PDF graphs) should be asked to assess data quality and interpretations. For example, can displacement values be strictly interpreted as reflecting chromatin-bound protein fraction; could they reflect other aggregation behavior of the proteins, such as phase separation? In addition, this reviewer felt that the interpretation of sptPALM data can be somewhat biased and the authors should consider other possibilities. For example, whether the higher displacement value observed for Nse6-mEos3 compared with Nse4 could be due to the tag differentially affecting different subunit, particularly given that Figure S1 showed that cells containing Nse6-mEos3, but not Nse4-mEos3, are sensitive to MMS. Also, could different displacement values of Nse4-mEos3 between brc1∆ vs nse6∆ cells be due to mutant cells are accumulated at different cell cycle phases given the slow growth of the mutants. Could the different mutants tested affect Nse4-mEos3 protein levels thus may affect data? Could the nse3-R254E or hinge mutants tested affect the Smc5/6 complex stability, thus affecting the signals?</p><p>Figure 1B, the result raised the question whether the Rad21-mEos3 expression level is greatly reduced than the endogenous Rad21. Along the same line, does the mEos3 fusion affect the protein levels of the examined Smc5/6 subunits? Clarification of protein levels of the fusion proteins is important for this work, as sptPAML data can be affected by protein levels.</p><p>Figure 1C, it is unclear how cells in mitosis vs. interphase were assigned. Also, what are criteria for determining nucleus vs cytosplam in these images?</p><p>Judging from Figure 2C and S1B, Nse4 and Rad21 appear to be present mostly in large bright clusters, though significantly amounts of weaker signals are also visiable, particularly for Nse4. This could suggest that two populations of proteins (within and outside the clusters). Do data in Figure 2A and B represent only the signals within the cluster or exhibiting weaker signals, or both (averaged).</p><p>Figure 5, the Alt 2017 paper suggests that while smc5-R609, 615E abolishes ssDNA binding, smc5-Y612G or smc6-x, and to a large extent Smc6-F528A, exhibit close to wild-type level of ssDNA binding. Here these mutants showed similar Nse4 sptPALM behavior. Thus, these observations would argue that features other than ssDNA binding affect Nse4-chromatin association.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Live-cell single-molecule tracking highlights requirements for stable Smc5/6 chromatin association in vivo&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In its current form, the manuscript might be better suited for a more specialized methods paper, but the impact of the work could be significantly raised by addressing the points #1-3 discussed below. As the requested additions are too extensive for a revision, we would invite a new submission of a revised manuscript with substantial new experiments to address these points, if you elect this course of action. We would make every effort to have the same review team evaluate the new manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the previous manuscript focussed too much on ‘proving’ the application of the singe-molecule technique, which may not have been necessary as it is now becoming more of a standard technique. Whilst we have found that the demonstration of the single-molecule tracking approach using the SMC complex condensin is visually beneficial for conference talks, we recognised that it detracted the manuscript somewhat from its central focus, thus we have removed this data. We have re-written the text to briefly introduce the type of SPT analysis that we do in the first figure.</p><p>We believe that this study will be of interest to the wide readership of <italic>eLife</italic> as a significant number of single-molecule microscopy papers exploring a wide range of topics have recently been published in the journal.</p><p>Recently, the same kinetic modelling approach (‘Spot-On’ – also published in <italic>eLife</italic><sup>3</sup>) has been used to address H2A.Z eviction by RNA Pol II<sup>4</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The key points to be addressed in case the authors elect to re-submit the manuscript:</p><p>1. This manuscript represents the first time sptPAML is used to derive the dynamic behavior of the Smc5/6 complex in live cells. There are a number of technical concerns that should be addressed.</p><p>• Lines 119/120: The authors state that DNA-bound proteins have constrained diffusion, which is clearly correct. The question is whether all constrained diffusion is caused by DNA binding, or whether binding to other stationary nuclear structures, such as the nuclear pore complex, or confinement in phase-separated compartments, could also lead to constraints?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question and one which is rather general to this methodology. In our study we generated a hypomorphic mutation <italic>nse3R254E</italic> which has been shown in vitro to significantly reduce binding to double stranded DNA. In our SPT experiments this mutant displayed &gt;2fold reduction in the bound fraction to a value similar to the most severe ATPase mutant. Complete abrogation of dsDNA binding is lethal and thus SPT cannot be performed in such a mutant. In response to this question, we attempted to deplete the wild type copy of <italic>nse3</italic> whilst inducing expression of lethal <italic>nse3</italic> dsDNA binding mutant, however fusion of the auxin-inducible degron (AID) tag to Nse3 was itself lethal.</p><p>Whilst we believe that there could indeed be confinement in compartments of the nucleus, this attenuated diffusion would still be higher than the apparent diffusion coefficient of the ‘bound’ Nse4 fraction (<italic>D =</italic> 0.005m <sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> ). Indeed, this may explain the slow diffusing population that was extracted from Spot-On kinetic modelling and will be investigated in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• What does it mean to be 50% chromatin bound be the sptPALM method? Does FRAP (or chromatin/soluble fractionation) also show a similar immobile fraction?</p></disp-quote><p>The ‘fraction bound’ value refers to the fraction of molecules that were</p><p>DNA/chromatin bound at the time of the experiment. This value is extracted using the Spot-On software which fits a kinetic model to singlemolecule displacement distributions. From this distribution it extracts different mobility states characterized by a diffusion coefficient (Free/Bound) and a fraction of the total population residing in this state (See new Figure 1C).</p><p>DNA bound molecules will have significantly attenuated diffusion and thus present trajectories that are essentially stationary and comprised of displacements roughly equal to the localisation precision of the experiment. These can be seen as the peaks in the displacement distributions such as Figure 1D.</p><p>With respect to other approaches – firstly, we and others have found that biochemical analysis of Smc5/6 chromatin association using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) or fractionation have always been limiting due to poor enrichment of the complex. This approach hides the dynamics of a process as they usually require chemical fixation – this was the main reason for initiating this study.</p><p>Secondly, SPT and FRAP are complementary approaches that allow the study of the mobility of molecules. Whilst FRAP provides ensemble information of a population of molecules, SPT is capable of visualising the movement of individual fluorescently labelled molecules. Inevitably, FRAP is somewhat limited by ensemble averaging and cannot reliably describe complex diffusion scenarios, such as mixed populations, different modes of diffusion and molecules that show sub-diffusive behaviour. Thus, SPT is a favourable methodology. We would predict that FRAP would provide similar data for wild type cells and mutants that have significant chromatin association defects – but it may not be sensitive enough to detect smaller changes such as that detected in Figures 3 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The higher displacement value observed for Nse6-mEos3 compared with Nse4 could be due to the tag differentially affecting different subunits, particularly given that Figure S1 showed that cells containing Nse6-mEos3, but not Nse4-mEos3, are sensitive to MMS.</p></disp-quote><p>This is true, the Nse6-mEos3, although it shows wildtype growth in the absence of DNA damage, the strain is slightly sensitive to MMS at higher concentrations. Thus, to address this question we created Nse5-mEos3. This strain which demonstrates wild type levels of sensitivity at high MMS concentrations (Supplementary Figure 1B), and showed similar fraction bound values for the Nse6-mEos3 strain (Figure 6B). This confirms our observation that the Nse5/6 subcomplex behaves differently to the rest of the Smc5/6 complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Could the different displacement values of Nse4-mEos3 between brc1∆ vs nse6∆ cells be due to the mutant cells accumulating at different cell cycle phases given the slow growth of the mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>Flow cytometry analysis of the DNA content of wildtype, <italic>brc1</italic> and <italic>nse6</italic> cells pre- and post-treatment with MMS showed similar profiles suggesting that reduction in chromatin association was not due to different cell cycle kinetics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Could the different mutants tested affect Nse4-mEos3 protein levels thus may affect data?</p></disp-quote><p>We know from previous work that destabilising one Smc5/6 component causes concomitant loss of expression of other subunits<sup>5.</sup> The mutants used in this study have all previously been published and assessed for expression – Alt et al. 2017 in supplementary figure 3 and Zabrady et al. 2016 in supplementary figure 4<sup>6,7</sup>. In these studies, they found no evidence that the mutations lead to decreased protein expression level. Thus, we are confident that there is no effect on Nse4-mEos3 protein levels in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 1B, the result raised the question whether the Rad21-mEos3 expression level is greatly reduced compared to the endogenous Rad21. Does mEos3 fusion affect the protein levels of the examined Smc5/6 subunits? Clarification of protein levels of the fusion proteins is important for this work, as the sptPAML data can be affected by protein levels.</p></disp-quote><p>The protein expression level of the cohesin kleisin subunit has been predicted to be less than that of other SMC components by quantitative mass spectrometry in fission yeast (rad21 = 173 molecules/cell, Cnd2 = 3502 molecules/cell, Nse1 = 1900 molecules/cell, Smc5 = 2329 molecules/cell)<sup>8</sup>. This suggests that the expression of cohesin kleisin is 10-20-fold lower than other kleisins or SMC subunits, which would support our western blot data. Furthermore, we have performed SPT analysis on an alternative cohesin subunit (Smc1 – Supplementary figure 3) and found complementary results. Our interpretation of this data, that cohesin has higher levels of chromatin association than Smc5/6 in our samples is therefore supported by this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What is the functional significance of the observed asymmetry in use of the two ATP binding sites? Moreover, the conclusion that &quot;DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by the two binding pockets is not equivalent&quot; could be strengthened by a direct assessment of the ATPase activity of the Smc5 (smc5-R77A) or Smc6 (smc6-R150A).</p></disp-quote><p>It is currently unclear as to why there is an asymmetry in the use of the two ATP binding sites of Smc5 and Smc6. A mechanism for such asymmetry has been described for cohesin DNA release<sup>9</sup> and condensin kleisin restructuring<sup>10</sup>. However, these studies have relied heavily on structural and biochemical data which is currently outside of the scope of this study but will be the focus of future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Why does suppression of gross chromosomal rearrangements require ssDNA binding but apparently not chromatin binding?</p></disp-quote><p>Our site-specific fork restart experiments (Figure 4C) show increased gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCR) in the <italic>smc6-</italic>X hinge mutant but not ATPase/dsDNA binding mutants. Restart at the RTS1 barrier requires homologous recombination, thus our data suggests that ssDNA interactions at the hinge are required to regulate these HR events.</p><p>As the ATPase and dsDNA binding mutants are hypomorphic, we predict that chromatin association of Smc5/6 is still achievable in these mutants but is significantly less efficient. Thus, it may be the case that eventually the complex is able to load at the RTS1 barrier, and efficiently direct HR repair. This is consistent with the detection of a fraction of DNA bound complex detected in SPT experiment in these mutants. In the hinge mutant, initial recruitment is not compromised (as evidenced by SPT), but defective interaction with ssDNA at HR events causes increase in GCR. These data suggest in some cases it is worse to recruit a dysfunctional Smc5/6 compared to reducing its ability to associate with the DNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors propose a model for HRR by Smc5/6 where dsDNA binding happens first and independent of DNA damage and ssDNA binding happens during DNA repair. It would strengthen the impact of the manuscript to test this model. For example: can DNA damage sensitivity and the chromatin association defect of dsDNA binding nse3-R254E mutant be rescue by fusion of Nse4 or Nse6 to Brc1?</p></disp-quote><p>Our model predicts that initial dsDNA binding and ATPase activity is required for stable association with the chromatin prior to its downstream functions at DNA repair events. We do not predict that this occurs independently of DNA damage. The chromatin association we detect in unchallenged cells may well be due to endogenous damage/replication fork arrest. This would be consistent with the essential nature of Smc5/6 and the observation that a proportion of this association is to regions of</p><p>γ-H2A.</p><p>We do not believe that a fusion experiment such as the one suggested would be beneficial to test this model. Firstly, stable association of the complex would still require efficient DNA binding in order to stimulate ATPase activity, increasing local concentration would not promote this. In support of this hypothesis is the fact that overexpression of Brc1 partially rescues DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>smc6-74</italic> (ATPase) mutants but not <italic>smc6-X</italic> (hinge/ssDNA interaction)<sup>11</sup>. This has been shown genetically to require Rad18 which channels repair into the post-replication repair pathway rather than increasing Smc5/6 loading<sup>12</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What distinguishes resistance to replication stress and suppression of gross chromosomal rearrangements?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question and one that the field cannot fully answer yet. Our prediction is that this would depend on the type of blockage that a replication fork encounters. Restart of replication forks at the RTS1 barrier used in our <italic>RuraR</italic>system (Figure 4C) is entirely dependent on homologous recombination. HR is also required for replication at the rDNA repeats, a process which Smc5/6 has also been linked with regulating. In such cases, we predict Smc5/6 is required to suppress gross chromosomal rearrangements caused by non-allelic HR. In other instances of replication stress, such as UV/MMS lesions, a variety of structures not seen at RTS1 may be generated. Distinguishing the role of Smc5/6 at different DNA structures is the focus of current and future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional points for the authors to consider:</p><p>4. Figure 3 C, D: The results beg the question of the phenotype of the brc1 nse6 double mutant. This could be very informative to start addressing the models developed in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This epistasis was tested in Oravcova, et al.<sup>13.</sup> The authors found that the double <italic>brc1Δ nse6Δ</italic> mutant was more sensitive to genotoxic agents which suggests that each protein has independent functions. This is consistent with our model that places Nse5/6 as a regulator of stable chromatin association as well interacting with recruiting partners such as Brc1. In budding yeast, the Brc1 homologue Rtt107 has been shown to interact with a variety of factors other than Smc5/6, including Mms22 and Slx4, suggesting it too has independent functions<sup>14</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 3E: The treatment with MMS is rather long (5 hours). How was this time chosen? Likely DNA lesions would have been processed and perhaps even repaired and some cells dead at 5 hours. I therefore suggest to do a time course for Smc5/6 chromatin association. The kinetics of chromatin association might simply be different in the brc1∆ and nse6∆ mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>All previous work investigating the dynamics of Smc5/6 chromatin association has relied on chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) approaches. We wanted to make sure that our experiments using MMS treatment were comparable to previous studies. As we were investigating previous predictions from Oravcova, et al. 2019 we decided to use the concentration and timings from this study<sup>13</sup>. In response to the question, we performed SPT at hourly intervals in wild type cells and found that the fraction bound was highest at 4-5 hours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 3F: The model in A predicts epistasis between the brc1 and the γ H2AX mutants, which should be tested here or has this been tested before?</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>hta1-SA hta2-SA</italic> genotype (also known as “<italic>htaAQ</italic>”) has previously been shown to increase both CPT and MMS sensitivity in <italic>brc1</italic>Δ cells<sup>15</sup>. This is consistent with Brc1 having known γ-H2A independent interactions at stalled forks. Previous genetic analysis has shown that Brc1 can bind to post-replication repair factor Rad18, which itself is recruited to stalled replication forks via an interaction with RPA coated ssDNA<sup>16</sup>. It has been suggested that this may aid stabilisation of RPA on its ssDNA substrate to inhibit HR-mediated fork resolution.</p><p>It has been shown that Brc1 can be prevented from binding to γ-H2A by the point mutation <italic>brc1-T672A</italic> and that this mutation prevents the formation of Nse4-GFP foci in response to MMS<sup>13, 17</sup>. We have since introduced the <italic>brc1-T672A</italic> allele into our Nse4-mEos3 strain and show a similar reduction in Nse4-mEos3 bound fraction compared to both (Supplementary Figure 7) <italic>brc1</italic>Δ and <italic>hta1-SA hta2-SA</italic> cells. This further strengthens our model that Brc1-dependent recruitment of Smc5/6 is limited to regions of γ-H2A, but this is not the only role of Brc1 at stalled forks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 5, the Alt 2017 paper suggests that while smc5-R609, 615E abolishes ssDNA binding, smc5-Y612G or smc6-x, and to a large extent Smc6-F528A, exhibit close to wild-type level of ssDNA binding. Here, these mutants showed similar Nse4 sptPALM behavior. Thus, these observations would argue that features other than ssDNA binding affect Nse4-chromatin association.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer is correct when stating that Alt et al. (2017) show that <italic>smc5R609E R615E</italic> severely abrogates initial ssDNA binding in vitro. Whilst the hinge destabilisation (<italic>smc5-Y612G</italic>) and secondary ssDNA interaction (<italic>smc6-F528A</italic>) mutants have more mild effects on ssDNA binding, they affect the kinetics of association and dissociation with ssDNA.</p><p>Importantly, they are also display significant sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and replication stress. However, unlike the dsDNA binding and ATPase mutants our SPT analysis demonstrates that this does not alter the bound fraction of Smc5/6 in unchallenged cells. This is one of the central points of our manuscript.</p><p>We have taken steps to highlight the different in vitro binding characteristics of these mutants in the manuscript to make it clearer for the reader. Furthermore, we have performed SPT analysis on the <italic>smc5R609E R615E</italic> mutant in the presence of MMS (Supplementary Figure 5). Interestingly, we found that the modest increase in bound fraction seen in response to MMS in wild type cells is either reduced or prevented in these hinge mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 6B: The fluctuation tests lack error bars. Since Figure S6 is labeled as a repeat of Figure 6B left, I assume these are single determinations. The data should be reported as mean of n=3. The rate difference between Figure 6B left and Figure S6 are unusually large for a rate determination, which is usually quite robust. All the more a reason to bolster these data with n=3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated these experiments so that there are now three repeats for each strain. We have also performed this analysis on a further mutant (<italic>nse3-R254E</italic>) to strengthen our observation that mutants that are defective in chromatin association produce distinct outcomes at HR-dependent processes than ssDNA interaction mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Text changes or clarifications:</p><p>9. Column graphs should be converted to scatter &quot;superplots&quot; as recently proposed (Lord et al., 2020) to show individual cell data and variability between experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we performed 3 technical repeats (fields of view of the same sample) for each biological repeat. In each technical repeat the single particle trajectories recorded are pooled together to populate the Spot-On displacement histograms. It is a standard process in the field to combine trajectories from individual nuclei from smaller eukaryotic cells as it would not possible to perform “superplots” of each nucleus as there would not be enough data to create a histogram and robustly perform the kinetic modelling. This exact approach has been recently applied to transcription factors in budding yeast cells and published in <italic>eLife</italic><sup>4</sup>. However, we agree that it is important to highlight the variability between technical repeats and have thus altered our column graphs to display the fraction bound value extracted from each.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.
