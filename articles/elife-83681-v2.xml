surface protein PfRH5. PfRH5 is a leading blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate and a target of growth-inhibitory antibodies. Here, we show that erythrocyte basigin is exclusively found in one of two macromolecular complexes, bound either to plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 1/4 (PMCA1/4) or to monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1). PfRH5 binds to each of these complexes with a higher affinity than to isolated basigin ectodomain, making it likely that these are the physiological targets of PfRH5. PMCA-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> export is not affected by PfRH5, making it unlikely that this is the mechanism underlying changes in calcium flux at the interface between an erythrocyte and the invading parasite. However, our studies rationalise the function of the most effective growth-inhibitory antibodies targeting PfRH5. While these antibodies do not reduce the binding of PfRH5 to monomeric basigin, they do reduce its binding to basigin-PMCA and basigin-MCT complexes. This indicates that the most effective PfRH5-targeting antibodies inhibit growth by sterically blocking the essential interaction of PfRH5 with basigin in its physiological context.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PfRH5</kwd><kwd>basigin</kwd><kwd>monoclonal antibody</kwd><kwd>PMCA</kwd><kwd>MCT1</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20797/Z/20/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jamwal</surname><given-names>Abhishek</given-names></name><name><surname>Higgins</surname><given-names>Matthew K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hirschi</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 746</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fakler</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TP 20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fakler</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The clinical symptoms of malaria occur as the merozoite developmental form of the parasite invades and replicates within human red blood cells (RBCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Venugopal et al., 2020</xref>). Vaccines or therapeutics which block erythrocyte invasion therefore have the potential to contribute to reduction and elimination of malaria.</p><p>Erythrocyte invasion is driven by a series of molecular interactions between merozoite ligands and their receptors on erythrocyte surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cowman et al., 2017</xref>). While many of these interactions are redundant, the binding of merozoite <italic>P. falciparum</italic> reticulocyte homologue 5 (PfRH5) to erythrocyte basigin is essential for invasion by all tested <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crosnier et al., 2011</xref>), making PfRH5 one of the most promising blood-stage malaria vaccine candidates. PfRH5 is part of the five-component PfPCRCR complex, containing PfRH5, PfCyRPA, PfRIPR, PfPTRAMP, and PfCSS, and each component is essential for invasion and is a target of growth-inhibitory antibodies or nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farrell et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reddy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Scally et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wong et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Vaccination of human volunteers with PfRH5 elicits strain-transcending anti-malarial antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Payne et al., 2017</xref>) and, in a human challenge model, reduces the rate of parasite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Minassian et al., 2021</xref>). Structural studies of PfRH5 have revealed that basigin binds towards one of the tips of the ‘kite-like’ structure of PfRH5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). Structures of PfRH5 in complex with Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies have identified a number of important epitopes across PfRH5, including those for human and mouse growth-inhibitory antibodies (R5.004, R5.016, 9AD4, and QA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alanine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wright et al., 2014</xref>), as well as the epitope for an antibody which potentiates the effects of growth-inhibitory antibodies (R5.011) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alanine et al., 2019</xref>). This insight has guided development of improved PfRH5-containing vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campeotto et al., 2017</xref>). However, mysteries remain, with the most effective growth-inhibitory antibodies, 9AD4 and R5.016 not able to block basigin binding. How do they prevent invasion?</p><p>Basigin is a type I transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, with the most common isoform presenting an ectodomain consisting of two highly glycosylated extracellular Ig domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Muramatsu, 2016</xref>), both of which contact PfRH5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, the transmembrane segment of basigin has been shown to mediate formation of heteromeric complexes which contain basigin and either monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) or plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Muramatsu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Supper et al., 2016</xref>). MCTs are involved in proton-coupled exchange of lactate or pyruvate across plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Felmlee et al., 2020</xref>). Both MCT1 and MCT4 interact with basigin in multiple eukaryotic cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kirk et al., 2000</xref>), affecting their function and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kirk et al., 2000</xref>) and MCT1 is the primary subtype in human erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Juel et al., 2003</xref>). PMCAs also play a role in membrane transport, with four subtypes of PMCA removing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cell cytosol to maintain intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and modulate cell signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stafford et al., 2017</xref>). Either basigin, or its close paralog neuroplastin, are essential subunits of PMCA, influencing expression and function of PMCAs in rodent neurons, with human erythrocyte PMCAs complexed with basigin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>). Both basigin-MCT1 and neuroplastin-PMCA1 complexes have been structurally characterised, revealing interactions mediated by transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), with the PfRH5 binding site on the basigin ectodomain remaining accessible.</p><p>Proteomics studies have confirmed that PMCA1, PMCA4, and MCT1 are all expressed on human RBC plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>) and, intriguingly, the actions of both MCTs and PMCAs have been linked to severe malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bedu-Addo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mariga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Timmann et al., 2012</xref>). In the case of MCT1, cerebral malaria is associated with increased lactate concentrations, which may damage the blood-brain barrier. However, it is hard to envisage a mechanism by which modulation of MCT1 function by PfRH5 during the rapid process of erythrocyte invasion could contribute to the symptoms of malaria. In contrast, PMCA polymorphisms have been linked to the development of severe malaria in a genome-wide association study, suggesting that calcium homeostasis across the erythrocyte membrane may affect the outcomes of malaria. Spikes of increased intra-erythrocytic calcium have been observed during the parasite invasion process and these are dependent on the interaction between PfRH5 and basigin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Volz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>), raising the question of whether localised blockage of PMCA-mediated calcium efflux may cause these calcium spikes. In this study, we therefore asked whether PfRH5 can interact with basigin which is complexed with MCT1 and PMCAs, whether this modulates PMCA function and whether this explains the function of growth-inhibitory antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Basigin in human erythrocyte is primarily found in complex with PMCAs and MCTs</title><p>We first aimed to determine whether basigin is mostly free when extracted from human erythrocyte membranes or is predominantly in complex with PMCAs or MCTs. We solubilised human erythrocyte ghosts using a mild detergent mixture of <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-β-D-maltose and cholesterol hemisuccinate (DDM:CHS), fractionated this extract by size exclusion chromatography and used western blotting to assess where basigin, PMCAs, and MCT1 elute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Probing individual fractions with a basigin-binding antibody revealed a broad band indicating the presence of heterogeneously glycosylated basigin. Fractions rich in basigin also showed strong signals for both PMCAs and MCT1, indicating that the majority of basigin co-migrates with PMCAs and MCT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The three components predominantly eluted in a region of the migration profile between standards of mass 157 kDa and 200 kDa, compatible with the mass of detergent-solubilised basigin-MCT1 and basigin-PMCA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). No basigin was found in later fractions in the region of the profile which would correspond to the mass of a single basigin in a detergent micelle.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Basigin from human erythrocytes is found in complex with plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) or monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The upper panel shows the trace from size exclusion chromatography of <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-β-D-maltose and cholesterol hemisuccinate (DDM/CHS)-solubilised ghost membrane proteins fractionated on a Superdex 200 increase 10/300 column (blue) and for full-length basigin purified from insect cells in CHAPS and exchanged into DDM:CHS (green).

Markers of apparent complex size indicate the positions of known mitochondrial respiratory chain (super)complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schägger and Pfeiffer, 2000</xref>) run in a separate gel lane. Binding of the antibody led to a full size-shift of both PMCA1/4-basigin and MCT1-basigin complexes, whereas no signal of free basigin could be observed in the low molecular weight range, even after overexposure of the blot. Data shown are representative from n=2 biological replicates. (<bold>c</bold>) The left-hand panel shows representative western blot images depicting sequential depletion of PMCA (upper panel) and MCT1 (upper-middle panel). Depletion of both transporters leads to reduced basigin levels, while levels of glycophorin C are unaffected in each fraction, again confirming that basigin is in complex with PMCA or MCT1.

This was extracted and purified using either CHAPS or DDM:CHS. The DDM:CHS-extracted protein purified with other protein components, migrated as a broad peak on a size exclusion column and showed complex binding kinetics for PfRH5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>). In contrast, protein extracted with CHAPS appeared pure on a gel, showed an elution profile indicating it to be monodispersed on a size exclusion column and bound to PfRH5, as determined by surface plasmon resonance, with binding kinetics which matched those of basigin ectodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>). We therefore concluded that insect cell expressed full-length basigin also associates with binding partners in Sf9 cells which co-purify in DDM:CHS but are removed using the harsher detergent CHAPS. To generate a sample suitable to calibrate our size exclusion experiment, we therefore purified full-length basigin after solubilisation with CHAPS and then detergent exchanged this sample into DDM:CHS, producing monomeric full-length basigin in a detergent micelle which matched that of our basigin-containing complexes purified from erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>). This full-length basigin eluted at ~11.2 ml from a size exclusion column, later than the basigin-containing complexes extracted from erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). These data suggest that erythrocyte basigin is predominantly found in complexes which co-elute with MCT1 and PMCA.</p><p>To more closely investigate the association of basigin with PMCAs and MCT1, we performed antibody shift assays in two different settings. First, we used size exclusion chromatography to assess whether antibodies alter the mobility of basigin-MCT1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A basigin-rich solubilised ghost extract was applied to a size exclusion column either in the presence or absence of an MCT1-targeting monoclonal antibody and the resultant fractions were probed on western blots for MCT1, basigin, or a glycophorin C control. While there was no shift of glycophorin C, the addition of the MCT1-specific antibody caused a shift in elution profile of the majority of the MCT1 and ~53% of basigin, suggesting them to be in complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, ~47% of the basigin did not shift. This identifies pools of basigin which are found in complex with and without MCT1. Next, we performed antibody shift experiments on detergent-solubilised human erythrocyte membrane extracts resolved by 2D blue native PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Western blotting these 2D gels and staining with basigin, PMCA, and MCT1 antibodies indicated two separate populations of basigin-containing complexes, one of which co-migrated with PMCA and one of which co-migrated with MCT1. Inclusion of an antibody which quantitatively binds to basigin shifted both populations to higher molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Signals at the appropriate molecular weight for free basigin were not observed in either the presence or absence of the basigin-binding antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>), even upon prolonged exposure of the blots.</p><p>In parallel, we conducted a depletion experiment. PMCAs and MCT1 were sequentially depleted from solubilised ghosts. PMCAs were first depleted by affinity capture on a calmodulin (CaM) resin, which binds to a regulatory site on the cytoplasmic tails of PMCAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stafford et al., 2017</xref>), while a monoclonal antibody was used to subsequently immunodeplete MCT1. Western blotting was used to assess the fraction of PMCA, MCT1, and basigin depleted at each stage and these were quantified by densitometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Sequential depletions of both PMCA and MCT1 resulted in almost complete elimination of basigin from the solubilised ghost membrane proteome, confirming that nearly all basigin is complexed with one of these transporters. Densitometric measurements also showed greater reduction in basigin levels upon MCT1 depletion, with ~72% of basigin complexed with MCT1 and ~28% of basigin complexed with PMCA. No basigin was depleted using beads alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>).</p><p>As there are multiple PMCA subtypes in human cells, we next used mass spectrometry analysis to identify which subtypes co-purify with basigin from human erythrocytes. This revealed PMCA4 to be the major partner of basigin in human erythrocytes, while also identifying PMCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Also identified were MCTs, with MCT1 as the primary subtype and MCT2 and -4 also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these data show that native basigin in human erythrocytes is found only in heteromeric complexes, either with PMCA (predominantly PMCA4) or MCT1. As the interaction between PfRH5 and basigin has been shown to be essential for erythrocyte invasion by <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, this raises the question of whether PfRH5 can bind to either the basigin-PMCA and/or basigin-MCT1 complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PfRH5 binds to the basigin-PMCA complex with greater affinity than to monomeric basigin</title><p>We next investigated the binding of PfRH5 to basigin-PMCA complexes. The structure of the neuroplastin-PMCA1 complex shows the neuroplastin ectodomain to be presented above the extracellular loops of PMCA, with the surface of neuroplastin equivalent to that used by basigin to bind to PfRH5 being exposed, making it likely that PfRH5 can bind to PMCA-bound basigin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong et al., 2018</xref>).

PfRH5 was chemically biotinylated on lysine residues and was immobilised on a streptavidin-coated chip and either 0.4 μM basigin-PMCA or 4 μM of basigin ectodomain were injected. Basigin ectodomain bound with similar kinetics to those previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crosnier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). Basigin-PMCA complexes bound PfRH5 with a sensogram profile indicating slower on- and off-rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). To confirm that these responses are specific, we pre-incubated surface-immobilised PfRH5 with monoclonal antibody R5.004, which occludes the basigin binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alanine et al., 2019</xref>). This blocked the binding of both basigin ectodomain and basigin-PMCA to PfRH5, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>).</p><p>To measure binding kinetics, we produced PfRH5 carrying an N-terminal biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) tag. This was captured at low density on a streptavidin-coated SPR chip and binding was studied by injecting twofold dilution series of either basigin ectodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>), full-length basigin (purified in CHAPS and exchanged into DDM:CHS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), or basigin-PMCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Kinetic binding data for full-length basigin could be fitted to a 1:1 binding model with an affinity of 0.56 µM (χ<sup>2</sup>=2.44), in good agreement with the affinity of ~1 µM measured for basigin ectodomain in previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crosnier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the kinetic data for the basigin-PMCA complexes did not fit well to a 1:1 binding model (χ<sup>2</sup>=7.71) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>), but the fit improved significantly (χ<sup>2</sup>=1.85) when using a two-state binding model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>). This model is consistent with an interaction which involves two separate, successive events, such as an initial lower affinity capture event, followed by a second binding event which increases the overall affinity, or a conformational change which follows an initial binding event. PfRH5 therefore bound to basigin-PMCA ~9-fold more tightly than to full-length basigin, primarily due to a lower dissociation rate constant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PfRH5 binding does not modulate calcium transport mediated by basigin-PMCA complexes</title><p>We next investigated whether PfRH5 binding can modulate the activity of PMCA, perhaps accounting for changes in calcium flux at the junction between the erythrocyte and invading merozoite. To test this, we used an established system in which current recordings from BK<sub>Ca</sub>-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels were used as a readout of apparent intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>). The expression of PMCA4b and basigin, together with BK<sub>Ca</sub>, in this system caused reduced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, as demonstrated by a right shift in the BK<sub>Ca</sub> activation curve. We confirmed that the PMCA4-basigin complex formed in these cells using 2D blue native PAGE western blot analysis of solubilised membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We next added PfRH5 at a concentration of 2 μM which caused no further change in the BK<sub>Ca</sub> activation curve, indicating that PfRH5 binding did not modulate PMCA-basigin function and did not change the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). As PfRH5 is normally part of the three-component PfRCR complex, we also added PfRCR at a concentration of 1 μM to the same system. Here too, we observed no effect on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b and c</xref>). Finally, we studied the effect of PfRH5 on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ATPase activity of purified basigin-PMCA by following inorganic phosphate release through a colorimetric assay. While the extracellular peptide inhibitor caloxin 1c2 inhibited calcium-dependent ATP hydrolysis at high micromolar concentrations, the addition of PfRH5 did not alter the ATPase activity of PMCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).

One of the predictions of a two-state binding model is that longer periods of incubation of PfRH5 with the basigin-MCT1 complex allow a larger fraction of interacting species to form stable complexes due to completion of the second binding event, and lead to slower off-rates. When we injected basigin-MCT1 over a chip decorated with biotinylated PfRH5, we indeed observed slower off-rates to be associated with longer incubation times, confirming a two-state interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). We also mixed basigin-MCT1 with PfRH5 for analysis by size exclusion chromatography, and again observed formation of a stable complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Therefore, PfRH5 binds to both basigin-PMCA and basigin-MCT1 with similar affinities, both more tightly than the interaction with the isolated basigin ectodomain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Two antibodies that bind to PMCAs and MCT1 do not inhibit parasite growth</title><p>We next assessed whether polyclonal antibodies that bind to PMCAs and MCT1 can prevent the growth of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in human blood culture.

The panel consisted of one growth-inhibitory antibody, R5.004, which prevents basigin binding, and two potent growth-inhibitory antibodies, R5.016 and 9AD4, which do not prevent basigin binding. Also tested were non-inhibitory antibodies, R5.011 and R5.015, which do not block basigin binding.</p><p>In accordance with previously published findings, only R5.004 prevented the binding of basigin ectodomain to PfRH5 immobilised on an SPR chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Indeed, these structural models are constructed using only the Fab fragments of the monoclonal antibodies and, in the presence of the antibody constant domains, even greater steric clash would be expected.

To date, no strain of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has been identified which can take a basigin-independent invasion route. Blocking this interaction also has proven therapeutic potential to prevent malaria, with antibodies against both PfRH5 and basigin identified which inhibit invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alanine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Douglas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wright et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zenonos et al., 2015</xref>), with vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>) or passive transfer of neutralising antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Douglas et al., 2019</xref>) leading to protection of Aotus monkeys from parasite challenge and with human vaccination slowing the onset of parasitaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Minassian et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, mysteries remain. First, the functional consequences of the PfRH5-basigin interaction are still unclear. What are the downstream outcomes of the interaction and why are they essential for invasion? Second, some of the most potent human and mouse PfRH5-targeting monoclonal antibodies which block parasite invasion do not directly block the PfRH5-basigin interaction. How do they function?</p><p>To answer these questions, we started by investigating the immediate molecular context of basigin in human erythrocytes. Various studies in different cell types have shown that basigin forms heteromeric complexes with either PMCAs or MCTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Muramatsu, 2016</xref>). We therefore used a combination of depletion, purification, 2D blue native PAGE, and mobility shift experiments to show that nearly all basigin in human erythrocyte membranes is found in complex with either PMCAs or MCTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While ~20% of basigin was not depleted with either PMCAs or MCT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), all basigin migrated at a high molecular weight on a size exclusion column and we did not observe free basigin in 2D blue native PAGE experiments. Indeed, techniques that more carefully preserve complex formation showed all basigin to be associated with PMCAs or MCTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The detection of free basigin in depletion experiments may then be due to disruption of protein complexes during depletion experiments, or due to basigin in complex with subtypes or splice isoforms of PMCA or other subtypes of MCTs that are not efficiently depleted. Therefore, nearly all basigin in human erythrocytes is found within larger protein complexes, with consequences for its recognition by PfRH5 and its role in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> invasion.</p><p>Intriguingly, both MCT1- and PMCA-bound basigin bind more tightly to PfRH5 than to isolated full-length basigin. Indeed, fitting of kinetic binding data from SPR showed that, while the binding of PfRH5 to basigin fits a simple 1:1 binding mode, its binding to basigin-PMCA and basigin-MCT1 shows biphasic kinetics, which fit most closely to a two-state binding model. This is further supported by data which shows that PfRH5 binds to basigin-MCT1 such that increasing association times correlate with decreasing dissociation rates, suggesting an initial lower affinity interaction, which ‘matures’ into a higher affinity interaction over time. While kinetic fitting data cannot be used to strictly derive a molecular mechanism, this is compatible with an initial lower affinity interaction between PfRH5 and basigin, followed by a subsequent interaction which stabilises the complex, possibly between PfRH5 and another part of the basigin-PMCA or basigin-MCT1 complexes.</p><p>Our demonstration that PfRH5 can bind to basigin-PMCA and basigin-MCT1 next led us to investigate whether PfRH5 binding can modulate the functions of these two transporters. MCT1 is a lactate transporter, and we were not able to envisage a mechanism by which altered lactate transport could play an essential role in the context of the ~20-s-long process of erythrocyte invasion. However, PfRH5 is known to be essential for a spike of increased calcium concentration at the merozoite-erythrocyte junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Volz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>) and the presence of basigin has been shown to alter PMCA function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>). Could modulation of basigin-PMCA function block calcium efflux and cause this spike during erythrocyte invasion? Our data do not support this hypothesis, with no change in basigin-PMCA function observed, either in the presence of PfRH5 or of the PfRCR complex. How PfRH5 modulates erythrocyte calcium levels to facilitate invasion is therefore still unclear. However, the demonstration that erythrocyte basigin is primarily found in large multimeric complexes will provide clues for future research to unveil this mechanism.</p><p>Finally, our results reveal the mechanisms by which the most potent PfRH5-targeting neutralising antibodies can block invasion. Immunity to blood-stage malaria is antibody-mediated and, while antibodies which target other aspects of the malaria life cycle use Fc-dependent mechanisms of immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kurtovic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Teo et al., 2016</xref>), those which prevent invasion appear to function directly by blocking essential interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alanine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Douglas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). As a result, the outcome of in vitro growth inhibition assays correlates well with protection due to PfRH5-targeting antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Douglas et al., 2019</xref>). It was therefore a mystery why the most effective PfRH5-targeting neutralising antibodies from both humans (R5.016) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alanine et al., 2019</xref>) and mice (9AD4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Douglas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wright et al., 2014</xref>) do not interfere with the PfRH5-basigin interaction. Studying basigin in the context of its membrane protein binding partners provides an answer, with both R5.016 and 9AD4 inhibiting the binding of PfRH5 to basigin-PMCA and basigin-MCT1 complexes. While this inhibition is strong in the context of a detergent micelle, we would expect it to be even stronger in the membrane context, with both R5.016 and 9AD4 modelled to angle directly towards the membrane plane. Our studies therefore highlight the importance of understanding the molecular context of basigin in understanding PfRH5 function and its inhibition, and open new directions to understand why the PfRH5-basigin interaction is so crucial for erythrocyte invasion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ghost preparation from human erythrocytes</title><p>400–450 ml of packed human RBCs were purchased from the NHS blood transfusion service after ethical consideration from the relevant University of Oxford ethics committee.

important insights into the interaction between an essential malaria parasite invasion ligand (and vaccine candidate) called PfRH5, and its erythrocyte surface integral membrane receptor basigin. The authors provide compelling evidence based on rigorous biochemical assays that erythrocyte basigin is predominantly expressed in a complex with one of two distinct erythrocyte membrane proteins called PMCA and MCT1 and that PfRH5 binds to these complexes better than to isolated basigin. Certain invasion-inhibitory antibodies, that do not prevent binding of PfRH5 to isolated basigin, do in contrast prevent binding to the basigin complexes, explaining the mode of action of these previously enigmatic antibodies and providing valuable data towards the improved design of vaccines based on PfRH5.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83681.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Silvie</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02en5vm52</institution-id><institution>Sorbonne Université, UPMC Univ Paris 06, INSERM, CNRS</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Blackman</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04tnbqb63</institution-id><institution>The Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.23.509221">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.23.509221v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael J Blackman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers appreciated that this is an important study that substantially advances our understanding of malaria parasite interactions with human erythrocytes during invasion. While they found the evidence compelling, they also identified two major weaknesses that should be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) The reviewers expressed some concerns about the calcium flux experiments. The data show that RH5 binding does not alter the calcium pump activity of PMCA in purified complexes or expressed in CHO cells. Unless they can provide experimental evidence that RH5-PMCA interaction has no effect on calcium flux in the context of erythrocyte invasion, they should tone down their claims and not rule out the role of PMCA inhibition during invasion. They should also confirm that recombinant PMCA4b and basigin interact and form the expected complex in their expression system, and consider performing a BKca activation dose-response experiment after the addition of Ca ionophore with and without a buffered low nanomolar [Ca].</p><p>(2) The reviewers were concerned that the SPR results may reflect the use of a full-length basigin versus just the ectodomain. This point needs to be addressed to more firmly establish that the association with other proteins is indeed critical for RH5 binding. Also, the reviewers raised some technical issues regarding the evidence for the absence of free monomeric basigin in the SEC and 2D blue native PAGE experiments.</p><p>The reviewers made some additional comments to improve the manuscript, as indicated in the individual reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) While the work is extremely well performed and provides compelling evidence that BSG is found in complexes with PMCA or MCT1 and that BSG-PMCA and BSG-MCT1 bind RH5 with higher affinity than isolated BSG, the story would be complete if the authors could include functional data on the role of PCMA and MCT1 during <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion. Have they tested the invasion-neutralising activity of specific antibodies and/or chemical inhibitors (such as caloxin 1c2)?</p><p>(2) The authors rule out the possibility that RH5 binding to BSG-PMCA may contribute to the calcium spike observed during erythrocyte invasion, based on the observation that RH5 does not alter the calcium pump activity of PMCA in purified complexes or expressed in CHO cells. However, formal demonstration would require evidence that RH5-PMCA interaction has no effect on calcium flux in the context of erythrocyte invasion. The authors may consider inhibiting PMCA and testing for calcium flux in invasion experiments. In the absence of such experimental data, they should tone down their claim.</p><p>(3) The antibody shift assay in figure 1 not only shows that basigin is essentially complexed with PMCA and MCT1, but also that all PMCA and all MCT1 are complexed with basigin (Figure 1b). This is quite surprising and should be discussed. Is it possibly due to partial solubilization by DDM/CHS? Along the same line, how do the authors explain that basigin, PMCA, and MCT1 are all found in the same fraction (7-9), although the expected size of each complex is different (BSG-MCT1 would rather be expected in fractions 11-12)? Have the authors tested other detergents and/or cross-linking to check that BSG is exclusively found in complexes with PMCA or MCT1? Another possible control is to test the effect of anti-MCT1 antibody on PMCA-BSG in mobility shift assays (supplementary Figure 1).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study and its conclusions are conceptually simple but rigorous and elegantly performed. The experimental approaches used are appropriate and the data are not over-interpreted. I have no major criticisms of the work. However, I have just a few comments regarding issues that might improve the manuscript.</p><p>1. Figure 1a and 1b: for the experiments using SEC or 2D blue native PAGE to analyse the form of basigin in erythrocyte ghost extracts, repeated reference is made to the predicted position of migration of monomeric free basigin. However, the authors do not calibrate their SEC or PAGE systems with this protein so this is a prediction only. I am aware that most of their work on recombinant basigin has used just the protein ectodomain, but do they also have access to recombinant full-length basigin (i.e. including its TMD) for this purpose?</p><p>2. The evidence presented that PfRH5 binds with higher affinity (slower off-rates, as well as apparently slower on-rates) to the native basigin-PMCA and basigin-MCT1 complexes than to recombinant basigin itself is convincing. However, this is discussed only briefly and the authors do not really attempt to provide a plausible explanation for this, since there is no structural evidence that RH5 makes molecular contacts with the basigin partner proteins. Is it conceivable that PfRH5 makes interactions with segments of PMCA or MCT1 (either protein components or post-translational modifications) that do not present electron density in the available crystal structures? I do feel that this point is worthy of a little more attention in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Figure 1 shows that most basigin on erythrocytes is associated with either MCT1 or PMCA4b. p. 4. The densitometry plot for basigin in Figure 1c does not appear to show a statistically significant reduction with PMCA depletion as the error bars are large relative to the decrease in mean band density. Would statistical analysis of these data clearly establish depletion of basigin with PMCA?</p><p>a. The GPC control in this depletion experiment is useful but does not control for nonspecific depletion of basigin on the resin, possibly due to its substantial glycosylation. It would be useful to include depletion of basigin on resin that captures irrelevant proteins (e.g. GPC and Band 3). This is especially important considering that the experiment aims to quantify basigin depletion on sequential resins, where nonspecific adsorption may be cumulative.</p><p>2) Figure 1b. p. 4. &quot;Signals at the appropriate molecular weight for free basigin were not observed in either the presence or absence of the basigin-binding antibody&quot; is not clearly supported by the data in Figure 1b because it is not clear that the first dimension (blue native PAGE) reveals proteins migrating at 40-65 kDa. The lowest MW marker, at 180 kDa, is close to the bottom of the 1st dimension migration. A molecular weight standard at or below this range is needed and should be indicated at the top left of the gel.</p><p>3) Figure 2e and Supp. Figure 2c. are important because they could reveal changes in erythrocyte Ca++ content resulting from RH5-basigin-PMCA interaction; a change in Ca++ content might reveal why RH5-basigin interaction is required for invasion. The co-expression of BKca, PMCA4b, and basigin in CHO cells is sophisticated and empowered to address this question. The right shift in BKca activation upon PMCA expression is consistent with functional PMCA Ca pumps that efflux Ca++, lowering intracellular Ca required for BKca activation. Controls are however needed to show that the expressed protein PMCA4b and basigin interact and form the expected complex in this system. A control to show that PfRH5 faithfully interacted with this complex upon its exogenous addition is also required to interpret an absence of change. A similar control is suggested for the PfRCR complex experiment (Supp. Figure 2c).</p><p>4) Figure 2e and Supp. Figure 2c. Another concern is whether the reduction in intracellular Ca++ with PMCA4b expression has maximally right-shifted the BKca activation curve. If it has done so, then changes in PMCA4b activity upon RH5 (or RCR) binding might not further shift the BKca activation curve in this system. The authors have properly used the Boltzmann equation to fit these curves in Figure 2f and Supp. Figure 2c (per the Methods section), but do not report V1/2 parameters. By eye, my estimate from the data is approximately 130 mV, which is only modestly to the left of the fully right-shifted value reported in PMID: 18955592 (183 mV). Because those workers used a different system, a control is needed here. A straightforward solution to this problem would be to perform a BKca activation dose-response experiment after the addition of Ca ionophore with and without a buffered low nanomolar [Ca] to show that further right shifts are detectable in the authors' hands.</p><p>5) Figure 2d, Supp. Figure 3b: &quot;This model is consisted with an interaction which involves two separate, successive events, such as an initial lower affinity capture event, followed by a second binding event which increases the overall affinity, or a conformational change which follows an initial binding event.&quot; – some caution is required here because there are other explanations. For example, it is possible that under the SPR conditions basigin-PMCA dissociates into individual subunits. Then, the complex kinetics could reflect the heterogeneous binding of isolated basigin vs intact complexes. Another possibility is the dose-dependent formation of basigin-PMCA aggregates, which would also complicate the observed kinetics. These caveats do not negate the observed tighter binding of basigin-PMCA than of ectodomain alone, but I recommend a more cautious presentation. Some of these caveats also apply to interpreting SPR kinetic data with basigin-MCT1.</p><p>6) More fundamentally, the SPR data compare full-length basigin complexed with PMCA or MCT1 to the basigin ectodomain alone and implicitly infer that the difference reflects the formation of a larger complex of basigin with another protein (PMCA or MCT1). Instead, the slow binding could reflect the use of a full-length basigin vs. just the ectodomain. As the RH5 binding sites are well above the membrane and distant from the partner proteins, this reviewer tends to favor better binding results from the use of a full-length basigin (in DDM-CHS, which may stabilize the protein) when compared to the soluble ectodomain fragment. The association with other proteins is compelling and interesting, but may not be critical for RH5 binding or inhibition by antibodies (Figure 4).</p><p>7) The docking experiments in Figure 4d and 4e do, however, suggest a contribution from the associated proteins. Antibody inhibition experiments using full-length basigin in DDM-CHS, such as those performed in Figure 4a-c, would be revealing and address this concern definitively, but I do not consider them essential for this publication. The authors may, however, want to present the interpretation of Figure 4a-c more cautiously with this in mind.</p><p>8) p. 5. The start of the 3rd paragraph is confusing. &quot;To measure binding kinetics, we produced PfRH5 carrying an N-terminal biotin acceptor peptide tag. This was captured at low density on a streptavidin-coated SPR chip&quot; is in a second paragraph after a paragraph describing SPR with streptavidin-coated chips. I assume the data in the preceding paragraph also used PfRH5 carrying an N-terminal biotin acceptor peptide tag. If correct, the confusion would be corrected by moving the biotin acceptor tag statement to the preceding paragraph and simply describing that dose-response experiments were used to measure binding kinetics in the second paragraph.</p><p>9) The Results section for Figure 2f – unclear what method is being used here as it is only described as &quot;colorimetry&quot; in Results and not explained in the figure legend. I believe this is the same ATPase assay as in Figure Suppl 2b, but this should be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83681.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers expressed some concerns about the calcium flux experiments.

We show, using the 2D gel system, that the PMCA4-basigin complex does form in the cellular system used for the electrophysiology assays and include the data in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2a. We also present data at different calcium concentrations which shows that we can observe right and left shifts in membrane potential and would therefore be able to show the effect of PfRH5 and/or PfRCR on PMCA4:basigin function, should this effect occur (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2b,c). With these controls included, we are confident in our data. Nevertheless, we have been very balanced in the language used in relation to this claim – for example ‘we therefore see no evidence that’ (line 214) and ‘our data do not support this hypothesis’ (line 341) – which we are confident is appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers were concerned that the SPR results may reflect the use of a full-length basigin versus just the ectodomain.

We present the binding to PfRH5 in Figure 2c, showing that full-length basigin has a very similar affinity and binding kinetics to basigin ectodomain. We have also repeated the antibody inhibition experiments using this full-length basigin and find very similar outcomes to when the same experiments were conducted using basigin ectodomain (Figure 4a). These experiments support our conclusion that differential binding and antibody inhibition are the result of the assembly of basigin into complexes with other membrane proteins in erythrocytes.</p><p>In addition, we have addressed technical concerns about the SEC and 2D gel experiments. In the case of the former, we have produced full-length basigin from insect cells, making sure that this experiment was well-conducted to ensure that the material is pure and is in the correct detergent micelle. This full-length basigin has a different mobility on a SEC column when compared with basigin extracted from erythrocytes (Figure 1a). In addition, we repeated the 2D gel analysis, to ensure that free basigin would be detected and we present this gel in supporting data (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1c). In both cases, the outcomes of these control experiment fully support our original conclusions and are presented in full.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers made some additional comments to improve the manuscript, as indicated in the individual reviews.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) While the work is extremely well performed and provides compelling evidence that BSG is found in complexes with PMCA or MCT1 and that BSG-PMCA and BSG-MCT1 bind RH5 with higher affinity than isolated BSG, the story would be complete if the authors could include functional data on the role of PCMA and MCT1 during <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion. Have they tested the invasion-neutralising activity of specific antibodies and/or chemical inhibitors (such as caloxin 1c2)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now conducted the experiment described here, in which we assessed the growth inhibitory activity of commercially available monoclonal antibodies targeting the extracellular domains of either MCT1 or PMCA. In each case, we were able to source a single antibody which binds to the extracellular region of the receptor and we show that neither of these antibodies inhibits the growth of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> in human blood culture. Without structural insight to show where on PMCAs or MCT1 these antibodies bind, it is hard to conclude why these antibodies are not inhibitory. This would require a major study in which we generate panels of antibodies and structurally characterise them as well as determining growth inhibitory activity. As MCT1 and PMCAs are unlikely to be therapeutic targets in malaria, it is not our view that this effort would be justified. For experiments related to PMCA inhibition, see below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors rule out the possibility that RH5 binding to BSG-PMCA may contribute to the calcium spike observed during erythrocyte invasion, based on the observation that RH5 does not alter the calcium pump activity of PMCA in purified complexes or expressed in CHO cells. However, formal demonstration would require evidence that RH5-PMCA interaction has no effect on calcium flux in the context of erythrocyte invasion. The authors may consider inhibiting PMCA and testing for calcium flux in invasion experiments. In the absence of such experimental data, they should tone down their claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Our view is that the experiment proposed here will be easy to do, but very difficult to interpret. The experiment proposes to inhibit PMCA using a chemical inhibitor, such as caloxin, and then assess the effect on invasion. As PMCA is a calcium extruder, its inhibition will lead to a global calcium increase in the RBC. This is not the same as the localised and transient inhibition of PMCA by PfRH5 just at the RBC-merozoite junction, which may lead to a transient flash of calcium. We have not been able to design an experiment in which we locally inhibit PMCA just at this junction. As the global modulation of PMCA before invasion, rather than transient modulation during invasion, will not test the same hypothesis, our view is that this experiment would be misleading, and we prefer not to conduct this study.</p><p>We have therefore made a few adjustments to the text, for example ‘making this unlikely as the mechanism’ in line 9 to tone down the claim. Elsewhere, the claim was already ‘toned down’ – for example ‘We therefore see no evidence’ in line 213-4 and ‘Our data do not support this hypothesis’ in line 341, which seem to us correct and balanced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The antibody shift assay in figure 1 not only shows that basigin is essentially complexed with PMCA and MCT1, but also that all PMCA and all MCT1 are complexed with basigin (Figure 1b). This is quite surprising and should be discussed. Is it possibly due to partial solubilization by DDM/CHS? Along the same line, how do the authors explain that basigin, PMCA, and MCT1 are all found in the same fraction (7-9), although the expected size of each complex is different (BSG-MCT1 would rather be expected in fractions 11-12)? Have the authors tested other detergents and/or cross-linking to check that BSG is exclusively found in complexes with PMCA or MCT1? Another possible control is to test the effect of anti-MCT1 antibody on PMCA-BSG in mobility shift assays (supplementary Figure 1).</p></disp-quote><p>The strength of our approach to study of the complexation of basigin with PMCAs and MCT1 comes from the use of multiple methods to ask the same question. We therefore include the size exclusion data which the reviewers highlight (Figure 1a), 2D gel analysis (Figure 1b), successive immuno-depletion studies (Figure 1c) and an antibody shift experiment (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2). These experiments use different approaches and protein solubilised with different detergents. In particular, the 2D gel study used a different solubilisation mixture to the others. While there are subtle differences between the outcomes of these assays, the overall picture is very similar. In some assays, all detectable basigin is bound to PMCA4 or MCT1 (ie Figure 1b) while in others (Figure 1c) we find that the majority is bound, perhaps with a small amount of unbound basigin due to the longer wash steps allowing time for dissociation or the different detergent used. By using four different methods to test the same hypothesis, we can be confident that our findings are rigorous and that basigin is found complexed with either PMCAs or MCT1.</p><p>To help us to understand the elution profile of the basigin:MCT1 and basigin:PMCA complexes in Figure 1, we can also compare with the elution profiles for purified basigin:PMCA (Figure 2b) and purified basigin:MCT1 (Figure 3d) on similar SEC columns. This comparison shows that each purified complex predominantly elutes between 10-11ml, which is where Western blotting shows each protein also elutes in Figure 1a. This analysis helps us to be confident that we are studying basigin:MCT1 and basigin:PMCA complexes in Figure 1a, despite the potential for purification to alter the micelle properties or lead to loss of associated lipids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The study and its conclusions are conceptually simple but rigorous and elegantly performed.

It was not straight-forward to obtain full-length basigin which was not bound to other membrane proteins, as purification in the mild detergent mixture, DDM:CHS also led to the co-purification of membrane protein complexes from the cells. In contrast, purification with the harsher detergent, CHAPS, disrupted these complexes, but CHAPS has a different micelle size to DDM:CHS, which would affect its mobility on SEC. To obtain the right calibration sample, we therefore purified full-length basigin from insect cells in CHAPS and then detergent exchanged into DDM:CHS, to generate a calibration sample in the same detergent as the erythrocyte purified protein complexes of interest. As we expected, this eluted later from a SEC column than the erythrocyte complexes of interest. This calibration has been added to Figure 1a and the data described here in relation to the purification of full-length basigin is in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1a,b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Is it conceivable that PfRH5 makes interactions with segments of PMCA or MCT1 (either protein components or post-translational modifications) that do not present electron density in the available crystal structures? I do feel that this point is worthy of a little more attention in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the biphasic kinetics which we observe are potentially interesting. Our finding that increased association times correlate with decreased dissociation rates is also supportive of a model in which there is an initial weaker interaction which ‘matures’ into a higher affinity interaction. However, SPR data alone is not sufficient to allow us to propose a molecular mechanism as there are multiple mechanisms which can lead to such a kinetic profile. While we are keen not to overinterpret this finding, we do, in lines 322-332 of the discussion, speculate that the observed binding kinetics might be the result of either a conformational change or a second component to the interaction, but we prefer not to comment more precisely on this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Figure 1 shows that most basigin on erythrocytes is associated with either MCT1 or PMCA4b. p. 4. The densitometry plot for basigin in Figure 1c does not appear to show a statistically significant reduction with PMCA depletion as the error bars are large relative to the decrease in mean band density. Would statistical analysis of these data clearly establish depletion of basigin with PMCA?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now repeated this analysis and show the new data in Figure 1a. The error bars are still quite high and a Mann-Whitney test gives p=0.100 for basigin in the starting material vs PMCA depletion. Together with equivalent outcomes from different assays (i.e. Figure 1 —figure supplement 2) we are confident about our overall conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. The GPC control in this depletion experiment is useful but does not control for nonspecific depletion of basigin on the resin, possibly due to its substantial glycosylation. It would be useful to include depletion of basigin on resin that captures irrelevant proteins (e.g. GPC and Band 3). This is especially important considering that the experiment aims to quantify basigin depletion on sequential resins, where nonspecific adsorption may be cumulative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted this experiment and it is now shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1e. Very little basigin binds to resin not coupled with antibody.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1b. p. 4. &quot;Signals at the appropriate molecular weight for free basigin were not observed in either the presence or absence of the basigin-binding antibody&quot; is not clearly supported by the data in Figure 1b because it is not clear that the first dimension (blue native PAGE) reveals proteins migrating at 40-65 kDa. The lowest MW marker, at 180 kDa, is close to the bottom of the 1st dimension migration. A molecular weight standard at or below this range is needed and should be indicated at the top left of the gel.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-run this experiment and show the resultant 2D gel in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1c, including the region of the denaturing gel in which free basigin would run. This confirms our conclusion that all basigin is found in either MCT1 or PMCA complexes in this assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2e and Supp. Figure 2c. are important because they could reveal changes in erythrocyte Ca++ content resulting from RH5-basigin-PMCA interaction; a change in Ca++ content might reveal why RH5-basigin interaction is required for invasion. The co-expression of BKca, PMCA4b, and basigin in CHO cells is sophisticated and empowered to address this question. The right shift in BKca activation upon PMCA expression is consistent with functional PMCA Ca pumps that efflux Ca++, lowering intracellular Ca required for BKca activation. Controls are however needed to show that the expressed protein PMCA4b and basigin interact and form the expected complex in this system. A control to show that PfRH5 faithfully interacted with this complex upon its exogenous addition is also required to interpret an absence of change. A similar control is suggested for the PfRCR complex experiment (Supp. Figure 2c).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now confirmed that PMCA4 and basigin express to form a complex in the CHO cell system, using the 2D gel approach. This data is presented in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2a.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2e and Supp. Figure 2c. Another concern is whether the reduction in intracellular Ca++ with PMCA4b expression has maximally right-shifted the BKca activation curve. If it has done so, then changes in PMCA4b activity upon RH5 (or RCR) binding might not further shift the BKca activation curve in this system. The authors have properly used the Boltzmann equation to fit these curves in Figure 2f and Supp. Figure 2c (per the Methods section), but do not report V1/2 parameters. By eye, my estimate from the data is approximately 130 mV, which is only modestly to the left of the fully right-shifted value reported in PMID: 18955592 (183 mV). Because those workers used a different system, a control is needed here. A straightforward solution to this problem would be to perform a BKca activation dose-response experiment after the addition of Ca ionophore with and without a buffered low nanomolar [Ca] to show that further right shifts are detectable in the authors' hands.</p></disp-quote><p>Our hypothesis is that addition of PfRH5 might lead to a left-shift, towards a lower membrane potential, rather than a right-shift. As PMCA is a calcium efflux pump, the hypothesis is that the calcium spike which occurs in the erythrocyte on invasion could result from an inhibition of PMCA, with an increase in intracellular calcium due to reduced efflux. In our electrophysiology experiment, the expression of PMCA-basigin has led to a right-shift in membrane potential in BK cells. Should PfRH5 or PfRCR inhibit basigin-PMCA, we would then expect a left-shift in membrane potential back towards the original BK cell line. This would be detected within the dynamic range of the experiment. A right shift would result instead from further activation of PMCA-basigin. To ensure that either shift could be detected within the set-up, we have measured membrane potential at different calcium concentrations (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2b,c) and we observe that 50µM calcium does shift the curve to the right of that observed with PfRH5, showing that, should this activated the PMCA-basigin, this would be detectable in our assay conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2d, Supp. Figure 3b: &quot;This model is consisted with an interaction which involves two separate, successive events, such as an initial lower affinity capture event, followed by a second binding event which increases the overall affinity, or a conformational change which follows an initial binding event.&quot; – some caution is required here because there are other explanations. For example, it is possible that under the SPR conditions basigin-PMCA dissociates into individual subunits. Then, the complex kinetics could reflect the heterogeneous binding of isolated basigin vs intact complexes. Another possibility is the dose-dependent formation of basigin-PMCA aggregates, which would also complicate the observed kinetics. These caveats do not negate the observed tighter binding of basigin-PMCA than of ectodomain alone, but I recommend a more cautious presentation. Some of these caveats also apply to interpreting SPR kinetic data with basigin-MCT1.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s caution in interpretation of SPR data and in ascribing different complex models and we share this approach. This is why, in the case of the basigin-MCT1 complex, we conducted the experiment in which we allowed binding to PfRH5 for different association times and showed that longer association times leads to shower dissociation rates (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1b). This behaviour is highly consistent with a two-step binding model as longer association times gives time for the second step to take place, leading to the stronger interaction and slower off-rate.</p><p>We find that both basigin-PMCA and basigin-MCT1 are stable in solution and we do not observe dissociation of the complexes or aggregation. This does not rule out the possibility that this happens in the SPR flow paths, but we see no reason to think that this is the case based on our experience of working with these proteins. In the experiment with different association rates, aggregation and/or dissociation would need to happen over a time scale of seconds to show the differences that we see. For these reasons we will stick with our current interpretation of this data, albeit describing it in what we are confident is appropriately cautious language (‘i.e. ‘this is compatible with’).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) More fundamentally, the SPR data compare full-length basigin complexed with PMCA or MCT1 to the basigin ectodomain alone and implicitly infer that the difference reflects the formation of a larger complex of basigin with another protein (PMCA or MCT1). Instead, the slow binding could reflect the use of a full-length basigin vs. just the ectodomain. As the RH5 binding sites are well above the membrane and distant from the partner proteins, this reviewer tends to favor better binding results from the use of a full-length basigin (in DDM-CHS, which may stabilize the protein) when compared to the soluble ectodomain fragment. The association with other proteins is compelling and interesting, but may not be critical for RH5 binding or inhibition by antibodies (Figure 4).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, that a better comparison for our basigin-containing membrane complexes is free full-length basigin, in detergent micelles of a matching composition. As explained in our response to reviewer 1, this was not straight-forward to obtain, as recombinant full-length basigin purified from insect cells in complex with binding partners. However, through use of a harsher detergent, followed by detergent exchange, we were able to obtain full-length basigin in DDM:CHS. We therefore measured the affinity of this material for immobilised PfRH5 and this showed a binding profile and affinity which closely match that of basigin ectodomain. This data is now shown in Figure 2c, replacing that for basigin ectodomain, as it is a better comparator for our basigin-containing membrane protein complexes. We find that the affinity and binding profile for full-length basigin and basigin ectodomain are extremely similar, supporting our original conclusion that differences in affinity and binding kinetics in the PMCA- and MCT1-bound complexes are the result of the presence of the binding partner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The docking experiments in Figure 4d and 4e do, however, suggest a contribution from the associated proteins. Antibody inhibition experiments using full-length basigin in DDM-CHS, such as those performed in Figure 4a-c, would be revealing and address this concern definitively, but I do not consider them essential for this publication. The authors may, however, want to present the interpretation of Figure 4a-c more cautiously with this in mind.</p></disp-quote><p>We also agree with the author that full-length basigin is the best comparator for this study and we have now included this data in Figure 4, with the basigin ectodomain data now moved into the supplement. In summary, the R5.016 monoclonal also showed no inhibition of binding of PfRH5 to full-length basigin, while 9AD4 showed a small amount of inhibition, most likely due to minor steric hinderance due to the detergent micelle. In neither case was inhibition observed at the same scale as for basigin-PMCA or basigin-MCT1 complexes, supporting our original conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) p. 5. The start of the 3rd paragraph is confusing. &quot;To measure binding kinetics, we produced PfRH5 carrying an N-terminal biotin acceptor peptide tag. This was captured at low density on a streptavidin-coated SPR chip&quot; is in a second paragraph after a paragraph describing SPR with streptavidin-coated chips. I assume the data in the preceding paragraph also used PfRH5 carrying an N-terminal biotin acceptor peptide tag. If correct, the confusion would be corrected by moving the biotin acceptor tag statement to the preceding paragraph and simply describing that dose-response experiments were used to measure binding kinetics in the second paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this was not clear. The experiment conducted in paragraph 2 used chemically biotinylated protein, which had been biotinylated on lysine residues. This was then immobilised onto the streptavidin-coated chip. We have clarified this in line 168. This is not the optimal way to conduct the experiment as RH5 molecules will be attached in different orientations to the chip surface. Therefore we added a BAP tag to the N-terminus of PfRH5, allowing specific biotinylation at the terminus. This protein was then used for subsequent experiments, ensuring homogeneous capture of PfRH5 on the surface.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The Results section for Figure 2f – unclear what method is being used here as it is only described as &quot;colorimetry&quot; in Results and not explained in the figure legend. I believe this is the same ATPase assay as in Figure Suppl 2b, but this should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a clause to lines 209-210 to link the experiment more clearly to the methods and show that we are studying inorganic phosphate release using a colorimetric assay.</p></body></sub-article></article>
