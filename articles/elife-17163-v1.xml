Here, we identify <italic>QIL1</italic> null alleles in two siblings displaying multiple clinical symptoms of early-onset fatal mitochondrial encephalopathy with liver disease, including defects in respiratory chain function in patient muscle. QIL1 absence in patients’ fibroblasts was associated with MICOS disassembly, abnormal cristae, mild cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase defect, and sensitivity to glucose withdrawal. QIL1 expression rescued cristae defects, and promoted re-accumulation of MICOS subunits to facilitate MICOS assembly. MICOS assembly and cristae morphology were not efficiently rescued by over-expression of other MICOS subunits in patient fibroblasts. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence of altered MICOS assembly linked with a human mitochondrial disease and confirm a central role for QIL1 in stable MICOS complex formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17163.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17163.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>QIL1</kwd><kwd>MICOS</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial disease</kwd><kwd>early-onset fatal mitochondrial encephalopathy</kwd><kwd>3-methylglutaconic aciduria</kwd><kwd>liver disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Maladies Rares</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jardel</surname><given-names>Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ouvrir les Yeux</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chrétien</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name><name><surname>Bénit</surname><given-names>Paule</given-names></name><name><surname>Rustin</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name><name><surname>Schiff</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>E-rare GENOMIT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chrétien</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name><name><surname>Bénit</surname><given-names>Paule</given-names></name><name><surname>Rustin</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name><name><surname>Schiff</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Association contre les Maladies Mitochondriales</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chrétien</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name><name><surname>Bénit</surname><given-names>Paule</given-names></name><name><surname>Rustin</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name><name><surname>Schiff</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM095567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>J Wade</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS083524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>J Wade</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Guarani et al., 2015), MICOS (mitochondrial contact site) assembly and cristae junction formation are shown to have a critical role in human health.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A diverse collection of mitochondrial diseases have been linked to mutations that affect either mitochondrial or nuclear genomes, and alter respiratory chain function, mitochondrial fission/fusion cycles, or mitochondrial quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vafai and Mootha, 2012</xref>). A central feature of mitochondrial disease is the pleotropic nature of phenotypes, with some diseases eliciting highly tissue-specific effects and others affecting multiple organ systems. The basis of this pleiotropy is poorly understood, but could reflect differences in mitochondrial structure and concomitant links with respiratory chain activity within individual tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vafai and Mootha, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Proper organization of the respiratory chain and other mitochondrial protein complexes within the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) relies on the formation of MIM invaginations referred to as cristae. These laminar structures with highly curved distal membrane arrangement are formed through the mitochondrial contact site (MICOS) complex, a cristae junction scaffold that is thought to both maintain close proximity of cristae membranes near the 'boundary' MIM as well as form connections between the cristae junction and the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pfanner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van der Laan et al., 2016</xref>). MICOS is composed of several subunits located on the MIM and mitochondrial intermembrane space, including MIC25, MIC60, MIC10, MIC26, MIC27, MIC19, and this core complex has been shown to interact with SAM50, MTX1, and MTX2 on the MOM, presumably helping to position cristae structures in proximity to the MOM. Our recent proteomic analysis of the MICOS complex identified a previously unstudied single-pass transmembrane protein – C19ORF70/QIL1 – as a component of MICOS localized in the MIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guarani et al., 2015</xref>). Depletion of QIL1 by RNAi in tissue culture cell lines resulted in: (1) loss of cristae junction structures accompanied by the formation of MIMs with characteristic 'swirl' structures, (2) MICOS complex disassembly, (3) loss of MIC10, MIC26 and MIC27 protein levels, (4) failure to assemble into a MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex, and (5) decreased mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guarani et al., 2015</xref>). RNAi of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> QIL1 ortholog in muscle and nervous tissue lead to a similar mitochondrial phenotype in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guarani et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, QIL1 is required for assembly and maintenance of the MICOS complex and mitochondrial architecture. This mechanism of MICOS assembly and the role of QIL1 have recently been verified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zerbes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anand et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Building upon our recent discovery and mechanistic analysis of QIL1, we now report recessive non-functional alleles of <italic>QIL1</italic> in two sibling patients with early onset fatal mitochondrial encephalopathy and recurrent liver disease. Molecular and cell biological studies revealed dramatic defects in mitochondrial organization in fibroblasts and muscle tissue derived from these patients that are associated with disassembly of the MICOS complex. MICOS assembly and mitochondrial architecture phenotypes in patient fibroblasts could be fully rescued by re-introduction of <italic>QIL1</italic>, but not other MICOS subunits, consistent with <italic>QIL1</italic> mutation underlying the phenotypes observed. These data reveal a critical role for the MICOS core complex in mitochondrial health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clinical presentation of patients deficient in QIL1</title><p>This study identified two patients from non-consanguineous parents with defects in the QIL1 gene. Both patients (patient 1, female and patient 2, male) were born after an uneventful pregnancy with normal birth parameters, although patient 1 had a smaller than the average head circumference (10th percentile). At 16 hr of life, patient 1 was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, displaying an array of abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), including hypothermia, lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and signs of liver failure. Plasma amino acids showed elevation of tyrosine and methionine concentration and urine organic acids revealed the presence of 3-methylglutaconic acid associated with lactic acid and Krebs cycle intermediates (malate and fumarate). After 48 hr of symptomatic treatment, including a protein and lipid-free infusion of glucose (13.5 g/kg/day) with electrolytes, the child fully recovered both clinically and biologically. During the next 6 months, neurodevelopment and growth were normal except for the incidence of acquired microcephaly from the age of 4 months (-2 SD at 4 months of age). At the age of 6 months, in the course of a benign febrile upper respiratory infection, she exhibited neurological deterioration with hypotonia, hyperlactacidemia with high lactate to pyruvate ratio, and evidence of mild liver disease without overt liver failure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Liver ultrasound disclosed hyperechogenicity of the liver with two hypoechogenic nodules in the VI and VII segments. Heart ultrasound disclosed mild hypertrophy with normal heart function and brain MRI showed cerebellar atrophy with optic atrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>) and a moderate lactate peak on brain MR spectroscopy (not shown). Plasma amino acids showed elevation of methionine consistent with liver disease and urine organic acids showed persistent urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). After three days of symptomatic treatment, there was a partial improvement of neurological functions, but persistence of poor eye contact and truncal hypotonia, disappearance of biological abnormalities except for mild hyperlactacidemia (2.5 to 3.5 mM). Bilateral and severe sensorineural deafness was confirmed by auditory evoked potentials. Severe bilateral neurovisual impairment was confirmed by evoked visual potentials, which showed barely detectable responses. Eye fundoscopy and elecroretinogram was normal. The child died before the age of 3 after slow progression of her neurological disease.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17163.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Clinical presentation of patients deficient in <italic>QIL1</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Brain MRI of patients 1 (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>, 2 years of age) and 2 (<bold>D</bold>–<bold>F</bold>, 1 year of age).

(<bold>G</bold>) Oxygen consumption by patients’ and control skin fibroblasts was measured as reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Khoury et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rustin et al., 1994</xref>). Cellular respiration was first measured using intact fibroblasts. It was essentially abolished upon addition of a limited amount of digitonin (Dig) which caused the leakage of endogenous respiratory substrates in the assay medium. Oxygen consumption resumed upon subsequent addition of 10 mM succinate (Succ) to the digitonin-permeabilized fibroblast. This oxidation decreased in the presence of oligomycin (oligo) (a mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor) while adding an uncoupling agent (<italic>m</italic>-ClCCP) allowed a maximal rate of oxidation and to calculate a respiratory chain control (RCR) value (rate in the presence of uncoupler <italic>versus</italic> rate in the presence of the ATPase inhibitor).

QIL1 deficiency was associated with transient neonatal deterioration with hypoglycemia, hyperlactacidemia and liver disease. In the first months of life, acute decompensations occurred with liver disease and hyperlactacidemia. This was associated with neurological disease, including developmental delay with cerebellar atrophy, eye disease with optic atrophy and sensorineural deafness. Liver disease also included liver nodules with high α-fetoprotein as observed in other mitochondrial disease such as <italic>TRMU</italic> gene mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gaignard et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Liver associated with central nervous system dysfunction is often involved in mitochondrial disease especially those involving defects of mitochondrial DNA maintenance caused by nuclear gene mutations <italic>i.e.</italic> mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (resulting from <italic>POLG, DGUOK</italic> or <italic>MPV17</italic> mutations for instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hussaini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Naviaux and Nguyen, 2004</xref>). QIL1 deficiency in patient fibroblasts did not affect mitochondrial DNA abundance, but resulted in severely disorganized mitochondrial cristae. In principle, the deletion of exon 2, which encoded the single-pass transmembrane domain apparently involved in QIL1 tethering to the MIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), would be expected to greatly reduce the efficiency of MICOS assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guarani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zerbes et al., 2016</xref>). Given the presence of a premature stop codon in the mRNA for the QIL1 mutant, it is likely that the mRNA is degraded through non-sense mediated decay. We also detected generalized mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies in skeletal muscle from patient 1 consistent with a reduced mitochondrial respiration previously reported upon QIL1 RNAi mediated knockdown in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guarani et al., 2015</xref>). However, we detected only a mild complex IV (cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase) deficiency in skin fibroblasts grown in culture. Interestingly, contrary to what was observed in RNAi-induced QIL1 depletion in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guarani et al., 2015</xref>), there was no effect of QIL1 deficiency on fibroblasts’ basal respiration in agreement with the limited defect affecting complex IV and the normal respiratory chain enzyme activities in these cells. Differences in mitochondrial activities observed between muscle biopsies and skin fibroblasts from patients are commonly observed in mitochondrial disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thorburn and Smeitink, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van den Heuvel et al., 2004</xref>). It has been reported that nearly 50% of the children with a respiratory chain defect in muscle display normal enzyme activities in cultured skin fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thorburn, 2000</xref>) and respiratory chain defects are often not expressed in fibroblasts even in some well-recognized oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robinson et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, patients’ fibroblasts exhibited high sensitivity to glucose deprivation, suggesting an inability to utilize the alternative mitochondrial energetic route to cope with glucose deprivation, in line with previous observations from other mitochondrial diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robinson et al., 1992</xref>). Interestingly, an increase in cristae density has been reported upon general nutrient or glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gomes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rossignol et al., 2004</xref>), indicating an important link between mitochondrial architecture and nutrient utilization. It has been proposed that mitochondrial cristae architecture may control nutrient utilization via different mechanisms, including electron transport chain function, nutrient import and access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stanley et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, differences between mitochondrial respiration defects observed in muscle and fibroblasts may not only reflect the pleiotropic nature of phenotypes of mitochondrial diseases, often eliciting highly tissue-specific effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vafai and Mootha, 2012</xref>), but also be related to cell-specific metabolic requirements and different mitochondrial pathways. Alternatively, skin fibroblasts may have possibly developed adaptive mechanisms over time to permit normal basal respiration under culture conditions.

A proposed model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, wherein loss of QIL1 leads to loss of cristae structure and reduced levels of MIC60, MIC19, MIC25, MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27, with MIC10, MIC26 and MIC27 being affected to the largest extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1N</xref>). Residual MIC60 and MIC19 could be found in an ~500 kDa complex in blue-native gels using quantitative proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,J</xref>), suggesting that this sub-complex of MICOS does not require QIL1 for assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guarani et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of MIC10 and MIC27 in QIL1-defective fibroblasts resulted in a fraction of mitochondria containing cristae like structures, with very low levels of MICOS complex assembly observed by blue-native gels. The ability of MIC10 and MIC27 overexpression to promote cristae formation with low efficiency may relate to the ability of MIC10 to form large oligomers and promote membrane curvature independently of other MICOS subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohnert et al., 2015</xref>) and MIC27 to bind cardiolipin which also promotes curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weber et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that MIC27 expression increased MIC10 levels, and it is possible that the ability of MIC27 to support complex formation with low efficiency may reflect stabilization of MIC10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1L,N</xref>). These findings are in line with previous observations by Koob et al who reported that MIC27 expression positively correlated with the levels of MIC10, and proposed that MIC26 and MIC27 modulate MIC10 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koob et al., 2015</xref>). Zerbes at al also reported that MIC27 promotes the stability of the MIC10 oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zerbes et al., 2016</xref>). Further studies are needed to address the underlying mechanism. Additionally, we note that fibroblasts from patients have highly enlarged mitochondrial structures, suggesting loss of appropriate mitochondrial fission-fusion cycles, and the absence of mitophagic destruction of damaged mitochondria. Similar defects in fusion-fission cycles and development of swollen mitochondria has been observed in cells lacking the MICOS subunit MIC60, suggesting that the observed phenotype is a general property of disruption of cristae structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>An additional interesting feature of both patients examined here is persistent urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid that might also be ascribed to mitochondrial cristae disassembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). 3-methylglutaconic aciduria is observed in other mitochondrial diseases, but most specifically in a new category of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial-related diseases, namely genetic defects of phospholipid biosynthesis, remodeling and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia-Cazorla et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu and Claypool, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mayr, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wortmann et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2015</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this report demonstrates that primary defects in mitochondrial inner membrane cristae architecture as observed with QIL1 deficiency causes severe mitochondrial disease in human clinically indistinguishable from primary oxidative phosphorylation respiratory chain disease. This is also the first report of early onset fatal mitochondrial encephalopathy in patients with mutations in a core MICOS complex subunit. CHCHD10 haploinsufficiency, found in a family with neurodegenerative disorders and mitochondrial respiratory chain defects also demonstrates impaired MICOS complex stability, cristae formation and mitochondrial genome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genin et al., 2015</xref>). Noticeably, alterations of different MICOS subunit protein levels and amino acid substitutions have been associated with several conditions, such as diabetic cardiomyopathy, neurodegeneration and cancer in cellular and animal model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zerbes et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that QIL1 and other MICOS subunits represent potential candidates for mutations in patients with unexplained early onset neurological deterioration with optic and cerebellar atrophy progressing over time combined with liver disease and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Brain MRI</title><p>Each subject underwent 1.5T brain MRI (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Randy Schekman as the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Toni Barrientos (Reviewer #1); Jared Rutter (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The conserved mitochondrial contact site and cristae junction (MICOS) complex functions as a primary determinant of mitochondrial inner membrane structure. Among the many components previously identified, the authors of this manuscript focus on QIL1, a relatively novel component, recently identified by the authors. The relevance of the present submission is that they have now found that null mutations in this gene, identified by exome sequencing, result in a recessive mitochondrial disorder in humans, involving early-onset fatal encephalomyopathy and liver disease. The analysis of patients' fibroblasts have allowed to confirm the central role on QIL1 in MICOS assembly and function.</p><p>The authors specifically show that the lack of QIL1 induces degradation of most remaining MICOS subunits, particularly MIC10 and MIC26, and induce the accumulation of a MICOS subcomplex containing MIC19 and MIC60. As expected, reintroducing wild-type QIL1 in patient's fibroblasts restores MICOS assembly and function.</p><p>The manuscript is technically and conceptually sound. The data and figures are excellent. The novelty lies on the identification of disease-associated mutations in QIL1 but not in the characterization of QIL1 function, since all details presented here in patient's fibroblasts were previously reported by the authors using QIL1 siRNA experiments.</p><p>Recommended revisions:</p><p>1) The authors could have tried to gain more mechanistic insight into how essential QIL1 is in MICOS formation by for example, attempt suppression of the deleterious phenotype in QIL1-deficient fibroblasts by overexpression of some of the other MICOS subunits. Or, does QIL1 overexpression induces any changes in MICOS formation? This would help understanding whether QIL1 has a regulatory role in MICOS formation.</p><p>2) The biochemical data presented are not terribly convincing in my view. Control values are presented as ranges with no standard deviation, and the single control they chose appears to be right very near the bottom of the control range (for fibroblasts). There may be a CIV defect in the patient fibroblasts, but it is awfully mild. No controls were analyzed for muscle and again only ranges are given.</p><p>3) I did not find the pictures of the patient cells growing in glucose vs. galactose particularly helpful. It doesn't look like the numbers are that different from control (ie the cells appear to have proliferated), and I guess they interpret the brightness as a stress response, which is not unreasonable, but I must say I find it a bit surprising based on the intact respiratory chain. Cell counts, some molecular markers would be useful. In my experience some cells with combined respiratory chain defects more severe than those reported here are able to grow on galactose, and such a comparison might provide some useful insight.</p><p>4) What is the relevance of the increased level of PCNA in the patient cells? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> does not have a C in the legend. (One can also see this in 4A).</p><p>5) I think that they should show the biochemical phenotype in the rescued patient cells in Figure 6. It is curious to me that they omitted that.</p><p>6) In the Abstract, the authors specifically point out a complex IV defect. It seems that these patients do not have a specific defect in complex IV but a more general defect in respiration.</p><p>7) Please comment on potential reasons why the respiratory phenotype varies between fibroblasts and muscle biopsy. Could this be related to specific biochemistry related to MICOS?</p><p>8) The pedigree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> does not use standard arrangement. Please revise.

Or, does QIL1 overexpression induces any changes in MICOS formation? This would help understanding whether QIL1 has a regulatory role in MICOS formation.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s that understanding QIL1 function is an important endeavor. One suggestion was to overexpress QIL1 and examine the effect on MICOS formation. In our previous paper in <italic>eLife</italic> identifying QIL1, we performed this experiment. Briefly, we found that in cells containing a lentiviral vector ectopically expressing QIL1-HA under CMV control, we were unable to “overexpress” the protein, and in the context of QIL1-HA expression, there was a commensurate reduction in the abundance of the endogenous protein, suggesting a homeostatic mechanism controlling total QIL1 abundance. In the present study, we observed a similar reduction of endogenous QIL1 levels upon expression of the C-terminally tagged version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5I</xref>). Of note, ectopic QIL1 expression did not seem to affect MICOS levels or assembly as evidenced by MIC10 immunoblotting of Blue-native gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) and SDS-PAGE analysis of MIC60 and MIC10 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5I</xref>).</p><p>In order to further address this question, we ectopically expressed MIC60, MIC19, MIC27, MIC10, and QIL1 in patient fibroblasts lacking QIL1 and examined the MICOS complex by blue-native gel using anti-MIC10 for detection, and cristae morphology by electron microscopy (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that neither MIC60 nor MIC19 rescued MICOS assembly by blue-native electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1L-N</xref>). In the case of MIC27 and MIC10 overexpression, we detected anti-MIC10 reactivity very weakly at ~700 kDa in the native gel analysis, but we also observed additional forms at ~800 kDa and at much lower mass (~100 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1L</xref>). Similarly, by EM, expression of MIC60 or MIC19 did not promote cristae structures. Interestingly, we found that a small fraction (~30%) of mitochondria in cells expressing MIC27 and MIC10 display some level of cristae structures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-K</xref>). This was a surprising result but was consistent with the detection of MIC10 positive structures by native PAGE in cells over-expressing MIC27 or MIC10. As noted in the previous version, loss of QIL1 leads to a virtually complete loss of MIC10 protein in mitochondrial extracts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1N</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of MIC27 led to the accumulation of endogenous MIC10 in QIL1 null cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1L-N</xref>). This suggests that MIC27 may stabilize endogenous MIC10, which may facilitate partial assembly of a MICOS-like complex capable of forming cristae-like structures by electron microscopy in the absence of QIL1. These findings are in line with previous observations by Koob et al. (Koob et al., 2015) who reported that MIC27 expression positively correlated with the levels of MIC10 and suggested that MIC26 and MIC27 modulate MIC10 levels. Zerbes at al. also reported that MIC27 promotes the stability of the MIC10 oligomers (Zerbes et al., 2016). Moreover, Barbot et al. and Bohnert et al. (Barbot et al., 2015; Bohnert et al., 2015) have shown that MIC10 forms large oligomers and induces membrane curvature independently of other MICOS subunits, which could contribute to the partial normalization of cristae structures observed in patients’ fibroblasts expressing ectopic MIC27 and MIC10. We now comment on this in the Discussion.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer suggesting this experiment.</p><p><italic>2) The biochemical data presented are not terribly convincing in my view. Control values are presented as ranges with no standard deviation, and the single control they chose appears to be right very near the bottom of the control range (for fibroblasts). There may be a CIV defect in the patient fibroblasts, but it is awfully mild. No controls were analyzed for muscle and again only ranges are given.</italic> </p><p>Our data showed that muscle biopsies obtained from one of the two QIL1-deficient patients displayed generalized reduction of mitochondrial respiratory chain activities, while only mild activity ratios defects (cytochrome c oxidase to citrate synthase ratio) and normal overall respiration were observed in cultured skin fibroblasts from both patients. This is however a feature commonly observed in mitochondrial disorders. Even though skin biopsies are more commonly performed than muscle biopsies due to the higher invasiveness associated with muscle biopsies, as much as 50% of the children with a respiratory chain defect in muscle display normal enzyme activities in cultured skin fibroblasts (Thorburn, 2000). High respiratory activities can be measured in fibroblasts even in cases of genetically proven mitochondrial diseases (Thorburn and Smeitink, 2001) and overall, enzyme defects observed in muscle are typically more pronounced than in fibroblasts (van den Heuvel et al., 2004). Indeed, respiratory chain defects are not expressed in fibroblasts even in some well-recognized oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies (Robinson et al., 1990). Thus, fibroblasts are considered less reliable than muscle biopsies for the diagnosis of respiratory chain diseases and an absence of defects in fibroblast biochemical analysis is not sufficient to exclude a disorder of mitochondrial metabolism (Haas et al., 2008). The partial defect noticed in these fibroblasts was the incentive to carry out the experiment in the presence or absence of glucose, as respiratory chain defective fibroblasts often rely on glucose-dependent activity to proliferate and survive (Robinson et al., 1992). Indeed, patients’ fibroblasts exhibited high sensitivity to glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), suggesting an inability to utilize the alternative mitochondrial energetic route to cope with glucose deprivation. We now comment on this in the Discussion.</p><p>Regarding the reviewer’s comment on why no controls were analyzed for muscle and ranges are given instead, this is due to previous observations that have shown that absolute values for activities of mitochondrial enzymes are extremely variable, particularly in skeletal muscle samples from hospitalized individuals (non-suspected of mitochondrial disease) (Rustin et al., 1991). The distribution of these values being in addition nonstandard (possibly distorted by the limited exercise done by part of the hospitalized patients), it would be rather unsafe to use standard deviations (Chretien et al., 1998). This is why in major mitochondrial diagnostic centers in France (where the two QIL1 defective patients reported herein were hospitalized) data are compared to ranges of control activities. Varying values for absolute activities are indeed observed in most if not all types of human tissues (liver, lymphocytes, including cultured skin fibroblasts). Indeed, we have previously reported that the scatter of control absolute respiratory activity values and their overlap with those of patients limits the diagnosis of respiratory chain deficiencies (Rustin et al., 1991). However, respiratory enzyme activities are maintained at a constant ratio in every tissue analyzed (Rustin et al., 1991), which may reflect the need for the maintenance of the appropriate stoichiometry between oxidative phosphorylation complexes for the optimum function of the electron transfer process. These observations prompted us to present enzyme activities as ratios rather than absolute values. Of note, obtaining control muscle tissues covering a given range of ages and appropriate healthy tissues is often a challenge (Thorburn and Smeitink, 2001). Thus, data presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1B and 1C</xref> are given either as ranges (for absolute enzyme activities) or as means +/- standard deviations (for ratios of enzyme activities).</p><p>A typing error in normal range of CIV has been corrected: 130-195 instead of 130-95. Ranges of respiratory chain activities were assessed in 89 control patients as described (Medja et al., 2009) and not 25 as erroneously written in the original version of paper. Additionally, typing errors in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref> activity ratios have also been corrected. We apologize.</p><p><italic>3) I did not find the pictures of the patient cells growing in glucose vs. galactose particularly helpful. It doesn't look like the numbers are that different from control (ie the cells appear to have proliferated), and I guess they interpret the brightness as a stress response, which is not unreasonable, but I must say I find it a bit surprising based on the intact respiratory chain. Cell counts, some molecular markers would be useful. In my experience some cells with combined respiratory chain defects more severe than those reported here are able to grow on galactose, and such a comparison might provide some useful insight.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer and therefore discarded the uninformative micrograph in order to present a quantification of cell density after culture for 4 or 7 days in the presence or absence of glucose (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The data indicated that patient fibroblasts are sensitive to glucose depletion, and that, even if partial, the unbalanced activity of enzymes evidenced in these fibroblasts is deleterious. Moreover, QIL1 deficiency and the resulting abnormal cristae architecture may contribute to the cells’ inability to grow without glucose in different ways. For example, an increase in cristae density has been reported upon general nutrient or glucose deprivation (Gomes et al., 2011; Rossignol et al., 2004) indicating an important link between mitochondrial architecture and nutrient utilization. It has been proposed that mitochondrial cristae architecture may control nutrient utilization via different mechanisms including electron transport chain function, but also nutrient import and access (Stanley et al., 2014). Thus, additional factors may contribute to the severity of the observed phenotype.</p><p><italic>4) What is the relevance of the increased level of PCNA in the patient cells? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> does not have a C in the legend. (One can also see this in 4A).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for noting the inconsistency between the legend and the figure. This has been repaired.</p><p>With respect to PCNA, we think that this might have biological significance. For this reason, PCNA may not be the best loading control to use. We have now re-probed the membranes (original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref> updated to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>) with a different control blot protein – α-tubulin antibody. The levels of α-tubulin were unchanged across all conditions. We have now replaced these panels with a different control blot protein – α-tubulin – which shows equal loading. We note that ATP5A used as a loading control for mitochondria was also equivalent across all the genotypes and ATP5A is used as a loading control throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) I think that they should show the biochemical phenotype in the rescued patient cells in Figure 6. It is curious to me that they omitted that.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. In the original Figure 6, we provided evidence that in patients’ fibroblasts, MICOS assembly is defective. Blue native electrophoresis analysis followed by immunoblotting with MIC60 and MIC10 antibodies and SILAC quantitative proteomics revealed the disassembly of the mature heterooligomeric MICOS complex at ~700 kDa with the accumulation of a smaller sub-complex at ~500 kDa containing MIC60 and MIC19, in line with our previous observations with RNAi-mediated QIL1 knockdown (Guarani et al., 2015). The reviewer suggested that we show the biochemical phenotype in the rescued patient cells in Figure 6, now updated to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We now demonstrate that QIL1 re-introduction rescues the biochemical phenotypes in multiple ways: 1) strong accumulation of MIC10 in a ~700 kDa MICOS complex by native gel analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1L</xref>), 2) strong recovery of MIC10 and MIC27 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1N</xref>), and partial recovery of MIC60 and MIC19 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1N</xref>). Thus, QIL1 re-introduction rescues the major biochemical phenotypes observed in patients lacking QIL1.</p><p><italic>6) In the Abstract, the authors specifically point out a complex IV defect. It seems that these patients do not have a specific defect in complex IV but a more general defect in respiration.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that in skeletal muscle there is a general defect in respiration. However, a mild CIV deficiency was observed in skin fibroblasts and mitochondrial respiration was unaffected. We discussed potential reasons for the differences in the degree of respiratory defects observed between fibroblasts and muscle biopsy under point 2 above. We have also modified the Abstract accordingly.</p><p><italic>7) Please comment on potential reasons why the respiratory phenotype varies between fibroblasts and muscle biopsy. Could this be related to specific biochemistry related to MICOS?</italic> </p><p>We have discussed potential reasons why the respiratory phenotype varies between fibroblasts and muscle biopsy under point 2 above. Additionally, the reviewer’s raises an interesting possibility that the variation observed between the respiratory phenotypes in fibroblasts and muscle may be due to tissue specific biochemistry related to MICOS. As far as mitochondrial architecture is concerned, QIL1 depletion had a similar impact in fibroblasts and muscle tissue as demonstrated in updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Due to unavailability of tissue samples, we are unable to address how MICOS subunits levels and assembly in patients’ skeletal muscle compare to skin fibroblasts.</p><p><italic>8) The pedigree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> does not use standard arrangement.

In order to address this question, we have:</p><p>1) redrawn <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> to make the comparisons clearer (and updated the legend accordingly),</p><p>2) rewritten the sentence in the Results section to make it clearer what the conclusion of the experiment is, and</p><p>3) improved the methods by adding more details.</p><p>The goal of the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> was to determine if cells lacking QIL1 expression were able to cope with the metabolic challenge of glucose deprivation, as this phenotype is often observed with cells harboring mitochondrial mutations (Robinson et al., 1992). To address this question, we cultured control and patient fibroblasts in the presence and absence of glucose and measured cell numbers at 4 and 7 days. On day zero when the experiment was initiated, cells were at 50% confluence. Importantly, the cells employed are primary fibroblasts and their proliferation rates are quite slow compared with other commonly used cell types. As can be seen in the presence of glucose in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, cells double in about 3 days, a feature that is important for interpreting the data but may not have been obvious in the revised version of the paper. The primary conclusion that we make is after 7 days in the absence of glucose, the control cells continue to proliferate while the patient cells do not. This demonstrates what we think is a dramatic sensitivity to the absence of glucose and think this conclusion is clear. We interpret the reviewer’s comments in part to be asking why there isn’t an effect already at day 4. We believe this reflects two major factors. First, the slow cell cycle rates for these cells coupled with the time required to move from cell cycle arrest through apoptosis likely affect the total number of cells remaining at this early time point, making it difficult to observe changes. Second, previous work using patient cells with mutations in mitochondrial systems vary in the point in time that they begin to be sensitive to glucose deprivation (Robinson et al., 1992). This likely reflects the severity of the phenotype as well as complex circuits and possibly reprogramming of metabolic pathways or utilization of alternative energy sources (Stanley et al., 2014), the elucidation of which we feel is beyond the scope of this work. We also note that because these experiments are using primary cells from individuals, there are sometimes differences in growth rates among the individual patients even in the presence of glucose. Overall, the slight variation in cell numbers between the different cell lines likely represents variation at the individual level.</p><p>We now state in the text: “Compared with control fibroblasts, patient fibroblasts displayed reduced cell number 7 days after glucose withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), a characteristic often observed in mitochondrial disease and indicative of a limited capacity for mitochondria to respond to the metabolic challenge resulting from glycolysis limitation (Lee et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 1992; van den Heuvel et al., 2004)”. We can explicitly point out the variation in onset to sensitivity if the editors feel it is necessary.</p></body></sub-article></article>
