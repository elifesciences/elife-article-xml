Here, we used the model organism <italic>C. elegans</italic> to investigate the impact of the IIS/FOXO pathway on age-related cognitive decline. The <italic>daf-2</italic> Insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutant exhibits a significant extension of learning and memory span with age compared to wild-type worms, an effect that is dependent on the DAF-16 transcription factor. To identify possible mechanisms by which aging <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants maintain learning and memory with age while wild-type worms lose neuronal function, we carried out neuron-specific transcriptomic analysis in aged animals. We observed downregulation of neuronal genes and upregulation of transcriptional regulation genes in aging wild-type neurons. By contrast, IIS/FOXO pathway mutants exhibit distinct neuronal transcriptomic alterations in response to cognitive aging, including upregulation of stress response genes and downregulation of specific insulin signaling genes. We tested the roles of significantly transcriptionally-changed genes in regulating cognitive functions, identifying novel regulators of learning and memory. In addition to other mechanistic insights, a comparison of the aged vs young <italic>daf-2</italic> neuronal transcriptome revealed that a new set of potentially neuroprotective genes is upregulated; instead of simply mimicking a young state, <italic>daf-2</italic> may enhance neuronal resilience to accumulation of harm and take a more active approach to combat aging. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for regulating cognitive function with age and offer insights into novel therapeutic targets for age-related cognitive decline.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>cognitive aging</kwd><kwd>neurons</kwd><kwd>Insulin/IGF-like signaling</kwd><kwd>FOXO</kwd><kwd>stress-resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Simons Collaboration on Plasticity and the Aging Brain</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Coleen T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gilliam Fellows Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morillo</surname><given-names>Katherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weng</surname><given-names>Yifei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Shiyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuron-specific sequencing of aged wild-type, <italic>daf-2</italic>, and <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> mutants revealed transcriptomic changes with age, and in longevity mutants, putative neuroprotective genes are upregulated, which are required for prolonged cognitive functions.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The loss of cognitive function is a rising problem in our aging society. A 2008 study estimated that at least 22.2% (about 5.4 million) of individuals over the age of 71 in the United States have at least mild cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Plassman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Langa and Levine, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gillis et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, global dementia cases are predicted to triple from an estimated 57.4 million cases in 2019–152.8 million cases in 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feigin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nichols and Vos, 2020</xref>). As most industrialized countries are experiencing a rapid increase in the proportion of the aged population, understanding and potentially preventing the underlying issues of neuronal structural and behavioral decline associated with aging is crucial for societal health.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is an excellent model system for studying neuronal aging, given its tractable genetics, short lifespan, and simple nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">White et al., 1986</xref>). Most importantly, <italic>C. elegans</italic> experiences rapid loss of learning and memory with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>): by Day 4 of adulthood, all long-term associative memory ability is lost, and by Day 8, <italic>C. elegans</italic> cannot carry out associative learning or short-term associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>) – despite the fact that these worms can still move and chemotaxis perfectly well. That is, with age worms first lose long-term memory ability (by Day 4), then short-term memory and learning ability (Day 6–8), then chemotaxis (Day 10–12), then motility (Day 16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hahm et al., 2015</xref>). Because learning and memory decline extremely early, we consider worms that are only a week old to already be ‘cognitively aged,’ despite the fact that they can chemotaxis and move well, and will continue to live for another one to two weeks. Therefore, we can examine neurons from these 7–8-day-old adults to explore the causes of these cognitive declines in animals that are otherwise quite healthy. Many human neuronal aging phenotypes and genes of interest for mammalian neuronal function are conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arey and Murphy, 2017</xref>), making discoveries in <italic>C. elegans</italic> possibly applicable to humans.</p><p>The Insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS)/FOXO pathway was first discovered to play a role in longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The lifespan of <italic>daf-2</italic>/Insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutants is twice that of wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>), and this lifespan extension requires the downstream Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>). DAF-16/FOXO controls the expression of many genes that contribute to longevity, including stress response, proteostasis, autophagy, antimicrobial, and metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>). As a conserved regulator, the IIS/FOXO pathway also regulates longevity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mice, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clancy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blüher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Suh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Willcox et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to regulating lifespan, the IIS pathway regulates neuronal function via the FOXO transcription factor. In particular, <italic>C. elegans</italic> IIS/<italic>daf-2</italic> mutants display DAF-16-dependent improved learning, short-term memory, and long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>). While both young and old <italic>daf-2</italic> adult worms display increased learning and memory relative to wild-type, the duration of this extension is not known, and the mechanisms by which <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants maintain neuronal function in older worms are not yet understood. Compared to wild-type worms, <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants better maintain maximum velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hahm et al., 2015</xref>), motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2016</xref>), neuromuscular junctions, the ability to regenerate axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byrne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lakhina et al., 2019</xref>), and neuronal morphology with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tank et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Toth et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, we previously showed that while <italic>daf-2</italic> has lower observed motility on food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bansal et al., 2015</xref>), this apparent is due to its high levels of a food receptor, ODR-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hahm et al., 2015</xref>), and its downregulation reveals the much higher mobility of <italic>daf-2</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hahm et al., 2015</xref>), even on food, in addition to its much higher and maintained maximum velocity with age. Previously, we found that <italic>daf-2</italic> worms also extend learning beyond the wild-type’s ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>), but the full duration of this extension with age was not known. That is, exactly how late in life <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants can still learn and remember, and whether this is proportional to their lifespan extension, was not previously determined.</p><p>We previously performed neuron-specific RNA-sequencing in young (Day 1) adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> and identified neuron-specific targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaletsky et al., 2016</xref>); genes upregulated in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant neurons are distinct from those in the whole animal, and we found that these neuronal genes are necessary for the observed improvements in memory and axon regeneration in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms. However, whether <italic>daf-2</italic> uses the same or different genes in young and old worms to improve and maintain cognitive function with age is unknown. Recent datasets using whole-animal single-cell RNA-seq have been generated for wild-type and <italic>daf-2</italic> worms, and these are sufficient for whole-body aging and pseudobulk analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roux et al., 2023</xref>), but we have found that those data are not deep enough to use specifically for in-depth analysis of neurons, which can be difficult to gather from whole animals. Other data are from larval stages and cannot be extrapolated to aging adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). To identify the transcriptional differences in the aging nervous system that might contribute to the loss of neuronal function with age in wild-type worms and the differences responsible for the extended abilities of <italic>daf-2</italic> animals, here we performed RNA sequencing on FACS-isolated neurons of aged (Day 8) wild-type and IIS/FOXO mutants. To further investigate the role of the neuronal IIS/FOXO pathway, we identified genes both upregulated by the IIS/FOXO pathway, and genes that are differentially expressed in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants with age. We found that <italic>daf-2</italic> differentially-regulated genes in the aged neurons are different from young neurons; in fact, many of these Day 8 <italic>daf-2</italic> vs <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> upregulated genes are stress response and proteolysis genes that may promote neuronal function and health. We then used functional assays to assess the contributions of <italic>daf-2</italic>-regulated genes to learning and memory. Our results suggest that <italic>daf-</italic>2’s neuronal targets in older worms are required to maintain neuronal functions with age, suggesting that additional and alternative mechanisms are at work in these aged mutants from their young counterparts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wild-type neurons lose their neuronal function and identity with age</title><p>Previously, we found that cognitive abilities in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> including learning, short-term memory, and long-term memory, all decline with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, neuronal morphology and regeneration ability are also impaired with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byrne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tank et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Toth et al., 2012</xref>). However, how these phenotypes are regulated at the molecular level in aging neurons remains to be systematically characterized. Therefore, we were interested in first identifying gene expression changes with age in wild-type neurons to characterize the normal physiological aging process. Before choosing timepoints to assess neuronal transcriptome changes, we carried out associative learning and short-term associative memory assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>) as we have previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kauffman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stein and Murphy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stein and Murphy, 2014</xref>). Briefly, well-fed worms are starved for 1 hr, then re-fed while exposed to the neutral odorant butanone for 1 hr; a choice assay between butanone and control immediately after training tests associative learning, while a choice assay after 1 hr of recovery on food-only plates tests short-term associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>). Adult Day 1 worms are fully developed, young, and healthy, while wild-type Day 7–8 worms, although still in their mid-life, have completely lost their learning and short-term memory abilities already by Day 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), thus we consider them ‘aged’ for the purposes of understanding loss of cognitive ability. Therefore, we reasoned that a comparison of adult wild-type Day 1 neurons with wild-type neurons that are at least aged Day 7–8 should reveal changes with age that result in loss of cognitive function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identifying neuronal aging targets in wild-type (WT) worms using neuron-specific RNA-sequencing.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Wild-type learning and 1 hr memory results on Day 1 and Day 7.

Tissue enrichment analysis of differentially-expressed genes suggested that aging neurons lose genes most expressed in the nervous system and neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), as one might expect.

There are two main models for genes that increase their expression with age and have a resulting impact on function: that they rise with age to compensate for lost function (‘compensatory’) and, therefore, promote function, or that their expression is deleterious to function and only rises with age through dysregulation. If a gene is compensatory, then its knockdown would abrogate learning and memory, even in young animals. If a gene’s function is harmful to neurons, reducing its expression might be beneficial to the worm, even in young animals (Of course, there may be other scenarios in which a gene with multiple functions may be detrimental for some behaviors but beneficial for other physiological roles). To test this hypothesis, we reduced the expression of a small set of highly upregulated candidate genes in categories that might function in a compensatory manner. These include <italic>utx-1</italic>, a histone demethylase known to play a role in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vandamme et al., 2012</xref>) and lifespan in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maures et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guillermo et al., 2021</xref>), and whose homolog has been implicated in cognition in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shaw et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tang et al., 2017</xref>); <italic>ins-19,</italic> an insulin-like peptide; and <italic>nmgp-1</italic>, a neuronal glycoprotein involved in chemosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernández et al., 2022</xref>). In each case, we see that gene expression is significantly higher in old than in young neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c, e and g</xref>). If a gene increases expression to benefit neurons, we would expect to see no difference in memory in young animals where there is no defect; by contrast, if the increase of a gene is deleterious, we would expect to see an improvement in behavior when knocked down, even in young animals. We performed adult-only neuron-sensitized RNAi knockdown to prevent any possible deleterious effects caused by changes during development, which largely takes place in early larval stages; testing in young adult animals is logical because there is no memory in aged wild-type, so any deleterious effect of knocking down a potentially compensatory gene in an aged would not result in a change. For all behavioral assays, we first prioritized significantly-changed genes with high fold-change, and then those with mammalian homologs.</p><p>We found that 48 hr (L4-Day 2) of adult-only knockdown of <italic>utx-1</italic> increases 1 hr and 2 hr memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), the loss-of-function mutation of <italic>ins-19</italic> increases both learning and memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>) and the adult-only knock-down of <italic>nmgp-1</italic> extends memory at 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). That is, in each of these cases, reduction of these genes did not impair memory, as loss of a compensatory function would appear; rather, loss of these age-upregulated genes improved wild-type memory. These results indicate that at least some neuronal genes that increase with age can have a negative impact on learning and memory, as demonstrated by the improvement of memory when knocked down, even in young animals. While it is still possible that some upregulated genes may act in a compensatory manner, the simplest model is that at least some are actively deleterious for learning and memory. We previously observed that for genes that play a role in complex behaviors like learning and memory, the loss of single genes can have a large impact on these complex behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lakhina et al., 2015</xref>), unlike the additive roles of longevity-promoting genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, one mechanism by which wild-type worms lose their learning and memory functions with age is not just by loss of neuronal gene expression, as one might expect, but also by dysregulation of expression of genes that can negatively impact learning and memory.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title><italic>daf-2</italic> mutants maintain learning and memory with age</title><p>We previously found that <italic>daf-2</italic> animals have extended motility (Maximum Velocity) that correlates with and predicts their extension of lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hahm et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, not only do young <italic>daf-2</italic> worms have better memory than wild-type worms, but <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants also maintain learning and memory better with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaletsky et al., 2016</xref>). However, the duration of this improvement was unknown. To determine the proportion of life that worms can learn and remember, we tested wild-type, <italic>daf-2</italic>, and <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> worms for their learning and associative memory ability every day until these functions were lost. We found that while wild-type worms lose their learning and short-term memory abilities by Day 7–8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>), learning and memory span were significantly extended in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>); thus, a comparison of <italic>daf-2</italic> neurons with wild-type neurons at Day 8 should reveal differences relevant to cognitive aging. The extension of learning and memory is dependent on the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>); in fact, while <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> mutants still have the ability to learn for a few days, these mutants are completely unable to carry out any memory ability, even on Day 1. Thus, learning ability, which is similar in wild-type and <italic>daf-2;daf-16</italic> mutants, is mechanistically distinct from short-term memory ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stein and Murphy, 2014</xref>). <italic>daf-2</italic> worms maintained learning ability until Day 19 and short-term (1 hr) memory ability until Day 15, more than twice the duration of wild-type worms, while <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> worms exhibit no short-term memory ability, even on Day 1 of adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Our data suggest that the learning span-to-lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>) and memory span-to-lifespan ratios in <italic>daf-2</italic> worms were similar to or slightly higher than that of wild-type worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>), indicating that <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants maintain cognitive function for at least proportionally as long as wild-type worms do. Thus, <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants maintain their higher cognitive quality of life longer than wild-type worms, while <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> mutants spend their whole lives without memory ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), in contrast to claims that <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants are less healthy than wild-type or <italic>daf-16</italic> worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bansal et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, it should be noted that because our choice assays distinguish motility function from learning and memory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kauffman et al., 2011</xref>), the improvements in memory with age shown by <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants relative to wild-type are distinct from <italic>daf-2’s</italic> improvements in motility that we previously showed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hahm et al., 2015</xref>).

Therefore, we tested the effect of RNAi knockdown of the top fold-change candidate genes on <italic>daf-2’s</italic> memory in aged adults.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–c</xref>, we selected these significantly differentially expressed candidate genes based on their ranking in fold-change. Previously, we have found that the top significantly differentially-expressed genes (by fold-change) are most likely to have strong effects on function, while less differentially-changed genes have less of an effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaletsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lakhina et al., 2015</xref>), therefore, we prioritized genes that are significantly different and the most highly expressed in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants compared to <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> mutants for subsequent testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). <italic>daf-2</italic> worms, including neurons, are susceptible to RNA interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaletsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang, 2004</xref>). Of the eight candidate genes we tested, the reduction of three of them (<italic>F08H9.4, mtl-1,</italic> and <italic>dod-24</italic>, originally classified as a Class II gene with proposed immune activity) significantly decreased <italic>daf-2’s</italic> learning ability on Day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Those genes plus reduction of two additional genes (<italic>C44B7.5</italic> and <italic>alh-2</italic>) affected 1 hr memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>) in Day 6 <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants.

The reduction of the metal stress gene <italic>mtl-1</italic>, which is expressed in neurons as well as the rest of the body, had a slight effect on learning and memory.</p><p>One caveat of these experiments is that, while we found these genes through the isolation of neurons from aged worms and subsequent RNA-sequencing, the knockdown of the genes and its effects are not necessarily neuron-autonomous; however, <italic>alh-2</italic> and <italic>F08H9.4</italic> were reported to only be expressed in neurons and the cephalic sheath cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaletsky et al., 2018</xref>), and <italic>C44B7.5</italic> and <italic>dod-24</italic>, while expressed more broadly, were not upregulated in <italic>daf-2</italic> in the whole-worm analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>), therefore, their effects are most likely neuron-autonomous. In fact, <italic>dod-24</italic> is one of the original Class 2 <italic>daf-2</italic>-downregulated genes from whole-animal analyses, suggesting that <italic>dod-24’s</italic> increase in expression is specifically in neurons, therefore, the effect of its knockdown is most likely to be neuron-autonomous.</p><p>Together, these data suggest that the specific genes that are differentially regulated in Day 8 <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants may aid in slowing neuronal function decline and behavioral changes associated with aging. Furthermore, memory maintenance with age might require additional genes that function in promoting stress resistance and neuronal resilience, which were not previously uncovered in analyses of young animals.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although it has been shown previously that <italic>daf-2</italic> worms maintain various functions with age, how long they can maintain learning and memory with age, and the genes that might be responsible for these extended neuronal functions, have not been previously explored.

We also identified the transcriptomic profile accompanying <italic>daf-2</italic>’s extended learning and memory span. Specifically, <italic>daf-2</italic> neurons maintain higher expression of stress response genes and predicted neuronal homeostasis functions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which may help make them more resistant to environmental adversities and age-related decline.

Sequencing many biological repeats of aging neurons to high depth with ribosomal RNA depletion allowed us to detect a larger number of genes compared to other neuron-related bulk and single-cell sequencing profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), providing a deep transcriptomic dataset of aged wild-type, IIS mutant, and IIS/FOXO mutant neurons. Our analysis allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes that are known to be expressed in at a small number of neurons, even for low-abundance genes. Notably, our sequencing results uncovered genes previously not known to be expressed in neurons that remained undetected in other datasets. Moreover, we revealed the involvement of known neuronal genes in the aging process, such as <italic>ins-6</italic> and <italic>srd-23</italic>. We hope that this dataset will become a valuable resource for detecting new candidates in neuronal aging.</p><p>For example, <italic>dod-24</italic>, which we observed to be upregulated in <italic>daf-2</italic> neurons and required for <italic>daf-2</italic>’s extended memory, was downregulated in the <italic>daf-2</italic> whole-worm transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c</xref>). <italic>dod-24</italic> has been traditionally classified as a Class II gene that is downregulated in <italic>daf-2</italic> worms and upregulated by <italic>daf-16</italic> RNAi treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tepper et al., 2013</xref>). Functionally, it has been shown to be an innate immunity gene upregulated during pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shapira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eckl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mack et al., 2022</xref>), and its whole-body reduction has been shown to extend the lifespan of wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>). However, here we find that <italic>dod-24</italic> is beneficial in the nervous system and required for <italic>daf-2</italic>’s extended learning and memory in aged worms. This intriguing contrast between the whole-worm transcriptome and the neuron-specific transcriptome suggests that some genes may have distinct regulatory roles in the nervous system, necessitating a more precise approach beyond whole-worm transcriptomics.</p><p>Using this neuron-specific sequencing profile of aged cells, we identified key pathways that change during neuron aging. Our sequencing of aged neurons uncovered active transcriptomic alterations during aging, resulting in not just transcriptional silencing but also upregulation of various pathways. We found that the Day 8 <italic>daf-2</italic> vs <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> neuronal differentially-expressed genes that we have newly discovered here differ from the neuronal Day 1 <italic>daf-2</italic> vs <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> dataset we previously obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaletsky et al., 2016</xref>). These Day 8 differentially-expressed genes are not canonical neuronal genes, such as receptors and ion channels; instead, there are more metabolic and proteolytic genes whose protein orthologs have been shown to be neuroprotective. All top 50 genes and 90% of the top 100 genes with identified mammalian orthologs have been shown to be essential to neuronal functions in mammals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These results indicate that instead of simply mimicking a young state, <italic>daf-2</italic> may enhance neuron’s resilience to the accumulation of harm and take a more active approach to combat aging. These changes suggest that <italic>daf-2</italic>’s extended memory maintenance may require different mechanisms than function in young animals; <italic>daf-2</italic> may maintain neuronal function not just by retaining a youthful transcriptome, but also by increasing the expression of genes that promote resilience, such as stress-response genes and proteolysis inhibitors.</p><p>In addition to examining aging in wild-type and IIS/FOXO mutants independently, our results further linked the normal aging process to altered gene regulation in the IIS pathway. <italic>utx-1, nmgp-1,</italic> and <italic>ins-19</italic> increase in expression in aged neurons, and we found that their reduction improved memory, indicating that at least some of the genes whose expression rises with age can have a negative impact on normal cognitive functions, rather than acting in a compensatory manner. <italic>utx-1</italic> is an H3K27me3 histone demethylase we found to be higher in wild-type aged neurons, but it is also involved in the IIS pathway. The downregulation of <italic>utx-1</italic> has been shown to regulate development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vandamme et al., 2012</xref>) and promote longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maures et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guillermo et al., 2021</xref>), and its mammalian homolog has been implicated in regulating cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shaw et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). The longevity response of <italic>utx-1</italic> depends on <italic>daf-16</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maures et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guillermo et al., 2021</xref>). The loss of <italic>utx-1</italic> decreases methylation on the <italic>daf-2</italic> gene, thus increasing DAF-16’s nuclear localization, mimicking a <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2011</xref>). This example of the crosstalk between normal aging and IIS/FOXO mutants offers valuable insights into modifying the aging process for enhanced longevity and cognitive health.</p><p>We found that the insulin-like peptide <italic>ins-19</italic> was upregulated in aged neurons and was downregulated in aged <italic>daf-2</italic> neurons, and its downregulation in wild-type worms extended memory span. Insulin-like peptides play crucial roles as receptor ligands (in both agonist and antagonist roles) for DAF-2, and we have found them to be downregulated in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants compared with <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> mutants, possibly creating a feedback loop that dampens the insulin signaling pathway, as was previously shown for <italic>ins-7</italic> and <italic>ins-18</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>). These peptides exhibit diverse functions in development, dauer formation, and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thomé-Duret et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kawano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, certain insulin-like peptides have been linked to neuronal activities, such as the regulation of aversive learning by the two antagonistic peptides <italic>ins-6</italic> and <italic>ins-7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), and reduced long-term learning and memory by <italic>ins-22</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lakhina et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, the expression changes of <italic>ins-19</italic> during wild-type aging and in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants provide an example of how longevity mutants can reverse wild-type transcriptional changes during aging, ultimately reducing behavioral and functional decline.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Summary of mechanistic insights</title><p>Our analysis of transcriptomes from isolated aged Day 8 neurons of wild-type, <italic>daf-2,</italic> and <italic>daf-16;daf-16</italic> mutants reveal several major mechanistic insights. Specifically, we found that wild-type neurons lose their neuronal identity through a combination of the loss of neuron-specific function genes with age, and the concomitant dysregulated increase in non-neuronal genes with age. Furthermore, at least a fraction of the top-upregulated genes with age can play deleterious roles; that is, they rise with age, and their knockdown improves function, even in young animals. This argues against the idea that all of these genes play a compensatory role with age.</p><p>We also found that the knockdown of individual top-ranked genes that function in learning and memory can have a large impact - like removing a cog of a machine. This is in contrast to our earlier findings regarding gene reduction in lifespan, where most cellular longevity processes regulated by DAF-16 activity appear to be additive, and therefore loss of individual major genes downstream of DAF-2 and DAF-16 have at most a 5–10% impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>). Several of these genes we found to be required for <italic>daf-2</italic>’s age-related improvement in learning and memory - namely <italic>dod-24</italic>, <italic>F08H9.4</italic>, <italic>C44B7.5</italic>, and <italic>alh-2</italic> – were previously not associated with memory function. Finally, these genes are distinct from the set of upregulated Day 1 <italic>daf-2</italic> vs <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> genes; how they each individually maintain neuronal function better with age will be interesting to dissect.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Beyond our sequencing analysis, we have established links between genomics, function, and behavior.

These additional findings further suggest that neuronal sequencing datasets can be used to identify functional candidates and pathways during the aging process. By bridging the gap between transcriptomic landscapes, genetic regulation, and functional outcomes, our study provides a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuronal aging, providing insights into the development of aging interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and worm cultivation</title><p>N2 (wild-type), OH441: otIs45(<italic>unc-119::GFP</italic>), CQ295: otIs45(<italic>unc-119::GFP</italic>);<italic>daf-2(e1370</italic>), CQ296: otIs45(<italic>unc-119::GFP</italic>);<italic>daf-16(mu86);daf-2(e1370</italic>), LC108: uIs69 (<italic>myo-2p::mCherry +unc-119p::sid-1</italic>), CQ705: daf-2(e1370) III, 3 X outcrossed, CQ745: <italic>daf-2(e1370) III;</italic> vIs69 [<italic>pCFJ90(Pmyo-2::mCherry +Punc-119::sid-1</italic>)] <italic>V</italic>, QL188: <italic>ins-19(tm5155) II</italic>, CX3695: kyIs140(<italic>str-2::GFP +lin-15(+</italic>)), CQ461<italic>: (daf-2(e1370);Pmec-4::mCherry</italic>), and CQ501<italic>: (daf-2 (e1370);zip-5(gk646);Pmec-4::mCherry</italic>).

Then worms were washed and resuspended in 500 uL 20 mg/mL pronase from <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic> (Sigma-Aldrich). Worms were incubated at room temperature with mechanical disruption by pipetting until no whole-worm bodies were seen, and then ice-cold osmolarity-adjusted L-15 buffer(Gibco) with 2% Fetal Bovine Serum (Gibco) were added to stop the reaction. Prior to sorting, cell suspensions were filtered using a 5 um filter and sorted using a FACSVantage SE w/ DiVa (BD Biosciences; 488 nm excitation, 530/30 nm bandpass filter for GFP detection). Sorting gates were determined by comparing with age-matched, genotype-matched non-fluorescent cell suspension samples.

One plate of worms was used to test the naïve chemotaxis assay without conditioning, while the other three plates were washed into M9, and washed three additional times to get rid of the bacteria. These worms are starved for 1 hr to prime them for food uptake. Then these worms are transferred to conditioning plates with NGM plates seeded with OP50 and 10% butanone stripes on the lid for 1 hr to perform conditioning. After conditioning, worms are either transferred from the conditioning plate directly to the chemotaxis plates to assess learning, or transferred to the holding plate for 1 hr or 2 hr to assess for memory. After staying on holding plates for 1 hr or 2 hr, worms are then transferred onto chemotaxis plates to assess for short-term memory. Chemotaxis assays were performed by transferring worms onto chemotaxis plates with 1 uL 10% butanone and 1 uL ethanol spots separated by 8 cm on a 10 cm NGM plate. Worms who have reached either the butanone spot or the ethanol spot are paralyzed by the 1 uL 7.5% NaN3 on these spots.

Does knockdown of the genes shown to affect learning also affect neuron structure during ageing, potentially one mechanism through which they modulate learning/memory?</p><p>(2) The learning and memory assay data presented in this study uses the butanone olfactory learning paradigm, which is well established by the same group. Have the authors tried other learning assays when testing for learning/memory changes after knockdown of candidate genes? Depending on the expression pattern of these genes, they may have more or less of an effect on olfactory learning versus for e.g. gustatory or mechanosensory-based learning.</p><p>(3) A comment on the 'compensatory vs dysregulatory' model as stated by the authors on page 7 - I understand that this model presents the two main options, but perhaps this is slightly too simplistic: gene expression that rises during ageing may be detrimental for memory (=dysregulatory), but at the same time may also be beneficial other physiological roles in other tissues (=compensatory).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your original suggestions; we addressed them in the previous version of response to the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>I am satisfied with how the authors have addressed all my comments/suggestions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your response!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary</p><p>In this manuscript, Weng et al. identify the neuron specific transcriptome that impacts age dependent cognitive decline.
