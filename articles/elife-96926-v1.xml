with age, and large-scale transcriptomic analyses have highlighted differential aging trajectories across tissues. The mechanism underlying shared and organ-selective functional changes across the lifespan, however, still remains poorly understood. Given the central role of mitochondria in powering cellular processes needed to maintain tissue health, we therefore undertook a systematic assessment of respiratory activity across 33 different tissues in young (2.5 months) and old (20 months) mice of both sexes. Our high-resolution mitochondrial respiration atlas reveals: (1) within any group of mice, mitochondrial activity varies widely across tissues, with the highest values consistently seen in heart, brown fat, and kidney; (2) biological sex is a significant but minor contributor to mitochondrial respiration, and its contributions are tissue-specific, with major differences seen in the pancreas, stomach, and white adipose tissue; (3) age is a dominant factor affecting mitochondrial activity, especially across most brain regions, different fat depots, skeletal muscle groups, eyes, and different regions of the gastrointestinal tract; (4) age effects can be sex- and tissue-specific, with some of the largest effects seen in pancreas, heart, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle; and (5) while aging alters the functional trajectories of mitochondria in a majority of tissues, some are remarkably resilient to age-induced changes. Altogether, our data provide the most comprehensive compendium of mitochondrial respiration and illuminate functional signatures of aging across diverse tissues and organ systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>respiration atlas</kwd><kwd>sex</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK084171</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>G William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL007534</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sarver</surname><given-names>Dylan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial respiration atlas reveals functional signatures of aging across diverse tissues and organ systems.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is a complex biological phenomenon that results in functional decline across tissues and organ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). Age is one of the most significant contributors to disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>), and the aging process is influenced by a variety of genetic and environmental factors at the tissue and organismal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tian et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuo et al., 2022</xref>). The application of omics technologies in recent years has led to unprecedented insights into the complex biology of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rutledge et al., 2022</xref>). Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses of mouse tissues across the lifespan have shown that aging tempo and trajectory, as indicated by tissue transcriptomic signatures, varies widely across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almanzar et al., 2020</xref>). Remarkably, many of the transcriptomic signatures of aging across tissues can be significantly reversed by caloric restriction or rejuvenated by the transfusion of young blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pálovics et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). Large-scale proteomic analyses of human plasma also reveal distinct waves of changes across the lifespan, which are associated with distinct biological pathways and affect age-related phenotypic traits and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oh et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Despite enormous progress, there is no consensus regarding the mechanisms underlying aging at the cellular or tissue level. Although many non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been put forth to explain the root cause of aging - oxidative damage, genomic instability, epigenetic changes, loss of proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, telomere shortening, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion - it remains a major challenge to distinguish between the driver and passenger mechanisms of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Magalhães, 2024</xref>). Nevertheless, efforts to understand the proximal and ultimate cause of aging will facilitate development of therapeutics aimed to improve healthy aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaeberlein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campisi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we focused on aging from a mitochondrial perspective, as this organelle is known to play an important role in the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lima et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lanza and Nair, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Mitochondria supply the bulk of the energy needed to maintain tissue health and repair tissue damage, and their function tends to decline with age. Over time, damage accumulates in mitochondrial DNA, proteins, and lipids, which compromises their functional integrity and leads to dysregulated metabolism and increased oxidative stress. Recent transcriptomic analyses have highlighted major reductions in electron transport chain gene expression across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>), and these changes can be significantly reversed by the transfusion of young blood into older mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pálovics et al., 2022</xref>). Aging-associated reduction in mitochondrial OXPHOS gene expression appears to be conserved between human, mouse, fly, and worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zahn et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in various age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haas, 2019</xref>). Boosting mitochondrial health has been shown to delay age-related decline in organ function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foote et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lima et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nilsson and Tarnopolsky, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Given the central role of mitochondria in tissue health, we aimed to address the extent and magnitude of aging-induced changes in mitochondrial function across tissues and organ systems. Although many studies have examined mitochondrial respiratory capacity in various tissues, the scale was limited in that only a very small number of tissues could be interrogated at the same time. This is largely due to the inherent low-throughput method of assessing respiration which requires freshly isolated mitochondria or cells from tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Salabei et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, it was not previously feasible to have a comprehensive and systems-level analysis of mitochondrial function across many tissues and the lifespan.</p><p>This barrier, however, has been recently overcome. An innovative method by Acin-Perez and coworkers has made it possible to now assess mitochondrial function in previously frozen tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2020</xref>). This new method circumvents the need to isolate mitochondria at the time of tissue harvest, allowing many tissues to be collected, frozen, and assayed at a later time. We adopted the new method in a standardized workflow to profile mitochondrial activity in 33 tissues from young and old mice of both sexes. The dataset consists of a total of 1320 tissue samples from 40 mice and 3960 high-resolution respirometry assays encompassing three technical replicates. Our study represents the largest and the most comprehensive tissue respirometry analysis to date. Our data provide an unprecedented view on the variations and changes in mitochondrial functional capacity across tissues, sex, and age, thus informing ongoing studies on the causes and consequences of aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pan-tissue mitochondrial respiration atlas overview, workflow, and analysis pipeline</title><p>To assay mitochondrial respiration and its maintenance across age and sex, we collected 33 tissues from young (2.5 months; ~18-year-equivalent in human) or old (20 months; ~65-year-equivalent in human) male or female mice (n=10 mice per age and sex).

The basic respiration assay consisted of four sequential steps: first, baseline unstimulated measurements were obtained. Then, NADH was used to assess respiration via mitochondrial complex I (CI), or succinate was used to assess respiration via mitochondrial complex II (CII) in the presence of rotenone (Rot, a CI inhibitor).

From this, we can quickly visualize tissues displaying a shared direction of change in respiration via CI, CII, or CIV across sex and age. Additionally, some tissues responded in an age-and-sex-specific manner (i.e. display divergence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This data clustering summarizes the shared (age-specific) or opposite (sex-specific) directionality of mitochondrial function across tissues in response to age.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that the mitochondrial activity of a particular tissue could increase or decrease in a sex-specific way even though the directionality is the same. For example, respiration through CII for the stomach (ST) showed male and female values decreasing with age, yet the male had a larger relative decrease when compared to female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, middle panel). Another consideration should be given to the divergent group, which displayed varying degrees of divergence. For example, CI-associated respiration of the stomach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, top panel) showed a strong divergence given that male had a strong decline in function while the female increased over time. On the other hand, the CI-associated respiration of the kidney medulla showed a weak divergence; although the directionality of change was opposite, the magnitude was small.</p><p>Lastly, we grouped all the tissues with a consistent shared (across sex) relative increase or decrease in CI-, CII-, and CIV-associated respiration in response to age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). The tissues with a shared (across sex) increased response to aging were plantaris (PL), diaphragm (DI), soleus (SL), heart ventricle (HV), ileum (IL), cecum (CC), proximal colon (PC), and mesenteric fat (MW). Interestingly, PL, DI, and SL are all skeletal muscles and IL, CC, and PC are all part of the digestive tract. Also of note, mitochondrial respiration in the gastrocnemius (GT), hamstring (HS), and tongue (TN) muscles were not uniformly increasing with age. In fact, these muscles showed reduced mitochondrial respiration with age, in striking contrast to other skeletal muscle types assayed. The tissues with a shared (across sex) decrease in response to aging were brown fat (BT), gonadal fat (GW), inguinal fat (IW), brain cortex (CO), hippocampus (HI), hypothalamus (HY), cerebellum (CE), liver (LV), kidney cortex (KC), eye (EY), skin (SK), and spleen (SP). Different fat depots and most of the brain regions showed a consistent decline in respiratory function with age, regardless of sex. The kidney cortex (KC) oddly showed a respiratory effect distinct from the medulla, which was almost completely resistant to age-related respiratory changes. The eyes (EY) not only showed a consistent decline in respiration with age, but also had one of the largest combined relative effects. Together, the shared and divergent analyses presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>) illuminate the modulation of mitochondrial function across age.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we provide the most comprehensive catalog of sex- and age-associated mitochondrial respiration signatures across diverse tissues and organs system. One important aspect of our study to emphasize is the experimental uniformity. All the tissue samples were collected from the same set of mice, and processed and analyzed in a uniform and standardized manner on the same respirometry platform in a single laboratory. Combined with the 10 biological replicates, our experimental setup and workflow markedly enhanced the rigor and reduced the variations in data quality. From the mitochondrial respiration compendium, we can clearly see that mitochondrial function varies widely across tissues. This is perhaps not surprising given the highly variable energetic demands of different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rolfe and Brown, 1997</xref>) and the known differences in the composition of mitochondrial proteomes across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pagliarini et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, our data provide evidence that aging has a disproportionately larger effect than sex on mitochondrial activity across tissues.</p><p>The transcriptomic dataset generated by the Tabula Muris Consortium clearly indicates organ-specific temporal signatures across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almanzar et al., 2020</xref>), and this is assumed to track closely with tissue function even though no equivalent systematic interrogation of tissue function across the lifespan has been performed. In this regard, our mitochondrial activity atlas aligned and corroborated with the conclusion from large-scale transcriptomic analyses that the aging process and trajectory can vary substantially across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). This reinforces the notion that while an organism ages, the aging-associated decline in organ function is not uniform across tissues and organ systems. Given that genetics and environmental factors all contribute to tissue health and their functional breakdown with age, this further exemplifies the heterogenous process of aging across a population.</p><p>Although sex is a significant biological variable influencing many aspects of physiology and pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austad and Fischer, 2016</xref>), and sex hormones are known to affect mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klinge, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaignard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sultanova et al., 2020</xref>), we were surprised that sex has a relatively modest impact on respiratory capacity in mitochondria across tissues and age. The modest impact of sex on mitochondrial respiration across tissues is also concordant with the relatively minor impact of sex on tissue transcriptome across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). The caveat, however, is that our study is based on a single strain of mice with a uniform genetic background. The contribution of biological sex may be more pronounced in an outbred population where sex hormones interact with other genetic and environmental determinants to influence mitochondrial activity across tissues and age.</p><p>Aging is a dynamic process that unfolds across the lifespan, which involves changes at the molecular, cellular, biochemical, and tissue level. Although the magnitude of change may vary between individuals, with increasing age, humans generally experience a gradual and progressive decline in cognitive function, visual acuity, skin elasticity, motor control, digestive function, fertility, and metabolism (e.g. increased adiposity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tian et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, in our dataset, we also observed an aging-associated decline in mitochondrial respiration in most brain regions, eyes, skin, fallopian tubes, different fat depots and BAT, pancreas, and the digestive tracts in male and/or female mice. This age-dependent reduction in mitochondrial function likely contributes, at least in part, to the functional decline across different organ systems. Depending on the tissue, the magnitude of change in mitochondrial respiration in old mice, when compared to young mice, can be substantial or relatively modest. This variability is consistent with the heterogenous rate of aging across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tian et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The underlying cause of reduced mitochondrial respiration in aging is not well understood and it may involve multiple mechanisms. Transcriptomic analyses have consistently shown that aging induces a reduction in mitochondrial OXPHOS gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), and this likely is one of the mechanisms that contributes to the reduced mitochondrial activity we observed across many tissues in old mice. The contributing factors which drive an age-dependent decrease in mitochondrial OXPHOS gene expression across tissues, however, is largely unknown. Other potential mechanisms may involve age-dependent accumulation of oxidative damage in mitochondrial DNA, proteins, and lipids that adversely affect mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sastre et al., 2000</xref>). The damage to mitochondrial integrity in aging is frequently attributed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are naturally generated as byproducts of electron transfer through the mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orrenius et al., 2007</xref>), or to inadequate stress response pathways (e.g. proteostasis and mitophagy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lima et al., 2022</xref>). While cells have mechanisms to guard against oxidative stress due to mitochondrial activity, these antioxidant defense mechanisms are known to decline with age despite an age-dependent increase in ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kozakiewicz et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, the integrated stress response pathways also tend to diminished with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lima et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, it is often thought the gradual accumulation of ROS with age, coupled with a decline in mitochondria’s ability to handle proteotoxic stress, progressively compromises mitochondrial function.</p><p>It should be noted that changes in cell, tissue, and organ function are often counteracted by homeostatic and compensatory responses. While many tissues showed a significant reduction in mitochondrial function, some tissues also showed a concomitant increase in mitochondrial activity with age. For example, we observed an increase in mitochondrial respiration in the heart, different skeletal muscle groups, and mesenteric fat in old male and/or female mice. Increased mitochondrial respiration is seen in both the oxidative (diaphragm, soleus, tongue) and glycolytic (plantaris) muscle fibers. This increase in mitochondrial activity is not attributed to differences in mitochondrial content since the OCR is normalized to mitochondrial content.</p><p>Skeletal muscle mass is known to decrease with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilkinson et al., 2018</xref>), and it is frequently but not always accompanied by a reduction in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gouspillou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Short et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kent-Braun and Ng, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chilibeck et al., 1998</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Short et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mansouri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumaran et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tonkonogi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drew et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Picard et al., 2010</xref>). Some studies, however, have also suggested that the energetic efficiency of mitochondria in skeletal muscle - located beneath the sarcolemmal membrane or between the myofibrils - appears to increase with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crescenzo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crescenzo et al., 2014</xref>). While we observed an increase in the maximal uncoupled respiration in skeletal muscle lysates of aged mice, our results cannot be directly compared to prior studies that examine coupled respiration in intact tissue or isolated mitochondria. It has been shown that skeletal muscle mitochondrial number increases, whereas mitochondrial size decreases, with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Campo et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the ultrastructure of mitochondria may also change with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandt et al., 2017</xref>). Whether these parameters correlate with and contribute to age-dependent changes in mitochondrial respiration remains to be established.</p><p>Similar to skeletal muscle, the heart also experiences functional decline with age, and this is thought to be attributed to multiple mechanisms that include age-dependent changes in mitochondrial content, morphology, lipid composition (e.g. cardiolipin) and dynamics (e.g. fusion and fission), activity of the electron transport chain, ROS generation, and susceptibility to mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lesnefsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boengler et al., 2017</xref>). Additional contributing factors to cardiac functional decline include age-related oxidative stress and chronic low-grade inflammation, which further impact mitochondrial integrity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Almeida et al., 2020</xref>). With regard to impaired mitochondrial OXPHOS in the aging heart, it appears the subpopulation of mitochondria located between the myofibrils, the interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM), are affected to a much greater extent than the population of mitochondria located in the subsarcolemmal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fannin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lesnefsky et al., 2001</xref>). This suggests that IFM, being more closely associated with energy-demanding myofibrils, might be more vulnerable to age-related dysfunction. In contrast to studies using isolated mitochondria from the heart, mitochondrial function was found to be largely preserved in permeabilized intact cardiomyocyte bundles from senescent rats, in which all intact mitochondria are represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Picard et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In our assay, however, maximal mitochondrial respiration in the heart ventricles increases with age. Since the contractile property of the heart declines and the stiffness of the extracellular matrix increases with age due to fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biernacka and Frangogiannis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Travers et al., 2016</xref>), the heart tissue becomes less efficient and requires more energy to carry out its normal pumping function. Thus, we speculate that reduced efficiency of the aging heart may drive a compensatory response to increase mitochondrial capacity. An increase in mitochondrial respiration, however, may come at the cost of generating greater amounts of reactive oxygen species, which are thought to be detrimental to the aging heart. Thus, with the general observation that organ function declines with age, our data suggests that some tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscle may increase their mitochondrial respiration to meet the energetic demands resulting from reduced mass (e.g. sarcopenia) and/or declining efficiency of organ function. This hypothesis awaits future experimental verification.</p><p>It is worth noting that our respirometry analysis assesses NADH-dependent respiration <italic>through</italic> CI, succinate-dependent respiration <italic>through</italic> CII, and TMPD/ascorbate-dependent respiration <italic>at</italic> CIV. Regardless of whether electrons enter the respiratory chain through CI or CII, or at CIV, oxygen (the final electron acceptor) is only consumed at CIV. Since the OCR is normalized to mitochondrial content, the variations we observed in OCR within any given tissue through CI or CII, or at CIV, likely reflect how tightly coupled respiratory complex chains consisting of CI+CIII2+CIV and CII+CIII2+CIV are relative to CIV alone. Although our data suggest that sex and age affect the flow of electrons through respiratory complex CI+CIII2+CIV and CII+CIII2+CIV across tissues, this remains speculative given that our assays were not performed on intact mitochondria.</p><p>Every respirometry method has its advantages and limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Salabei et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike the mitochondrial respiration analysis in intact cells or isolated mitochondria, our respirometry analyses were performed in mitochondria-enriched lysates derived from frozen tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2020</xref>). In an intact mitochondrion, the rate of respiration is regulated by both substrate supply across the mitochondrial membrane and the rate of NADH and FADH production via the TCA cycle and fatty acid β-oxidation. In the absence of an intact mitochondrial membrane, our assays measure maximal mitochondrial respiration through CI, CII, or CIV. Thus, our mitochondrial activity reflects maximal respiration across tissues. In an in vivo milieu, mitochondrial activity is likely regulated and may not reach its maximal capacity as reflected in our assay. Other relevant and informative parameters concerning mitochondrial functions - e.g., P/O ratios, basal respiration, and ATP-coupled respiration - could not be obtained from our current approach, which relied on non-intact mitochondria. However, despite these limitations, the major advantage of the frozen-tissue method is that it is now feasible to carry out large-scale respirometry analyses across tissues, thus providing a broader understanding of systemic bioenergetic health that outweighs its limitations.</p><p>It should be emphasized that our mitochondrial respiration represents the average values for each tissue, even though all tissues consist of multiple distinct cell types that may vary in their cellular composition and mitochondrial activity across sex and age. While individual cell types can be isolated prior to respirometry analysis, this labor-intensive method is not suited for assessing mitochondrial respiration at scale (i.e. across a large number of tissues from the same animal). In the future, this challenge may be overcome with the development of new technologies that allow for high-resolution mitochondrial respirometry at cell-type or single-cell resolution in situ.</p><p>In summary, our mitochondria functional signatures demonstrate similar and divergent responses to aging across tissues. Whether changes in tissue mitochondrial respiration reflect the cause, consequence, or both, of aging remains to be determined. We anticipate that the integration of this knowledge and approach with other large-scale omics data will help uncover potential genetic, epigenetic, and biochemical mechanisms linking mitochondrial health and organismal aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse model</title><p>All wild-type C57BL/6J male and female mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and fed a standard chow (Envigo; 2018SX). In total, the young group was comprised of 10 male and 10 female 10-week-old mice, and the old group was comprised of 10 male and 10 female 80-week-old mice. Mice were housed in polycarbonate cages on a 12 hr:12 hr light-dark photocycle with ad libitum access to water and food. All mice were fasted for 2 hr prior to euthanasia and dissection. Tissues were collected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at –80°C until analysis. All mouse protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (animal protocol # MO22M367). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines and followed the standards established by the Animal Welfare Acts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Comprehensive multi-organ dissection</title><p>Each mouse was dissected cleanly, swiftly, and in a concerted manner by three people. Each dissection took approximately 8–10 min, with 33 tissues collected per dissection. After euthanasia, blood was collected via decapitation. The head was then immediately given to dissector one to collect brain regions (hypothalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex), eyes, and tongue. Simultaneously, the visceral cavity was opened by dissector two. iWAT was collected immediately after opening the abdominal skin. After that the abdominal muscle was cut and gWAT and testes or fallopian tubes were collected. Following this, the visceral organs were partitioned in two groups. Dissector two promptly dissected liver, stomach, kidneys (further separated the cortex and medulla), spleen, diaphragm, heart (further divided into atria and ventricles), lungs, BAT, and skin (cleared of hair using Topical Nair lotion, cleaned, then collected). At the same time, dissector three was collecting the pancreas, mesWAT, small intestine (further split into duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), cecum, and large intestine (further split into proximal and distal colon). As soon as tissue collection in the head was finished, the mouse carcass was cut transversely at the lumbar spine and handed to dissector one for muscle dissection. Dissector one then rapidly and precisely anatomized (bilaterally) the quadriceps (entire complex - rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and vastus medialis), hamstrings (biceps femoris), gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles. All tissues were washed with sterile 1× PBS to remove residual blood prior to snap-freezing. Additionally, the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine were cleared and cleaned of debris with PBS prior to freezing. The cecum, however, was kept whole containing all fecal/food matter and microorganisms present. All dissected tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80°C for later analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Respirometry of frozen tissue samples</title><p>Respirometry was conducted on frozen tissue samples to assay for mitochondrial activity as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2020</xref>), using a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer.

The authors aimed to generate an atlas of ETC function in about 3 dozen tissue types isolated from all major mammalian organ systems. They used a recently published improvised method by which ETC function can be quantified in freshly frozen tissues. This method enabled them to collect data from almost all organ systems from the same mouse and use many biological replicates (10 mice/experiment) required for an unbiased and statistically robust analysis. Moreover, they studied the influence of sex (male and female) and aging (young adult and old age) on ETC function in these organ systems. The main findings of this study are (1) cells in the heart and kidneys have very active ETC complexes compared to other organ systems, (2) the sex of the mice has little influence on the ETC function, and (3) aging undermined the mitochondrial function in most tissue, but surprisingly in some tissue aging promoted the activity of ETC complexes (e.g., Quadriceps, plantaris muscle, and Diaphragm).</p><p>Comments on the second revision:</p><p>My previous concern remains unaddressed in the new revision. As I mentioned earlier, it is crucial for the authors to include a detailed discussion on the limitations of their method, specifically how maximal respiration does not accurately reflect the actual ATP production rate. Additionally, the authors should highlight the fact that data provided in the manuscript should be interpreted with caution.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96926.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors utilize a new technique to measure mitochondrial respiration from frozen tissue extracts, which goes around the historical problem of purifying mitochondria prior to analysis, a process that requires a fair amount of time and cannot be easily scaled up.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial respiration across tissues, sexes, and two different ages provides foundational knowledge needed in the field.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While many of the findings are mostly descriptive, this paper provides a large amount of data for the community and can be used as a reference for further studies.

In particular, the study recorded the activity of respirasomes, i.e. the concerted activity of mitochondrial respiratory complex chains consisting of CI+CIII2+CIV, CII+CIII2+CIV or CIV alone.</p><p>The strength is certainly the atlas of oxidative metabolism in the whole mouse body, the inclusion of the two different sexes and the comparison between young and old mice. The measurement was performed on frozen tissue, which is possible as already shown (Acin-Perez et al, EMBO J, 2020).</p><p>Weakness: The assay reveals the maximum capacity of enzyme activity, which is an artificial situation and may differ from in vivo respiration, as the authors themselves discuss. The material used was a very crude preparation of cells containing mitochondria and other cytosolic compounds and organelles. Thus, the conditions are not well defined and the respiratory chain activity was certainly uncoupled from ATP synthesis. Preparation of more pure mitochondria and testing for coupling would allow evaluation of additional parameters: P/O ratios, feedback mechanism, basal respiration, and ATP-coupled respiration, which reflect in vivo conditions much better. The discussion is rather descriptive and cautious and could lead to some speculations about what could cause the differences in respiration and also what consequences these could have, or what certain changes imply.</p><p>Nevertheless, this study is an important step towards this kind of analysis.</p><p>Comments on the second revision:</p><p>I believe this is an important and interesting area of study, although I recognise that the assay which measures maximal enzyme activity under unphysiological conditions has its limitations. Nevertheless, it does seem possible to get a first glance of the respiratory situation in the respective tissue. There is a typo in the source data (Fig. xC) for skeletal muscle.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96926.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sarver</surname><given-names>Dylan C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Saqib</surname><given-names>Muzna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Fangluo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>G William</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>No further questions, but please do add a sentence or two about the lack of these additional points in the discussion as a limitation to the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional “limitations of the study” in the Discussion Section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>The authors have added to the discussion some critical remarks about the limitations of the study, which will help in the assessment of the conclusions.</p><p>In sum, the manuscript has significantly improved during the revision.</p><p>Some minor points should be changed, though</p><p>Page 18 marked: &quot;What causes an age-dependent decrease in mitochondrial OXPHOS genes across tissues, however, is largely unknown.&quot; I assume, the authors do not suggest that the abundance of genes is reduced, which means elimination of DNA?
