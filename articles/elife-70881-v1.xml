detecting cell-cell contacts are powerful tools for studying a wide range of biological processes, from neuronal signaling to cancer-immune interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we report TRACC (Transcriptional Readout Activated by Cell-cell Contacts), a GPCR-based transcriptional recorder of cellular contacts, which converts contact events into stable transgene expression. TRACC is derived from our previous protein-protein interaction recorders, SPARK (Kim et al., 2017) and SPARK2 (Kim et al., 2019), reported in this journal. TRACC incorporates light gating via the light-oxygen-voltage-sensing (LOV) domain, which provides user-defined temporal control of tool activation and reduces background. We show that TRACC detects cell-cell contacts with high specificity and sensitivity in mammalian cell culture and that it can be used to interrogate interactions between neurons and glioma, a form of brain cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synthetic biology</kwd><kwd>cell contacts</kwd><kwd>transcriptional reporter</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1 MH117821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ting</surname><given-names>Alice Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1NS111132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monje</surname><given-names>Michelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Big Ideas Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ting</surname><given-names>Alice Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2T32CA009302-41</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Kelvin F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Blavatnik Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Blavatnik Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Kelvin F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014989</institution-id><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ting</surname><given-names>Alice Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TRACC (Transcriptional Readout Activated by Cell-cell Contacts) is an engineered molecular tool that detects and records cell-cell contacts in mammalian systems.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell-cell interactions are integral to maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis; signaling that occurs from direct physical cellular contacts mediates a diverse range of biological processes, including embryonic development, neuronal signaling, and immune-cancer interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armingol et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dustin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhang and Liu, 2019</xref>). Consequently, several molecular tools have been developed to visualize and detect cell-cell interactions between different cell populations. Technologies based on enzymatic labeling strategies result in chemical labeling at contact sites, which allows for direct visualization. For example, LIPSTIC uses sortase A to catalyze labeling on the cell surface of interacting cells and has been applied to study T cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pasqual et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, the biotin ligase BirA and lipoic acid ligase LplA have been engineered for labeling across synaptic contacts to visualize neuronal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Split forms of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Martell et al., 2016</xref>) and the biotin ligase TurboID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Takano et al., 2020</xref>) have also been engineered to perform both extracellular and intracellular labeling at cell-cell contact sites; mGRASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) and SynView (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tsetsenis et al., 2014</xref>) reconstitute GFP across neuronal synapses.</p><p>While direct visualization of cellular contacts is useful, it is often desirable to also highlight the <italic>entire</italic> contacting cell, so that cell anatomy, transcriptomic signature, and functional properties can be further characterized. Various tools have been engineered that result in the release of an orthogonal transcription factor (TF) in the receiver cell after contact with a sender cell, allowing for a range of user-desired outputs. These include the Notch-based systems synNotch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Morsut et al., 2016</xref>) and TRACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Huang et al., 2017</xref>), and the GPCR-based system trans-Tango (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Talay et al., 2017</xref>). Other approaches involving trans-cellular uptake of protein cargo have also been developed; in BAcTrace, the botulinum neurotoxin is transferred to the receiver cell, which also results in proteolytic release of a TF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cachero et al., 2020</xref>), while in G-baToN, a fluorescent protein is transferred, which labels the receiver cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). These aforementioned tools (TRACT, trans-Tango, and BAcTrace) have not yet been tested in mammalian systems and lack temporal gating, which can provide temporal specificity and reduce background signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe a different and complementary technology for transcriptional recording of cell-cell contacts. In TRACC (Transcriptional Readout Activated by Cell-cell Contacts), a GPCR in the receiver cell is activated upon interaction with a ligand expressed on sender cells, resulting in the release of a TF, which allows for versatile outputs. By incorporating an engineered light-oxygen-voltage-sensing (LOV) domain, the tool becomes light-gated, and tool activation requires both cell contact and exogenous blue light, restricting activation only to user-defined time windows. We show that TRACC can detect cellular contacts with high specificity and sensitivity in HEK293T culture. We further demonstrate its utility by extending to neuronal cultures and assaying interactions in co-culture between glioma cells and neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and development of TRACC</title><p>To design TRACC, we built upon our previously published tool SPARK, which detects protein-protein interactions with transcriptional readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). TRACC is comprised of four components, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>. On the sender cell, a ligand is presented on the cell surface by fusion to pre-mGRASP, a construct that contains the transmembrane domain of CD4 and the intracellular domain of the pre-synaptic protein neurexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). On the receiver cell, a corresponding GPCR is expressed and fused to an LOV domain, a TEV cleavage site (TEVcs; ENLYFQM), and a TF. Additionally, the receiver cell expresses arrestin fused to the TEV protease (TEVp) and a reporter construct of interest. Upon cell-cell contact, the ligand on the sender cell activates the GPCR on the receiver cell, resulting in recruitment of arrestin-TEVp. However, in the absence of light, the LOV domain cages the TEVcs, rendering it inaccessible to the TEVp. With the addition of exogenous blue light, the LOV domain uncages, resulting in subsequent cleavage and release of a TF and reporter activation. Thus, TRACC is designed as an ‘AND’ logic gate, simultaneously requiring contact with a sender cell and exogenous blue light.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design of TRACC (Transcriptional Readout Activated by Cell-cell Contacts).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of TRACC. A ligand is presented on sender cells; a GPCR specifically activated by the selected ligand is expressed in receiver cells. The GPCR is fused to the light-oxygen-voltage-sensing (LOV) domain, TEV protease cleavage site (TEVcs), and transcription factor (TF). Upon both cell-cell contact and exposure to blue light, the GPCR is activated and recruits arrestin fused to TEV protease (TEVp); blue light uncages the LOV domain, allowing cleavage of the TEVcs and subsequent release of the TF, which translocates to the nucleus and drives expression of a reporter of interest. (<bold>B</bold>) Constructs used in TRACC. The sender construct is comprised of a peptide ligand fused to pre-mGRASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) and the HA epitope tag. Receiver constructs include the corresponding GPCR fused to the LOV domain, TEVcs, and TF (Gal4), arrestin fused to TEVp, and a reporter construct. (<bold>C</bold>) Luciferase assay to screen a panel of GPCR-ligand pairs in cis. HEK293T cells were transfected with both sender and receiver constructs corresponding to each GPCR-ligand pair indicated, using the reporter UAS-luciferase. Approximately 8 hr after 10 min blue light exposure, the UAS-luciferase luminescence was recorded using a plate reader (n = 4 replicates per condition). The CCR6-CCL20 pair (red) showed the highest ±light and ±ligand signal ratios of 2.6-fold and 3.2-fold, respectively. A receiver construct using the glucagon receptor (GCGR), but omitting the LOV domain, analogous to that of previously published trans-Tango (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Talay et al., 2017</xref>), was included as a control.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1sdata1"><label>Figure 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Primary data for luminescence graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70881-fig1-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70881-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To first test our design in HEK293T cells, we utilized eLOV, a previously engineered LOV domain that has improved light caging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), and the orthogonal Gal4-UAS TF system. To ensure that TRACC would be orthogonal for eventual applications in neuroscience, we selected six GPCR-ligand pairs that are not expressed or lowly expressed in the brain according to the GTEx database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lonsdale et al., 2013</xref>). These are CCR3-CCL13, CCR6-CCL20, CCR7-CCL19, GHRHR-GHRH, GNRHR-GnRH, and GCGR-GCG, the last of which was utilized in trans-Tango (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Talay et al., 2017</xref>). GPCR-ligand pairs were cloned into TRACC constructs and co-expressed in HEK293T cells in cis along with a UAS-luciferase reporter. We adopted previously optimized experimental parameters from SPARK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) and SPARK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), including DNA transfection amounts, incubation times, and light stimulation time (Methods). Approximately 8 hr following 10 min stimulation with blue light, TRACC activation was measured via a luciferase assay on a plate reader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Of the GPCR-ligand pairs tested, the CCR6-CCL20 pair showed the highest ±light and ±ligand signal ratios (2.6- and 3.2-fold, respectively). Thus, we selected this GPCR-ligand pair for subsequent experiments. Of note, we included a construct that omitted the LOV domain, a design similar to trans-Tango (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Talay et al., 2017</xref>), and observed high background reporter expression and ligand-independent activation (±ligand signal ratio of 1.1-fold), suggesting that the additional light-gate is crucial for minimizing background.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Detecting cellular contacts in HEK293T cultures</title><p>Next, we tested whether TRACC could successfully detect cell-cell contacts in trans. To do this, sender and receiver HEK293T cells were separately transfected with the corresponding TRACC constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Sender and receiver cell populations were co-plated together; approximately 8 hr following 10 min blue light stimulation, TRACC activation of UAS-luciferase expression was measured on a plate reader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We observed a robust increase in luciferase reporter expression with ±light and ±sender signal ratios of 5.6-fold each. To demonstrate the versatility of a transcriptional reporter, we repeated the assay using a UAS-mCherry reporter in place of UAS-luciferase and performed immunostaining and confocal fluorescence imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). From the imaging assay, we observed robust light-dependent activation of the mCherry reporter in V5-positive (receiver-positive) cells that were in direct contact with HA-positive (sender-positive) cells. Quantitation of fluorescence intensities of cells across 50 fields of view (FOVs) showed that TRACC was highly specific; of 94 mCherry-expressing cells analyzed, 80.0% were in direct contact with an HA-positive sender cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). While we did observe mCherry reporter activation in V5-positive cells not touching sender cells (20% of mCherry-expressing cells were not in direct contact with a sender cell), it is possible that these cells were previously in contact, but the sender cells were dislodged during the course of the experiment or during the washing steps in immunostaining. It is also possible that background activation may occur in cells expressing the arrestin-TEVp component at particularly high levels, which can result in GPCR activation-independent release of the TF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sanchez et al., 2020</xref>). V5 intensity distributions were consistent across high-mCherry and low-mCherry populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that reporter activation is sender-dependent and not a result of differential receiver expression levels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Using TRACC (Transcriptional Readout Activated by Cell-cell Contacts) to detect cell-cell contacts in HEK293T culture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design for co-plating sender and receiver cells.

TRACC is a GPCR-based detector of cell-cell interactions with transcriptional readout, offering versatile outputs for detection and downstream manipulation. TRACC incorporates the light-sensitive LOV domain, such that tool activation can only occur in a user-defined window during which exogenous blue light is supplied. Compared to tools that directly label contact sites such as LIPSTIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pasqual et al., 2018</xref>), split-HRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Martell et al., 2016</xref>), and mGRASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), TRACC provides genetic access to contacting cell populations for downstream analysis and potential manipulation.

We further showed that TRACC can be applied to detect cellular contacts in both neuron and glioma systems, and that the sender construct localizes properly to pre-synaptic terminals. In future studies, TRACC may be useful for synapse-specific tracing, particularly in the anterograde direction (pre-synaptic to post-synaptic) for which tools are currently lacking. This will first require careful validation of TRACC component localization in vivo and testing of TRACC specificity and sensitivity in a well-characterized circuit in vivo. TRACC may also be useful for future investigations of neuron-glioma circuitry, allowing identification and subsequent analysis of connected subpopulations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Table of plasmids used in this study.</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Plasmid name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Plasmid vector</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Promoter</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Features</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Variants</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Details</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Used for</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Used in</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">P1-P6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAAV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CMV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HindIII-GPCR-SpeI-NES-NheI-eLOV-TEVcs-FLAG-Gal4-V5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GPCRs: CCR3, CCR6, CCR7, GHRHR, GNRHR, GCGR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NES: ELAEKLAGLDIN;

Confocal imaging was performed with a Zeiss AxioObserver inverted microscope with a 20× air objective, and 40× and 63× oil-immersion objectives. The following combinations of laser excitation and emission filters were used for various fluorophores: DAPI (405 nm laser excitation, 445/40 nm emission), AlexaFluor 488 (491 nm laser excitation, 528/38 nm emission), AlexaFluor 568 (561 nm laser excitation, 617/73 nm emission), and AlexaFluor 647 (647 nm laser excitation, 680/30 nm emission). All images were collected with SlideBook (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) and processed with ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Neuron and DIPG co-culture</title><p>Primary rat cortical neurons and SU-DIPG-VI cells were cultured as described above. For co-culture assays with sender neurons and receiver SU-DIPG-VI cells, 50 μL of AAV1/2 encoding pAAV-Syn-CCL20-pre-mGRASP was added to neurons at DIV5. For subsequent media changes after neuron infection with AAV, complete neuronal media without serum was used instead. At DIV9, stable DIPG cells expressing receiver constructs were dissociated using TrypLE and then pelleted by centrifugation for 3 min at 200 g, and further washed with DPBS twice. DIPG cells were then resuspended in complete neuronal media without serum and added directly to the neuron culture at a density of 10,000 cells/well for a 24-well plate; plates were then wrapped in aluminum foil. At DIV11, cells were exposed to an LED light array (467 nm, 60 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1 s of light every 3 s) at 37°C for 10 min. After light stimulation, the plate was rewrapped in aluminum foil and incubated for an additional 24 hr in a 37°C incubator. Cells were then fixed and immunostained as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Specificity and sensitivity analysis for HEK293T trans assay</title><p>For specificity analysis of imaging data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-E</xref>, an ROI was generated for each V5-positive cell (receiver). The average pixel intensities in each channel for each manually drawn ROI were measured. Pixel intensities were corrected for background by subtracting the average pixel intensities of 50 V5-, mCherry-, and HA-negative cells for each channel. Measurements for each ROI were separated into either V5-positive cells in contact (n = 106 cells) with an HA-positive (sender) cell or not in contact (n = 108 cells), and the mCherry/V5 signal ratios were plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>For sensitivity analysis of imaging data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>, the mCherry signal in V5-positive (receiver) cells in contact with an HA-positive (sender) cell were measured as described above. Cells were considered mCherry-positive if the signal was greater than 1.5-fold over background, as determined from V5-negative cells. From this analysis, 80.2% of V5-positive cells in contact with an HA-positive cell showed TRACC activation and mCherry expression (n = 106 cells from 50 FOVs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Colocalization analysis of sender construct</title><p>Sender construct colocalization with endogenous synapsin expression in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>) was quantified using the Coloc2 test for image colocalization in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), which measures the correlation of pixel intensity at each location to compare HA and synapsin intensity levels.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70881-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the NIH (RF1 MH117821 to AYT, DP1NS111132 to MM) and Stanford Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute (Big Ideas initiative to AYT).

cells that have come into contact with another population of cells. In contrast with previous systems, TRACC is gated temporally and spatially by blue light application. The system comprises a GPCR and ligand that interact at the surface of the two cells, as well as a TEV protease-arrestin fusion that gets recruited following the interaction. The GCPR is fused to a LOV light sensitive domain, a LOV-masked TEV cleavage site and transcriptional activator. TEV cleavage, in the presence of a sender cell and light, releases a transcriptional activator to drive expression of a reporter transgene in the receiver cell. This system provides a new tool for studying cell-cell contacts.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70881.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Dötsch</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04cvxnb49</institution-id><institution>Goethe University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Dötsch</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04cvxnb49</institution-id><institution>Goethe University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A light-gated transcriptional recorder for detecting cell-cell contacts&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Volker Dötsch as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #2, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Philip Cole as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is no quantification of the detection of neuron-glioma cell interactions in Figure 4 as there is for the other experiments.</p><p>2) The authors note that about 80% of cells in contact light up above background, and that some cells not in contact also light up. But &quot;above background&quot; is not defined, nor is what they mean by &quot;some&quot; cells.

There are no real biological applications of the tool presented here.</p></disp-quote><p>While we report from our HEK293T trans assay specificity and sensitivity values of about 80% each, there are other technical factors in the assay that may affect these numbers. For example, sensitivity may be impacted because the assay is conducted using transient transfection, and for a receiver cell to show TRACC activation, it needs to be simultaneously transfected with 3 separate receiver components (GPCR, arrestin-TEVp, reporter); cells that lack one or more components will decrease sensitivity calculations. In regards to specificity, it is possible that background activation may occur in cells expressing the arrestinTEVp at particularly high levels, which can result in GPCR activation-independent release of the transcription factor. We have also shown previously with SPARK (Kim et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2017) that the use of stable cells with more controlled expression of similar components can improve specificity; indeed when we test our DIPG cell lines stably expressing TRACC constructs via transposons, we observe minimal activation in control conditions (Figure 4A, 4C, and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B). Furthermore, potential dislodging of sender cells during the course of the experiment or during the washing steps in immunostaining can also contribute to the number of (apparent) false positives observed.</p><p>Regarding the value and importance of light gating, we show in Figure 1C that omission of the LOV domain results in a drastic increase in background, resulting in little to no ligand-dependent activation. We therefore believe that the light gating is directly responsible for the high SNR of TRACC. It is true that the requirement for light delivery can be limiting for applications in opaque tissue or non-transparent animals where surgical implantation of an optical fiber is not possible.</p><p>We show that TRACC can be used successfully to detect cell-cell contacts in both neuron-HEK293T and neuron-glioma co-cultures. We envision that with additional validation of these constructs in vivo, it would be very feasible to use TRACC to detect cellular contacts in mammalian in vivo models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Cho et al., describe the adaption of their previously developed methods SPARK and SPARK2 that detect protein-protein contacts to the detection of cell-cell contacts.
