components, distorting the liver architecture. Since limited antifibrotics are available, pharmacological intervention targeting activated HSCs may be considered for therapy. A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12) is a scaffolding protein that directs protein kinases A/C (PKA/PKC) and cyclins to specific locations spatiotemporally controlling their biological effects. It has been shown that AKAP12’s scaffolding functions are altered by phosphorylation. In previously published work, observed an association between AKAP12 phosphorylation and HSC activation. In this work, we demonstrate that AKAP12’s scaffolding activity toward the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident collagen chaperone, heat-shock protein 47 (HSP47) is strongly inhibited by AKAP12’s site-specific phosphorylation in activated HSCs. CRISPR-directed gene editing of AKAP12’s phospho-sites restores its scaffolding toward HSP47, inhibiting HSP47’s collagen maturation functions, and HSC activation. AKAP12 phospho-editing dramatically inhibits fibrosis, ER stress response, HSC inflammatory signaling, and liver injury in mice. Our overall findings suggest a pro-fibrogenic role of AKAP12 phosphorylation that may be targeted for therapeutic intervention in liver fibrosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>A-kinase anchor protein</kwd><kwd>liver fibrosis</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>scaffolding protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21ES030534-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramani</surname><given-names>Komal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1 R21AA027352-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomasi</surname><given-names>Maria Lauda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Site-specific phosphorylation of the A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12) in hepatic stellate cells modulates its scaffolding function and promotes liver fibrosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) constitute approximately 5–8% of the normal liver and are major sites for vitamin A storage in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Friedman, 2008</xref>). During chronic liver injury, HSCs acquire a pro-fibrogenic phenotype or activated state that is critical in the liver’s response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hernández-Gea et al., 2013</xref>). HSC activation causes increased production of extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as collagens and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Persistent injury leads to fibrosis due to abnormal accumulation of ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2008</xref>). HSC pathways that cause fibrogenic responses in the liver can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.</p><p>Collagen maturation and secretion are facilitated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident chaperone, heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) along with other ER foldases such as BIP/GRP78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawasaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>). Under normal physiological conditions, HSP47 is expressed at low levels in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2005</xref>) and other organs such as lung, heart, and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khalil et al., 2019</xref>). Fibrogenic stimulation by carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) or bile duct ligation (BDL) in mice and human liver fibrosis is associated with induction of HSP47 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van de Bovenkamp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xia et al., 2006</xref>). The induction in HSP47 correlates with increased collagen secretion from activated HSCs during liver fibrosis. Therefore, silencing HSP47 to inhibit collagen production is an appealing option for reversing fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). However, because HSP47 also plays a chaperoning function in the healthy liver and other organs, the collateral effects of its therapeutic silencing should be investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). Apart from its function as a collagen chaperone, a recent interactome study identified HSP47 as a binding partner for an unfolded protein response (UPR) sensor protein, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>). HSP47 activates IRE1α oligomerization and phosphorylation by displacing its regulator, BIP, thereby triggering the UPR response during ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>). Whether triggering of UPR signaling by HSP47-IRE1α interaction and BIP displacement in HSCs may enhance the folding of pro-fibrogenic proteins such as collagen is unclear so far. But it is generally accepted that HSCs exhibit ER stress and UPR signaling in response to liver injury stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maiers and Malhi, 2019</xref>).</p><p>A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12) is a ubiquitously expressed member of the AKAP family that exhibits scaffolding activity toward signaling molecules including protein kinases (PKA and PKC), β2-adrenergic receptor, cyclins-(cyclin-D1, CCND1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gelman, 2002</xref>), and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canton et al., 2012</xref>). By virtue of its scaffolding function, AKAP12 spatiotemporally controls cellular signaling by guiding its binding partners to their physiological substrates or specific functional locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tröger et al., 2012</xref>). These activities regulate growth, cytoskeletal remodeling, and adrenergic signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gelman, 2002</xref>). AKAP12-mediated scaffolding of PKC attenuates PKC activation and suppress oncogenic proliferation, invasiveness, chemotaxis, and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akakura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akakura and Gelman, 2012</xref>). PKCα, δ, and ε isoforms interact with AKAP12, however only PKCα and δ activity is induced in the absence of AKAP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Su et al., 2010</xref>). AKAP12 sequestration of CCND1 in the cytoplasm prevents its nuclear translocation and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2000</xref>). AKAP12 sequestering of CCND1 and inhibition of CCND1 activity have been reported in parietal glomerular epithelial cells and in fibrosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burnworth et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It has been demonstrated that the scaffolding ability of AKAP12 is altered by its phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xia and Gelman, 2002</xref>). Prephosphorylation of AKAP12 by PKC suppresses its interaction with PKC itself and increases PKC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gelman, 2010</xref>). Phosphorylation of AKAP12 at a PKC phosphorylation site (S507/515) prevents the sequestration of CCND1 by AKAP12 leading to its nuclear translocation, allowing cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burnworth et al., 2012</xref>). AKAP12 phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) at a threonine residue (T766) enhances the recruitment of the polo-like kinase (PLK1) in human glioblastomas to ensure efficient mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canton et al., 2012</xref>). Even though phosphorylation is known to regulate AKAP12’s scaffolding activities, the functional impact of its phospho-modifications on liver disease has not been evaluated. We previously demonstrated that HSC activation during liver injury was associated with an induction in phospho-AKAP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramani et al., 2018</xref>). In this work, we demonstrate that specific AKAP12 phosphorylation events in HSCs regulate its scaffolding activity toward the collagen chaperone, HSP47. HSC-specific CRISPR-editing of AKAP12’s phospho-sites preserves the AKAP12-HSP47 scaffold, reduces HSP47’s collagen-chaperoning activity, dramatically lowering overall collagen content and liver injury during carbon-tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-induced liver fibrosis. AKAP12 phospho-modulation directed toward HSCs regulates HSP47-IRE1α interaction, thereby controlling UPR signaling in HSCs. Furthermore, AKAP12 phospho-site modulation in HSCs suppresses overall ER stress in the fibrotic liver. Our data support a previously unidentified function of AKAP12 and its phospho-modification in regulating the outcome of liver fibrosis in animal models.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression, phosphorylation, and scaffolding activity of AKAP12 is altered in CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated mouse liver and human liver fibrosis</title><p>The expression of AKAP12 protein was decreased in livers of CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated mice by 13% compared to oil controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel) without a change in <italic>Akap12</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel).

This was associated with a 40% decrease in α-SMA levels, demonstrating that AKAP12 phospho-site editing inhibited HSC activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The overall level of HSP47 decreased by 25% whereas the level of AKAP12 protein remained unchanged after HDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Deletion of phospho-sites in mouse HSCs resulted in a 422-bp deletion-specific amplicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). Like human HSCs, mouse HSCs also exhibited increased AKAP12-HSP47 interaction after AKAP12 phospho-site editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata2">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 2</xref>). Reversal of HSC activation by AKAP12 editing was determined by examining vitamin A auto fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Senoo et al., 2010</xref>). Cultured human HSCs at Day 0 exhibited strong vitamin A autofluorescence that was reduced in Day 5 activated HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, three independent experiments are shown). AKAP12 editing in Day 5 HSCs restored the loss of vitamin A fluorescence compared to Day 5 HSCs or Day 5 HSCs+SaCas9 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). HSP47 is an ER-resident chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawasaki et al., 2015</xref>). A weak PLA signal of AKAP12-HSP47 interaction co-localized with the ER marker, calreticulin in activated (WT) HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, left panel). However, upon CRISPR-editing (HDR), a strong AKAP12-HSP47 PLA signal co-localized with calreticulin in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, left panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). We examined whether HSP47’s collagen-chaperoning activity was regulated by AKAP12 phospho-site editing. Our results show that the collagen-HSP47 PLA signal strongly co-localized in the ER of activated HSCs (WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, right panel). CRISPR-editing of AKAP12 (HDR) reduced the collagen-HSP47 interaction significantly by 65% compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>).

S676/S678 sites were also PKCα sites but shared consensus sites with calmodulin kinase (CAMK). The overall confidence of prediction for the S676/S678 sites was less than that of S687/S688 sites. In vitro kinase assay followed by phostag gel analysis revealed that phosphorylation of AKAP12 was significantly enhanced in the presence of active PKCα enzyme compared to kinase negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Mutations of AKAP12 S676/S678 to alanine modestly reduced the phosphorylation of biotinylated recombinant AKAP12 whereas S687A/S688A mutation dramatically suppressed the phostag shift of AKAP12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The mutation seemed to completely inhibit the phospho-band. Since other phosphorylation events could also cause the shift, we repeated the experiment to see whether this complete suppression was reproducible. In an additional experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), we observed that the S687/S688A mutation suppressed but did not always wipe out the phospho-shift.

A PDEL donor was used to delete the AKAP12 phospho-sites whereas each S or T phospho-site was mutated to A using a PMUT donor. Two unique sgRNAs specific for the region around the phospho-sites along with the donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, Key resource table) were cloned into AAV vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left panel). To perform CRISPR editing in HSCs of mouse liver, the SaCas9 enzyme was cloned into AAV vector under control of two different HSC-specific promoters (Glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP or Lecithin retinol acyltransferase, LRAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Puche et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2020</xref>).

Oil+EV or CCl<sub>4</sub>+EV HSCs or hepatocytes gave a 298-bp amplicon in this multiplex PCR.

Proteomics analysis revealed alterations in several proteins in CCl<sub>4</sub> HSCs as well as total liver that were regulated by AKAP12 HSC-specific phospho-editing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of these proteins identified two top scoring pathways, the ER stress response and UPR, that were significantly dysregulated by CCl<sub>4</sub> and were normalized upon AKAP12 phospho-editing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The proteomics analysis of HSCs showed an induction in BIP/GRP78, an ER stress sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>), in CCL<sub>4</sub>-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We confirmed the proteomics by western blotting. GAPDH-normalized densitometries from individual experiments are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. HSCs isolated from CCl<sub>4</sub> livers showed increased BIP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, even though the proteomics analysis showed inhibition of CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced BIP levels by AKAP12 phospho-editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), we could not confirm this effect by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Since BIP is a known collagen chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>), we examined its interaction with collagen in our CRISPR model. BIP exhibited increased interaction with collagen in the CCl<sub>4</sub>+EV HSCs compared to oil+EV HSCs and AKAP12 phospho-editing strongly inhibited the BIP-collagen interaction in HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). IRE1α, a UPR component that binds to HSP47 and becomes phosphorylated during ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>), exhibited increased interaction with HSP47 in CCL<sub>4</sub> HSCs that was inhibited by AKAP12 phospho-editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The IRE1α-HSP47 interaction was further confirmed in desmin-positive HSCs of the CRISPR model by PLA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). CCl<sub>4</sub>-mediated IRE1α phospho-activation (S724 phosphorylation) was strongly inhibited by AKAP12 phospho-editing without a change in total IRE1α levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Furthermore, two pathways, P38MAPK and SMAD2/3 that are known to be induced in HSCs through IRE1α activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Galarreta et al., 2016</xref>) were also suppressed by AKAP12 phospho-editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The proteome of CCl<sub>4</sub>-exposed livers exhibited increased ER stress and UPR signaling components that were modulated by AKAP12 HSC-specific phospho-editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). BIP levels by western blotting were induced in CCl<sub>4</sub> livers and inhibited by AKAP12 phospho-editing, confirming the proteomics result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Like the proteomics data, we did not find any change in total IRE1α expression. However, phospho-activated IRE1α was suppressed by AKAP12 phospho-editing in total liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Since ER stress induces inflammatory signals in different systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maiers and Malhi, 2019</xref>), we examined whether the HSCs from our CRISPR mouse model exhibited altered inflammatory signaling upon AKAP12 phospho-modulation. Out of the known HSC cytokines, we found the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-17, IL-6, and IL-β to be strongly induced in CCl<sub>4</sub>-HSCs whereas AKAP12-phospho-edited HSCs suppressed their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). On the other hand, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 was suppressed in HSCs by CCl<sub>4</sub> administration, and its expression was restored by AKAP12 phospho-editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). To examine whether ER stress modulation within activated HSCs was transmitted to other liver cell types, we evaluated crosstalk between HSCs and hepatocytes in a co-culture system where AKAP12 was CRISPR-edited. Co-culture with activated HSCs induced the ER stress response markers BIP and induced IRE1α phosphorylation in hepatocytes compared to co-culture with quiescent HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Co-culture with activated HSCs in which AKAP12 was phospho-edited (CR) reduced the ER stress signal in hepatocytes compared to activated HSCs alone whereas hepatocytes co-cultured with quiescent HSCs with CR did not exhibit any alteration in ER stress markers compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

AKAP12 interacts with HSP47 in the ER of normal HSCs and negatively regulates HSP47’s collagen-chaperoning activity and its ability to promote ER stress-directed IRE1α branch of UPR signaling. AKAP12 negatively regulates HSC activation. Pro-fibrogenic stimuli that cause HSC activation allow AKAP12’s PKCα-dependent site-specific phosphorylation. By AKAP12 CRISPR phospho-editing, we show that AKAP12 phosphorylation inhibits AKAP12’s HSP47 scaffolding activity, increases HSP47-collagen chaperoning activity and induces HSP47’s interaction with UPR signals (IRE1α and P-IRE1α). AKAP12 phosphorylation may lead to increased downstream events associated with the UPR signaling such as BIP-collagen chaperoning, phosphorylation of SMADs/P38MAPK and UPR-regulated inflammatory signaling. Blocking AKAP12 phosphorylation in activated HSCs prevents the ER stress response in hepatocytes co-cultured with activated HSCs.

By mapping the phosphorylation events that are altered upon activation of human or mouse HSCs, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of specific S or T residues of AKAP12 is triggered during HSC activation. Hence, we named these sites as activation-responsive phospho-sites. Out of the five activation-responsive phospho-sites, four serine residues were confirmed as PKCα substrates. Mutagenesis analysis on recombinant AKAP12 showed that the S687 and S688 were stronger PKCα substrates compared to S676 and S678 because their mutations drastically suppressed phosphorylation. We further observed that phosphorylation of AKAP12 by PKCα suppressed direct binding between AKAP12 and HSP47. Confirming this recombinant data, we observed that silencing <italic>PKCα</italic> in HSCs induced the binding between AKAP12 and HSP47. The data suggest that PKCα is involved in promoting AKAP12’s scaffolding activity toward HSP47. AKAP12’s known scaffolding activities toward CCND1, PLK1, and PKCα that were identified previously are regulated by its phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akakura and Gelman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burnworth et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore evaluated the role of site-specific phosphorylation in modulating AKAP12’s scaffolding functions in HSCs.</p><p>Using a CRISPR-based gene editing approach, we deleted AKAP12’s phosphorylation sites in culture-activated human or mouse HSCs and observed an enhancement in AKAP12’s interaction with HSP47, a strong inhibition of HSC activation (judged by α-SMA levels) and restoration of the quiescent marker, vitamin A that is suppressed in activated HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Senoo et al., 2010</xref>). HSP47 resides in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawasaki et al., 2015</xref>) and since AKAP12 interacted with HSP47, we evaluated whether it co-localized with HSP47 in the ER and whether the AKAP12-HSP47 scaffold in the ER was affected by CRISPR-editing its phosphorylation sites. The AKAP12-HSP47 scaffold was induced in the ER upon AKAP12 phospho-editing. HSP47’s chaperoning activity toward collagen is highly induced during HSC activation and this allows increased maturation and secretion of collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawasaki et al., 2015</xref>). Since AKAP12 binds to HSP47, we examined whether this interaction regulated HSP47’s collagen chaperoning function. The ER of activated HSCs stained strongly for the collagen-HSP47 scaffold but AKAP12 phospho-site editing diminished the collagen scaffolding activity of HSP47. Our findings suggest that lack of AKAP12 activation-responsive phosphorylation quenches HSP47’s collagen chaperoning activity and prevents HSC activation.</p><p>HSC activation is a hallmark of liver fibrosis. The fact that enhanced phosphorylation of AKAP12 at its activation-responsive phospho-sites promotes HSC activation fueled our hypothesis that site-specific AKAP12 phosphorylation may be involved in promoting liver fibrosis in animal models. To address this hypothesis, we designed CRISPR-AAV vectors to perform gene editing of AKAP12’s activation-responsive phospho-sites specifically in HSCs of mouse liver. This was achieved by expressing the CRISPR-causing enzyme, SaCas9 under control of the HSC-specific promoters, GFAP or LRAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Puche et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Both GFAP and LRAT specifically expressed SaCas9 in HSCs, but GFAP-driven SaCas9 was increased in activated HSCs compared to normal HSCs whereas the reverse was observed with LRAT-Cas9. GFAP promoter activity is induced during HSC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maubach et al., 2006</xref>) whereas LRAT expression is known to be suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khomich et al., 2019</xref>). This might have been responsible for the different effects of these two promoters. The AAV particles of serotype 6 were used because AAV6 efficiently transduces activated HSCs in the CCl<sub>4</sub> mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakano et al., 2020</xref>). HSC-specific gene editing of AKAP12 was performed by deleting the DNA region corresponding to the five phospho-sites (PDEL). AKAP12 phospho-site editing by this PDEL mechanism strongly inhibited HSC activation, enhanced the AKAP12-HSP47 scaffold, and suppressed the collagen-chaperoning activity of HSP47 leading to decreased collagen production in the liver. To confirm the involvement of AKAP12 phosphorylation at these residues in promoting pro-fibrogenic phenotype, we inhibited phosphorylation at these sites by CRISPR-mediated editing of the S/T residues to A (PMUT). The overall editing efficiency caused by PMUT was lower than that of PDEL in activated HSCs from CCl<sub>4</sub>-exposed livers. PMUT suppressed but did not completely normalize ALT levels and hydroxyproline content compared to PDEL. Despite these differences, PMUT was effective in suppressing the fibrogenic response in the liver, supporting an important role of AKAP12 phosphorylation in regulating the outcome of liver fibrosis. As opposed to fibrotic livers, CRISPR editing in HSCs of normal liver did not alter the molecular identity of the liver. Since normal HSCs do not exhibit phosphorylation of AKAP12 at the activation-responsive phospho-sites, they appear to be unaffected by modulating these sites. This control data reiterates the fact that increased AKAP12 phosphorylation caused by HSC activation has pro-fibrogenic effects.</p><p>Apart from suppression of fibrotic parameters, we observed that AKAP12 phospho-modulation in HSCs inhibited collagen mRNA levels and globally suppressed liver injury. Since inhibition of collagen transcription and overall liver injury may not be due to AKAP12’s ability to regulate HSP47’s collagen-chaperoning activity, we searched for additional mechanisms of action of phospho-AKAP12. We performed proteomics analysis in HSCs from our CRISPR model and total liver from the same to identify molecular signals altered by AKAP12 phospho-editing. In HSCs, we identified BIP/GRP78, a regulator of the IRE1α branch of UPR signaling and a known collagen chaperone in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferreira et al., 1994</xref>). Interestingly, a recent interactome study identified HSP47 as a binding partner for IRE1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>). IRE1α is an ER transmembrane kinase that is kept in inactive state by its binding to BIP. HSP47 activates IRE1α oligomerization and phosphorylation by displacing BIP and triggering the UPR response during ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>). The functional effect of the HSP47-IRE1α interaction on UPR signaling and collagen folding during fibrogenic stimulation in HSCs is undescribed so far. But IRE1α activation caused by ER stress inducers in HSCs is known to enhance collagen transcription as well as collagen protein expression through activation of p38MAPK and SMAD pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Galarreta et al., 2016</xref>). HSCs exhibit ER stress and UPR signaling in response to liver injury stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maiers and Malhi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mannaerts et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, ER stress appears to be both a cause and effect of HSC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maiers and Malhi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koo et al., 2016</xref>). Since phospho-edited AKAP12 interacted with HSP47 in the ER of HSCs, we wondered whether HSP47-mediated UPR signaling might be regulated by AKAP12. We found that IRE1α-HSP47 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>) was enhanced in CCl<sub>4</sub> HSCs and so were downstream pathways known to be enhanced by IRE1α activation in HSCs (phospho-P38MAPK and SMAD2/3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Galarreta et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly AKAP12 phospho-editing suppressed HSP47’s UPR-activating function by quenching the CCl<sub>4</sub>-mediated IRE1α-HSP47 interaction in HSCs that further inhibited IRE1α phospho-activation preventing downstream P38MAPK and SMAD signaling in these cells. Another component of the UPR signaling we found from proteomics was BIP. BIP is a collagen chaperone that also inactivates IRE1α under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>). During ER stress, HSP47 displaces BIP from IRE1α, activating IRE1α-mediated UPR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>). Whether this HSP47-mediated BIP displacement promotes BIP’s activity as a collagen chaperone during HSC activation or liver fibrosis is unclear so far. We hypothesized that AKAP12 by virtue of its increased phosphorylation and lack of scaffolding toward HSP47 may regulate the BIP-IRE1α-HSP47 axis and promote BIP’s collagen chaperoning function. Indeed, we observed increased interaction of BIP with collagen in HSCs of CCL<sub>4</sub> livers that was suppressed by AKAP12 phospho-editing. We could not find any interaction between AKAP12 and BIP in HSCs but speculate that loss of AKAP12-HSP47 scaffolding leading to increased HSP47-IRE1α interaction might have released BIP from the IRE1α sites and favored BIP-collagen scaffolding.</p><p>Enhanced protein secretion is associated with ER stress and UPR signaling in activated HSCs and is crucial for processing of inflammatory proteins and ECM components upon pro-fibrogenic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maiers and Malhi, 2019</xref>). Studies in liver and other systems support the role of ER stress in promoting inflammatory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasnain et al., 2012</xref>). Also, inflammatory proteins have a less well-described role in promoting ER stress and UPR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasnain et al., 2012</xref>). ER stress is therefore both a cause and consequence of inflammatory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasnain et al., 2012</xref>). Cytokines such as IL-1β are known to be induced in activated HSCs through ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2018</xref>). Other cytokines known to be expressed by HSCs, IL-17 and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salguero Palacios et al., 2008</xref>), are prone to modulation by ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez et al., 2019</xref>). The anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic cytokine, IL-10 expressed by HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hung et al., 2005</xref>) was recently shown as a target of ER stress in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hansen et al., 2019</xref>). IL-6 and IL-1β are mediators of ER stress in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duvigneau et al., 2019</xref>). In pancreatic beta cells, IL-1β is known to induce ER stress in a nitric oxide-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kacheva et al., 2011</xref>). The anti-inflammatory effect of IL-10 has been shown to block ER stress in intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shkoda et al., 2007</xref>). Since our data on AKAP12 suggests that it regulates ER stress pathways in HSCs, we tested whether known inflammatory signals linked to ER stress were also regulated by AKAP12. We found the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-17, Il-1β, and Il-6 to be induced in CCl<sub>4</sub>-HSCs whereas AKAP12-phospho-edited HSCs exhibited a strong suppression of these cytokines. On the other hand, the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 was suppressed in HSCs by CCl<sub>4</sub> administration, and its expression was restored by AKAP12 phospho-editing. Literature suggests that inflammatory molecules and UPR signaling may contribute to increased collagen transcription during liver fibrosis. Pro-inflammatory IL-6 signaling induces collagen transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kagan et al., 2017</xref>) and loss of anti-inflammatory signals such as IL-10 inhibit it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). The IRE1α-directed UPR also induces collagen transcription through increased p38MAPK and SMAD2/3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Galarreta et al., 2016</xref>). Since AKAP12 phospho-editing suppressed IRE1α-directed UPR signaling through its association with HSP47 and regulated ER stress-linked cytokines expressed in HSCs, these factors may have contributed to the overall drop in collagen mRNA levels.</p><p>Since ER stress/UPR signaling plays a role in enhancing liver injury and the ER stress inducer, tunicamycin is known to induce ALT/AST levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2016</xref>), we examined whether AKAP12 HSC-specific editing regulated the liver ER stress response. We found dysregulation of ER stress and UPR-associated components in total liver of CCl<sub>4</sub> mice (BIP and other ER foldases such as protein disulfide isomerases, PDIA1, and PDIA6) that were regulated by HSC-specific AKAP12 phospho-editing. Induction of BIP expression in the liver was normalized by AKAP12 phospho-editing. Although the total IRE1α levels were unchanged by CCl<sub>4</sub>, IRE1α phospho-activation was inhibited by AKAP12 HSC-specific phospho-editing. These results suggest that controlling the ER stress response/UPR signaling within HSCs during pro-fibrogenic stimulation also modulates the same in the whole liver. The phenomenon of ER stress being communicated from stressed cells to other cells within a tissue has been reviewed in the context of cells that produce large amounts of proteins such as immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garg et al., 2012</xref>). It has also been published that ER stress invokes liver fibrosis primarily due to ER stress within HSCs due to their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koo et al., 2016</xref>). Since hepatocytes are known to be sensitive to CCl<sub>4</sub>-mediated ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Üstüner et al., 2021</xref>), we examined whether crosstalk between activated HSCs and hepatocytes in a co-culture system promoted the ER stress response in hepatocytes and whether AKAP12 regulated this crosstalk. Modulating HSC activation through AKAP12 regulated the ER stress response in hepatocytes in culture. Since we observed regulation of ER stress-linked inflammatory cytokine production from HSCs of AKAP12 CRISPR edited livers, we speculate that inflammatory cytokines from HSCs might transmit ER stress to the whole liver and AKAP12 provides a mode to control these effects during fibrogenesis. The overall findings are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we have identified AKAP12 as a scaffolding partner of HSP47 in normal HSCs that controls HSP47’s collagen chaperoning activity and its interaction with UPR signals in HSCs. Site-specific phosphorylation of AKAP12 occurs during HSC activation and this modification inhibits its interaction with HSP47. This induces HSP47’s collagen chaperoning activity, collagen production, and HSP47’s interaction with UPR signaling proteins upon pro-fibrogenic stimulation. Blocking AKAP12 phospho-modification inhibits HSC activation, collagen production, fibrosis as well as overall liver injury possibly via modulation of the ER stress response and inhibition of ER stress-linked inflammatory signals. The next step in this analysis would be to perform structural studies to identify how AKAP12’s activation-responsive phospho-sites interact with HSP47 and the kinase, PKCα. This will further facilitate the design of small molecules to block AKAP12-PKCα interaction at these sites, thereby preventing phosphorylation and promoting AKAP12-HSP47 scaffolding. Since AKAP12 phospho-modification is not evident in normal HSCs but is induced upon pro-fibrogenic stimulation, AKAP12 phosphorylation may be utilized as a druggable target in liver fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Mouse HSCs or hepatocytes were isolated from 3 to 4 months old C57BL/6 mice according to our previously established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramani et al., 2018</xref>). Mouse HSCs were culture-activated on plastic dishes like human HSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Phospho-peptide mapping</title><p>AKAP12 was immunoprecipitated from HSCs or hepatocytes using an AKAP12 antibody-conjugated protein A/G column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The AKAP12 beads were submitted to Applied Biomics, CA for phospho-peptide mapping. Tryptic peptides were enriched for phospho-peptides and processed for detection of a phospho-site by mass spectrometry. Phosphorylated residues were confirmed by mass spectrometry peak showing the neutral loss of phosphate that was detected from peak shifts on MS/MS spectrum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata1">Table 1—source data 1</xref>). The observed mass of a phospho-peptide was reduced by 98 Da if a single serine/threonine showed a neutral loss of phosphate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>CRISPR gene editing in cultured HSCs</title><p>CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing at the AKAP12 gene locus (exon 3) to delete the region of its activation-responsive phospho-sites was performed by HDR. A 22-bp small guide RNA sequence (sgRNA) upstream of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM- 5′-GTGGAT-3′) recognized by saCas9 (PAM consensus-NNGRRT where N=any nucleotide, R=A or G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2018</xref>), was designed and synthesized using the Edit-R CRISPR system (Horizon Discovery, CO) (human guide sequence, Key resource table). The CRISPR design tool was used to determine the sgRNA whose sequence is unique compared to the rest of the genome to avoid off-target effects. A donor RNA to delete the phospho-region was designed and synthesized using the Edit-R HDR donor designer system (Horizon) (human PDEL HDR donor, Key resource table). The sgRNA was stabilized by 2′-O-methyl nucleotides and phosphorothioate linkages in the backbone on both the 5′ and 3′ ends and the HDR donor was stabilized by phosphorothioate linkages on both ends to improve functionality during transfection. Cultured cells were co-transfected with a commercially available plasmid, AAV6-GFAP-saCas9, containing the SaCas9 gene under control of the GFAP promoter (Vector Biolabs, PA), sgRNA and HDR donor RNA using the DharmaFECT Duo Transfection Reagent that allows co-transfection of RNA and DNA (Horizon). Cells with transfection reagent alone or SaCas9 plasmid alone +transfection reagent were used as controls. CRISPR designs for mouse HSCs were performed as above for human with mouse guide sequence #1 and mouse PDEL HDR donor (Key resource table). After 48–72 hr of transfection, genomic DNA from human or mouse HSCs was amplified by multiplex PCR using two primers to amplify the region around the deletion site and a third deletion-specific primer to detect HDR-mediated gene editing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Gene silencing in activated HSCs</title><p>Activated human HSCs (0.3 million cells per well of six-well plate) were reverse transfected with a universal negative control (Cat #4404021), <italic>Prkca</italic> (Cat #s11092), or <italic>Prkca</italic> B (Cat #s11094) silencerselect siRNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, IL) using the lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent as we described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramani et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Carbon-tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) injection in mice</title><p>About 12-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were injected intraperitoneally with CCl<sub>4</sub> (HPLC grade, Cat #270652, Sigma-Aldrich, diluted 1:3 in mineral oil) or mineral oil (control) at 1 µl/gram body weight bi-weekly for 5 weeks. All procedures for the care and use of mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>CRISPR gene editing in mice</title><p>HDR-based gene editing in control or CCl<sub>4</sub> mice was performed according to the scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>. Two 22-bp sgRNA sequences upstream of a saCas9 PAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2018</xref>), were designed using the Edit-R CRISPR system (Horizon Discovery). Off-target analysis for the two sgRNA was performed using the algorithm from the Benchling (Biology Software-(2022) retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://benchling.com">https://benchling.com</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). The two sgRNA sequences were cloned into a single AAV6 vector under the control of a U6 promoter by the cloning service available from Vector builder Inc, IL. An AAV6 vector containing a non-targeting sgRNA was used as an EV control. The sequence corresponding to a PDEL or PMUT donor with 500 bp flanking either side of the target region was cloned into a separate AAV6 vector. The PAM sequence in these donors was mutated to prevent re-cleavage by SaCas9 after HDR. The AAV6-GFAP-SaCas9 vector (Vector Biolabs) was used for HSC-specific gene editing. In addition, another AAV6-LRAT-SaCas9 vector was prepared by cloning the mouse LRAT promoter (Accession ID: NM_023624) upstream of SaCas9 (Vector Builder). AAV6 particles of the sgRNA construct, EV construct, PDEL/PMUT donors, and GFAP/LRAT-SaCas9 were purified using Vector builder’s AAV production service. For each viral vector, titer was determined by real-time PCR using primers specific for the AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). A titer of 1–2×10<sup>13</sup> genome copies (GCs)/ml was achieved for each AAV. All vectors tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. EV or sgRNA vectors along with PDEL or PMUT donors and GFAP or LRAT SaCas9, were injected into tail vein of mice at 10<sup>11</sup> GC/vector in a volume of 100 µl phosphate-buffered saline. Viral vectors were injected into oil or CCl<sub>4</sub> mice during the second and fourth week of oil or CCl<sub>4</sub> administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The HSC specificity of CRISPR was determined by SaCas9 immunofluorescence as described under the Immunostaining section. The efficiency of CRISPR editing in HSCs and hepatocytes of gene-edited livers was evaluated by NGS. A 298-bp PCR product was amplified from genomic DNA using primers that recognized regions upstream and downstream of the site of AKAP12 deletion or mutation. Amplicons were purified from gels and submitted to Azenta Life Sciences Inc, CA. for performing NGS. Briefly, Illumina adaptor sequences (FW: 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT</named-content>-3′, REV: 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGA </named-content>TCT-3′) were added to the amplicons and sequenced by Azenta Illumina platform sequencers. The WT and mutant or deletion mutant reads were counted from each sample and the efficiency of editing was the percentage of edited reads (PDEL or PMUT) versus the total reads. Frequencies of on-target and off-target base changes were analyzed by comparing the target reads to reference reads corresponding to the WT Akap12 amplicon between the two sgRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Within this region, any mismatches other than PDEL or PMUT were considered as off-targets. The mismatches to the reference were observed mainly outside the target region at a frequency of 5% or less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Human tissue array</title><p>The human tissue array (Cat #XLiv086-01) in the form of paraffin-embedded tissues was purchased from the human tissue biorepository, US Biolabs Inc, MD.

Biotinylated AKAP12 or its mutants (5 µl) were used as a substrate for PKCα in a 25-µl in vitro kinase reaction using 100 ng of active recombinant PKCα enzyme (MilliporeSigma, MA), 5 µl of a lipid activator (MilliporeSigma; 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mM β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM CaCl2), 3 µl of Mg<sup>2+/</sup>ATP cocktail (MilliporeSigma, 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 75 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 mM ATP) and 2.5 µl of 20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.6. The reaction was carried out at 30°C for 2 hr. The kinase reaction was run on a zinc phostag gel containing 15 µM phostag gel (Fujifilm Wako Chemicals, VA) to separate phosphorylated form of AKAP12 from its unphosphorylated counterparts as we described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramani et al., 2015</xref>). Membranes were probed with streptavidin-HRP (Key resource table) to detect biotinylated AKAP12. Biotin antibody was conjugated to protein A/G plus agarose columns using a coupling buffer according to the crosslink immunoprecipitation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by binding of recombinant biotinylated AKAP12. The columns were treated with recombinant HSP47 protein in the absence or presence of active PKCα enzyme. Bound proteins were eluted from the washed column using elution buffer from the crosslinking immunoprecipitation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and run on gels along with biotinylated AKAP12 as input and antibody-bound protein A/G beads as IgG controls. Blots were incubated with HSP47 antibody followed by Clean-blot IP detection. Reverse IP was done by following the same protocol using HSP47 antibody columns treated with biotinylated AKAP12 followed by detection with streptavidin-HRP. Recombinant HSP47 input was purchased from Prospec protein specialists, NJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Duolink PLA and immunostaining procedures</title><p>For immunocytochemical procedures, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with Triton-X 100 before antibody staining. For immunohistochemical analysis, tissues were de-paraffinized and antigen retrieval was performed using the citrate-based antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, CA). For phospho-detection using PLA, primary AKAP12 or phospho-serine (PSer) antibodies (see Key resource table) were directly conjugated to PLA minus or plus complementary oligonucleotide arms (PLA minus, Catalog no. DUO92010; PLA plus, Catalog no. DUO92009, MilliporeSigma) according to our previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramani et al., 2018</xref>). To examine protein-protein interactions in cells or tissues, samples were incubated with the antibodies for the interacting targets at 4°C overnight (AKAP12-HSP47, HSP47-collagen). After washing the unbound antibodies, samples were further incubated overnight with secondary antibodies (rabbit or mouse) that were bound to PLA plus or minus complementary probes (MilliporeSigma, Key resource table). The PLA probes were ligated when the proteins were in proximity due to their interaction giving a fluorescent signal as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramani et al., 2018</xref>). To evaluate the localization of interacting partners, co-immunostaining of the PLA signals was done with HSC (desmin) or subcellular compartment (calreticulin ER) marker antibodies. Marker antibodies were detected by Alexa fluor green rabbit or mouse secondary antibodies (Abcam, Key resource table). Co-localization of SaCas9 with desmin or albumin markers in liver tissue was detected by Alexa fluor secondary antibodies (see Key resource table). AKAP12 expression in tissues was detected using the mouse HRP/DAB detection immunohistochemistry kit (Cat #ab64264, Abcam).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Histopathological examination</title><p>Liver sections fixed with 10% neutral formalin were processed for paraffin embedding, sectioning, H&amp;E, and picrosirius red staining (collagen) using the services provided by the liver histology core of the University of Southern California research center for liver diseases (NIH grant P30 DK048522).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Hydroxyproline measurement</title><p>The hydroxyproline content of tissue was measured following the protocol from the hydroxyproline assay kit (Cell Biolabs Inc, CA). Briefly, 10 mg of liver tissue was homogenized, and acid hydrolysis was done with 12 N HCl. Hydrolyzed samples were treated with chloramine T to convert the hydroxyproline to a pyrrole. Ehrlich’s reagent or 4-(Dimethylamino) benzaldehyde added to the pyrrole reacted with it to produce a chromophore whose absorbance could be read at 540–560 nm. The content of hydroxyproline in the tissue sample was determined by comparison to a hydroxyproline standard from the kit that was processed like the unknown sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>ALT/AST measurement</title><p>ALT and AST levels from plasma of mice were measured with the ALT and AST colorimetric activity assay kits (Cayman Chemical, MI). ALT activity was measured by monitoring the rate of NADH oxidation in a coupled reaction using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The NADH to NAD+ oxidation caused a decrease in A340 nm absorbance. The rate of decrease (ΔA340/min) is directly proportional to the ALT activity. AST activity was measured by the rate of NADH oxidation in the presence of malate dehydrogenase. NADH to NAD+ conversion caused a decrease in A340 nm absorbance. LDH was added to the AST reaction to prevent interference from endogenous pyruvate in the plasma. The ΔA340/min for both ALT and AST were converted to units/L by dividing the ΔA340 values by the NADH extinction coefficient and multiplying by the sample dilution factor as per the protocol instructions (Cayman).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Proteomics analysis</title><p>Total protein from liver or HSCs was subjected to mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis by the services of Poochon proteomics solutions, MD. The Nanospray LC/MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides for each sample was performed sequentially with a blank run between each two sample runs using a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris 240 Mass Spectrometer and a Thermo Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System. Peptides from trypsin digestion were loaded onto a peptide trap cartridge at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The trapped peptides were eluted onto a reversed-phase Easy-Spray Column PepMap RSLC, C18, 2 μM, 100 A, 75 μm×250 mm (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (3–36%) in 0.1% formic acid. The elution duration was 110 min at a flow rate of 0.3 μl/min. Eluted peptides from the Easy-Spray column were ionized and sprayed into the mass spectrometer, using a Nano Easy-Spray Ion Source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under the following settings: spray voltage, 1.6 kV, Capillary temperature, 275°C. Other settings were empirically determined. Raw data files were searched against mouse protein sequences database using the Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) based on the SEQUEST algorithm. Carbamidomethylation (+57.021 Da) of cysteines was set as fixed modification, and Oxidation/+15.995 Da (M), and Deamidated/+0.984 Da (N, Q) were set as dynamic modifications. The minimum peptide length was specified to be five amino acids. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 15 ppm, whereas fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.05 Da. The maximum false peptide discovery rate was specified as 0.05. The resulting Proteome Discoverer Report contains all assembled proteins with peptides sequences and peptide spectrum match counts (PSM#). The PSM count is a measure of the abundance of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Western blotting data were quantified by densitometry of blots using the ImageJ software (NIH). PLA staining and immunofluorescence data were analyzed in a blinded manner by two individuals and quantified using ImageJ according to published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">López-Cano et al., 2019</xref>). Scatter bars showing individual experimental points and their means were plotted using GraphPad Prism 9.3.0, GraphPad software. Biologically independent replicates combined from at least three individual experiments were represented as mean ± standard error (mean ± SE). Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Student’s t-test for paired comparisons and one-way ANOVA (GraphPad Prism) for comparing differences between multiple groups. Significance was defined as p&lt;0.05. Tukey HSD post hoc test for each comparison is shown as source data.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Formal analysis</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

this important work, Ramani et al. provide solid evidence that AKAP12 enhances collagen production in a CCL4-induced mouse model of liver fibrosis, and they demonstrate that in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) AKAP12 is phosphorylated by PKCalpha, which, in turn, leads to increased scaffolding activity towards HSP47, a chaperone of collagen located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). AKAP12 activation also resulted in increased ER stress and the generation of inflammatory mediators, and targeting AKAP12 phosphorylation sites in HSCs resulted in suppression of collagen synthesis and ER stress and fibrotic response in the mice. The important findings of the study include the identification of a novel disease mechanism and an attractive drug target for liver fibrosis. The finding should, however, be cautiously interpreted as the role of AKAP12 in liver fibrosis has to be explored in other models of liver fibrosis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78430.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Mani</surname><given-names>Arya</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03v76x132</institution-id><institution>Yale University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Broichhagen</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/010s54n03</institution-id><institution>Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.15.484391">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.15.484391v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Johannes Broichhagen (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Revisions should include the following, in addition to a point-by-point response to the comments made by the 3 reviewers.</p><p>– Several protein blots, as outlined by reviewer 2, should be redone. Specifically replace Figure 1 A and B. Please specify if the difference in Akap12 expression shown in Figure 1A is significant.</p><p>– The number of mice for comparing CR-PMUT to CR-PDEL should be increased to at least 6 for both groups.</p><p>– Add scale bars to all immunofluorescence images.</p><p>– Figure 5B: Please show Sirius red as well as HandE.</p><p>– Transcript levels for collagen and a-SMA should be provided.</p><p>– Please provide a time course of AKAP12-HSP47 interaction during in vitro activation of HSC.</p><p>– Please follow our advice about statistical reporting.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As mentioned in the public statement, I only feel confident in recommending improvements from a technical side. Some issues need to be addressed in detail from my point of view.</p><p>– Revise Figure 7F to contain only information obtained in this study.</p><p>– Some blots seem saturated, which should be double-checked by authors. Especially since they perform quantitative analyses.</p><p>– Scale bars are missing in the microscopic images and should be added.</p><p>– I find it difficult to interpret significance descriptors, i.e. which data is compared to which in the plots. A clearer annotation using horizontal bars could be helpful. In a similar vein, is the difference in Akap12 expression significant in Figure 1A? Otherwise, it would help to label non-significant differences with &quot;n.s.&quot; or the like.</p><p>– The many tables in Figure 4G and in Figure 7 could be moved to the Supporting Information to help balance the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although the study is interesting and reports a novel mechanism for drug design to potentially target the process of liver fibrosis, several issues related to data presentation call for questions on the rigor of the study:</p><p>1. Figure 1A. Blots in figure 1A for AKAP12 and GAPDH are either modified (bands appear &quot;squished&quot; on the vertical axis in figure 1A when compared to the source data). Moreover, the appearance of the AKAP12 bands on the source data figure would suggest that the protein lysate was not separated for the appropriate amount of time as the bands look to not have entered the separating portion of the gel. In other words, the proteins appear to be &quot;stuck&quot; in the stacking part of the acrylamide gel. This western blot should be redone.</p><p>2.Figure 1B. Immunofluorescence is not of good quality (over-exposed) and merged panels are not the same exact field as the single staining. Also, contrary to what is expected from a PLA staining, i.e small fluorescent dots that denote interaction between two antigens/proteins of interest, figures show large &quot;blobs&quot; as positive interaction. Based on this, the conclusion that the images display AKAP12 phosphorylation does not seem accurate. Also, 200x merged figure is not aligned with the three channels displayed. A similar issue is present in additional images provided as source data. Is 400x from the same field?

However, following the reviewer’s advice, we have removed tables from revised figure 7 to help balance the figure. Instead, we have the raw data of each experiment represented as a graph in revised figure 7—figure supplement 1. In addition, we have post-hoc analysis source data for each of the sub-figures of figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Although the study is interesting and reports a novel mechanism for drug design to potentially target the process of liver fibrosis, several issues related to data presentation call for questions on the rigor of the study:</p><p>1. Figure 1A. Blots in figure 1A for AKAP12 and GAPDH are either modified (bands appear &quot;squished&quot; on the vertical axis in figure 1A when compared to the source data). Moreover, the appearance of the AKAP12 bands on the source data figure would suggest that the protein lysate was not separated for the appropriate amount of time as the bands look to not have entered the separating portion of the gel. In other words, the proteins appear to be &quot;stuck&quot; in the stacking part of the acrylamide gel. This western blot should be redone.</p></disp-quote><p>The western blots have been repeated and data is now presented in revised figure 1A. The statistical significance is indicated. Revised source data is presented in figure 1-source data 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.Figure 1B. Immunofluorescence is not of good quality (over-exposed) and merged panels are not the same exact field as the single staining. Also, contrary to what is expected from a PLA staining, i.e small fluorescent dots that denote interaction between two antigens/proteins of interest, figures show large &quot;blobs&quot; as positive interaction. Based on this, the conclusion that the images display AKAP12 phosphorylation does not seem accurate. Also, 200x merged figure is not aligned with the three channels displayed. A similar issue is present in additional images provided as source data. Is 400x from the same field? If so, please indicate the area on the merged figure from the 200x magnification that was used to produce the 400x images. Similarly, for AKAP12/HRP immunohistochemistry 400x and 200x are from different fields.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these errors. Usually, PLA staining for interaction gives small dots in cells and a mixture of small and medium dots when staining tissue. In this case we performed a PLA of AKAP12 with phospho-serine antibody to identify phospho-serine phosphorylation of AKAP12 in tissues. This antibody combination with phospho-serine antibody stained as large blobs of positive interaction in the tissues we examined. To address this concern of the reviewer, we have now repeated the phospho-serine/AKAP12 PLA with OIL and CCL4 livers that were recently prepared from new experiments. The PLA staining is better than the old experiments and so we have included it in revised figure 1B and included source data for the same.</p><p>In addition, we now have the three channels aligned for figure 1B and source data.</p><p>For the IHC staining, we have now shown 200X and 400X from the same field and marked the area of 200X that was magnified to show 400X.</p><p>We hope that this alleviates the above concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Yes, some pictures are nearby areas of the same liver as opposed to a different mouse liver. We have now fixed this problem by re-checking all the raw images.

Sirius red images from OIL-EV mice (I-II-III) and from OIL-CR-PMUT (II-III) have the same issue as in point 5.

Our overall analysis on the effect of CR-PMUT shows that some parameters such as AST levels are substantially suppressed very similar to PDEL; however, other parameters such as hydroxyproline (collagen quantification) level are reduced but not completely normalized like PDEL. All statistical correlations between the different groups are now clearly shown in the graphs of PDEL and PMUT and post-hoc analysis has been done and presented as source data for each figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
