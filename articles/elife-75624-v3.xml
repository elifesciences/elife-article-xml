To date, the majority of efforts to study cellular heterogeneity in testis has been focused on single-cell gene expression rather than the chromatin landscape shaping gene expression. To advance our understanding of the regulatory programs underlying testicular cell types, we analyzed single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles in more than 25,000 cells from mouse developing testis. We showed that single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-Seq) allowed us to deconvolve distinct cell populations and identify <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (CREs) underlying cell-type specification. We identified sets of transcription factors associated with cell type-specific accessibility, revealing novel regulators of cell fate specification and maintenance. Pseudotime reconstruction revealed detailed regulatory dynamics coordinating the sequential developmental progressions of germ cells and somatic cells. This high-resolution dataset also unveiled previously unreported subpopulations within both the Sertoli and Leydig cell groups. Further, we defined candidate target cell types and genes of several genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, including those associated with testosterone levels and coronary artery disease. Collectively, our data provide a blueprint of the ‘regulon’ of the mouse male germline and supporting somatic cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>scATAC-Seq</kwd><kwd>testis development</kwd><kwd>chromatin accessibility</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004853</institution-id><institution>Chinese University of Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Department of Chemical Pathology's Faculty Startup Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liao</surname><given-names>Jinyue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001839</institution-id><institution>University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>General Research Fund CUHK 14120418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Tin-lap</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis reveals the intricate regulatory landscape of mouse testicular development, uncovering novel cell subpopulations and transcription factors, and offering valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms driving germ cell and somatic cell maturation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian testis consists of germ cells and distinct somatic cell types that coordinately underpin the maintenance of spermatogenesis and fertility. These testicular cells display extensive developmental dynamics during the perinatal period. Primordial germ cells give rise to M-prospermatogonia at about embryonic day (E) 12, which enter G0 mitotic arrest at about E14 to form T1-prospermatogonia (T1-ProSG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCarrey, 2013</xref>). Shortly after birth, T1-ProSG resume mitotic activity and begin migrating from the center of the testis cords to the basal lamina of testicular cords, and become T2-prospermatogonia (T2-ProSG). Once resident at the basement membrane, T2-ProSG generate spermatogonia including self-renewing spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) or directly transition into differentiating spermatogonia that participate in the first round of spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kluin and de Rooij, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manku and Culty, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Specialized <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/somatic-cell">somatic cells</ext-link> play a pivotal role in maintaining normal germ cell development and spermatogenesis. SSCs and their initial progenies reside in a niche on the basement membrane and are surrounded by Sertoli cells, which nourish SSCs. In mice, Sertoli cells actively proliferate during the neonatal period for 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vergouwen et al., 1991</xref>). Outside the seminiferous tubules, the interstitial compartment of testis mainly contains stroma, peritubular myoid cells (PTMs), Leydig cells, macrophages, and vascular cells. PTMs are smooth muscle cells that distribute over the peripheral surface of the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maekawa et al., 1996</xref>). They are mainly involved in tubule contractions to facilitate the movement of sperm to the epididymis and secrete extracellular matrix materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Leydig cells are responsible for steroidogenesis and provide critical support for spermatogenesis. In mammals, there are two types of Leydig cells, fetal Leydig cells (FLCs) and adult Leydig cells (ALCs), which develop sequentially in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shima, 2019</xref>). While FLCs start to degenerate after birth, they are replaced by stem Leydig cells (SLCs), which are the progenitors of ALCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Su et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>One of the goals of developmental biology is to identify transcriptional networks that regulate cell differentiation. Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomic methods have enabled an unbiased identification of cell types and gene expression networks in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Green et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). A key remaining question is how the gene expression is dynamically regulated during the development of distinct cell types. Since all cells share the same genetic information, cell-type development must be regulated by differential chromatin accessibility in a cell type-specific manner. Thus, the understanding of the testis development, especially the cell type-specific transcription factors (TFs), is of paramount importance. scRNA-Seq provides limited information of TFs, which are usually lowly expressed. Although sequencing methods such as ATAC-Seq and DNase-Seq have been developed for profiling chromatin accessibility landscapes across samples and classification of regulatory elements in the genome, the nature of bulk measurements masks the cellular and regulatory heterogeneity in subpopulations within a given cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shema et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, uncovering regulatory elements in testicular cell types has been particularly challenging as samples are limited and heterogeneous. Notably, only one previous study examined the genome-wide chromatin accessibility in Sertoli cells, using the <italic>Sox9</italic> transgenic line followed by DNase-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maatouk et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>By profiling the genome-wide regulatory landscapes at a single-cell level, recent single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-Seq) studies have demonstrated the potential to discover complex cell populations, link regulatory elements to their target genes, and map regulatory dynamics during complex cellular differentiation processes. We reasoned that the advent of new single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing methods, combined with single-cell transcriptomic data, would be instrumental in advancing our understanding of gene regulatory networks in mammalian testis development. Here, we applied scATAC-Seq to deconvolve cell populations and identify cell type-specific epigenetic regulatory circuits during perinatal testis development. The dataset led to identification of key cell type-specific TFs, defined the cellular differentiation trajectory, and characterized regulatory dynamics of distinct cell types. Furthermore, our results shed light on the identification of target cell types for genetic variants. To enable public access to our data, we constructed the mouse testis epigenetic regulatory atlas website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://testisatlas.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/">http://testisatlas.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell ATAC-Seq captures developmental and cell type-specific heterogeneity in the testis</title><p>To delineate the dynamic changes on cellular populations in a developing testis, we profiled the chromatin accessibility landscapes of mouse perinatal testis across E18.5 and postnatal stages (P0, P2, and P5) by scATAC-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To improve cell-type annotation, we used Harmony to integrate datasets of four time points and project cells onto a shared embedding in which cells were grouped by cell type rather than developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>). Unbiased iterative clustering of these single cells after integration identified 11 distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Some clusters could be assigned to known testicular cell types based on gene activity scores of key marker genes compiled from chromatin accessibility signals within the gene body and promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While this approach provided broad classifications for cell-type annotation, an unbiased method is needed for more accurate classification. Therefore, we leveraged a previously published scRNA-Seq dataset of perinatal testis samples to predict cell types in scATAC-Seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). We first re-analyzed scRNA-Seq data to determine the cellular composition and annotate cells based on their transcriptional profiles. Prediction of cell types in scATAC-Seq was then performed by directly aligning cells from scATAC-Seq with cells from scRNA-Seq through comparing the ‘query’ gene activity scores matrix with ‘reference’ gene expression matrix based on the top variable genes in the scRNA-Seq dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The results showed that the vast majority of cells had a high prediction score and were confidently assigned to a single cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Cell-type proportions varied across time points, such as the expansion of germ cells during the early neonatal period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We further validated the cluster assignment by gene score and chromatin accessibility profiles of marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

These data confirm that scATAC-Seq is a robust method for the detection of cell type-specific chromatin accessibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Chromatin accessibility is associated with cell type-specific TF activity</title><p>Currently, the identities of cell type-specific TFs involved in testis development are poorly defined. Accessibility at regulatory sites is driven by TF binding and histone modifications of local chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cui et al., 2013</xref>). To characterize the determinants of chromatin accessibility variation among cell types, we predicted TF ‘activity’ for individual cell types based on the presence of binding motifs within DARs. Assessment of enriched TFs and their cognate motifs identified several known cell type-specific regulators – including the nuclear receptors (NR4A1 and NR5A1) in Sertoli cells and Leydig cells, ESR2 in Leydig cells, MYOG in PTMs, and previously uncharacterized TFs as potential cell type-specific regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). For example, we found that ZEB1 and SNAI2 motifs were enriched in germ cells, indicating they may undergo mesenchymal-like transition in perinatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammoud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liao et al., 2020</xref>). DNA bound by TFs is protected from transposition by Tn5, which can be visualized by plotting the ‘footprint’ pattern of each TF as the local chromatin accessibility surrounding the motif midpoint. Examining the footprint validated the cell type-dependent differential footprint occupancy of identified TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Although motif enrichment for DAR can be informative, this measurement is not calculated on a per-cell basis and they do not take into account the insertion sequence bias of Tn5. Therefore, in the second analysis approach, we used chromVAR to infer TF motif activity, which can reflect the enrichment level of the TF motif in accessible regulatory elements in an scATAC-Seq dataset. We first identified deviant TF motifs by stratifying motifs based on the degree of variation observed across clusters. Since TFs from the same family often share a similar motif, this makes it challenging to identify the specific TFs that actually drive the observed changes in chromatin accessibility. This is illustrated by SOX9, which exhibited enriched TF activity in both Sertoli and germ cell clusters, despite being known to be expressed only in Sertoli cells. This could be attributed to the expression of other SOX family genes, such as SOX3, which share similar DNA binding motifs, in germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raverot et al., 2005</xref>). However, SOX9 exhibited concordant enrichment of TF activity and gene expression only in Sertoli cells and can be considered a strong candidate in Sertoli cells, but not in germ cells.</p><p>To reduce false discovery, we systematically identified putative positive regulators determined from the correlation between the gene expression based on scRNA-Seq dataset (or inferred gene activity based on scATAC-Seq dataset) and the chromVAR motif activity score, reasoning that expression of high-confidence TFs is correlated with their motif accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Clustering analysis of positive regulators showed that diverse combinatorial TF motif landscapes were apparent across cell types and closely mirrored gene accessibility profiles of respective TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). There was an increased GATA1 TF ‘activity’ (motif activity) in the Sertoli cell cluster, in addition to increased chromatin accessibility in <italic>Gata1</italic> (gene activity) and increased <italic>Gata1</italic> transcription (gene expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). It has been shown that mutation of GATA1 causes human cryptorchidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nichols et al., 2000</xref>) and its expression in Sertoli cells is conserved between human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yomogida et al., 1994</xref>). A similar pattern was seen for DMRT1 in germ cells, which is one of the top motifs enriched in human SSC-specific ATAC-Seq peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). This analysis also revealed shared and unique regulatory programs across cell types. For example, PTM and stromal cells shared similar regulators, but PTM demonstrated higher activity of AR and TCF21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Similarly, NR5A1 and GATA4 were more active in both Leydig cell and Sertoli cell populations. However, only Sertoli cells showed increased activity in the SOX family.</p><p>Importantly, we observed that individual cell types can be defined by TF ‘activity’, suggesting that cell type-specific TFs likely regulate chromatin accessibility.

Since <italic>Nr5a1</italic> is widely considered as a somatic cell marker in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luo et al., 1994</xref>), we performed immunostaining to examine NR5A1’s expression in germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

The second path bypassed the undifferentiated state but passed through the unknown populations and directly reached the differentiating state by P5. It has been reported that the first round of spermatogonia arise from a unique neurogenin-3 (<italic>Ngn3</italic>) negative pool of ProSG that transitions directly into A1 spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>).

To date, the studies related to the male reproductive system mainly focus on germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lazar-Contes et al., 2020</xref>). There have only been a few studies adopting epigenetic approaches, including DNaseI-Seq and ChIP-Seq, to address the regulation of cell fate in somatic cells in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maatouk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maezawa et al., 2021</xref>). These studies also lacked single-cell resolution. Recently, Wu et al. performed scATAC-Seq analysis of adult human testis. Although somatic cell types could be identified based on chromatin accessibility, detailed characterization was not feasible due to the small number of cells captured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we present a comprehensive open chromatin map at single-cell resolution for the developing testis. First, we showed that similar to scRNA-Seq, the chromatin accessibility information obtained from scATAC-Seq is able to define cell types in the testis. Second, identification of TFs has been challenging solely based on gene expression information from scRNA-Seq. Our scATAC-Seq provides additional information on TF regulation by correlating motif accessibility and predicted gene activity, which allows us to reveal cell type-specific TFs. Third, we found numerous peak-to-gene links among different cell types, which demonstrates the tight regulatory association between CREs and gene expression. More importantly, a significant amount of peak-to-gene links are within known testis enhancer regions, indicating the reliability of our analysis strategy. Lastly, our study illustrates the critical role of scATAC-Seq in identifying target cell types of known GWAS variants.</p><p>Our study revealed dynamic chromatin accessibility that tracks with germ cell differentiation. Notably, in the pseudotime trajectory analysis of germ cells, besides a conventional pathway from ProSG to differentiating spermatogonia through an undifferentiated spermatogonial state, we also observed a second trajectory in which T1-ProSG reached the differentiating state through two cell clusters with unknown identities. We speculated that this may represent the germ cells undergoing the first wave of spermatogenesis, which are a subset of ProSGs that differentiate immediately into spermatogonia and undergo spermatogenesis in early postnatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, the low gene expression of <italic>Ngn3</italic> we observe along this trajectory is concordant with the observation that the first round of mouse spermatogenesis initiated directly from ProSGs without passing through the <italic>Ngn3</italic>-expressing undifferentiated spermatogonial stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>). Since there is currently a lack of marker genes to accurately identify gonocytes which undergo the first wave of spermatogenesis, our scATAC-Seq data uncovered a list of potential markers that warrants further investigation.</p><p>Our scATAC-Seq analysis revealed novel cell populations not previously reported in scRNA-Seq studies, such as a distinct subpopulation of Sertoli cells.

We showed that testicular cell type-specific peaks displayed increased heritability enrichment in cell populations consistent with the known biology. Intriguingly, Sertoli cells show higher heritability enrichment for CAD phenotypes, which leads us to hypothesize that CAD-associated variants may act in Sertoli cells. The risk of CAD has been linked to testosterone level, increasing age and male gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nettleship et al., 2009</xref>). Our hypothesis can be supported by the role of Sertoli cells in testosterone level regulation through influencing the Leydig cell function and testicular vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rebourcet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rebourcet et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, co-accessibility measurement informs well-studied CAD-relevant genes, such as <italic>Mras</italic> and <italic>Ptpn11</italic> in Sertoli cells. These results define immediately testable hypotheses in which these variants modulate the activity of the CREs in Sertoli cells in the context of CAD. While our analysis provided new insights toward the target cell types of a certain SNP, it should be noted that our data were generated on mouse testis. Whether a similar implication could be translated into human testis needs to be validated. Several studies have used scRNA-Seq analysis to characterize human testicular cell types, including somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sohni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>), which provided significant insights into the testis development.

Future studies that incorporate multiomics data will be important for obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular processes we have studied. Another limitation of our study is that we did not perform experimental assignment of regulatory sequences with gene promoters. Investigating the 3D organization of chromatin and the interactions between regulatory elements and gene promoters using techniques such as Hi-C has the potential to provide valuable insights and overcome this limitation. Finally, our analysis did not directly measure protein level, and therefore, may not fully capture the functional status of a cell. Complementary techniques such as mass spectrometry or immunofluorescence to validate or confirm protein expression would certainly make it more comprehensive. The integration of single-cell protein measurements may provide even deeper insights into cellular function.</p><p>We believe that these limitations provide opportunities for future research to build upon the findings of our study and to further enhance our understanding of the complex regulatory networks that govern testis development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All the animal experiments were performed according to the protocols approved by the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee (AEEC) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) and followed the Animals (Control of Experiments) Ordinance (Cap. 340) licensed from the Department of Health, the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

In brief, washed and pelleted cells were lysed with the Omni-ATAC lysis buffer containing 0.1% NP-40, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.01% digitonin, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 for 3 min on ice. The lysis buffer was diluted with ATAC-Tween buffer that contains 0.1% Tween-20 as a detergent. Nuclei were counted and examined under microscope to ensure successful isolation. Same number of nuclei were subjected to tagmentation with equal ratio of cells/Tn5 transposase to minimize potential batch effect. Nuclei were resuspended in tagmentation mix, buffered with 1× PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA and agitated on a ThermoMixer for 30 min at 37°C. Tagmented nuclei were kept on ice before encapsulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Library preparation and sequencing</title><p>Tagmented nuclei were loaded onto a ddSEQ Single-Cell Isolator (Bio-Rad). scATAC-Seq libraries were prepared using the SureCell ATAC-Seq Library Prep Kit (17004620, Bio-Rad) and SureCell ATAC-Seq Index Kit (12009360, Bio-Rad). Bead barcoding and sample indexing were performed with PCR amplification as follows: 37°C for 30 min, 85°C for 10 min, 72°C for 5 min, 98°C for 30 s, eight cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 60 s, and a single 72°C extension for 5 min to finish. Emulsions were broken and products were cleaned up using Ampure XP beads. Barcoded amplicons were further amplified for eight cycles. PCR products were purified using Ampure XP beads and quantified on an Agilent Bioanalyzer (G2939BA, Agilent) using the High-Sensitivity DNA kit (5067-4626, Agilent). Libraries were sequenced on HiSeq 2000 with 150 bp paired-end reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Sequencing reads preprocessing</title><p>Sequencing data were processed using the Bio-Rad ATAC-Seq Analysis Toolkit. This toolkit is a streamlined computational pipeline, including tools for FASTQ debarcoding, read trimming, alignment, bead filtration, bead deconvolution, cell filtration, and peak calling. The reference index was built upon the mouse genome mm10. For generation of the fragments file, which contain the start and end genomic coordinates of all aligned sequenced fragments, sorted bam files were further processed with ‘bap-frag’ module of BAP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/caleblareau/bap">https://github.com/caleblareau/bap, v0.6.0</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lareau et al., 2019</xref>) . Downstream analysis was performed in ArchR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Granja et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Dimensionality reduction, clustering, and gene score/TF activity analysis</title><p>Fragment files were used to create the Arrow files in the ArchR package. We filtered out low-quality nuclei with stringent selection criteria, including read depth per cell (&gt;2000) and TSS enrichment score (&gt;4). Potential doubles were further removed based on the ArchR method. Bin regions were cleaned by eliminating bins overlapping with ENCODE Blacklist regions, mitochondrial DNA, as well as the top 5% of invariant features (house-keeping gene promoters). Dimensionality reduction and clustering was performed with ArchR. Briefly, we used LSI dimensionality reduction using a TFIDF normalization function, UMAP low-dimensional embedding, and clustering using a nearest neighbor graph performed on data in LSI space. To facilitate major cell type annotation, we used harmony to integrate datasets of four time points and project cells onto a shared embedding in which cells were grouped by cell type rather than developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>). The clustering analysis within each cell type was carried out without harmony integration.</p><p>ArchR was used to estimate gene expression for genes and TF motif activity from single-cell chromatin accessibility data. Gene scores were calculated using the addGeneScoreMatrix function with gene score models implemented in ArchR. addDeviationsMatrix function was used to compute enrichment of TF activity on a per-cell basis across all motif annotations based on chromVAR (chromVAR_0.3). The scATAC data was integrated with scRNA-Seq data (GEO: GSE130593) using the ArchR function addGeneIntegrationMatrix. The integration process involved directly aligning cells from scATAC-Seq with cells from scRNA-Seq using the FindTransferAnchors function from the Seurat package to identify the integrated anchors with default parameters (reduction = ‘cca’, nGenes = 2000). Marker gene activity scores were used for initial annotation while labels from the RNA integration were used to validate and refine the initial annotations to produce the final cell-type annotations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Pseudo-bulk coverage analysis</title><p>To create the ‘pseudo-bulk’ coverage profile for each individual cell type, we split the aligned BAM files of each developmental time point into given groups of cell barcodes belonging to different cell types using sinto tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://timoast.github.io/sinto/">https://timoast.github.io/sinto/</ext-link>). deepTools suite was used to convert individual bam files into standard coverage tracks (bigWig files) with RPKM normalization and visualized with pyGenomeTracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramírez et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-6"><title>Trajectory analysis</title><p>Trajectory analysis was performed in ArchR. addTrajectory function in ArchR was used to construct trajectory on cisTopic UMAP embedding. To perform integrative analyses for identification of positive TF regulators by integration of gene scores with motif accessibility across pseudotime, we used the correlateTrajectories function which takes two SummarizedExperiment objects retrieved from the getTrajectories function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>Footprinting analysis</title><p>Differential TF footprints across cell types were identified using the Regulatory Genomics Toolbox application HINT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Aligned BAM files from different cell types were treated as pseudo-bulk ATAC-Seq profiles and then subjected to rgt-hint analysis. Based on MACS calling peaks, we used HINT-ATAC to predict footprints with the ‘rgt-hint footprinting’ command. We then identified all binding sites of a particular TF overlapping with footprints by using its motif from JASPAR with ‘rgt-motifanalysis matching’ command. Differential motif occupancy was identified with ‘rgt-hint differential’ command and ‘–bc’ was specified to use the bias-corrected signal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from cells by AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit (QIAGEN).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the two external experts agreed that this study may offer new and exciting insights into the cell populations that support spermatogenesis at birth. However, because the scATAC-seq was performed on a single replicate, there is no statistical power to support the strength of the main findings, i.e. the identification of novel cell types. Therefore, there is a important need for independent validation.</p><p>Please refer to the two points expanded below to prepare your revisions, and please consult the detailed points raised by the reviewers, for further corrections or analytical additions, rephrasing of the manuscript and support for discussion in a point-by-point rebuttal.</p><p>1) The quality of immunofluorescence data is not optimal and the validation results often often inconclusive. Better independent validation is needed to support the identification of novel populations by scATAC-seq, a point that was raised by the two reviewers. The results that NR5A1 may mark germ cells that commit to spermatogenesis in an SSC-independent manner are intriguing. However, whole-mount immunostaining provided in Figure 4E is not convincing. Clear colocalization between NR5A1 and germ cell markers should be provided, by cell cytometry and/or IF on sections. Clearer validation that Sertoli stem cells were identified is also needed, the whole-mount staining in Figure 5F being poorly informative. Reviewer #1 provides useful suggestions to make progress on that manner. Reviewer #2 also requests additional analysis to support this identification.</p><p>2) One limitation of the study is to correlate scATAC-seq profiles generated here with scRNA-seq data available in the literature and obtained on cell populations that may not be defined according to the same experimental and analytical tools. It is not requested here to perform multiomics on the same cells, but this limitation should be acknowledged. The other limitation comes from using correlation between the presence of TF binding sites at open chromatin sites and gene expression of nearby genes, without proper experimental assignment of regulatory sequences with gene promoters by 3D assays. This experiment would be very difficult to carry on in this developmental and cellular context. Nonetheless, this limitation should also be acknowledged.</p><p>3) Replace &quot;mammalian&quot; with &quot;mouse&quot; in the title.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In supplemental figure 2 – projecting the dividual datasets will help the reader evaluate the contribution of the individual datasets to each cluster.</p><p>A summary stat's table about individual cell quality metrics would be helpful. please detail inclusion / exclusion criteria # peaks per cell etc…</p><p>The alignment of scRNAseq clusters with scATACseq was missing in S2D.</p><p>What is a deviation score in Figure S3B? Is this the same as a correlation?</p><p>EMT in germ cells has also been previously described in http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/29/21/2312</p><p>Based on the text and figures for supplemental figure 11 it is hard to fully appreciate the stromal/myoid cell heterogeneity. The authors identify 10 clusters – PC2 appears to be called out as a TCf21 and telocyte population – is this correct? Are these the same the same population but classified differently?</p><p>This paper by Liao et al. aims to understand the genetic networks that underlie or modulate gonadogenesis and germ cell maturation during the fetal to neonatal transition. This goal was achieved by performing scATACseq on multiple timepoints (E18.5 and Postnatal days 1,2,5). Clustering of thousands of cells has revealed striking cellular diversity and led to the identification of additional novel populations. This is an exciting paper that may have far reaching implications, but additional validation is needed for novel populations identified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) It appears that for each time point, only one sample was analyzed, meaning that there was no statistical power to discern whether the outcome is a random observation or true reflection of a biological event. If having statistically meaning sample size is impossible, a duplication of samples should have been done at least to exclude potential technical deviation. In addition, it is not clear whether for each sample, it is a pool of several testes or a single testis.</p><p>2) One concern is the lack of details and reference gene lists for making correlations between the published single cell RNAseq dataset from Tan et al. and the single cell ATACseq dataset from this study. This is the critical first step to validate the scATACseq results and assign cell identities. Only one gene per cell type was given as an example.</p><p>3) Sertoli and Leydig cells are distinct cell types in terms of their functions and transcriptional profiles. However, the scATACseq dataset did not detect cell specific TF binding profile (Figure 2C). This is quite puzzling.</p><p>4) The presence of TF binding sites in the open chromatin region is a suggestion, not a confirmation of TF activity. The authors are advised to make clarification on this matter and tone down the language on such correlation without further validation like ChIP-seq. For example, in Figure 2H, <italic>SOX9</italic> binding motifs are enriched in both Sertoli and germ cell cluster but its expression is absent in the germ cells. Similarly, TCF21 motifs and gene expression are enriched in a specific cluster of stromal cells but TCF21 gene activity is not different from other cell type. It is not clear how authors reconcile these conflict findings.</p><p>5) Making correlation between separated scATACseq data and scRNAseq data has its limitation. One still cannot be certain that the cell from scATACseq is the same as the one from scRNAseq. This is the major limitation of this study.</p><p>6) Similarly, the chromatin interaction (Figure 3A-F) is based on correlation between open chromatin and gene expression. Without confirmation of 3C and High C analyses, the results are strictly speculative.</p><p>7) Some of the figures are difficult to follow with insufficient description of how the experiments were conducted. For example, experiments for Figure 3F were not described in the result session.</p><p>8) The findings of NR5a1 as a potential regulator of an unknown population of male germ cells are interesting but puzzling. NR5a1 has never been shown to be expressed in the testis by cells other than the somatic cell populations. The wholemount colocalization image is far from convincing.</p><p>9) Similarly, the unique expression of MBD3 in a subset of Sertoli cells is quite fascinating. However, the analysis was superficial and inconclusive. This subset of Sertoli cells should be <italic>SOX9</italic> negative/low and AMH positive/high. Unfortunately, such confirmation is not available to support the conclusion.</p><p>10) The intent to link human GWAS data with the chromatin status of various cell types is reasonable and novel. Unfortunately, confirmation of the cell type-specific expression of several putative target genes (Wars, Mras, Ptpn11, etc) was not provided. The same problem is found in other analyses on Sertoli and Leydig cell stem cell types.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75624.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In supplemental figure 2 – projecting the dividual datasets will help the reader evaluate the contribution of the individual datasets to each cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would provide more clarity for the reader and we have included this in our revised manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A summary stat's table about individual cell quality metrics would be helpful. please detail inclusion / exclusion criteria # peaks per cell etc…</p></disp-quote><p>We have summarized individual cell quality metrics in Supplementary File 3.

This suggests that the accessibility of the Sertoli cell DHSs in this cluster deviates significantly from the average accessibility of these sites in all other clusters. To further confirm the identity of this cluster as Sertoli cells, we have added feature enrichment analysis in the revised manuscript. We showed that the cluster-specific ATAC-seq peaks for the Sertoli cell cluster are significantly enriched for Sertoli cell DHSs compared to other clusters. This supports our finding that this cluster represents Sertoli cells with unique chromatin accessibility profiles. We hope that this explanation clarifies how we confirmed Sertoli cell clusters in our scATAC-seq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>EMT in germ cells has also been previously described in http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/29/21/2312</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer bringing this paper to our attention. We are aware of this study and it provides interesting insights into the heterogeneity of germ cells and their plasticity during development, which is aligned with our finding. We have referenced this paper in our revised manuscript. In addition, we have conducted additional studies and our results are currently being prepared for publication in a follow-up manuscript</p><p>(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.12.336834v2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on the text and figures for supplemental figure 11 it is hard to fully appreciate the stromal/myoid cell heterogeneity. The authors identify 10 clusters – PC2 appears to be called out as a TCf21 and telocyte population – is this correct? Are these the same the same population but classified differently?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5 – —figure supplement 2 (supplemental figure 11 in original version), our rationale for suggesting the possible identity of PC2 cluster as telocytes is based on a recent publication by Marini et al. (2018) that reports telocytes as a stromal cell type present in various tissues, including the testis (PMID:30283023). In line with this paper, we found that the PC2 cluster displayed higher activity of markers for telocytes such as Tcf21, Cd34 and Pdgfra. However, we acknowledge that further validation and functional studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. In the revised manuscript, we wanted to avoid any confusion and have deleted the introduction of Tcf21’s function in bipotent somatic cells because it’s less relevant to the postnatal testis. We hope we have made it more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) It appears that for each time point, only one sample was analyzed, meaning that there was no statistical power to discern whether the outcome is a random observation or true reflection of a biological event. If having statistically meaning sample size is impossible, a duplication of samples should have been done at least to exclude potential technical deviation. In addition, it is not clear whether for each sample, it is a pool of several testes or a single testis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's concern regarding the statistical power of our study. Due to resource constraints, we were only able to analyze one sequencing sample per time point. Each sequencing sample was from 3 independent mice mixed in equal proportion according to the same cell count to minimize the effects of biological variability. Also, all the sequencing samples were processed in a single cell capture run, which should minimize the technical bias. We believe that our stringent quality control measures and experimental approach have minimized the effects of technical variability. We have carefully mentioned the details in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One concern is the lack of details and reference gene lists for making correlations between the published single cell RNAseq dataset from Tan et al. and the single cell ATACseq dataset from this study. This is the critical first step to validate the scATACseq results and assign cell identities. Only one gene per cell type was given as an example.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more details of integration analysis in the Materials and methods section. Gene used in the prediction are the top 2000 variable genes from scRNA-seq reference dataset (Supplementary File 1). The integration process involved directly aligning cells from scATAC-seq with cells from scRNA-seq using the FindTransferAnchors() function from the Seurat package to identify the integrated anchors with default parameters (reduction = “cca”, nGenes = 2000). It is worth noting that the top variable genes are typically cell type-specific genes that exhibit high expression variability across cells and are therefore highly informative for cell type classification and identity assignment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Sertoli and Leydig cells are distinct cell types in terms of their functions and transcriptional profiles. However, the scATACseq dataset did not detect cell specific TF binding profile (Figure 2C). This is quite puzzling.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment regarding the lack of cell-specific TF binding profiles between Sertoli and Leydig cells in Figure 2C. We have investigated this issue and found that the criteria to include TF in the heatmap were stringent. Therefore, we have re-analyzed the data and updated the heatmap to show the differential enrichment of TF motifs in Sertoli and Leydig cells. We found that ESR2 motif is more enriched in Leydig cells, suggesting that it could be a cell-specific TF in this cell type (PMID: 15823796). In addition, the updated results show that Leydig cells exhibit a higher enrichment of several TF motifs such as Nhlh2 and Ascl1/2 compared to Sertoli cells. Enrichment of Nhlh2 and Ascl1/2 in Leydig cells is shared with peritubular myoid (PTM) cells, likely because they share the same cellular origin during gonad development (PMID:30893600). We have updated Figure 2C to reflect these findings. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The presence of TF binding sites in the open chromatin region is a suggestion, not a confirmation of TF activity. The authors are advised to make clarification on this matter and tone down the language on such correlation without further validation like ChIP-seq. For example, in Figure 2H, SOX9 binding motifs are enriched in both Sertoli and germ cell cluster but its expression is absent in the germ cells. Similarly, TCF21 motifs and gene expression are enriched in a specific cluster of stromal cells but TCF21 gene activity is not different from other cell type. It is not clear how authors reconcile these conflict findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment and we acknowledge that the presence of TF binding sites in the open chromatin region is not a confirmation of TF activity. We understand the importance of further validation, such as ChIP-seq, to confirm TF activity. As a suggestion rather than a confirmation, we believe that the results we provide can still offer insights and candidate genes for follow-up studies. Due to the limitation of TF activity prediction, it is challenging to identify the specific TFs that drive observed changes in chromatin accessibility, especially when TFs from the same family share similar motifs. <italic>Sox9</italic> showed its enrichment of TF activity in both Sertoli and germ cell clusters, despite its known expression only in Sertoli cells. This could be due to other SOX family genes, such as SOX3, which have similar DNA binding motifs (PMID:15893302). This is why we believe that our positive regulator analysis approach can overcome this limitation to some extent and provide more informative results. In this case, <italic>SOX9</italic> shows concordant enrichment of TF activity and gene expression in sertoli cells and meets this criteria of a positive regulator and should be regarded as a good candidate in Sertoli cells but not in germ cells. We understand that this approach may not be immediately clear to the reader and have further clarified this in our manuscript.</p><p>To improve clarity in Figure 2H, we will only show TF activity and gene expression and clarify that the positive regulator score is calculated based on the correlation between these two measurements. The readers can refer to our website for more information on gene activity.</p><p>Finally, we have added some discussion in the manuscript to address these concerns and to emphasize the limitations and potential pitfalls of using TF binding motifs as suggestions for TF activity. We hope this will help readers approach the data more critically and come up with their own candidate genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Making correlation between separated scATACseq data and scRNAseq data has its limitation. One still cannot be certain that the cell from scATACseq is the same as the one from scRNAseq. This is the major limitation of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a valid concern regarding the limitations of making correlations between separated scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq datasets.While we cannot definitively confirm that each cell in the scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq datasets are exact matches, we took steps to minimize the potential impact of this issue. Specifically, we carefully matched the time points between the scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq datasets, which allowed us to better infer the transcriptional activity of each cell type during the developmental stages of the testis. Additionally, to ensure a comprehensive representation of cell types and avoid potential biases, we opted not to use pre-selection techniques such as FACS sorting. We believe that our data and analysis provide a robust foundation for further investigations into the transcriptional regulation of testicular cell development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Similarly, the chromatin interaction (Figure 3A-F) is based on correlation between open chromatin and gene expression. Without confirmation of 3C and High C analyses, the results are strictly speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the limitations of our study with regard to the lack of experimental validation of chromatin interactions. While our approach for inferring interactions based on correlation between open chromatin and gene expression is a widely used and effective method (for example in PMID: 33850129), we recognize that this correlation does not necessarily indicate a direct physical interaction. Future studies, such as those employing techniques like Hi-C, could provide further insights into the 3D organization of chromatin and the interactions between regulatory elements and gene promoters. We believe that these limitations highlight opportunities for further research to build upon our findings and to enhance our understanding of the complex regulatory networks that govern cellular processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Some of the figures are difficult to follow with insufficient description of how the experiments were conducted. For example, experiments for Figure 3F were not described in the result session.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion that may have arisen due to the insufficient description of experiments in our manuscript. We have now revised the manuscript to provide a more comprehensive and detailed account of the experiments and methods employed, specifically for Figure 3F. Our goal is to ensure the transparency and reproducibility of our research, and we have taken care to clearly describe the methods and experimental details in the revised manuscript, both in the main text and the Materials and methods section. If further clarification is needed, we are more than willing to provide additional information upon request.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The findings of NR5a1 as a potential regulator of an unknown population of male germ cells are interesting but puzzling. NR5a1 has never been shown to be expressed in the testis by cells other than the somatic cell populations. The wholemount colocalization image is far from convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed immunostaining of NR5A1 in testicular sections and showed that NR5A1+ germ cells (TRA98+ cells) exist in P5.5 testis. As additional evidence supporting our finding that a subset of somatic markers are expressed in the unique germ cell population we identified, we reference a study where cells in the spermatogonial signature 3 cluster showed high levels of mRNAs characteristic of Sertoli cells, including Nr5a1, <italic>Sox9</italic>, and Wt1 (PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25568304">25568304</ext-link>). This indicates that cells with germ cell identity can express somatic cell genes, which is consistent with our findings. Additionally, another study reported the expression of the somatic cell marker WT1 in some germ cells through immunostaining (Figure 3B, PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34815802">34815802</ext-link>). We have included this information in the revised manuscript to further support our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Similarly, the unique expression of MBD3 in a subset of Sertoli cells is quite fascinating. However, the analysis was superficial and inconclusive. This subset of Sertoli cells should be SOX9 negative/low and AMH positive/high. Unfortunately, such confirmation is not available to support the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestions, we conducted further immunostaining of MBD3 and AMH in Sertoli cells (Figure 5F), which showed that MBD3-high cells tend to have higher levels of AMH expression. On the other hand, the antibodies that worked well in our hands for both MBD3 and <italic>SOX9</italic> were raised in rabbit species, making it infeasible to perform co-staining due to the overlap in the secondary antibodies. We made efforts to find suitable <italic>SOX9</italic> antibodies raised in other species, but unfortunately, none of them provided satisfactory staining results. This limitation hindered our ability to perform a direct co-staining of MBD3 and <italic>Sox9</italic>.</p><p>Despite this challenge, we have provided additional data on MBD3 and AMH staining to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the MBD3-expressing Sertoli cell subpopulation. The observed staining results not only confirm the properties of MBD3+ cells (MBD3-high/AMH-high) but also highlight the heterogeneity of Sertoli cells, as evidenced by the presence of various expression patterns such as MBD3-low/AMH-high (cluster SC3 in Figure 5A) and MBD3-low/AMH-low (cluster SC2/4/5/6 in Figure 5A). We hope that this explanation clarifies the difficulties we encountered and that our revised data adequately addresses your concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The intent to link human GWAS data with the chromatin status of various cell types is reasonable and novel. Unfortunately, confirmation of the cell type-specific expression of several putative target genes (Wars, Mras, Ptpn11, etc) was not provided. The same problem is found in other analyses on Sertoli and Leydig cell stem cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the importance of confirming the cell type-specific expression of putative target genes identified from our analysis and have mentioned this limitation in the Discussion section. As a starting point, our study has provided a comprehensive list of putative target genes and their associated GWAS trait in our manuscript, which we hope will facilitate further studies aimed at confirming their expression and function in relevant cell types.</p></body></sub-article></article>
