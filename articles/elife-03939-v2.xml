Kinetic competition between these processes has been proposed to determine RNA fate, yet such coupling has never been observed in vivo on single transcripts. In this study, we use dual-color single-molecule RNA imaging in living human cells to construct a complete kinetic profile of transcription and splicing of the β-globin gene. We find that kinetic competition results in multiple competing pathways for pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing of the terminal intron occurs stochastically both before and after transcript release, indicating there is not a strict quality control checkpoint. The majority of pre-mRNAs are spliced after release, while diffusing away from the site of transcription. A single missense point mutation (S34F) in the essential splicing factor U2AF1 which occurs in human cancers perturbs this kinetic balance and defers splicing to occur entirely post-release.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03939.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03939.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03939.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To make a protein, part of a DNA sequence is copied to make a messenger RNA (or mRNA) molecule in a process known as transcription. The enzyme that builds an mRNA molecule first binds to a start point on a DNA strand, and then uses the DNA sequence to build a ‘pre-mRNA’ molecule until a stop signal is reached.</p><p>To make the final mRNA molecule, sections called introns are removed from the pre-mRNA molecules, and the parts left behind—known as exons—are then joined together. This process is called splicing. However, it is not fully understood how the splicing process is coordinated with the other stages of transcription. For example, does splicing occur after the pre-mRNA molecule is completed or while it is still being built? And what controls the order in which these processes occur?</p><p>One theory about how the different mRNA-making processes are coordinated is called kinetic competition. This theory states that the fastest process is the most likely to occur, even if the other processes use less energy and so might be expected to be preferred. Alternatively, the different steps may be started and stopped by ‘checkpoints’ that cause the different processes to follow on from each other in a set order.</p><p>Coulon et al. used fluorescence microscopy to investigate how mRNA molecules are made during the transcription of a human gene that makes a hemoglobin protein. To make the RNA visible, two different fluorescent markers were introduced into the pre-mRNA that cause different regions of the mRNA to glow in different colors. Coulon et al. made the introns fluoresce red and the exons glow green. Unspliced pre-mRNA molecules contain both introns and exons and so fluoresce in both colors, whereas spliced mRNA molecules contain only exons and so only glow with a green color.</p><p>By looking at both the red and green fluorescence signals at the same time, Coulon et al. could see when an intron was spliced out of the pre-mRNA. This revealed that in normal cells, splicing can occur either before or after the RNA is released from where it is transcribed. Thus, splicing and transcription does not follow a set pattern, suggesting that checkpoints do not control the sequence of events. Instead, the fact that a spliced mRNA molecule can be formed in different ways suggests kinetic competition controls the process.</p><p>In some cancer cells, there are defects in the cellular machinery that controls splicing. When looking at cells with such a defect, Coulon et al. found that splicing only occurred after transcription was completed. This study thus provides insight into the complex workings of mRNA synthesis and establishes a blueprint for understanding how splicing is impaired in diseases such as cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03939.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03939.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>RNA processing</kwd><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>single-molecule imaging</kwd><kwd>fluctuation analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIABC011383-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>Matthew L</given-names></name><name><surname>Palangat</surname><given-names>Murali</given-names></name><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>Daniel R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coulon</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name><name><surname>Chow</surname><given-names>Carson C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Real-time single-molecule visualization of transcription and splicing in living cells reveals that RNA synthesis and processing can occur through multiple pathways on the same gene.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Co-transcriptional processing of nascent pre-mRNA is a central mechanism for gene regulation in eukaryotes and requires temporal coordination between transcription initiation, elongation, splicing, and cleavage. Each of these processes is carried out by megadalton macromolecular complexes acting at a single genetic locus, and kinetic competition between these processes has been proposed to determine RNA fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley, 2014</xref>). Genome-wide studies across organisms indicate heterogeneous distributions of both RNA polymerase and nascent RNA along the gene, suggesting that kinetic checkpoints exist throughout the gene, including at promoter-proximal sites, translation start sites, intron–exon boundaries, and at the 3′ end of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nechaev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Larson et al., 2014</xref>). However, population studies reflect the balance of kinetic rates and are unable to resolve the multiple competing processes occurring at a single gene. Moreover, genome-wide measurements lack the time-resolution which might provide mechanistic clues about the underlying enzymatic processes.</p><p>The hypothesis of kinetic competition is that a fast process will out-compete a process which may in fact be more energetically preferred. Kinetic competition during the transcription cycle has been shown to influence splice site selection during alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de la Mata et al., 2003</xref>), recruitment of factors which release promoter-proximal pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2013</xref>), and even RNAi-mediated genome defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dumesic et al., 2013</xref>). Since these processes occur within the dynamic milieu of the nucleus, the stochastic interactions between macromolecules may result in a range of possible outcomes for the nascent RNA. Stochastic RNA synthesis—the phenomenon whereby the inherently stochastic nature of bio-molecular encounters and reactions leads to a non-deterministic production of transcripts—has been directly visualized in multiple organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Golding et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chubb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yunger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larson et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2013</xref>). Yet, stochastic RNA processing—the possibility that stochastic bio-molecular reactions might lead to non-deterministic pathways/outcomes in the making and maturation of an RNA—has never been directly observed, and the potential consequences for gene regulation are largely unexplored. Alternatively, regulatory checkpoints have been proposed which safeguard against such stochastic RNA processing events, providing a level of quality control. For example, the model of exon definition requires that splicing of the terminal intron relies on synergy between 3′ end formation, nascent RNA cleavage, and intron excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berget et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Niwa et al., 1990</xref>). Similarly, multiple studies indicate an increased density of nascent RNA present at the 3′ end of genes or in the chromatin-bound fraction, suggesting that nascent RNA is retained at the site of transcription to ensure correct processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Glover-Cutter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brody et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhatt et al., 2012</xref>). In both the competition model and the checkpoint model, kinetics plays a prominent role, but in the latter case, the cell has developed additional safeguard mechanisms.</p><p>In this article, we use an in vivo single-molecule RNA imaging approach to directly measure kinetic coupling between transcription and splicing of a human β-globin reporter gene. The approach is based on simultaneous dual-color imaging of both the intron and exon of the same pre-mRNA using both PP7 and MS2 stem loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertrand et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chao et al., 2008</xref>). We find that kinetic competition results in multiple competing pathways for pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing of the terminal intron occurs stochastically both before and after transcript release, indicating there is not a strict quality control checkpoint. Post-release splicing occurs from freely diffusing transcripts in the nucleus and is an order of magnitude faster than splicing at the site of transcription. A single missense mutation (Ser34Phe) in the zinc finger domain of the conserved splicing factor U2AF1 which is recurrent in multiple cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graubert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waterfall et al., 2014</xref>) changes the balance, making all splicing post-release. This same effect can also be observed on the endogenous, un-modified fragile X mental retardation mRNA (<italic>FXR1</italic>). Our results show that kinetic competition governs the stochastic balance between multiple competing pathways for RNA synthesis and processing and that this balance is perturbed by oncogenic mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Real-time visualization of transcription and splicing at the single-molecule level in living cells</title><p>To visualize transcription, splicing, and release of single transcripts in living cells, we used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of multiply labeled RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertrand et al., 1998</xref>). We stably integrated into U2-OS cells, a human β-globin reporter with a DNA cassette that encodes for 24X PP7 RNA hairpins in the second intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chao et al., 2008</xref>) and a 24X MS2 hairpin cassette in the 3′ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boireau et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The constitutively expressed PP7-coat protein tagged with mCherry (PCP-mCherry) and MS2-coat protein tagged with GFP (MCP-GFP) bind with high affinity (the on rate for MCP is 0.54 μM<sup>–1</sup>s<sup>–1</sup>. At a nuclear concentration of 1 μM, the average time for the MCP to bind a completed stem loop is 1.85 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buenrostro et al., 2014</xref>) to the RNA stem loops as homodimers, tagging each cassette with 48 fluorophores of a single color, resulting in orthogonal labeling of two different parts of the nascent transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hocine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buenrostro et al., 2014</xref>). Since the PP7 cassette is intronic, unspliced RNAs appear in both colors, while spliced RNAs are only visible in green. Time-lapse imaging of cells in 3D reveals a temporally fluctuating diffraction-limited spot, co-localizing in both colors, that corresponds to the transcription site (TS) where nascent transcripts are synthesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref>).

If splicing is pre-release, the red fluorescence drops before the green fluorescence reflecting that intron removal occurred before the release of a spliced transcript.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03939.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03939.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03939-fig1-figsupp1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03939.005</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Integration site of the β-globin reporter and copy number analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of an integration site of the reporter plasmid as identified by whole genome sequencing.

Autocorrelations decrease linearly and reach 0 at a delay equal to the persistence time of the red and green signals. Cross-correlation shows four angles, each reflecting the delay between a rise or fall in the red signal and a rise or fall in the green signal. (<bold>B</bold>) This can be generalized to the case where fluorescence signals rise as ramps (spanning the width of each cassette). In this case, the sharp angles described above become smooth when one or two of the fluorescence transitions they involve is a ramp. (<bold>C</bold>) If the red fall precedes the green rise (i.e., splicing precedes transcription of MS2 cassette), crosscorrelation at τ = 0 is null because the two signals never overlap. If the red signal falls while the green signal is up (i.e., splicing occurs after the MS2 cassette but before release), crosscorrelation at τ = 0 is non-null and is increasing with the same slope on either side of the y-axis. Finally, if both signal fall at the same time (i.e., splicing succeeds or coincides with transcript release), the crosscorrelation shows a break of slope at τ = 0, with a positive slope for τ &lt; 0 and a null slope for τ &gt; 0. (<bold>D</bold>) The correlation functions originating from a heterogeneous (stochastic) population of transcripts is simply the average of the correlation functions for each transcript. Hence, all the pre-release splicing events contribute a positive slope on either site of the y-axis, while all the post-release splicing events only contribute a positive slope on the left side of the axis. The resulting crosscorrelation displays a change of slope that directly reflects the fraction of pre- and post-release splicing events.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03939.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03939.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03939-fig2-figsupp2-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig2s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03939.012</object-id><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Estimation of the fraction of pre-release splicing from slopes in the crosscorrelations.</title><p>In panels (<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>), we estimate the fraction of splicing events that occur pre-release from experimental correlation functions (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), by applying the principle shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>.

At short time delays (&lt;40 s), the cross-correlation reflects the order of splicing and release events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>—§2). If splicing never occurs before transcript release, the intron-to-exon cross-correlation (blue) starts horizontally at positive delays. On the other hand, if splicing always occurs before release, this function starts with a positive slope in alignment with its negative counterpart (magenta). In the case where splicing is stochastic and both outcomes may occur, their relative probability of occurrence is given by the change of slope of the cross-correlation at 0 delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2 fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 2D and 3</xref>). The experimental cross-correlation determined from ∼2000 individual β-globin transcripts indicates that splicing occurs before release for a fraction of transcripts (13 ± 5%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> inset). We note that this change in slope at short time delay <italic>only</italic> denotes the relative order of splicing <italic>vs</italic> release but says nothing about the kinetics of these two processes. In summary, these data demonstrate that splicing and release are not firmly constrained to occur in a specific order (p &lt; 0.003).</p><p>At longer delays (&gt;40 s), other features of the transcription cycle are visible. For example, the delay at which the intron-to-exon cross-correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, blue circles) starts decreasing (∼60 s) corresponds to the elongation time between the two cassettes (2573 bases apart), resulting in an elongation rate of ∼2.6 kb/min. Finally, the decay at time-scales &gt; 100 s relates to the dwell time of transcripts at the TS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Specifically, the long decays observed in all correlation functions indicates that RNA is not immediately released after transcription of the poly(A) site. Rather, the transcript remains at the TS for a duration which reflects either a pause at/near the poly(A) site, transcription past the termination site, or a post-cleavage retention of the transcript within the diffraction-limited spot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hofer and Darnell, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Glover-Cutter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brody et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhatt et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To confirm our assignment of transcription cycle events to features in the correlation curve, we treated cells with drugs known to affect different aspects of RNA synthesis.

Treatment with camptothecin (CPT, a topoisomerase I inhibitor known to slow down elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh and Padgett, 2009</xref>]) resulted in a marked shift of the decreasing part of the intron-to-exon cross-correlation to longer delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which is the expected manifestation of slower elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>—§2).</p><p>As an additional control, when shuffling channels between traces or when using time traces recorded away from the TS, the correlation functions are flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>), supporting the fact that the correlation functions shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> reflect the molecular events happening at the TS.</p><p>Finally, we emphasize that an essential advantage of this approach is that correlation functions reveal single-transcript kinetics even from signals where multiple transcripts are present at any given time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>—§1).

To gain further insight, we developed mathematical models which relate the shape of the correlation functions to the timing of the underlying molecular processes (see ‘Materials and methods’). We generated five different mechanistic schemes: (I) purely post-release splicing, (II) independence between splicing and elongation/release, (III) polymerase pausing at the 3′ splice site (ss) until splicing is complete, (IV) splicing only during 3′ end retention of the transcript, and (V) release only after splicing is complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’). For each one of these general schemes, different time distributions were tested for elongation, splicing, and release (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Since by construction, the intron-to-exon cross-correlation at 0 delay is necessarily null in scheme III and have a null slope in scheme I, these two schemes can be ruled out (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A,D</xref> for fits). The three other schemes were better at fitting the correlation curves but the best model is one from scheme II, that is where splicing is independent of elongation and transcript release (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> and discussion on <italic>Model comparison</italic> in ‘Materials and methods’). In this 3-parameter model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), splicing occurs a fixed amount of time after the 3′ss has been transcribed, and transcript release involves a stochastic delay after the poly(A) site is reached. No pause at the 3′ ss was needed to fit the data. This observation does not rule out pausing at these sites but suggests that such a pause would be much shorter than the other timescales observed. Notably, our data are fit better with a model having a fixed time for intron removal rather than a stochastic (exponential) one, arguing for several sequential kinetic steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitken et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>). In total, the β-globin-terminal intron splicing time was 267 ± 9 s after the polymerase passes the 3′ ss.

Based on our measurements, splicing occurring at the TS is rarely completed during elongation but rather during a pause at the 3′ end of the gene. Because transcript release is stochastic, the 3′ end dwell time can be shorter or longer than the necessary time to remove the intron, resulting in splicing that can occur either before or after release.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Splicing happens 10-fold faster on freely diffusing transcripts than on chromatin</title><p>Since the majority of β-globin pre-mRNA is released from the TS before splicing of the terminal intron, we addressed the question of where and when this splicing takes place. We observed a mobile population of unspliced pre-mRNA (co-localized intron/exon) diffusing in the immediate vicinity of the TS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). In contrast, spliced mRNA (exon only) could be observed diffusing throughout the nucleus. A small population of red-only particles was also recorded, which could be due either to the false-discovery rate of the segmentation algorithm or the presence of free lariats (See ‘Materials and methods’). The radial distribution of mRNA and pre-mRNA indicated an enrichment for unspliced transcripts within 2.4 ± 0.1 µm of the TS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), meaning that splicing occurs faster than diffusion throughout the nucleus. This enrichment disappears upon treatment with splicing inhibitor SSA, in which case most of the transcripts are unspliced and dispersed throughout the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). From the measured diffusion coefficient (D = 0.12 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; See ‘Materials and methods’), we calculated that post-release splicing takes place on average 13 ± 1 s after departure from chromatin. This time is much shorter than the expected 137 s it would take if pre- and post-release splicing kinetics were identical (calculated from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). From this observation, it is tempting to speculate that transcripts are released only after they have passed a particular rate-limiting step in spliceosome assembly, explaining why the catalytic step occurs very soon after release. However, this interpretation is inconsistent with the fact that 3′end retention time is not affected by SSA treatment which impairs binding of U2 and hence affects recruitment of all the snRNPs except U1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corrionero et al., 2011</xref>). Note also that we cannot formally exclude the possibility that co-localized intron/exon particles are actually excised introns still in complex with transcripts. In summary, although introns can be retained for over 4 min on chromatin, once the transcript is released, splicing is 10-fold faster for freely diffusing transcripts. In most cases, the nascent intron is retained until transcription reaches the 3′ end of the gene and then removed either before or shortly after release of the transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03939.020</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Visualization of splicing occurring after release from chromatin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Individual frames from live-cell confocal imaging showing intron (red dots), exon (green dots), and the merged image.

The transcript is retained at the 3′end of the gene for a stochastic amount of time that can be shorter or longer than the remaining time to excise the intron.

Deep sequencing studies in myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and hairy cell leukemia have all revealed the existence of mutated factors involved in 3′ ss recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graubert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waterfall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">TCGA, 2012</xref>). One recurrent change is a heterozygous point mutation in U2 auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1), which is an essential factor for recognition of the AG dinucleotide consensus motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The serine-to-phenylalanine (S34F) missense mutation in the zinc finger domain results in disparate changes in alternative splicing patterns including exon skipping, exon inclusion, and alternative 3′ ss selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>). Although somatic genetics clearly indicate the importance of this mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waterfall et al., 2014</xref>), there is no functional or mechanistic understanding of how U2AF1-S34F works at the molecular level.</p><p>We performed time-lapse imaging on cells expressing moderate levels of either wild-type U2AF1 or U2AF1-S34F, both fused to a cerulean fluorescent protein.

Using single-molecule FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Femino et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), we examined the spatial distribution of intron and exon in fixed cells transfected with U2AF1 or U2AF1-S34F. As was the case for the β-globin reporter, we observed a population of unspliced FXR1 pre-mRNA in the vicinity of an active TS, indicating that at least some fraction of FXR1 transcripts are released before splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We then performed the same spatial analysis as above, except on fixed cells instead of live cells.

Taken together, both static and dynamic measurements on a reporter β-globin transcript and the endogenous FXR1 transcript suggest that the S34F mutation in U2AF1 acts in a dominant negative fashion to postpone splicing until after release and cause slower splicing from diffusing transcripts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The picture that emerges from this study is one in which the β-globin-terminal intron can be spliced during multiple steps of the transcription cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). A minority of transcripts are spliced while retained at the 3′ end of the gene, but the dominant pathway is the one in which splicing is contemporaneous with release or occurs shortly thereafter. These results are consistent with several studies which suggested that intron removal is enhanced upon cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baurén et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bird et al., 2005</xref>). In fact, we find that splicing is 10-fold faster on freely diffusing transcripts than on chromatin-bound transcripts. Our data are consistent with a model where commitment to splicing of the terminal β-globin intron occurs co-transcriptionally but suggest there may be a high energy barrier to completion of intron removal while transcripts are still tethered to chromatin, possibly due to steric constraints. Thus, post-release splicing may be the energetically favored process, but there is a long kinetic window in which the less-favorable pre-release intron removal can occur.</p><p>The time required to remove an intron therefore becomes a central parameter in our understanding of RNA processing, with implications for both constitutive and alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley, 2014</xref>). This fundamental kinetic quantity has been elusive. Population-based measurements suggest a splicing time for several endogenous, un-modified introns of 5–10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh and Padgett, 2009</xref>). Bulk in vitro measurements on β-globin indicate a 40- to 50-min timescale. A single-molecule in vitro study on yeast transcripts measured ∼10-min splicing time. On the opposite end of the spectrum, previous live-cell imaging approaches relying on both direct and indirect measurements indicate splicing times in the order of ∼30 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huranová et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). One of the primary experimental advances in our study is the ability to observe the transcription and splicing process with a time resolution that spans three orders of magnitude. Since the time to splice is a distributed quantity, and splicing times vary from transcript to transcript, the variation in previously reported splicing rates may be strongly influenced by the temporal dynamic range of the method. Biologically, this variability in splicing rate may provide regulatory potential, as we discuss below.</p><p>One potential criticism of the live-cell imaging approach is that the stem-loops and the coat protein may perturb kinetics. Several arguments stand against this view. First, our splicing kinetics are consistent with both population measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh and Padgett, 2009</xref>) and in vitro single-molecule measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>). Second, the splicing efficiency of the reporter is high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting there are no dead-end intermediates. Third, endogenous metazoan RNAs are decorated with RNA-binding proteins from their inception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castello et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that the spliceosome is well-equipped to handle bulky messages. Finally, since we can never exclude the possibility that a synthetic reporter may be missing features found in an endogenous gene, we have also recapitulated the results on the un-modified endogenous FXR1 message.</p><p>Importantly, our single-molecule study reveals the existence of multiple pathways, indicating the absence of a strict checkpoint for intron removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bird et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brody et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhatt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pandya-Jones et al., 2013</xref>). The presence of a delay at the 3′ end may be interpreted as a checkpoint mechanism to ensure that splicing takes place before transcript release, but there are several reasons to reject this interpretation of our data. First, none of the models which assume dependence between splicing and elongation/release fit better than one that assumes independence. Second, both splicing and elongation inhibition experiments support the view of the two processes being kinetically independent. Abolishing splicing with SSA does not lead to an increase in release times. Conversely, reducing elongation speed with CPT does not slow down splicing. Instead, it leads to an increase in pre-release splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), as expected if the two processes are independent. Thus, splicing and release can happen in either order, with the order of events determined by kinetic competition. It is this competition which results in stochastic outcomes for the RNA.</p><p>What are the physiological implications of this stochastic outcome? Does the cell utilize changes in kinetic balance to alter gene expression? Moreover, is the timing of intron removal of secondary importance to the timing of splicing commitment? While, single-cell variation in alternative splicing has been observed, the mechanism behind this variability has remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Waks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). We have found that a single point mutation in U2AF1 that is recurrent in multiple human cancers alters this kinetic balance to favor post-transcriptional splicing of both the β-globin reporter and also endogenous FXR1 mRNAs. Interestingly, single-molecule measurements on fixed cells suggest that post-release splicing may be the preferred pathway for alternatively spliced transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vargas et al., 2011</xref>). Our studies on the mutant U2AF1 provide a mechanistic basis for this observation and suggest a role for mutations in the core splicing machinery for the increased levels of ‘noisy splicing’ which are observed in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pickrell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, our time-resolved results indicate that post-release splicing is more efficient than pre-release splicing, which may explain how the timing of intron removal might lead to different outcomes for the message. Such a model relies on a degree of plasticity in spliceosome assembly and function, which has been suggested by in vitro single-molecule measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shcherbakova et al., 2013</xref>). We speculate that the kinetic delay induced by U2AF1-S34F allows either for alternate pairing between 5′ and 3′ss during transcription or for post-release reconfiguration of pre-mRNA which is not yet committed to intron excision in the spliceosome. Other pathological RNA processing defects may also originate from a similar kinetic imbalance. In summary, the single-molecule approach developed here provides a blueprint for dissecting the many competing processes which take place at the earliest stages of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell line and DNA constructs</title><p>The reporter gene vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) was constructed with the human β-globin DNA sequence placed under the control of a Tet-responsive promoter, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janicki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Darzacq et al., 2007</xref>). Briefly, the 3′ end of the human β-globin sequence was truncated 72 bp upstream of the endogenous stop codon. It was replaced by a cassette coding for the cyan fluorescent protein fused to the peroxisome-targeting sequence serine-lysine-leucine (CFP-SKL), ending with a translation stop codon. A cassette containing 24 repeats of the MS2 stem loop sequence was inserted in the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR), followed by a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence (BGH-PolyA). In our modified construct, we inserted a cassette containing 24 repeats of the PP7 stem loop sequence into the second and last intron of the gene, approximately halfway between the 5′ splice site (5′ss) and the branch point. In order to be the least perturbing, the cassette was inserted 463 bp downstream of the 5′ss and 371 bp upstream of the branch point, and most of the endogenous DNA was conserved (8 bp in the intron were deleted). In addition, we replaced the MS2 cassette with one that is less prone to recombination. The repeating units of the PP7 and MS2 cassettes are composed of two-stem loop blocks, which are then multimerized 12× to get 24× total stem loops:</p><p>MS2: GATCCTACGGTACTTATTGCCAAGAAA<underline>GCACGAGCATCAGCCGTGC</underline>CTCCAGGTCGAATC</p><p>TTCAAA<underline>CGACGACGATCACGCGTCG</underline>CTCCAGTATTCCAGGGTTCATCAG</p><p>PP7: CTAAGGTACCTAATTGCCTAGAAA<underline>GGAGCAGACGATATGGCGTCGCTCC</underline>CTGCAGGTCGA</p><p>CTCTAGAAA<underline>CCAGCAGAGCATATGGGCTCGCTGG</underline>CTGCAGTATTCCCGGGTTCATTAGATC.The loops themselves are underlined.</p><p>The construct was stably integrated into the genomic DNA of U2-OS cells (human osteosarcoma cell line) through transfection of the plasmid followed by a screen for genomic integration.

The cell line also constitutively expresses the PP7 bacteriophage-coat protein fused to the mCherry fluorescent protein (PP7-mCherry) and the MS2 bacteriophage-coat proteins fused to the green fluorescent protein (MS2-GFP).

The reads were trimmed to remove low quality sequences (Trimmomatic software) and were aligned to both the human genome (hg19) and the sequence of the β-globin reporter gene plasmid (Bowtie2 and Illumina CASAVA Eland softwares). Paired reads that partially align to both genomic and plasmid sequences were extracted and used to identify possible insertion sites. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> shows an example of an insertion site: 4 read pairs align with both with genomic sequence (up to chr8:145,074,337) and plasmid sequence (all from the same position in the plasmid backbone). This defines the 5′ junction of the insertion. Similarly, three read pairs were found partially aligning a few bp downstream (chr8:145,074,349) and with the plasimd up to the beginning of the MS2 cassette, defining the 3′ junction. Multiple copies of the plasmid may have been integrated.</p><p>Three insertion sites were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), including two where only one junction was found. All three were confirmed by PCR and the copy number of the reporter in the cell line was obtained as follows. Genomic DNA was isolated from cells (1 × 10 cm plate) by standard protocols, and amplicons were PCR amplified using primer pairs overlapping the putative junctions. The PCR was performed for 24 cycles and the products separated on a 2% agarose gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). All four junctions show a band at the expected size. To estimate the copy number of the inserted plasmid, we also use two primer pairs that amplify a region that is internal to the plasmid construct. Each junction should be present in one copy per cell so that, in comparison, the amount of the internal amplicon should reflect the total copy number in the cell line. The gel was quantitated using the ImageJ software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

It consists in an AxioObserver inverted microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a high aperture objective (Zeiss 63× C-Apochromat) and two Evolve 512 EMCCD cameras (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Excitation sources are 488 nm and 594 nm lasers (Excelsior, Spectra Physics, Santa Clara, CA). Typical laser intensities are 250 μW and 50 μW respectively. For imaging Cerulean, we used a 445 LED (Zeiss Colibri) or an X-Cite lamp (Lumen Dynamics). Cells were imaged in 35-mm MatTek dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) placed in a Tokai Hit stage incubator (INUB-LPS, Shizuoka-ken, Japan). Average temperature inside the dish was measured at 37°C using a thermocouple. Images were taken every 10 s as z-stacks (7 or 9 images, Δz = 0.5 μm) and in both color simultaneously with two cameras, using an exposure time of 100 ms and for a duration between 45 and 512 frames. Raw images were collected using MicroManager software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edelstein et al., 2001</xref>).

Trajectories are then generated based on a nearest-neighbor method with a maximal jump distance threshold. If no spot is detected within the threshold distance, the previous location is used as the initial guess for the iterative Gaussian mask localization procedure. Integrated fluorescence intensity over the diffraction-limited spot is collected using a Gaussian mask fit after local background subtraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thompson et al., 2002</xref>).

This yields a somewhat uniform spacing of time delay points on a logarithmic scale, reducing the sampling noise at long delays while keeping a high temporal resolution at short delays. When shifting the two signals, non-overlapping ends are not wrapped. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> for examples of correlation functions from single traces.</p><p>To reach better statistical convergence, correlation functions from single time traces were averaged together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Each point of the single-trace correlation functions was given a weight corresponding to the number of overlapping time points from the signals used in its computation. Bootstrapping was performed to obtain standard error of the mean correlation functions (SEM). Two normalizations were performed prior to bootstrapping: (i) Baseline subtraction: Slow processes (e.g. bursting, cell cycle) may produce a slow decay which adds up to the fast transcription/splicing kinetics. These are usually well separated; see how the decay is much slower after 200–300 s on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>. The baseline subtraction gets rid of the slow decay, approximating it as a constant offset at short delays. (ii) Normalization with null-delay crosscorrelation G<sub>rg</sub>(0): All 4 correlation functions were normalized using an estimate of G<sub>rg</sub>(0). This was done for 2 reasons: (a) doing this normalization prior to bootstrapping promotes a good convergence of the crosscorrelation at short delays 0 (the most informative part of the correlation functions; See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>—§2). This constrains the fits to capture precisely the temporal features at short delays. (b) This normalization reduces by 1 the number of free parameters of all the models used to fit the data: On unnormalized correlation functions, changing the initiation rate of transcription simply scales up and down all 4 correlation functions together (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>—§1). Normalizing them gets rid of this degree of freedom. Because most of the time G<sub>rg</sub>(0) is inaccurate due to shot noise and/or small tracking error (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,E,F</xref>), we use the estimate (G<sub>rg</sub>(Δt) + G<sub>gr</sub>(Δt))/2 instead (Δt = 10 s is the sampling time).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Confocal microscopy and image processing</title><p>We performed imaging with a confocal laser scanning microscope to observe single RNAs diffusing in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref> [associated supplements], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video5 video6 video7">Videos 5 to 7</xref>).

False positive spots due to nucleoli or localized outside of the nucleus were eliminated using a standard masking procedure. Spots were detected independently in both channels (intron and exon) in 9 videos of 50 frames on average taken with a 3.26 s frame interval. Pairs of red and green spots colocalized by less than 250 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) were hence considered single bi-color particles. The TS was tracked and used as a reference for radial distributions of particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These distributions were normalized by the distribution obtained for random locations in the nucleus (i.e., a value of 1 observed indicates a purely uniform distribution). RNAs in the nucleus being relatively sparse, colocalized particles are expected to be mostly true positive, that is unspliced RNAs. On the other hand, a proportion of the red-only and green-only particles may be false positive (e.g., bi-color RNA only detected in one color). mRNAs being much more abundant than pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), green-only spots should only have a small portion of false positives. It is however difficult to estimate what portion of the red-only spots truly represents free lariat and what is a wrong detection/categorization of pre-mRNA. The fact that the red-only radial distributions and the co-localized radial distribution are very similar suggests that red-only spots have a high proportion of false positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and that lariat lifetime is likely shorter than that of post-release pre-mRNA (i.e. &lt; 13 s). Depletion at distances shorter than 1 μm is due to the difficulty for the spot-localization algorithm to locate two spots closer than this distance.

The enrichment at short distances was fit with a Gaussian distribution as for the confocal data.

Note that the non-null baseline in the radial distributions also reveals a second population of pre-mRNAs which are spliced slower than diffusion in the nucleus. The proportion of this second population as well as its spatial distribution is not affected by U2AF1-S34F mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mechanistic models for RNA synthesis and processing</title><p>In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>—§2, we showed how different features in the geometry of the correlation functions (e.g., position of specific angles, decay times, change of slope, …) are reflecting different aspects of the transcription/splicing kinetics (e.g., elongation speed, intron and exon dwell times, stochastic co- and post transcriptional splicing, …).</p><p>Here, we want to build mathematical models that fully predict the correlation functions given (i) a certain underlying mechanism and (ii) a set of parameters.

Using this generic description, we are able to derive the general expressions of the correlation functions for each scheme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>—Appendix 2). The second step is to generate multiple simple models from each of these schemes by affecting <italic>A</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), <italic>B</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), <italic>C</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), <italic>D</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), <italic>E</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), and <italic>F</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) with particular distributions. For instance, in a model where everything is deterministic, all the distributions will be Diracs. If a certain step includes a stochastic pause, it will involve an exponential distribution. If a step results from the succession of several biochemical reactions, it will involve a gamma distribution. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> summarizes all the different models we derived from each scheme.</p><p>For each of these models (described thereafter), changing the parameter value(s) produces different sets of correlation curves. We fit these correlation curves to the experimental data (see examples for the untreated condition on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A–F</xref>) by fitting all four experimental correlation functions at once. We used a Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least square fitting procedure, giving twice more weight to the crosscorrelations since they carry more information. Only time points up to typically 350∼500 s were used. Fit quality was compared between models using a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>—Appendix 3) on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> (the lower the BIC, the better the fit). The BIC favors simpler models: if two models with different number of parameters fit equally well the data, the BIC penalizes the one with extra degrees of freedom so that only the simplest model is retained.</p><p>In addition, as indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, each model may or may not be consistent with:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>•the geometrical properties of <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>rg</italic></sub>(0) described in the previous section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>; example, scheme I necessarily yields a flat <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>rg</italic></sub>(0<sup>+</sup>) by construction), or</p></list-item><list-item><p>•the fact that transcripts can be released unspliced from the transcription site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Details of schemes and models</title><p>Schematics of each scheme are shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> and the models generated from them are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. The general forms of the correlation functions are derived in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>—Appendix 2.</p><sec id="s4-8-2-1"><title>Scheme I—splicing is post-release</title><p>Here, the red signal always remains as long as the RNA is being transcribed and drops coincidentally with the green signal, when the transcript is released. Model I.1 is the simplest possible: it assumes that everything is deterministic, that elongation proceeds with a constant speed, and that transcript release is instantaneous. It has a single parameter v, representing the speed of the polymerase. In models I.2, we add an elongation pause between the two cassettes. This can represent a pause anywhere between the cassettes, such as, in particular, right after the 3′ splice site (3′ss). This model has two parameters: the elongation speed v and the mean pause time ps. Model I.3 is constructed similarly by introducing an exponentially distributed pause at the 3′ end of the gene. Model I.4 includes pauses both after the 3′ss and at the 3′ end of the gene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2-2"><title>Scheme II—no crosstalk between transcription and splicing</title><p>Once the 3′ss is passed, splicing and transcription proceed independently and may complete in either order for different transcripts as a result of their own stochastic kinetics. The red signal drops either when splicing occurs (after <italic>F</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)) or when the transcript is released (after <italic>E</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)), whichever of the two happens first. Models II.1 and II.2 consider a deterministic elongation (equivalent of model I.1) with either a deterministic or a stochastic splicing time. Models II.3 to II.5 include a pause at the 3′ss, at the 3′ end of the gene, or at both (as for models I.2 to I.4), but also include here a deterministic splicing time. Of all the models described so far, the experimental data is best fit by model II.4 where splicing is deterministic and 3′ end dwell time exponential. Hence, we generated three other closely related models: II.6 where splicing is exponential and 3′ end dwell time deterministic, II.7 where both are exponential, and II.8 where 3′ end dwell time is exponential and splicing follows a gamma distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2-3"><title>Scheme III—checkpoint at 3′ splice site: Elongation pauses after the 3′ss until intron is spliced</title><p>This is an obligatory checkpoint because splicing has to complete before the polymerase keeps elongating, as opposed to models II.3 and II.5 where there is a pause after the 3′ss regardless of the splicing kinetics. By construction, the red signal always drops before the green signal starts rising. Hence, <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>rg</italic></sub>(0) is necessarily null and flat on both sides of the y-axis (first case of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), making it obviously unable to fit our experimental data. For the sake of illustration, we derived two models, respectively with an exponential and a deterministic splicing/pausing time. Both fit very badly the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2-4"><title>Scheme IV—checkpoint at exon end/termination site</title><p>Splicing can only take place after the polymerase has reached the termination site (or the 3′ end of the last exon). Once splicing happens, release of the transcript may require an extra time (distribution <italic>F</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)). In models IV.1 to IV.3, when the polymerase reaches the termination site, splicing occurs either immediately (IV.1), or after an exponentially (IV.2) or gamma distributed (IV.3) delay. Then, the RNA is released after an exponentially distributed time (e.g., for additional 3′ end processing). These three cases correspond to a checkpoint mechanism that holds the splicing process respectively at its last biochemical step, or at 1 or several steps prior to its completion. In this scheme, RNAs cannot be released unspliced. So the only possibility for <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>rg</italic></sub>(0) to show both a break of slope and a rising slope at 0<sup>+</sup> would be that splicing and release occur simultaneously for a fraction of the transcripts. Hence, we built model IV.4 which is similar to model IV.2 except that, for a fraction of the transcripts, release is immediate after splicing. This corresponds to a mechanism where both splicing and RNA 3′-end processing take (independent) exponential times after the termination site is reached, but the RNA is only released when both processes have come to completion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2-5"><title>Scheme V—checkpoint for release</title><p>After the polymerase has passed the 3′ss, elongation and splicing happen independently of each other as in scheme II. However, here, the transcript can only be released after the intron is removed. In models V.1 to V.3, the splicing time is respectively deterministic, exponentially distributed, or follows a gamma distribution, corresponding to different number of biochemical reaction in the splicing process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Model comparison</title><p>Evaluating all the models on each experimental data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>—Appendix 3), we find that, the most likely models are either II.4 or IV.4 in the control case, as well as in many of the other cases. Models IV.3 and V.3 perform well in a number of cases, but only V.3 is consistent with all the geometric features of <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>rg</italic></sub>(0) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), making it also a good candidate to explain the data. Complementary to the BIC, a visual inspection of the fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A–F</xref>) also illustrates how the different models perform. In particular, how badly models II.1 to II.3 fit the data indicates the need for a pause at 3′ end.</p><p>To conclude our modeling and data fitting analysis, three candidate models are able to reproduce the data accurately: II.4, IV.4, and V.3. All three models agree on the following:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>•the delay between splicing and release is stochastic,</p></list-item><list-item><p>•only a fraction of the RNAs are spliced strictly before release,</p></list-item><list-item><p>•pre-release splicing occurs mostly (or exclusively) at the 3′ end of the gene,</p></list-item><list-item><p>•all three models give similar values for delays between events at the transcription site (so that any may be used to report these delays).</p></list-item></list></p><p>These models differ on the causality between events: whether splicing and transcription are independent or one waits for the other cannot be known purely from the correlation curves themselves. Model II.4, however, appears as the simplest of all three since it assumes independence instead of a checkpoint mechanism and has only three parameters. In addition, several strong lines of evidence point toward model II.4. Indeed, only this model is consistent with the following observations:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>•inhibiting splicing does not affect 3′-end dwell time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>),</p></list-item><list-item><p>•inhibiting elongation does not affect splicing time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>),</p></list-item><list-item><p>•some unspliced RNAs can be released from the transcription site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p>These observations argue that splicing and transcription are independent. Hence, we conclude that model II.4 is the most likely mechanism and use it in the main article to report parameter values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>Error on model parameters and statistical tests</title><p>We used error propagation from the correlation functions to obtain SEM on the fitting parameters.

A further reviewer prefers to remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper from Larson and colleagues examines the relative kinetics of pre-mRNA synthesis, splicing, and transcript release from the DNA template. This is an important issue for understanding the coupling of these reactions and an area of substantial interest in the field. The authors use single molecule imaging of a tagged beta-globin RNA substrate carrying fluorescent labels in an intron and the 3' exon to follow the appearance and disappearance of the two labels in living cells. They develop a new and elegant analysis that applies correlation spectroscopy to the intron and exon signals to extract reaction rates for transcriptional elongation, splicing, and release from the gene locus. As seen by others, they find that some splicing occurs at the locus and some after release. Using inhibitors to alter the rates of either transcription or splicing, they show that these rates are essentially independent of each other. They find that there is a significant delay between the time of transcript completion and its release from the locus, with the fraction of splicing seen at the locus in kinetic competition with the elongation and release rates. The intron containing transcripts that are released from the locus appear to be very rapidly spliced as measured in relation to their diffusion from the site of transcription. Finally, the authors present interesting experiments using their system to analyze the effects of a dominant mutation in the U2AF1 splicing factor. U2AF1 mutations have recently been implicated in myelodysplastic syndromes, and the authors show that expression of the mutant factor significantly delays splicing to be mostly after release from the locus.</p><p>The authors present a new analysis of an important problem, and the data in this paper are very strong. All of the reviewers felt that this was an important contribution. However, all the reviewers also found multiple problems with the description of the experiments, the interpretation of the data, and other issues with the language. These are summarized as follows.</p><p>1) The use of the term “stochastic” in the Title and elsewhere and the comparison of stochastic transcription initiation to “stochastic RNA processing” was confusing. The splicing was not necessarily initiating randomly and was completing at a definable rate. Describing the process as a kinetic competition was more apt, but this should be more clearly defined earlier in the paper as a competition between the splicing rate and the combined elongation and release rates.</p><p>2) Throughout the paper, splicing occurring at the gene locus is described as cotranscriptional. Although this usage is seen in other papers, it is not strictly correct. Brody et al and others have described polyA RNA at the locus and the authors here describe a significant dwell time after the 3' end is synthesized. Thus, at least some of the splicing at the locus is presumably taking place on transcriptionally complete RNAs. Making this clearer would avoid confusing constructions like: “co-transcriptional splicing is rarely completed during elongation”. Similarly, the authors seem to imply in places that 3' cleavage is occurring at the time of release. This is not shown and there is data from others to indicate it may at the beginning of the dwell time not the end. Since single molecule transcription experiments in vitro do not show delayed release, the authors might discuss what the delayed release in vivo might mean. Paused polymerase prior to the poly-A site, the need to pass some stage in maturation prior to release, a process that anchors material close to a locus that is absent from an in vitro system, or some other possibility?</p><p>3) The statements that post-transcriptional splicing is more efficient or faster than cotranscriptional splicing (or splicing pre and post release) are also not supported. It is possible that released transcripts have all past a rate limiting step in spliceosome assembly allowing the catalytic step to occur very soon after release. This also weakens their argument that the data indicate a lack of a checkpoint prior to release. While it seems clear that unspliced RNA can be released, this release of RNA may require completing a particular stage of assembly.</p><p>4) There are a number of aspects of the reporter system and its validation that are not described. Some of this may already be published but it should be mentioned and referenced. The constructs to build the gene arrays are poorly described and the origin/construction of the globin gene. The authors should also mention how the kinetics of binding of the MS2 and PP7 fusion proteins to RNA affect interpretation of the results. The authors do not seem to see well defined red spots corresponding to the spliced intron, only spliced exons (green) or unspliced pre-RNA (red+green). Is the half-life of the excised intron known? Could at least the PP7-bound portion of the intron be protected by the coat proteins and thus more stable? The data would argue not, but has this been looked at? Could the coincident red and green spots seen to move away from the locus actually be an excised intron still in complex with the ligated exons? It should also be noted that any synthetic reporter may be missing features found in an endogenous gene and may yield different results. This does not take away from the data, but it is a limitation of the experimental system.</p><p>5) The authors describe testing 21 models to find the best fit to the correlation data. This is very hard to follow. It would be helpful to start with the 5 different mechanistic scenarios and explain how specific model solutions exclude them. Showing a few examples of how a particular hypothesis when translated into a modeled simulation is not compatible with the data might also help the reader. In the main text it is important to give some idea of which conclusions are clearly ruled out from the modeling and which are simply disfavored because their fit to a model is slightly less than others. This is not easy material to explain to a general audience but some sense of how the simulations led to the conclusions is important to convey.</p><p>6) More discussion of how these results fit with others in the field is needed. Recent papers from Carmo Fonseca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martin et al 2013</xref>), Huranova et al, Brody et al and others have also used imaging methods to examine transcription and splicing kinetics, sometimes reaching different conclusions. For non-specialists in the audience, it would be very helpful to have some description of how the methods and results compare, and what might lead to different conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03939.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The use of the term “stochastic” in the Title and elsewhere and the comparison of stochastic transcription initiation to “stochastic RNA processing” was confusing.

In stochastic transcription, events such as a gene switching ON and OFF are stochastic but still have a definable rate. The non-deterministic outcome is the amount of a given RNA in a cell over time. Similarly, in RNA synthesis and processing, events are stochastic and also occur at a definable rate. The non-deterministic outcome is the pathway taken to go from nascent pre-mRNA to mRNA. The simple fact that our data cannot be described by a deterministic model indicates that, by definition, RNA processing is stochastic.</p><p><italic>2) Throughout the paper, splicing occurring at the gene locus is described as cotranscriptional. Although this usage is seen in other papers, it is not strictly correct. Brody et al and others have described polyA RNA at the locus and the authors here describe a significant dwell time after the 3' end is synthesized. Thus, at least some of the splicing at the locus is presumably taking place on transcriptionally complete RNAs. Making this clearer would avoid confusing constructions like: “co-transcriptional splicing is rarely completed during elongation”. Similarly, the authors seem to imply in places that 3' cleavage is occurring at the time of release. This is not shown and there is data from others to indicate it may at the beginning of the dwell time not the end. Since single molecule transcription experiments in vitro do not show delayed release, the authors might discuss what the delayed release in vivo might mean. Paused polymerase prior to the poly-A site, the need to pass some stage in maturation prior to release, a process that anchors material close to a locus that is absent from an in vitro system, or some other possibility?</italic></p><p>The reviewers raise a valid point. Part of the confusion arises from the terminology that is already established in the literature, which is admittedly vague. Our data indicates that RNA is retained for ∼2 minutes after synthesis should be complete. We cannot differentiate between a pause in elongation at the 3’ end and retention of cleaved RNA by tethering to RNAPII or chromatin. By extension, we also cannot determine whether these retained RNAs are poly-adenylated. We have clarified this interpretation by considering every occurrence of the words ‘co-transcriptional’ and ‘post-transcriptional’ throughout the manuscript and either replacing the terms with ‘pre-release’ and ‘post-release’ or reformulating the description all together. We have also made the distinction between release and cleavage.</p><p>We also point out that the alternative explanations for the 3’ pausing enumerated by the referees were present in the original draft.</p><p><italic>3) The statements that post-transcriptional splicing is more efficient or faster than cotranscriptional splicing (or splicing pre and post release) are also not supported. It is possible that released transcripts have all past a rate limiting step in spliceosome assembly allowing the catalytic step to occur very soon after release. This also weakens their argument that the data indicate a lack of a checkpoint prior to release. While it seems clear that unspliced RNA can be released, this release of RNA may require completing a particular stage of assembly</italic>.</p><p>We disagree with this interpretation of our data and have made changes to the text to clarify our results. As now explained, we do think our data shows that splicing is faster post-release than at the site of transcription. If the splicing kinetics were unaffected by the departure of the RNA from the transcription site, one would expect a post-release splicing time of 137 s on average. (This time corresponds to the 267 s for the total splicing time, minus the elongation and release times, calculated only for the transcripts that are released unspliced). The fact that we see a much shorter time (13 s) indicates that the pre-release splicing rate cannot be the same as the post-release splicing rate. In fact, the post-release kinetics are unexpectedly fast. The argument that a transcript is probably highly committed before release, with most of the spliceosome assembled, is a persuasive one with which we find ourselves in agreement, but this statement is not the same as a checkpoint requirement. Our splicing inhibition experiment would appear to be clear-cut in this case: treatment with spliceostatin A, which inhibits U2 snRNP assembly, has no measurable effect on the release time. So if there is a checkpoint, it is before U2 recruitment.</p><p><italic>4) There are a number of aspects of the reporter system and its validation that are not described. Some of this may already be published but it should be mentioned and referenced. The constructs to build the gene arrays are poorly described and the origin/construction of the globin gene</italic>.</p><p>We have added more information about the reporter construct, the coat proteins, and the cell lines to the Methods.</p><p><italic>The authors should also mention how the kinetics of binding of the MS2 and PP7 fusion proteins to RNA affect interpretation of the results</italic>.</p><p>The association rate of the coat protein has a negligible effect on our kinetic measurements. The Greenleaf lab has measured the association rate of MS2 for &gt;3,000 hairpin variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buenrostro et al., 2014</xref>). The variant we use has a k<sub>on</sub> of 0.000538011 nM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. For 1 μM coat protein levels, the average time to associate is 1.85 s. The average time to synthesize the 60 bp repeating unit of the stem loop cassette at 2.6 kb/min is 1.4 s. Therefore, on average, the previous stem loop has already bound coat protein before synthesis of the next stem loop is completed. More importantly, this association time is two orders of magnitude lower than the kinetic quantities we report in this manuscript. We have added a footnote to this effect in the Results.</p><p><italic>The authors do not seem to see well defined red spots corresponding to the spliced intron, only spliced exons (green) or unspliced pre-RNA (red+green). Is the half-life of the excised intron known? Could at least the PP7-bound portion of the intron be protected by the coat proteins and thus more stable? The data would argue not, but has this been looked at?</italic></p><p>The question of imaging lariats is a difficult one. In our case, we do detect a certain amount of red-only particles, and we reported these results in our original submission (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, we cannot say with confidence whether these are actual red-only particles (i.e. free lariats) or simply mis-classified pre-mRNA. If we take this number at face-value, the red-only fraction of the total nuclear RNA pool is ∼ 2%. Based on the spatial distribution around the TS, the lariat lifetime &lt; 10 s. We clarify this aspect of our assay in the main text and explain in greater detail in the Methods section. We also explain why we have much better confidence in the green-only and the dual-color particles.</p><p><italic>Could the coincident red and green spots seen to move away from the locus actually be an excised intron still in complex with the ligated exons? It should also be noted that any synthetic reporter may be missing features found in an endogenous gene and may yield different results. This does not take away from the data, but it is a limitation of the experimental system</italic>.</p><p>We now address these two caveats brought up by the reviewers: that dual-color particle potentially being lariat and mRNA still in complex and that a reporter gene may behave differently from an endogenous one.</p><p><italic>5) The authors describe testing 21 models to find the best fit to the correlation data. This is very hard to follow. It would be helpful to start with the 5 different mechanistic scenarios and explain how specific model solutions exclude them. Showing a few examples of how a particular hypothesis when translated into a modeled simulation is not compatible with the data might also help the reader. In the main text it is important to give some idea of which conclusions are clearly ruled out from the modeling and which are simply disfavored because their fit to a model is slightly less than others. This is not easy material to explain to a general audience but some sense of how the simulations led to the conclusions is important to convey</italic>.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ advice, we reformulated the description of the modeling and model testing. This is now hopefully more understandable by the non-specialist readers. We first describe the 5 different schemes, then we explain that two of them can be ruled out even without having to fit the data and we decide between the other 3 by fitting the correlation functions.</p><p><italic>6) More discussion of how these results fit with others in the field is needed. Recent papers from Carmo Fonseca (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45"><italic>Martin et al 2013</italic></xref><italic>), Huranova et al, Brody et al and others have also used imaging methods to examine transcription and splicing kinetics, sometimes reaching different conclusions. For non-specialists in the audience, it would be very helpful to have some description of how the methods and results compare, and what might lead to different conclusions</italic>.</p><p>We have expanded the discussion of how our results compare to other kinetic measurements in the literature.</p><p>Buenrostro, J.D., Araya, C.L., Chircus, L.M., Layton, C.J., Chang, H.Y., Snyder, M.P., and Greenleaf, W.J.
