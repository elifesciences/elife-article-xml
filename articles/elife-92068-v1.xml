In the follicles of mammalian ovaries, N-cadherin adherens junctions are present between granulosa cells, cumulus cells, and at the interface of cumulus cell transzonal projections and the oocyte. We demonstrate a mechanosensory role of N-cadherin integrating tissue structure and hormonal regulation of follicular morphogenic events including expansion of the cumulus–oocyte complex (COC) matrix, oocyte maturation, and ovulation. Two small molecule N-cadherin antagonists inhibited COC maturation in vitro. Transcriptome profiling revealed that targets of β-catenin and YAP1 pathways were dysregulated by N-cadherin antagonists. In vivo, N-cadherin antagonist significantly reduced ovulation in mice compared to controls (11 vs 26 oocytes/ovary; p = 5.8 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). Ovarian follicles exhibited structural dysgenesis with granulosa and cumulus cell layers becoming disorganised and the connection between cumulus cells and the oocyte disrupted and the transcriptome again indicated altered mechanical sensing causing dysregulation of the Hippo/YAP and β-catenin pathways and extracellular matrix reorganisation. Granulosa-specific N-cadherin depletion in <italic>Cdh2</italic><sup>Fl/FL</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>Cre/+</sup> also showed significantly altered mechanosensitive gene expression and reduced ovulation. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for N-cadherin in ovarian follicular development and ovulation, and the potential to inhibit ovulation through targeting this signalling mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ovulation</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>cell signalling</kwd><kwd>ovary</kwd><kwd>contraception</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1171844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Darryl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INV-001616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Darryl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Research Fellowship APP1110562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Darryl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Research Fellowship APP1117976</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robker</surname><given-names>Rebecca L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000950</institution-id><institution>Cancer Council South Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Beat Cancer Project Early Career Cancer Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mrozik</surname><given-names>Krzysztof M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A critical role for N-cadherin in ovarian follicular development and ovulation is demonstrated with inhibitors or knockout of N-cadherin shown to inhibit ovulation by blocking mechanotransduction of ovulatory genes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Classical (type I) cadherins are calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules that form intercellular adherens junctions thereby regulating cell–cell recognition and the assembly of tissues. These cadherins control a myriad of biological processes including cell migration, proliferation, death, and adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pannekoek et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mrozik et al., 2018</xref>). They consists of extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains. The intracellular domain interacts with a complex composed of β-catenin, α-catenin, p120, and α-actinin that links the type I cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kourtidis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mrozik et al., 2020</xref>). The formation of adherens junctions requires interaction of cadherins within the same membrane to form lateral or <italic>cis</italic>-dimers. These <italic>cis</italic>-dimers then promote intercellular adhesive dimerisation or <italic>trans</italic>-dimers of cadherins on adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vendome et al., 2014</xref>) to form adherens junctions. Intracellular signalling pathways are activated by mechanical force generated through cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions. Two types of cell surface receptors, cadherins and integrins directly mediate cell adhesion and activate intracellular pathways such as β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernández-Sánchez et al., 2015</xref>). Cross-talk between the classical cadherin, N-cadherin (CDH2), and the Hippo signalling pathway is another mechanosensitive signalling axis that regulates cell proliferation and determines organ size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benham-Pyle et al., 2015</xref>). The Hippo-YAP1 signalling is regulated by numerous upstream signals including organ size, extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, and cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vite et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Ovarian follicles are complex multilayered structures required for the development and maturation of oocytes. Follicles also serve as an endocrine organ coordinating the female reproductive cycle, augmenting oocyte maturation and ovulation (the release of the oocyte) at the appropriate time for fertilisation. In growing follicles, the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte provide essential metabolites and maintain oocyte meiotic arrest through transfer of cAMP and cGMP from cumulus cells to oocyte. This communication requires thin cytoplasmic projections known as transzonal projections (TZPs) that extend from the cumulus cells, through the thick ECM of the zona pellucida to contact the oocyte plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena and Terasaki, 2019</xref>). Gap junctions at the cumulus–oocyte cellular contacts transport small molecules such as glucose metabolites, ATP, and cAMP between the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fontana et al., 2020</xref>). Adherens junctions have been proposed to stabilise these cumulus cell–oocyte contacts as a necessary precursor to gap junction formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Hayek et al., 2018</xref>), and the contacts are selectively uncoupled just prior to ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbassi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Contacts between cumulus and granulosa cell layers are critical for the progressive development of ovarian follicles and maturation of oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena and Terasaki, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prunskaite-Hyyryläinen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rowlands et al., 2000</xref>). N-cadherin is present on the intercellular junctions between granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>) and β-catenin has been observed on granulosa and cumulus cell membranes, while another type I cadherin, E-cadherin (CDH1) is expressed on oocyte membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). β-Catenin is also a transcription factor which plays an important role during follicle development and granulosa cell specification in the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>). Constitutive activation of β-catenin in Sertoli cells of the mouse testis drives their trans-differentiation toward ovarian granulosa cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>), while in ovaries constitutive β-catenin induces elevated expression of the estrogen synthesising gene <italic>Cyp19a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2010</xref>). YAP1 also plays a critical role in mediating regulation of follicle development through mechanical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun and Diaz, 2019</xref>). In granulosa cells YAP1 is required for proliferation and promotes differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ji et al., 2017</xref>). However, the respective roles of N- and E-cadherin regulation of β-catenin and YAP1 pathways during ovarian folliculogenesis or oocyte maturation and ovulation has not been investigated.</p><p>Ovulation is initiated by a surge of luteinising hormone from the pituitary, inducing dramatic remodelling of the ovarian follicle ECM, and differentiation of cells. The intercellular junctions between cumulus cells and the oocyte are disrupted as the cumulus–oocyte complex (COC) undergoes dynamic expansion of a unique viscoelastic ECM through gene induction in granulosa and cumulus cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>). This COC matrix expansion is essential for ovulation and fertilisation-potential of oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Russell and Robker, 2007</xref>). The expanded COC acquires an adherent and migratory cell phenotype and can be shown to robustly adhere to ECM components such as fibronectin and collagens that are abundant in the follicle wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akison et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The localisation of N-cadherin on granulosa cells was recently shown to be involved in primordial follicle formation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hernandez Gifford, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Piprek et al., 2020</xref>), and N-cadherin antagonists have also been shown to cause apoptosis of cultured granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makrigiannakis et al., 1999</xref>). We now report previously undiscovered roles for N-cadherin in granulosa cell responses to hormones, as well as COC expansion, oocyte meiotic maturation, and ovulation. Two recently developed, small molecule N-cadherin antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mrozik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smits et al., 2020</xref>) were shown to disrupt the interaction between TZPs and oocytes, and to dysregulate β-catenin and YAP1 signalling pathways in mouse COCs, blocking oocyte meiotic maturation. Furthermore, treatment of mice in vivo with an N-cadherin antagonist blocked ovulation with pervasive effects on β-catenin and YAP1 pathways leading to altered response to ovulation stimulus. Our findings demonstrate a role for N-cadherin mechanosensing to maintain ovarian tissue architecture, and hence the hormone responsiveness essential for oocyte maturation and ovulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>N-cadherin antagonists block acquired periovulatory COC adhesion</title><p>Through screening a small molecule library, we identified two compounds that block the adhesion of periovulatory COCs to fibronectin using the xCELLigence system. Two potent COC adhesion blocking compounds were: (<italic>S</italic>)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenoxy)-3-(4-((<italic>S</italic>)–2-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenoxy) propylamino) piperidin-1-yl)propan-2-ol (CRS-066) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smits et al., 2020</xref>) and 5 [3,4 dichlorobenzyl sulfanyl]4H 1,2,4 triazol 3 amine (LCRF-0006) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mrozik et al., 2020</xref>), both of which are small molecule N-cadherin antagonists. Dose-dependent inhibition of COC adhesion to fibronectin, compared to vehicle controls, was confirmed at doses above 1 μM for CRS-066 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.4 μM) and above 36 μM for LCRF-0006 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 38 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Analogues of both compounds were synthesised with substitutions of two key active chloride side chains on the aromatic ring structure, which abolished the COC adhesion blocking activity at the same concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We confirmed the N-cadherin blocking action of the active compounds by showing they reduced N-cadherin abundance at intercellular contacts in N-cadherin expressing SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2016</xref>).

The N-cadherin depleted areas of follicles showed multiple regions of detached cells suggesting a loss of intercellular adhesion. The expression of putative N-cadherin mechanoresponsive genes Areg and Ptgs2 were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced 2- to 3-fold, respectively, in the granulosa-specific Cdh2 mutants, and Cyp19a1 showed trending (p = 0.08, 2.5-fold) reduced expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), similar to the reduced Cyp19a1 expression reported in <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Fl/FL</sup>;Amhr2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hernandez Gifford et al., 2009</xref>).

Specifically, N-cadherin antagonists, or Cdh2 gene mutation disrupt intercellular contacts between granulosa cells, as well as oocyte–cumulus cell contacts leading to impaired COC expansion, oocyte maturation, and ovulation. Likewise, even incomplete disruption of the Cdh2 gene expression led to a similar disruption to mechanoresponsive gene expression and ovulation. Broad transcriptional changes indicate cross-talk between N-cadherin with β-catenin and Hippo/YAP pathways mediating a mechanical signal that integrates with the hormone actions to regulate genes required for oocyte maturation and ovulation.</p><p>There is evidence that the ovarian follicle is a mechanosensitive organ. Either excess or inadequate tissue rigidity profoundly affects folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation. This is evident in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), a prevalent infertile condition where excess rigid ECM prevents follicle and oocyte growth progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monniaux et al., 2020</xref>). It is also shown in vitro, where isolated follicles in different bioengineered support matrices exhibit reduced follicle growth and viability in soft or rigid environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">West et al., 2007</xref>). Our findings suggest that N-cadherin is a key mechanosensor and transducer of growth and differentiation of granulosa cells, cumulus cells, and oocytes. Consistent with this, dysregulation of β-catenin and Hippo/Yap1 has been shown in conditions of disrupted follicle growth including PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ji et al., 2017</xref>), as well as Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawamura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsuzaki and Darcha, 2013</xref>). Further studies are required to determine the interplay between cadherins and integrins in the cells of ovarian follicles, as both cell surface receptor groups interact with the actin-based microfilaments and regulate similar biological processes.</p><p>Direct physical contacts between cumulus cells and the oocyte are important for transport of cAMP and cGMP via gap junctions to maintain oocyte meiotic arrest. Both in vivo and in vitro N-cadherin antagonists caused disruption of TZPs and cumulus–oocyte cellular contacts in COCs. Disruption of these contacts was recently shown to be a normal event in response to induced COC maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbassi et al., 2021</xref>). The effects of N-cadherin antagonists provide the first evidence confirming that N-cadherin stabilises these unique cell–cell contacts and that premature disruption of the cumulus cell–oocyte contacts is highly detrimental to follicle growth and oocyte maturation. Our observation that two N-cadherin antagonists severely impaired COC expansion and meiotic maturation in IVM while not depleting expression of cumulus matrix genes such as <italic>Has2</italic> suggests that N-cadherin mediates signalling between oocyte and cumulus cells, transducing essential signals necessary for these preovulatory events. This is in line with N-cadherin being a known mechanotransducer and being abundant at cell junctions between cumulus cells and in TZPs at cumulus–oocyte contacts. The disruption of cumulus cell arrangement around oocytes in ovaries of N-cadherin antagonist treated mice also demonstrates the necessity for N-cadherin to stabilise cell–cell contact and maintain the tissue architecture critical for bidirectional cell communication. The possibility of heterotypic interaction of N- and E-cadherin at the cumulus cell–oocyte interface suggests a unique type of intercellular junction in the context of oocytes and cumulus cells with interactomes that are also likely to be specialised. The molecular composition of these adherens complexes, and the mechanism behind cadherin-driven intracellular signalling in the COC clearly warrants further investigation.</p><p>β-Catenin transduces Wnt signalling, and in ovarian cells it is fundamental to specification of the female somatic cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>) establishing female sex determination and follicle formation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hernandez Gifford, 2015</xref>). Our studies are the first to demonstrate that N-cadherin is important for functional gene regulation in the follicle by regulating the β-catenin and Hippo/Yap1 pathways. Reduced expression of β-catenin regulated granulosa cell-specific genes, including <italic>Ptgs2</italic> and <italic>Cyp19a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hernandez Gifford et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 2010</xref>), and changes in the transcriptome profile indicate the loss of β-catenin activity caused by the N-cadherin antagonist. This is consistent with N-cadherin’s reported role stabilising β-catenin at tensile cell junctions and facilitating nuclear translocation in response to Wnt signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelson and Nusse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, our results demonstrate that tissue structure and mechanical force contribute to hormone responsiveness and the steroidogenic phenotype of granulosa cells. We did not see evidence of upregulated testis specific genes indicating that neither N-cadherin antagonist treatment, nor gene depletion was not sufficient to reverse granulosa cell specification as seen with complete β-catenin ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chassot et al., 2008</xref>). However, our results do indicate that N-cadherin stabilises granulosa and cumulus cell phenotypes through β-catenin signalling.</p><p>N-cadherin antagonists also reduced expression of Yap1 target genes with key functions in folliculogenesis (<italic>Ctgf</italic> and <italic>Areg</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2018</xref>), indicating a loss of Yap1 function in vivo. These findings suggest that an ovarian Yap1 mechanosensing pathway, also mediated through N-cadherin, is attenuated in the antagonist treated mice. Trans-cellular interaction of cadherins has been shown to sequester Yap1 in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gumbiner and Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirate et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), and peptide inhibitors of N-cadherin can block nuclear translocation of Yap1 in response to tissue rigidity in mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cosgrove et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, our results show Yap1 signalling in granulosa cells is controlled by N-cadherin and regulates the differentiation status of these cells and their response to hormone stimuli. This conclusion is also supported by the morphological change in follicles of Wnt4-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prunskaite-Hyyryläinen et al., 2014</xref>), and in granulosa-specific Yap1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lv et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that mechanotransduction signals through N-cadherin mediate the reported high Yap1 activity in granulosa cells needed to sustain normal folliculogenesis.</p><p>During IVM of COCs, N-cadherin antagonists blocked COC expansion, and oocyte meiosis. CRS-066 paradoxically increased <italic>Areg</italic> and <italic>Ptgs2</italic>, which are β-catenin repressed genes in COCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2010</xref>). Their induction is consistent with compromised β-catenin function after N-cadherin inhibition in vitro as was seen in vivo. The induction of <italic>Areg</italic>, <italic>Ptgs2</italic>, and the canonical Yap1 target, <italic>Ctgf</italic> all suggest activation of Yap1 by N-cadherin antagonist in IVM. Supporting this, the Yap1 antagonist verteporfin caused dose-dependent repression of <italic>Ctgf</italic>, <italic>Areg</italic>, and <italic>Ptgs2</italic> indicating Yap1 indeed mediates induction of these critical COC maturation genes. This is consistent with reports that show that close contact with oocytes suppresses Yap1 activation in cumulus cells, and that cumulus expansion elicits a mechanical signal that releases this inhibition leading to expression COC maturation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun and Diaz, 2019</xref>). Thus, N-cadherin antagonist-mediated inhibition of mechanotransduction disrupted the normal regulation of Yap1. Ctgf mediates size regulation of many organs and is a known ovarian mitogen that directly regulates follicle development and ovulation by upregulating activin-dependent LOX-mediated extracellular remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagashima et al., 2011</xref>). N-cadherin antagonism during IVM and in vivo consistently showed that Lysyl oxidase, activin binding and ECM remodelling were among the most affected molecular functions, further supporting our proposed model of N-cadherin acting through Hippo/Yap1/Ctgf to regulate COC expansion, meiotic maturation, and ovulation. The inverse effect of LCRF-0006 on <italic>Ctgf</italic> expression in IVM suggests the two antagonists differ not only in their potency but have different effects on N-cadherin signalling responses. Further investigation is required to determine whether this observation is explained by the targeting of different binding pockets of N-cadherin by LCRF-0006 and CRS-066. Since Yap1 and β-catenin have divergent effects on <italic>Ptgs2</italic> and <italic>Areg and</italic> are both influenced by N-cadherin antagonists, the activation/inactivation state of these individual pathways is difficult to unravel, however it is clear the net effect mediated through N-cadherin cell contacts plays a key role in mediating follicle growth and differentiation.</p><p>In conclusion, our study identified N-cadherin as a mechanosensory regulator important in ovarian granulosa cell differentiation and response to hormone stimuli both in vivo and in vitro. The action of N-cadherin through β-catenin and Yap1 signal transducers places new emphasis on the role of these pathways as mediators of hormone responses that also incorporates mechanical cues such as the size and physical tension within the ovary, which is influenced by the neighbouring growing follicles as well as ECM composition. Dysregulation of this mechanism has important implications for conditions such as premature ovarian failure, PCOS, and fibrosis as well as other forms of unexplained infertility. Additionally, the potential to target this signalling pathway with small molecule inhibitors, to block ovulation is an illustration the principle of non-hormonal ovulation blocking contraceptives.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Study approval</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the University of Adelaide Animal Ethics Committee (Ethics approval IDs M-2018-071 and M-2018-117) and conducted in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Animals and drug treatments</title><p>Hybrid F1 (CBA female/C57 male) prepubertal female mice (21-day-old, weighting 10–12 g) were purchased from Laboratory Animal Services (University of Adelaide) and were maintained on a 12-hr light and 12-hr dark cycle, with rodent chow and water provided ad libitum.

Prior studies have shown that this is the principal cadherin expressed by the follicular granulosa cells. Two main strategies are used - small-molecule inhibitors that target N-cadherin and a conditional knockout where the gene encoding N-cad is deleted in granulosa cells. The authors also take advantage of the ability to reproduce key events of folliculogenesis, such as oocyte meiotic maturation, in vitro. Four main conclusions are drawn from the studies: (i) cadherin-based cell contact is required to maintain cadherin (N-cad in the granulosa cells; E-cad in the oocyte) at the plasma membrane; (ii) N-cad is required for cumulus layer expansion; (iii) N-cad is required for meiotic maturation of the oocyte; (iv) N-cad is required for ovulation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The experiments are logically conceived, clearly described and presented, and carefully interpreted. A key strength of the paper is that multiple approaches have been used (drugs, knockouts, immunofluorescence, PLA, in vitro and in vivo studies). Taken together, they clearly establish essential roles for N-cadherin during folliculogenesis.</p><p>It is intriguing that, when cadherin activity is impaired, the cadherins are lost from the plasma membrane. This suggests that, in a multicellular context, interactions with other cadherins, either in cis within the same cell or in trans with a neighboring cell, are required to maintain cadherins at the membrane. Hence, beyond their significance for understanding female reproductive biology, these experiments have broader implications for cell biology.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A few points could be considered or clarified by the authors:</p><p>The YAP experiments were confusing to the reviewer. CRS-066 increased YAP activity, as indicated by increased expression of target genes. Since CRS-066 prevents expansion, this result suggests that YAP antagonizes expansion. Therefore, blocking YAP should favor expansion. Yet, the YAP inhibitor impaired expansion. In the reviewer's eyes, these results seem to be contradictory.</p><p>It is intriguing that the inhibitors were able to efficiently block oocyte maturation. Oocytes from which the cumulus granulosa cells have been removed (denuded) will mature in vitro in the absence of LH or EGF.

The authors performed several in vitro and in vivo mice experiments, using diverse techniques to reinforce their results.</p><p>First, they identified two compounds (N-cadherin antagonists) that block the adhesion of periovulatory COCs to fibronectin through screening a small molecule library, using the xCELLigenceTM system, performing proper and complementary controls.

And that these adherens complexes between cumulus cells and oocytes were disrupted when inhibited N-cadherin, as observed by nice representative confocal images. Then, the authors assessed COC expansion and oocyte meiotic maturation to determine whether the loss of oocyte membrane β-catenin and E-cadherin upon N-cadherin inhibitor treatment disrupts the bi-directional communication between cumulus cells and the oocyte. Indeed, N-cadherin antagonists disrupted both processes (cumulus expansion and oocyte meiotic).

N-cadherin antagonist CRS-066 (but not LCRF-0006) significantly reduced mouse ovulation compared to controls. RNA-sequencing data analysis identified distinct gene expression profiles in CRS-066 treated compared to control ovaries.

What are the authors' ideas that could explain these discrepancies in outcomes?</p></disp-quote><p>Comparing the responses in IVM COCs to in vivo whole ovaries carries multiple caveats, though as noted, the observations are consistent with altered mechanotransduction in each case. It is important to note the change in pre-ovulatory follicle gene expression in vivo, which likely affects the response of follicles to ovulatory stimulus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors stated that the ovaries from mice treated in the same manner and collected either before hCG treatment (eCG 44 h) or 11 h after hCG showed equivalent numbers of follicles at each stage of development from primary to antral. However, in Panel l from Figure 5, there is a significant increase in the number of antral follicles in the CRS-066 group (hCG 11 h) compared to the vehicle. Could the author discuss it in the manuscript?</p></disp-quote><p>A small change in these follicle types was significant in hCG 11h treated mice and is consistent with the altered response to the ovulatory stimulus and reduced ovulation resulting in persistent antral follicles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Is the mechanism by which the small molecules block N-cad's adhesive activity known? And is the stable residence of cadherins in the plasma membrane known to depend on their engagement with other cadherins either in cis or in trans?</p></disp-quote><p>Adhesion interactions between N-cadherin in Cis or Trans results in their clustering and enrichment at the membrane. Molecular docking models of the small molecule N-cadherin inhibitors are not available. However, these inhibitors were designed as peptidomimetics of the N-cadherin amino-terminus that is shown to interacts in Trans with N-cadherin on neighbouring cells (Blaschuk OW. Front Cell Dev Biol. 2022 Mar 3;10:866200).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the inhibitors are blocking cadherin activity, one might have expected the cumulus cell mass to disaggregate into individual cells. Yet, Figures 3a and 3c show that this does not happen. Could the authors speculate how the cells are being held together?</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
