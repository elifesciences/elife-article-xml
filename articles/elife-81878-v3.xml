With the rising prevalence of diabetes and an aging population, the burden of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and premature deaths, is also set to rise in parallel. Diabetes accounts for 30–50% of all chronic kidney disease (CKD) cases, affecting 285 million people worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Webster et al., 2017</xref>). As CKD is asymptomatic till more than 50% of kidney function decline, early detection of individuals with diabetes who are at risk of developing DKD may facilitate prevention and appropriate intervention for DKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirst et al., 2020</xref>). However, early identification of individuals at risk of developing CKD in type 2 diabetes is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alicic et al., 2017</xref>). Although most ESKD cases are due to diabetes, awareness of diabetes as a risk factor for CKD is markedly lower in several countries, which may constitute a barrier for early detection of CKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">White et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hussain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Couser et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, in people with diabetes, adherence to annual screening for DKD with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) remains a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manski-Nankervis et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, there is an urgent need for the characterization of new biomarkers to identify individuals at risk of progressive eGFR decline and enable timely intervention for improving outcomes in DKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alicic et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several risk prediction models have been developed in the past for predicting progression to ESKD, but studies predicting onset of CKD in diabetic populations are limited. These studies were focused on clinical populations utilizing data from clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunkler et al., 2015</xref>) or heterogeneous cohorts of patients with different CKD definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Dunkler et al. showed that albuminuria and eGFR were the key predictors and addition of demographic, clinical, or laboratory variables did not improve predictive performance beyond 69% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunkler et al., 2015</xref>). Current CKD risk prediction models developed using traditional regression models (e.g., logistic regression [LR] or linear regression) perform well when there are only small or moderate numbers of variables or predictors but tend to overfit if there is a large number of variables. Machine learning (ML) methods using ‘Big data,’ or multidimensional data, may improve prediction as they have fewer restrictive statistical assumptions compared to traditional regression models that assume linear relationships between risk factors and the logit of the outcomes and absence of multicollinearity among explanatory variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sundström and Schön, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doupe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Diabetes is a metabolic disorder, and the metabolic changes associated with diabetes can lead to glomerular hypertrophy, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial inflammation, and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alicic et al., 2017</xref>). Several blood metabolites have been shown to be associated with DKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colhoun and Marcovecchio, 2018</xref>). Similarly, genetic abnormalities in diabetes have also been linked to an increased risk of DKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cole and Florez, 2020</xref>). We, and several others, have previously shown that retinal microvascular changes, including retinopathy, vessel narrowing, or dilation, and vessel tortuosity, were associated with CKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yip et al., 2017</xref>). Integrating high-dimensional data from multiple domains, including patient characteristics, clinical and ‘Omics’ data, has the potential to aid in risk stratification, prediction of future risk, and provide insights into the pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eddy et al., 2020</xref>). These features may contribute to prediction in very complicated ways, and they may not fully satisfy the requirement for a simple linear logistic model. It is thus more appropriate to consider ML approaches for a comprehensive study.</p><p>In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a set of the most common ML models, including traditional LR, for predicting the 6-year risk of DKD and identifying important predictors of DKD in a large population-based cohort study in Singapore with multidimensional data, including imaging, metabolites, and genetic biomarkers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>Data for this study was derived from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study, a population-based prospective study of eye diseases in 10,033 Asian adults aged 40–80 y in Singapore. The follow-up study was conducted after a median duration of 6.08 y (interquartile range: [5.56, 6.79]), with 6762 participants. The detailed methodology of SEED has been published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Majithia et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, the name list of adults residing in the southwestern part of Singapore was provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs, and then an age-stratified random sampling procedure was conducted. A total of 3280 Malays (2004–2007) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foong et al., 2007</xref>), 3400 Indians (2007–2009), and 3353 Chinese (2009–2011) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lavanya et al., 2009</xref>) participated in the baseline study with response rates of 78.7, 75.6 and 72.8%, respectively. As all three studies followed the same methodology and were conducted in the same study clinic, we combined the three populations for the present study. For the current analysis, we included only those with diabetes, defined as random glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L, HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), self-reported antidiabetic medication use, or having been diagnosed with diabetes by a physician. Of the 6762 participants who attended both baseline and follow-up visit, after excluding those without diabetes (n = 5307), prevalent CKD (n = 315), missing information on eGFR (n = 90), the final sample size for analysis was 1365 (47.5% Indians, 27.8% Malays, and 24.7% Chinese). The sample size available for each dataset after removing participants missing &gt;10% data was between 976 and 1364 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1-Table 1a</xref>). SEED was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board (2018/2717, 2018/2921, 2012/487/A, 2015/2279, 2018/2006, 2018/2594, 2018/2570). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Assessment of DKD</title><p>Incident DKD was defined as an eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> with at least a 25% decrease in eGFR at follow-up in participants who had eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> at baseline. Combining change in eGFR category together with a minimal percent change ensures that small changes in eGFR, for example, from 61 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, are not misinterpreted as incident CKD as the eGFR is &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yip et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stevens et al., 2013</xref>). The reduction in eGFR at follow-up was calculated as a percentage of the baseline eGFR as (eGFR at baseline – eGFR at follow-up)/eGFR at baseline * 100%. GFR was estimated from plasma creatinine using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levey et al., 2009</xref>).

We organized the variables into five different domains: traditional risk factors, extended risk factors, imaging parameters, genetic parameters, and blood metabolites. For ML analysis, based on different combinations of the five domains, we tested six models (A to F): A = traditional risk factors; B = A + extended risk factors; C = B + imaging parameters; D = B + genetic parameters; E = B + blood metabolites; F = B + imaging parameters + blood metabolites + genetic parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Traditional risk factors (n = 7)</title><p>Age, sex, ethnicity (Chinese, Malays, and Indians), body mass index (BMI, kg/m<sup>2</sup>), systolic blood pressure (BP, mm Hg), duration of diabetes (years), and HbA1c% were included as traditional risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Extended risk factors (n = 22)</title><p>Participant information was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire (demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle factors, and personal history of diseases and medication use), physical examination (height, weight, BP), and laboratory examination (blood glucose, creatinine, lipid profile) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Majithia et al., 2021</xref>). Marital status, educational level (primary/below [≤6 y], secondary/above [7 y and above of education]), monthly income, smoking status (current smokers vs. former and nonsmokers), alcohol consumption (ever vs. nondrinkers), history of CVD (self-reported history of myocardial infarction, stroke or angina), hypertension status, diastolic BP, pulse pressure, blood glucose, total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, antidiabetic including oral hypoglycemia drugs and insulin, antihypertensive, and anticholesterol medication use were included as part of extended risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Blood metabolites (n = 223)</title><p>We quantified 228 metabolic measures from stored serum/plasma samples at baseline using a high-throughput NMR metabolomics platform (Nightingale Health, Helsinki, Finland).

Predictive accuracy was assessed using metrics such as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval (CI) , sensitivity and specificity calculated at the optimal cut-point (determined by Youden’s index). In preliminary analyses, testing different combinations of features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>), performance of all ML models was below 0.80 in dataset D including genetic features (best AUC = 0.785 by RF) and dataset F including all 339 features (best AUC = 0.788 by XGB).

In LR, stepwise selection according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is widely used but it lacks stability. LASSO is an extension of LR with L1 regularization to drop the less important variables. EN is like LASSO but with a milder regularization, resulting in a larger number of retained variables. In order to select only the most predictive features, we recursively apply EN until the retained variable subset is optimized, that is, recursive feature selection (RFE). In RF, GBDT, and XGB, the most predictive variables were identified based on their relative importance to model performance. Feature selection was also performed according to their selection frequency during repeated cross-validation. We identified the top 15 predictors by each of the best-performing ML models, then compared the performance of the ML models based on the top variables with that of LR based on seven traditional risk factors (age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, HbA1c, duration of diabetes, and systolic BP) in another 40 random repeats of 5-fold cross-validation. Subgroup analyses were conducted for the three ethnic groups separately.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We compared the baseline characteristics of participants with diabetes by incident DKD status using χ<sup>2</sup> test or Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test as appropriate for the variable and compared the socioeconomic status by ethnicity using χ<sup>2</sup> test and Kruskal–Wallis test as appropriate for the variable. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value&lt;0.05. Subgroup numbers such as DR status may not add up due to the presence of missing data. For modeling, we used mean values/modes for missing value imputation as appropriate for each variable because the missing proportions were all below 10%. Improvement in prediction accuracy by ML over the traditional risk factor model was calculated as (ML AUC – traditional model AUC)/traditional model AUC * 100%. All analyses were conducted using R software version 4.0.2. To assess whether the features selected by ML models were meaningful, we visualized the association of top 15 variables with incident DKD in forest plots or a variable importance plot as appropriate for the algorithm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The 6-year incidence of DKD was 11.9% in the study population.

The top 15 predictors by EN using RFE identified several metabolites related to lipid concentration, lipoprotein subclasses, fatty acids, and ketone bodies as novel predictors besides confirming traditional predictors, including age, ethnicity, antidiabetic medication use, presence of hypertension, DR, higher levels of systolic BP, HbA1c, and lower levels of eGFR.

As the median duration of development of DKD was ~10 y since the onset of diabetes, predicting 1-year risk may not be sufficient. Huang et al. predicted DKD risk in 1838 adults with diabetes and prediabetes who participated in the KORA study in Germany. The authors used ML models SVM, RF, and Ada Boost based on 14 clinical factors and 125 metabolites. The best achieved AUC was 0.857, which is similar to that of our model using EN (AUC = 0.851) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we observed that when the features were limited to the traditional risk factors, the performance of LR was similar to that of the best ML model EN. However, when the number of features was large, LR’s performance dropped significantly compared to the top-performing ML models, including EN, LASSO, and GBDT. While ML models are capable of addressing complex variable effects and nonlinearity issues, herein we found regularized regression models (EN and LASSO) outperforming other more sophisticated models. This suggests that the pathophysiological progression from diabetes to CKD may not be as nonlinear as previously assumed. At CKD stage 4, heterogeneity in terms of disease trajectory is primarily low, and nonadditive effects are likely to be negligible, which could explain the superior performance of EN and LASSO in our study. In a previous study based on the same dataset as the current study, Nusinovici et al. tested the performance of several ML models utilizing 20 risk factors alone and found that the performance of LR (AUC = 0.905) was similar to that of the best ML model, GBDT (AUC = 0.903), for predicting incident CKD in those with and without diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nusinovici et al., 2020</xref>). When a large number of features are present, more advanced ML methods may capture the complex functional dependency of the incident CKD outcome much better than the linear approach used in LR.</p><p>The top-performing ML models (EN, LASSO, GBDT) identified established risk factors for DKD, such as age, ethnicity, antidiabetic medication use, presence of hypertension, DR, higher levels of systolic BP, HbA1c, and lower levels of eGFR. Additionally, antihypertensive medication use and low housing type were identified by LASSO while BMI and duration of diabetes by GBDT. Increasing age, longer duration of diabetes, higher levels of HbA1c, systolic BP/hypertension are well-known risk factors of DKD. A meta-analysis conducted by Nelson et al., including 15 multinational cohorts with diabetes as part of the CKD Prognosis Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nelson et al., 2019</xref>), also identified older age, hypertension, lower eGFR, higher levels of BMI, HbA1c, and antidiabetic medication use as significant risk factors for incident CKD in those with diabetes. While black ethnicity was a risk factor for CKD in the meta-analysis, in our study, we found Chinese and Malay ethnicity to be at higher risk of developing incident DKD compared to Indian ethnicity. Compared to the Indian population, the Chinese population was generally older, while Malay participants had lower education levels and higher prevalence of smoking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 -Table 1g</xref>). Both Chinese and Malays had a higher prevalence of hypertension and lower levels of antidiabetic medication use, which may contribute to the ethnic difference in DKD incidence. Another reason for the lower risk of developing DKD in the Indian ethnicity could be that as a high-risk group for diabetes they may be more aware of the risk and comply with screening, medication, and other measures that can reduce their risk of developing DKD. Malay ethnicity has been identified to be a high-risk group for CKD by several studies conducted in Singapore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sabanayagam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">National Registry of Diseases Office, 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, sex was not identified to be a risk factor by any of the three ML models, which is consistent with the findings of the Ravizza et al. algorithm based on data-driven feature selection that did not pick up sex as one of the priority features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ravizza et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, several new predictors from the metabolites domain were identified. Specifically, lipid metabolites, including phospholipids in HDL and VLDL subclasses, cholesterol esters, and free cholesterol in HDL subclasses, were found to be associated with an increased risk of DKD, while cholesterol esters in IDL were found to be protective against DKD. Furthermore, higher levels of DHA, acetate, and tyrosine also showed a protective association (odds ratios not shown). These findings are consistent with previous studies. For example, in the ADVANCE trial, higher tyrosine levels were associated with an increased risk of microvascular complications in diabetic participants. DHA, a n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), has been shown to reduce renal inflammation and fibrosis and slow down the progression of CKD in animal models with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mathi Thumilan et al., 2016</xref>). PUFA supplementation has also been shown to reduce hyperglycemia-induced pathogenic mechanisms by its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and improve renal function in diabetic nephropathy patients . Furthermore, higher levels of the short-chain fatty acid acetate have been shown to be inversely associated with diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2020b</xref>), and have beneficial effects in mice models with type 2 diabetes by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><p>The strengths of our study include a multiethnic Asian population with a long follow-up and the availability of a wealth of information. The use of RFE for dimension reduction and feature selection reduced overfitting of data. ML models identified the relative importance of one domain over the other domains (like metabolite features in our study compared to genetic features) and the best predictors within one domain. However, our study results should be interpreted in light of a few limitations. First, our definition of DKD was based on the measurement of a single blood creatinine both at baseline and follow-up. This could have resulted in some misclassification, but the bias would be nondifferential and similar across both outcomes. Second, albuminuria, an important predictor of DKD, was not included as it was missing in a substantial number of participants. Third, external validation was not performed. Fourth, ML models are computationally intensive compared to traditional regression models.</p><p>In conclusion, in a population-based sample of multiethnic Asian adults, we found that EN with specific metabolites outperformed the current DKD risk prediction models using demographic and clinical variables. Our results provide evidence that combining metabolites and ML models could improve the prediction accuracy for DKD and that increasing the use of ML techniques may discover new risk factors for DKD. Further testing in external populations would support the validity of the model.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>SEED was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board [2018/2717, 2018/ 2921, 2012/487/A, 2015/2279, 2018/2006, 2018/2594, 2018/2570].

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Martin Pollak as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Statistical significance versus clinical significance:</p><p>The authors seem to use recursive feature elimination to come up with a set of top features for each Ml algorithm and select features from a varied feature set. However, the authors may need to pay attention to what the features (that come up as significant) are trying to allude to? for e.g. the authors seem to have dropped the datasets with features that contain the genetic and imaging parameters: D= B+ Genetic parameters and F= B+ Imaging parameters+ Blood metabolites+ Genetic parameters. They provide reasons for the low performance of the ML models for dropping the features but do not elaborate on whether they investigated the reasons for the drop in performance.</p><p>2) The authors speak about the advantage of using ML approaches to overcome shortcomings of traditional assumptions from linear models, however, in the consideration of their covariates they might also want to understand the clinical association between some of their selected features. for e.g. BMI, HbA1c, duration of diabetes, and systolic BP may somehow not be entirely independent of each other (especially in the context of influencing one another and driving diabetes) and multi-collinearity may need to be looked into.</p><p>3) One of the biggest limitations of the study is its longitudinal nature with 6 yr timeframe for the development of DKD. That is a long timeframe to be able to discount factors other than those mentioned that could have affected the development of kidney disease. For example, patients with diabetes are also at risk for heart diseases, infections, and other hospital admissions, all of which can affect the development of kidney disease over that timeframe and haven't been controlled for in the dataset.

However, the authors may need to pay attention to what the features (that come up as significant) are trying to allude to? for e.g. the authors seem to have dropped the datasets with features that contain the genetic and imaging parameters: D= B+ Genetic parameters and F= B+ Imaging parameters+ Blood metabolites+ Genetic parameters. They provide reasons for the low performance of the ML models for dropping the features but do not elaborate on whether they investigated the reasons for the drop in performance.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the question. We would like to clarify that our decision to drop genetic features and imaging parameters was based on both statistical and clinical significance.</p><p>Although not included in the main text, we analysed an additional set of features: B + Imaging parameters + Blood metabolites, getting median AUC scores of 0.840 by EN, 0.812 by LASSO, 0.806 by GBDT, 0.804 by XGB, 0.774 by RF, 0.727 by SVM, 0.688 by CART, 0.665 by NB, and 0.617 by LR. The results showed that imaging parameters did not provide additional predictive value beyond what was already captured by the metabolites (set E). Furthermore, adding genetic factors to set D and F always resulted in a decline in performance, indicating that genetic data carried more noises than signals.</p><p>From a clinical perspective, DKD is driven by multiple causes from different domains, including genetics, metabolites, environmental exposures, etc. While imaging parameters based on retinal fundus photography may provide insights into the microvasculature patterns in end-organs, they are indirectly related to kidney function. On the other hand, circulating metabolites are directly associated with kidney function since the kidney plays a critical role in metabolism. Genetic factors are also directly linked, but may not reflect the dynamic changes of bio-chemical reactions that may show early signs of DKD, and they do not always represent environmental exposures such as lifestyle and socio-economic status. Therefore, we believe that metabolites are more clinically relevant for predicting DKD in our population. Moreover, given the correlation between metabolites, genetics, and retinal micro-vasculature, after dropping certain features due to their lower predictive value or higher noise, some of their information may still be available through the selected metabolites or extended risk factors (e.g., diabetic retinopathy). We hope this clarifies our rationale for selecting features for our models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors speak about the advantage of using ML approaches to overcome shortcomings of traditional assumptions from linear models, however, in the consideration of their covariates they might also want to understand the clinical association between some of their selected features. for e.g. BMI, HbA1c, duration of diabetes, and systolic BP may somehow not be entirely independent of each other (especially in the context of influencing one another and driving diabetes) and multi-collinearity may need to be looked into.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We have taken into account the possibility of multicollinearity among our selected features and have evaluated the correlation between them using Spearman's correlation coefficients. For our primary model based on the EN algorithm, we found low levels of multicollinearity among any pairs of continuous variables, with correlation coefficients ranging from -0.49 to 0.43. We further assessed the generalized variance inflation factor (GVIF) in a multivariable logistic regression setting, and found that GVIF^(1/(2*Df)) ranged from 1.1 to 1.3, indicating low levels of multicollinearity.</p><p>However, we did observe high levels of multicollinearity between certain variables in the LASSO and GBDT models, including L-LDL-CE% and IDL-C% (=0.85), systolic BP and pulse pressure (=0.85), and DHA and HAFA (=0.76). This is not unexpected as machine learning algorithms like LASSO and GBDT were designed to be robust even in the presence of multicollinearity<sup>1-3</sup>.</p><p>Overall, we agree that the potential for multicollinearity among our selected features is an important consideration. We have evaluated this possibility and believe that the primary model based on the EN-selected variables is valid given its low levels of multicollinearity among the variables. We have added in the manuscript, results that:</p><p>“We found low collinearity in EN-selected features (Spearman's correlation coefficients: -0.49 to 0.43), while LASSO and GBDT selected some variables of higher correlation (e.g., systolic BP and pulse pressure).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One of the biggest limitations of the study is its longitudinal nature with 6 yr timeframe for the development of DKD.

We have added the insulin use data in supplementary Table S7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Suggest discussing the “top 15” predictors in the 3 models and proposed mechanisms that are not traditional risk factors (e.g. 3-hydroxybutyrate in the GBDT model; acetate in the EN model).</p></disp-quote><p>(Similar to Reviewer #3 point 7) Thank you for your suggestion. We agree that discussing the mechanism of the selected metabolites in DKD development is an interesting point. However, it is important to note that while these metabolites were selected by machine learning, their relationship with DKD incidence may not be causal and further research is needed to fully understand their significance. As such, caution should be exercised in interpreting the results. Investigating the mechanism further would be valuable, and we will consider this point in future research.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.

One major concern I still have is its longitudinal nature with 6 yr timeframe for the development of DKD. The authors have noted that as the AUC of the model is 0.85, baseline characteristics are good enough to predict DKD. If we look closely though the incidence of DKD was &lt;12%. It is thus an unbalanced dataset and therefore AUC is likely an inflated value that needs to be interpreted with caution. I realize that ultimately this is the data that the authors have and it is still a valuable addition to the literature but this is an important limitation that needs to be acknowledged upfront.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for his insightful comment. We have now included the following sentences as an additional limitation in page 18, paragraph 1 as follows:</p><p>“Fourth, the 6-year incidence of DKD in our cohort was relatively low, with less than 12% of participants developing DKD within that timeframe. It is thus possible that the unbalanced distribution of outcomes in our dataset may have inflated the value of AUC that needs to be interpreted with caution.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
