The ATR-dependent intra-S checkpoint pathway mediates detection and processing of sites of replication fork stalling to maintain genomic integrity. Several factors involved in the global checkpoint pathway have been identified, but the response to a single replication fork barrier (RFB) is poorly understood. We utilized the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>-based Tus-<italic>Ter</italic> system in human MCF7 cells and showed that the Tus protein binding to <italic>TerB</italic> sequences creates an efficient site-specific RFB. The single fork RFB was sufficient to activate a local, but not global, ATR-dependent checkpoint response that leads to phosphorylation and accumulation of DNA damage sensor protein γH2AX, confined locally to within a kilobase of the site of stalling. These data support a model of local management of fork stalling, which allows global replication at sites other than the RFB to continue to progress without delay.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>Tus-TerB</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>replication stress</kwd><kwd>genomic instability</kwd><kwd>ATR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-CA187069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Powell</surname><given-names>Simon N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50-CA247749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Powell</surname><given-names>Simon N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM045751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schildkraut</surname><given-names>Carl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-CA085344</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schildkraut</surname><given-names>Carl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Powell</surname><given-names>Simon N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-CA013330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schildkraut</surname><given-names>Carl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AG023475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Twayana</surname><given-names>Shyam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cells exhibit a localized ATR-dependent DNA damage response to a site-specific stalled replication fork that is distinct from that observed after global replication stress.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genomic DNA is constantly exposed to exogenous and endogenous damaging agents, forming DNA lesions that challenge the progression of replication forks (RFs) during the S-phase of the cell cycle. The genome contains natural impediments, which cause replication stalling such as common fragile sites, repeated sequences, non-B structures, sites of collision between transcription and replication machinery, or DNA-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mirkin and Mirkin, 2007</xref>). These replication fork barriers (RFB) can impede the progression of the replication machinery and, if unresolved, lead to genomic instability, a common hallmark of aneuploidy, neurological and neuromuscular disorders, and cancer.</p><p>Replication stress can impede the progression of the replication fork. During replication stress, the intra-S phase checkpoint pathway can be activated at a local and global level, which is a critical step to process the DNA lesions and maintaining genome integrity. The S-phase checkpoint involves the uncoupling of replicative polymerases from the replicative helicase and the generation of ssDNA, which rapidly gets coated with RPA. In turn, this activates ATR/ATRIP kinase signaling with its effector kinase CHK1, plus phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser139 in response to a variety of lesions that promote cell cycle arrest, fork stabilization, and restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iyer and Rhind, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iyer and Rhind, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Willis and Rhind, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies suggest that the local and global intra-S checkpoints are two distinct mechanisms that can be distinguished by the signaling intensity of detecting DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saxena and Zou, 2022</xref>). It is thought that a threshold of DNA damage must be reached to activate the global checkpoint and impact cell cycle progression during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bantele et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shimada et al., 2002</xref>). The local checkpoint reacts to a unique replication fork stalling site, which does not impact overall cell cycle progression. The proteins involved in the global replication stress response have been identified using DNA damaging agents that lead to multiple DNA lesion formation randomly throughout the genome. Nevertheless, the mechanism and timing of the checkpoint pathway at a local scale remain largely unknown and are critical to understanding the series of processes at a single RF stall.</p><p>In the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> genome, the DNA pausing sequences called terminator (Ter) are recognized by a protein called Tus to cause a polar site-specific arrest of the RF at the end of the bacterial chromosome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hiasa and Marians, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hidaka et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mulcair et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roecklein et al., 1991</xref>). The Tus-<italic>Ter</italic> complex leads to a temporarily locked complex on DNA that can be overcome by the fork arriving in the opposite direction, displacing Tus to terminate replication. The artificial <italic>E. coli</italic>-based Tus/Ter system has previously been employed in mouse embryonic stem cells to measure homologous recombination repair products and investigate the DNA repair pathway choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandramouly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Willis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Willis et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we integrated a plasmid with five repeats of the <italic>TerB</italic> sequence in the non-permissive orientation, referred to as pWB15, at a unique site within chromosome 12 of the breast cancer cell line MCF7 (MCF7 5C-TerB clone). We utilized the integrated Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> system in human MCF7 cells to artificially generate individual RFBs and investigated the activation of the S-phase checkpoint signaling mechanism. We show that Tus/Ter creates an efficient site-specific RFB in human cells and observed local activation of ATR signaling, which was responsible for the phosphorylation of DNA damage marker γH2AX at the stall sites. When a replication fork pauses at the local Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> block, we do not detect any alteration in global replication profiles. Our system allows us to study the ATR-checkpoint activity as a local response to a single RFB.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tus is found enriched at <italic>TerB</italic> sites integrated in human cells</title><p>The 23 bp <italic>TerB</italic> sequence in interaction with the Tus protein have been successfully used in yeast and mice to create artificial RFBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larsen et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Willis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Willis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Willis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Willis and Scully, 2016</xref>). To study the effect of site-specific replication blocks at a genomic locus in human cells, we used a previously established MCF7 clone with a unique integrated copy of the pWB15 plasmid carrying two sets of five <italic>TerB</italic> repeat sequences in opposite, non-permissive orientations with respect to the incoming replication forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whole-genome sequencing of the clone was carried out to confirm the single-copy integration of the plasmid at hg38 chr12:95325001. Firstly, we checked whether Tus protein was able to bind <italic>TerB sequences</italic> in this artificial system in human cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using an antibody against the His-tag 24 hr after MCF7 5C-TerB cells were transfected with a Tus-His expression plasmid.

We reasoned that our integrated system in MCF7 cells would be more prone to replication fork arrests near the <italic>TerB</italic> sequences. We used single-molecule analysis of replicated DNA (SMARD) to investigate evidence of replication fork stalling in the genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Norio and Schildkraut, 2001</xref>). The self-labeling SNAP-tag was used to label Tus. After induction of Myc-NLS-TUS-SNAP by using Dox for 3 d, asynchronous MCF7 5C-TerB cells were sequentially pulse-labeled using two nucleoside analogs (iododeoxyuridine [IdU] and chlorodeoxyuridine [CldU]) for 4 hr each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The isolated DNA was digested by restriction endonuclease Sfil, and the 200 kb fragment obtained was stretched on slides for staining. Two DNA FISH probes were used to detect the 200 kb segment of interest containing the <italic>TerB</italic> arrays: one probe of 40 kb within the chromosome 12 (hg38 chr12:95,199,827–95,239,226) and one probe of 7 kb made from pWB15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The direction of replication forks could be determined using the labeling patterns and its position within the locus of interest using our FISH probes. After inducing the expression of Myc-NLS-TUS-SNAP from an integrated plasmid in MCF7 5C-TerB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), we analyzed its impact on the replication fork progression within the region containing <italic>TerB</italic> repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). The yellow arrows indicate the transition of labeling from IdU to CldU incorporation showing the replication fork direction. When Tus was expressed, these transition sites were found accumulated near the <italic>TerB</italic> regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, arrows within the white oval) compared to the random signal spread on the 200 kb region when Tus is not expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We quantified the percentage of molecules with replication forks at each 5 kb interval in the 200 kb SfiI segment containing <italic>TerB</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>) and confirmed an accumulation of forks at the <italic>TerB</italic> sequences only when Tus was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, black arrow), supporting that the binding of Tus on <italic>TerB</italic> arrays can impair the replisome progression at genomic loci. Interestingly, expression of the Tus protein alone does not alter the direction of replication fork progression along the 200 kb SfiI segment where forks predominantly progress from the 3′ to 5′ direction in cells both with and without Tus expression as analyzed by the percentage of molecules with IdU incorporation at each 5 kb interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in the global replication fork speed in cells with or without Tus expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).

The Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> system has previously been employed in mouse embryonic stem cells to measure and investigate the DNA repair pathway choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandramouly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Panday et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Willis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Willis et al., 2014</xref>). This included both error-free and error-prone homologous recombination induced by a mammalian chromosomal RFB, as well as identifying the role of the structure-specific endonuclease complex SLX4-XPF and FANCM in the repair of microhomology-mediated tandem duplications that occur at replication arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elango et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nandi and Whitby, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Willis et al., 2017</xref>). The Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> block is robust and is not dissociated by the action of DNA helicases such as PIF1, corroborated in previous yeast studies that have demonstrated that the ‘sweepase’ RRM3 is unable to resolve this RFB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larsen et al., 2014b</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the RFB is resolved either by incoming replication forks leading to termination at the <italic>TerB</italic> site or by fork cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larsen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Willis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Willis et al., 2014</xref>). Fork reversal at the Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> site has been observed in the yeast system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larsen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marie and Symington, 2022</xref>), but not for the mammalian systems, and it is unlikely that shifting the position of the RFB would make it easier to resolve. Therefore, fork cleavage is the most likely mechanism for resolving the RFB.</p><p>The upstream pathway of activation of the DNA damage response, as a result of a single RFB, is not completely understood. Previous work has shown that FANCM acts as a scaffolding protein for recruitment of different repair protein complexes involved in the stalled replication fork rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Panday et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Willis et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that the FANCM protein is enriched at the site of the RFB induced by Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), confirming a similar phenomenon observed in mouse cells. However, it is yet to be determined whether FANCM recruitment to the RFB precedes local H2AX phosphorylation by ATR or whether FANCM is recruited as a consequence of the γH2AX signal to help elicit the downstream DNA damage response (DDR). We also anticipate that the protein complex, 9-1-1 (RAD9A, HUS1, RAD1), and the subsequently recruited TOPBP1, may also play a role at this local ATR-dependent intra-S checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parrilla-Castellar et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>While the Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> system is an important tool in deciphering signaling at individual replication forks, it will be important to test whether the local-S phase model remains supported when exploring endogenous lesions that occur when replication forks encounter secondary structures such as R-loops, G-quadruplexes, and common fragile sites characterized by trinucleotide repeat expansion [(CAG)<sub>n</sub>/(CTG)<sub>n</sub>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brickner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Here the mechanisms surrounding the identification and resolution of the RFB may differ. Overall, our results indicate that Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> system acts as an efficient RFB and activates local ATR checkpoint signaling at the stall site, leading to phosphorylation and accumulation of the DNA damage sensor protein γH2AX, which is dependent on the ATR kinase. The local γH2AX accumulation at the stalled region would lead to the recruitment of DNA repair factors for resolution of the fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Together, our findings reveal the signaling mechanism of the Tus/<italic>TerB</italic>-induced replication block and showed that the site-specific fork block is dependent on the local ATR S-phase checkpoint signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection conditions</title><p>MCF7 5C-TerB cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in complete DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 20 mM HEPES, 100 I.U./ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 400 µg/ml zeocin.

A single plasmid containing two divergently oriented five-fold TerB repeats was integrated on chromosome 12 of MCF7 cells. ChIP and PLA experiments convincingly demonstrate the occupancy of Tus at the Ter sites in cells. Using an elegant Single Molecule Analysis of Replicated DNA (SMARD) assay, compelling data demonstrate the replication block at Ter sites dependent on the presence of the protein. As an orthogonal method to demonstrate fork stalling, ChIP data show the accumulation of the replicative helicase component MCM3 and the repair protein FANCM around the Ter sites. Previous published work from the Scully and Hickson laboratories showed that Ter sites do not perturb replication fork progression and consistently the data show that the observed effects are dependent on expression of the Tus protein. The SMARD data reveal that about one third of the forks are arrested at Tus/Ter but it is unclear for how long forks remain stalled. Fork stalling led to a highly localized gammaH2AX response, as monitored by ChIP using primer pairs spread along the integrated plasmid carrying the Ter sites. This response was shown to be dependent on ATR using the ATR inhibitor VE-822. This contrasts with a single Cas9-induced DSB between the two Ter sites, which causes a more spread gammaH2AX response measured at two sites flanking the DSB. The difference between the DSB and the Tus-induced stall is very significant. Interestingly, despite evidence for ATR activation through the gammaH2AX response, no evidence for phosphorylation of ATR-T1989, CHK1-S345, or RPA2-S33 could be found under fork stalling conditions. The global replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) elicited phosphorylation of ATR-T1989, CHK1-S345, or RPA2-S33. In this context, it would have been of interest to examine if a single DSB in the Ter region leads to phosphorylation of ATR-T1989, CHK1-S345, or RPA2-S33 and cell cycle arrest. The replication inhibitor HU led to an increase in gamma H2AX foci consistent with a global replication stress response. Overall, this is a well written manuscript, and the data provide convincing evidence that the Tus-Ter system poses a site-specific replication fork block in MCF7 cells leading to a localized ATR-dependent DNA damage checkpoint response that is distinct from the more global response to HU or DSBs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87357.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ahmed-Seghir</surname><given-names>Sana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jalan</surname><given-names>Manisha</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grimsley</surname><given-names>Helen E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>Aman</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Twayana</surname><given-names>Shyam</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Albert Einstein College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kosiyatrakul</surname><given-names>Settapong T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Albert Einstein College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schildkraut</surname><given-names>Carl L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Albert Einstein College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Powell</surname><given-names>Simon N</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Review:</bold></p><p>The authors report the first use of the bacterial Tus-Ter replication block system in human cells.

Fork stalling led to a highly localized gammaH2AX response, as monitored by ChIP using primer pairs spread along the integrated plasmid carrying the Ter sites. This response was shown to be dependent on ATR using the ATR inhibitor VE-822. This contrasts with a single Cas9-induced DSB between the two Ter sites, which causes a more spread gammaH2AX response. While this was monitored only at a single distal site, the difference between the DSB and the Tus-induced stall is very significant. Interestingly, despite evidence for ATR activation through the gammaH2AX response, no evidence for phosphorylation of ATR-T1989, CHK1-S345, or RPA2-S33 could be found under fork stalling conditions. The global replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) elicited phosphorylation of ATR-T1989, CHK1-S345, or RPA2-S33. In this context, it would have been of interest to examine if a single DSB in the Ter region leads to phosphorylation of ATR-T1989, CHK1-S345, or RPA2-S33 and cell cycle arrest. It is not shown whether the replication inhibitor HU leads to the same widely spread gamma H2AX response. Overall, this is a well written manuscript, and the data provide convincing evidence that the Tus-Ter system poses a site-specific replication fork block in MCF7 cells leading to a localized ATR-dependent DNA damage checkpoint response that is distinct from the more global response to HU or DSBs.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response to public review:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“It is unclear whether the Ter sites integrated by a single copy plasmid have any effect on the replication of this region but the data show that the observed effects are dependent on expression of the Tus protein.”</p></disp-quote><p>-The lack of perturbation of the TerB sequence on fork progression has extensively been studied previously in both Willis et al, 2014 and Larsen et. al, 2014.

I mention this because it was reported in yeast that a single DSB in G1 cells leads to a similarly localized Mec1 (ATR) -dependent response that does not elicit phosphorylation of Rad53 (CHK1) and other downstream targets, but leads to H2A phosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of RPA and the Rad51 paralog Rad55 (see PMCID: PMC2853130). It might be of interest to the reader to discuss this publication and the commonalities and differences between both localized checkpoint response</p></disp-quote><p>-The reviewers raise an interesting question about the phosphorylation of ATR/CHK1/RPA and its effect on cell cycle after a single DSB. The aim of using the Cas9 break site in this study was merely to corroborate previously published observations pertaining to the spread of gH2AX after a DSB and to contrast that with the local response seen with Tus-TerB. Thus, while an intriguing question, we do not think this particular experiment will help in the understanding of the localized checkpoint response after a single replication fork block. However, we have included the observations previous published in the yeast system (PMC2853130) in our discussion as it helps compare and contrast fork blocks and DSBs further. It is of worth though that the yeast studies were looking at the cellular response to a DSB in G1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 256-260: In the discussion of ATRIP, unpublished data are discussed that show no increase in ssDNA.

Since Tus/Ter complex block the CMG progression, fork reversal would result in a chicken foot structure with the long single-stranded 3'-overhang of an Okazaki fragment site. Such a structure should be protected by BRCA2 or RAD52 proteins from degradation. Any role for these proteins in the checkpoint activation at the TerB site?</p></disp-quote><p>-The reviewers suggest an interesting scenario where the Tus-TerB block induced reversed fork structure could be protected by the loading of known DNA repair proteins and this in turn could lead to a signaling mechanism and checkpoint activation. While we have not tested this hypothesis, nor studied the temporal dynamics of the formation if the reversed fork with respect to gH2AX accumulation, we think the localized gH2AX signal observed in the vicinity of the block is what initiates the downstream DDR response, promoting fork stabilization, followed either by fork reversal and restart or fork collapse. If the reversed fork was responsible for the gH2AX signaling, one would envision the spread to be more widespread, perhaps decorating the entire stretch of DNA between the block and the reversed fork. However, further studies are warranted to tease out this mechanism and the spatio-temporal dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 292-294: The authors state that &quot;unpublished work from our laboratory has demonstrated that replication forks are cleaved at or near the TerB site...&quot; Unless the data are shown, it might be best to eliminate discussion of unpublished work, also because the occurrence of DNA ends at Ter sites was already described in Willis et al. 2017.</p></disp-quote><p>-The statement has been deleted and Willis et al. 2017 has been referenced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suppl Table 1: It would help to also show representative images of stretched fibers in addition to the summary data shown.</p></disp-quote><p>-Since the data is negative, the fiber images do not show any discernible differences and we do not think it adds useful information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suppl Fig 4.
