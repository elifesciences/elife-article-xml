microbiome can influence anticancer treatment success. We previously suggested that chemotherapies with antimicrobial activity can select for adaptations in bacterial drug metabolism that can inadvertently influence the host’s chemoresistance. We demonstrated that evolved resistance against fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy lowered its efficacy in worms feeding on drug-evolved bacteria (Rosener et al., 2020). Here, we examine a model system that captures local interactions that can occur in the tumor microenvironment. Gammaproteobacteria-colonizing pancreatic tumors can degrade the nucleoside-analog chemotherapy gemcitabine and, in doing so, can increase the tumor’s chemoresistance. Using a genetic screen in <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> we mapped all loss-of-function mutations conferring gemcitabine resistance. Surprisingly, we infer that one third of top resistance mutations increase or decrease bacterial drug breakdown and therefore can either lower or raise the gemcitabine load in the local environment. Experiments in three <italic>E. coli</italic> strains revealed that evolved adaptation converged to inactivation of the nucleoside permease NupC, an adaptation that increased the drug burden on co-cultured cancer cells. The two studies provide complementary insights on the potential impact of microbiome adaptation to chemotherapy by showing that bacteria–drug interactions can have local and systemic influence on drug activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gemcitabine</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>chemoresistance</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>drug adaptation</kwd><kwd>resistome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM133775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Amir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI170722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Amir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK068429</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walhout</surname><given-names>Albertha JM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM122502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walhout</surname><given-names>Albertha JM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mutations conferring resistance to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> against the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine can have opposite effects on bacterial drug degradation and therefore can increase or decrease the chemotherapy load on neighboring cancer cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clinical research on the influence of intratumor bacterial infection can be dated back to more than 150 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sepich-Poore et al., 2021</xref>). However, in the past decade, research of the tumor-microbiome gained significant momentum with the maturation of DNA sequencing technologies and advancement of microbiome research. Multiple recent studies of bacterial colonization in human tumors outlined the magnitude of this phenomenon (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sepich-Poore et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodman and Gardner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cullin et al., 2021</xref>) Collectively, these works establish that the proportion of infected tumors greatly varies across tumor types and that many tumors harbor microbiomes with a distinctive and characteristic composition of bacterial species. In some cases, as in breast and pancreatic cancer, more than 60% of tumors harbored a tumor-microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nejman et al., 2020</xref>). The microbiome, in turn, is known to influence cancer disease through multiple independent mechanisms, including promotion of neoplastic processes in healthy host cells, modulation of the host antitumor immune response, and by bacterial biotransformation of anticancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cullin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roy and Trinchieri, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riquelme et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial metabolism of xenobiotics, including breakdown of host-targeted drugs, is prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spanogiannopoulos et al., 2016</xref>). Estimates from recent drug screens show that two thirds of human-targeted drugs can be metabolized by at least one bacterial species that is present in the human gut microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zimmermann et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, these interactions are reciprocal, bacteria both metabolize the host-targeting drugs and are also frequently impacted by them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zimmermann et al., 2021</xref>). Roughly 25% of host-targeted drugs are potent inhibitors of bacterial growth at physiological concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maier et al., 2018</xref>). This proportion is doubled for antineoplastic drugs and almost all anticancer drugs that belong to the antimetabolite drug class have potent antimicrobial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maier et al., 2018</xref>). A key underexplored question that arises from these reciprocal drug–microbiome interactions is how they impact one another given the ability of microorganisms to evolve and change over short time scales within the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lieberman, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garud et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Snitkin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gatt and Margalit, 2021</xref>). Specifically, given that bacteria rapidly evolve resistance to antimicrobial drugs, it is plausible that adaptation to host-targeting drugs that are also antimicrobial will alter bacterial drug metabolism or its transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosener et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kyono et al., 2022</xref>). Such adaptions have been repeatedly observed with standard antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekshun and Levy, 2007</xref>). In such cases, evolved resistance in tumor-colonizing bacteria may increase or decrease drug availability to the tumor cells, which, in turn, may interfere with the efficacy of the chemotherapy.</p><p>The tumor-microbiome in pancreatic cancer has attracted much attention recently due to the prevalence of infections in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nejman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riquelme et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McAllister et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aykut et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pushalkar et al., 2018</xref>). Studies have uncovered multiple independent mechanisms through which microbes influence oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aykut et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pushalkar et al., 2018</xref>), disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riquelme et al., 2019</xref>), and treatment success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geller et al., 2017</xref>) in the pancreas. Bacterial infection is attributed to retrograde bacterial migration from the gastrointestinal tract into the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McAllister et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pushalkar et al., 2018</xref>). Characterization of the PDAC tumor-microbiome by 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that proteobacteria are highly enriched relative to the gut microbiome and that they are highly prevalent in pancreatic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nejman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pushalkar et al., 2018</xref>). Recent work suggested that pancreatic colonization can impede therapy with gemcitabine (2',2'-difluoro 2' deoxycytidine [dFdC]), a frontline chemotherapy drug that is used for PDAC treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geller et al., 2017</xref>). Further clinical data provided circumstantial evidence indicating that this interaction may indeed take place in treated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meriggi and Zaniboni, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mohindroo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Gemcitabine drug metabolism is well-understood in the model gamma-proteobacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geller and Straussman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The antimetabolite gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog, is imported into the bacterial cell through the nucleoside transporter NupC and is then phosphorylated. Gemcitabine triphosphate may be incorporated into a newly synthesized DNA strand and then may interfere with chain elongation by masked chain termination (similar to mammalian cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Sousa Cavalcante and Monteiro, 2014</xref>). Therefore, despite its clinical use as an anticancer drug, gemcitabine’s mechanism of action potentially makes it a broadly toxic, antimicrobial compound. Previous works showed that some bacterial species can rapidly convert gemcitabine into the less toxic metabolite 2′,2′-difluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (dFdU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vande Voorde et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lehouritis et al., 2015</xref>). In gamma-proteobacteria, gemcitabine degradation proceeds through a specific isoform of the cytidine deaminase enzyme (Cdd<sub>L</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geller et al., 2017</xref>). The well-characterized interactions between tumor cells, gemcitabine, and gamma-proteobacteria puts forth a good model system for testing how bacterial adaptation can impact drug metabolism and potentially influence the tumor’s chemoresistance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic screen identifies gemcitabine sensitive and resistant loss-of-function mutations in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gemcitabine transport and metabolism in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

This observation led us to conclude that resistance can rapidly emerge under natural selection through gene inactivation within a single evolutionary step. Using a functional assay, we found that one third of top resistance mutations impacted extracellular drug concentrations (gemcitabine activity). Co-culturing bacteria harboring these loss-of-function mutations with cancer cells confirmed that these adaptive mutations in bacteria have the potential to alter chemoresistance of neighboring tumor cells. Finally, through in vitro evolution we studied which adaptations emerge under drug selection in three <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. We found that inactivation of the drug transporter NupC arises in all evolved strains. This inactivation leads to decreased bacterial drug import and therefore reduces the rate of gemcitabine breakdown. Reduced bacterial breakdown, in turn, increases gemcitabine availability for neighboring tumor cells. Our work reveals that bacterial adaptation to the frontline chemotherapy drug gemcitabine can take place rapidly in vitro. If similar adaptation takes place in gemcitabine-treated patients, it may ultimately increase the chemosensitivity of the hosting tumor. Our in vitro work suggests that monitoring bacterial adaptation to chemotherapy may be required to decide whether chemotherapy should be augmented with antibiotic treatments. Such decisions are nontrivial given that administration of antibiotics can be detrimental to cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meriggi and Zaniboni, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elkrief et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>E. coli</italic> resistome against gemcitabine</title><p>We first set out to determine the inhibitory concentration of gemcitabine in three <italic>E. coli</italic> strains: BW25113 (a K-12 lab strain), F-18 (a human fecal isolate), and Nissle 1917 (a human fecal isolate that is used as probiotic).

We used a pooled screening approach that we recently developed, which relies on sequencing DNA barcodes that are unique for each gene-knockout in the strain collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosener et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noto Guillen et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> outlines the main steps of the screening method: the pooled knockout strains were inoculated and grown in media containing a high gemcitabine concentration (140 µM) while a control culture was inoculated in media without drug. Once the cultures reached a late logarithmic growth phase, cells were lysed, and DNA was extracted for amplification and sequencing of the barcode region. Lastly, we compared the frequency of each barcode, corresponding to an individual gene-knockout, in the drug and control conditions. This comparison revealed strains whose frequency was significantly increased or decreased in gemcitabine. Such enrichment or depletion correspond to increased or decreased drug resistance, respectively. We used three biological replicates, biological experiments conducted side-by-side, in three separate tubes, to infer statistical significance. We identified over a million and a half barcode containing reads in each replicate that corresponded to roughly 3500 unique barcodes (knockout strains). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows detailed information on the screen coverage and replication quality. To validate the screen results we repeated the entire screen two additional times, once with the same collection of knockout strains and once with a collection knockout strains that were cloned independently (again, each with three internal replicates). The results (resistance/sensitivity) from the two additional screens were highly correlated with the original screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Results of all screens and replicates appear in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows a volcano plot representation of the screen results. Using very strict cutoff values for fold-change (&gt;16) and false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value (&lt;0.05), we identified 42 gemcitabine-resistant knockout strains and 6 gemcitabine-sensitive strains (shown as purple and green circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The screen results, including all statistically significant hits without a strict cutoff on enrichment, appear in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Reassuringly, we found that knockout of the known drug transporter (<italic>nupC</italic>) is among the top resistors. When we inspected the gene annotation of the top resistors, we identified multiple hits from the known target pathway of the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These included the permease (<italic>nupC</italic>), the transcriptional regulator <italic>cytR</italic> (a repressor of both <italic>nupC</italic> and <italic>cdd</italic>), and the cytidylate kinase (<italic>cmk</italic>) that likely phosphorylate intracellular gemcitabine. We also found multiple hits that encode membrane proteins or transporters, including <italic>ompR</italic> and <italic>envZ</italic> that together regulate permeability channels for nutrients, toxins, and antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mizuno and Mizushima, 1987</xref>). Lastly, we observed a high prevalence of genes coding for metabolic enzymes that can considerably slow down growth when mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noto Guillen et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, a statistical test revealed that gene knockouts that were previously identified as reducing growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baba et al., 2006</xref>) were highly enriched in the set of gemcitabine resistant strains (p-value = 8.6186e-18, Fisher’s exact test). The overlap between resistant strains and slow growing strains is sensible given that slow growth reduces the rate of DNA synthesis. Since gemcitabine is quickly degraded by the bacterial Cdd enzyme, it was only transiently present in the extracellular media during the screen experiment. Under such a transitory stress, slower consumption of the antimetabolite is likely beneficial (normal growers incorporated much more gemcitabine into their DNA and remain arrested while slow growers incorporated less and therefore avoid arrest).</p><p>Next, we used the gene set enrichment analysis tool GAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2009</xref>) to test for functional enrichment using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</xref>) and Gene Ontology (GO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>) databases. This analysis is complementary to the previous analysis since it considers the enrichment values from all strains rather than only the limited set of hit strains obtained by imposing strict cutoffs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> shows the functional enrichment by KEGG pathways (enrichment indicates that pathway inactivation increased resistance). Reassuringly, we observed a high agreement between the functional enrichment by GAGE and the annotation of the top hits. Specifically, we observed enrichment in purine synthesis and membrane transporters as well as multiple metabolic pathways impacting bacterial growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noto Guillen et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> provides the full list of enriched and depleted categories.</p><p>Taken together, the results from our genetic screen outline three adaptation strategies that increase bacteria’s gemcitabine resistance: reduced drug import by inactivating membrane proteins and transporter systems, changes in the drug metabolism through mutations in the target pathway, and inactivation of metabolic genes that slowdown bacterial growth. Importantly, since these resistance adaptations arise from knockout of single genes, they are all accessible within a single evolutionary step (e.g., a single gene inactivating mutation).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The impact of bacterial resistance on bacterial drug degradation</title><p>Our genetic screen revealed alternative adaptation strategies that increase bacterial resistance against gemcitabine. However, for most loss-of-function mutations, it remains to be determined how they will influence the rate of bacterial drug degradation (and ultimately drug availability for neighboring cancer cells). We therefore designed a functional assay to detect changes in drug activity, after bacterial incubation with the drug, relative to its activity after incubation with the wild-type strain (outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We incubated a knockout strain of interest in saline with a high gemcitabine concentration and collected the conditioned supernatant after a short incubation period (15 or 45 min). We diluted the conditioned supernatant into regular media and monitored the growth of a drug-sensitive reporter strain (a <italic>cdd</italic> knockout that cannot degrade gemcitabine) in this media. Finally, we used growth curves of the reporter strain as a proxy for the gemcitabine concentration in the conditioned supernatant. We reasoned that a conditioned supernatant containing high drug concentration is indicative of slow degradation by the strain of interest. This difference in drug concentration will in turn manifest as slow growth of the reporter strain (blue curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We note that this detection method is insufficient to resolve the mechanism underlying the slowed degradation since it only measures drug availability in the extracellular environment after incubation (e.g., both slow import and slow deamination will be interpreted as slow degradation).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Bacterial gemcitabine resistance can oppositely affect drug degradation and impact neighboring cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The functional drug breakdown assay.

We found one third of the tested knockout strains modulated extracellular drug availability (33 of 88). Specifically, 11% of all strains were fast degraders and 26% of strains were slow degraders (one-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, FDR-adjusted p-value&lt;0.1). We next decided to validate the conclusions of our functional assay using an independent chemical approach for the wild-type and three knockout strains. We focused on the fastest and the slowest degraders and cdd knockout as a control. We incubated each strain with gemcitabine and sampled aliquots of the supernatant at predetermined timepoints (20, 45, and 75 min). We then used gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to measure the concentration of gemcitabine and its degradation product in the conditioned supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In agreement with our functional assay, the GC-MS measurements confirmed that the gene knockouts indeed altered the availability of gemcitabine and in the extracellular environment. The increased availability of the drug breakdown product (dFdU) support the conclusion that rate of drug metabolism is underlying this change (as opposed to intracellular drug accumulation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klünemann et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we tested whether bacterial resistance mutations influence the drug sensitivity of co-cultured cancer cells. While previous works relied on sequential exposure to the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lehouritis et al., 2015</xref>), using conditioned bacterial supernatant on cancer cells, we reasoned that a co-culture system will reveal whether bacterial degradation is sufficient to impact drug efficacy in neighboring cancer cells that are simultaneously exposed to the drug. We co-cultured bacteria with spheroids of the CT26 murine cancer cell line and simultaneously treated them with gemcitabine for 4 hr (gemcitabine cytotoxicity can be recapitulated in this cell line; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geller et al., 2017</xref>). Spheroids were then washed to remove bacteria and left to grow for a week in media supplemented with antibiotics. Lastly, spheroids were washed again to remove dead cells and the area of the spheroids was measured to evaluate gemcitabine’s efficacy on the cancer cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows microscopy images of a representative microwell plate. As the figure shows, we observed sensible trends in these experiments: first, we observed that spheroid size was inversely correlated with gemcitabine concentration (lower spheroid row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and that bacterial concentration, without any drug, did not significantly impact spheroid growth (left spheroid column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Reassuringly, we observed that co-cultured bacteria can mitigate gemcitabine damage and that the magnitude of rescue depended on the bacterial concentration (spheroid area is overall increased in upper spheroid rows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>We used our systematic measurements of spheroid area to fit a fitness landscape. This procedure allowed us to infer the effective drug concentration that leads to a 50% change in area (EC50) for any bacterial concentration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows the landscapes for the wild-type strain, a control non-degrader (<italic>cdd</italic> knockout) and the fastest and slowest degraders (<italic>cytR</italic> and <italic>nupC knockouts</italic>, respectively). As evidenced by the changes in the EC50 fronts, we observed that the spheroid fitness landscapes were considerably different depending on the co-cultured bacteria during drug exposure. In agreement with our functional and chemical assays, increased chemoresistance relative to the wild-type strain was observed when spheroids were co-incubated with the fast degrader (<italic>cytR</italic> knockout). In contrast, decreased chemoresistance relative to the wild-type strain was for co-incubation was with the slow degrader (<italic>nupC</italic> knockout). A replicated spheroid experiment with <italic>cytR</italic> and <italic>nupC knockouts</italic> and the wild-type strain revealed similar shifts in the EC50 fronts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additional experiments with nine more bacterial resistors showed they also impacted spheroid chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the results of the spheroid experiments demonstrate that mutations impacting gemcitabine degradation rates in bacteria can indeed impact neighboring cancer cells simultaneously with the drug. Importantly, we observed that bacterial resistors can have opposite influences on gemcitabine sensitivity of co-cultured cancer cells. For examples, the <italic>nupC</italic> knockout decreased chemoresistance while the <italic>cytR</italic> knockout increased it. A key question remaining is which adaptations will naturally transpire during bacterial evolution under drug selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Evolved bacterial resistance against gemcitabine</title><p>The genetic screen uncovered multiple loss-of-function mutations that confer bacterial gemcitabine resistance. Yet, such screens are insufficient for determining which gene inactivation, if any, will emerge under natural selection. Moreover, since evolution can leverage additional processes beyond gene inactivation, such as gain-of-function, adaptation may follow an entirely different evolutionary trajectory. We applied the widely used serial transfer approach to select for evolved drug resistance in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dragosits and Mattanovich, 2013</xref>). Such in vitro experiments can shed light on the mechanisms underlying resistance and the time scale needed to acquire resistance.

This convergence can be driven by multiple mechanisms that are not necessarily exclusive to one another. Evolutionary trajectories are influenced by multiple parameters, including the adaptation benefit (e.g., the level of resistance the mutation confers), the adaptation cost (e.g., if it reduces growth), and the likelihood that the mutation will appear spontaneously. We reasoned that quantifying these parameters for the <italic>nupC</italic> gene would provide insight into the forces underlying the evolutionary convergence we observed.</p><p>Our genetic screen already revealed that <italic>nupC</italic> is among the top loss-of-function mutations conferring resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), yet it remains unclear whether <italic>nupC</italic> inactivation is associated with any cost to the cells. We therefore monitored the growth rate of the top five resistant knockouts identified in the genetic screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The experiment revealed that a <italic>nupC</italic> knockout grows as fast as the wild-type strain (<italic>ybcN</italic> knockout) for most of the growth phases and slows down only during the stationary phase.

We reasoned that a mutation hotspot will be evident if we observed that multiple independent resistant clones will share a specific site or region within the <italic>nupC</italic> locus or will leverage on a specific mutation mechanism. We obtained independent clones by picking 100 individual colonies of the wild-type strain. We grew them overnight and plated them on agar plates with an inhibitory gemcitabine concentration (0.5 mM). We reasoned that at this high concentration, only the most resistant and fast-growing mutants, namely <italic>nupC</italic> mutants, will be able to form large colonies within an overnight growth. We then picked a single resistant colony from each of the 100 agar plates and Sanger sequenced the <italic>nupC</italic> coding sequence locus. We found that 85% of colonies were mutated in this region, with mutations spanning multiple types. Missense mutations and short indels were the most frequent mutations observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In order to annotate the missense mutations, we tested whether they likely disrupt positions important for permease function.

We compared this mutation rate to a reference gene (<italic>nfsA</italic>) that confers resistance to furazolidone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lourenço et al., 2016</xref>). We performed this experiment as four replicates using four different genetic backgrounds (the strains used for the evolution experiments and the MG1655 lab strain). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> shows the calculated mutation rates for <italic>nupC</italic> and <italic>nfsA</italic> loci in all strains (normalized to a gene with 1000 basepairs). In all cases, we found rates comparable to the average gene mutation rate previously inferred for <italic>E. coli</italic> (2.1 × 10<sup>−7</sup> per gene per generation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Zhang, 2013</xref>). For BW25113, the mutation rate of <italic>nupC</italic> was 5.7-fold higher than that of <italic>nfsA</italic>. For Nissle, this difference was 6.8-fold and for MG1655 it was 1.8-fold. For F-18 strain, in contrast, the mutation rate of <italic>nfsA</italic> was 7.9-fold higher than <italic>nupC</italic>. While the mutation rate was not identical in the two genes, the mutation of <italic>nupC</italic> was not always higher than that of <italic>nfsA</italic>, and their rate difference was never larger by an order of magnitude.</p><p>Taken together, the results from multiple experiments suggested that <italic>nupC</italic> was likely repeatedly inactivated across multiple genetic backgrounds since it confers high drug resistance without compromising growth. Experiments focusing on the <italic>nupC</italic> mutation revealed that gene inactivation could take place through multiple alternative mutation mechanisms and that the <italic>nupC</italic> locus is not characterized by an exceptionally high mutation rate (excluding the possibility of a mutational hotspot).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The recent discovery that bacterial infections are frequent across multiple cancer types suggests that the tumor-microbiome is an important, yet understudied, component of the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cullin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nejman et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we suggest that a key aspect of microbial biology is underexplored in current investigations of the tumor-microbiome – the ability of bacteria to rapidly evolve and adapt to extracellular changes. Within the tumor niche, successful colonization may require bacterial adaptation to the unique conditions of the tumor microenvironment, including adaptation to tumor-targeting therapeutics. A strong selective pressure from chemotherapies likely exists given that multiple antineoplastic drugs are putative antimicrobials at physiological concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maier et al., 2018</xref>). We previously raised the hypothesis that bacterial evolved resistance to tumor-targeting chemotherapies can manifest in changes to bacterial drug metabolism and this type of adaptation can inadvertently influence chemoresistance. Our previous work used the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> model system, its bacterial diet, and two fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy drugs to study this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosener et al., 2020</xref>). In that model system, we estimated that almost 60% of loss-of-function mutations that conferred bacterial resistance would also reduce drug toxicity in a worm host feeding on these bacteria. Here, we further study this hypothesis and focus on a different chemotherapy drug and a model system that captures bacterial–drug interactions that may be at play in the tumor microenvironment, rather than in the host gut as in the previous publication.</p><p>Research of the bacterial role in pancreatic cancer revealed multiple and independent mechanisms of microbial influence on cancers in this organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nejman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riquelme et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McAllister et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aykut et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pushalkar et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, recent work suggested that pancreatic colonization by proteobacteria can decrease efficacy of gemcitabine through rapid bacterial drug inactiavation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geller et al., 2017</xref>). We used this drug–bacteria–tumor interaction to test our hypothesis by reconstituting similar interactions from individual parts that are well-understood on their own. We first mapped the gemcitabine resistome in <italic>E. coli</italic> and found that changes in multiple cellular processes increase resistance. Importantly, these potential adaptations are easily accessible within short time scales since they only require inactivation of a single gene. A functional assay revealed that one third of these adaptations impact bacterial drug breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Indeed, gemcitabine administration to co-cultures of cancer spheroids and bacteria demonstrated that two of the top loss-of-function mutations that the screen identified can considerably, and oppositely, impact drug efficacy in neighboring cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). While the impact of bacterial resistance on neighboring cells could have been predicted for the <italic>nupC</italic> knockout, it was not trivial for the <italic>cytR</italic> knockout. CytR is a transcription factor that represses at least 14 different operons, including nucleotide transporters and membrane proteins (<italic>nupC</italic>, <italic>nupG</italic>, <italic>tsx</italic>, <italic>ycdZ</italic>), sigma factors (<italic>rpoH</italic>), and metabolic enzymes in the target pathways (<italic>ccd</italic>, <italic>udp</italic>, <italic>deoABCD</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keseler et al., 2017</xref>). A chemical assay revealed that <italic>cytR</italic> knockdown culminates in increased drug degradation and a co-culture experiment confirmed it increases chemoresistance of neighboring cancer spheroids. It is therefore likely that relief of CytR repression of both <italic>nupC</italic> and <italic>cdd</italic> leads to increased import that is counteracted by even faster gemcitabine deamination. This observation is key since it suggests that mutations conferring gemcitabine resistance in bacteria can both increase and decrease gemcitabine breakdown rate. In the context of the tumor-microbiome, bacterial adaptation to gemcitabine can therefore raise or reduce the tumor’s chemoresistance.</p><p>A key question that arises from the observation that bacterial resistance can modulate drug availability for neighboring cancer cells, is which adaptations will emerge under drug selection and whether evolution will repeatedly converge to the same resistance mechanism. Results from the serial transfer evolution experiment in three <italic>E. coli</italic> strains showed that drug selection repeatedly yielded adapted clones that disabled the drug permease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Additional experiments suggested that selection for <italic>nupC</italic> inactivation, at the expense of alternative resistance mechanisms, is attributed to the high resistance this inactivation confers and to the minimal impact it has on growth. Importantly, as the fluctuation experiments reveal, resistant clones can preexist drug exposure and therefore also likely preexist any treatment if the bacterial number in the tumor-microbiome is sufficiently large. In such cases, tumor-microbiome adaptation can potentially take place through ecological-like changes and takeover by a resistant bacterial clone. Such clonal expansion in bacteria is reminiscent to the process of clonal expansion and takeover of preexisting resistant cancer cells that is thought to be prevalent in cancer treatment.</p><p>Previous research established that the microbiomes, in natural body sites or within tumors, can metabolize tumor-targeting drugs and by doing so influence drug efficacy in the host. Our previous and current studies complement this premise by demonstrating that bacterial evolutionary adaptation to chemotherapies can further influence bacterial drug metabolism and therefore host drug efficacy. Intriguingly, in this work we found that bacterial influence can have opposite effects on drug breakdown and therefore can increase, or decrease, chemoresistance. Moreover, the genetic screens from both works suggest that such occurrences might not be rare, given that such a high fraction of adaptive loss-of-function mutations also alter drug breakdown rates.</p><p>While we believe this work illuminates an underexplored and potentially impactful field of research – evolutionary adaption in the tumor microbiome – we are also excited by the follow-up questions that naturally ensue our in vitro findings. Foremost, it will be fascinating to test whether tumor-colonizing bacteria evolve and adapt to anticancer host treatment in animal models. Specifically, following our observations in the model gammaproteobacteria <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the known prevalence of gammaproteobacteria colonization in pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geller et al., 2017</xref>), it will be intriguing to check whether similar adaptations are observed in bacteria isolated from tumors that were resected from pancreatic cancer patients. Identifying convergent adaptation in tumor-microbiome of patients may prove impactful for personalizing anticancer treatment and informing the decision to complement chemotherapy treatment with antibiotics, a decision that is highly consequential for cancer patients and that should therefore be well-justified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meriggi and Zaniboni, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elkrief et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>Bacterial strains used in this study are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

In each strain, the open-reading frame of a single gene was replaced in-frame with a fragment containing turbo GFP, chloramphenicol resistance cassette, and a unique 20 bp sequence that serves as an identification barcode. Since the barcode is the only variable region across strains, it can be amplified from a mixed culture of strains with a single pair of primers.

For the day-to-day IC50 measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), a sample from daily evolving populations was directly diluted 1:200 into the microtiter plate with gemcitabine. For measurement of gemcitabine resistance of evolved populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), a sample from frozen last day glycerol stocks of evolution experiment was inoculated into 3 mL LB for overnight culture. Overnight cultures were diluted to OD (600 nm) of 1 in M9 and were added to the 384-well plate (1:200 final dilution). For single-colony gemcitabine IC50 experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), single colonies were grown overnight in 3 mL LB and the same dilution protocol was followed as evolved populations. The prepared microplates (with bacteria and gemcitabine dilutions) were incubated at 37°C and 360 rpm double orbital shaking in an automated plate reader (BioTek Eon) and absorbance (600 nm) was monitored every 10 min for 18 hr. All measurements were performed in technical triplicates. Each evolved population is considered as a separate biological replicate (three biological replicates per evolution condition; one biological replicate is shown in the figure for control evolved population). A MATLAB script was used to fit the dose–response curves and infer the IC50 values.

In the morning, the culture was diluted to OD (600 nm) of 1, and then diluted 1:400 into 7 ml of M9 with or without 140 µM gemcitabine. We prepared triplicates for each of the two conditions (quadruplicates in validation screens). The tubes were incubated at 37°C shaker and OD was monitored periodically. Once culture crossed OD (600 nm) 0.6, we collected the cells and extracted genomic DNA with a commercial kit (Zymo Quick DNA miniprep Plus Kit, Cat# D4068). Library preparation was identical to the protocol we previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosener et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, genomic DNA isolated from endpoint of the genetic screen was quantified using Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity kit (Thermo Fisher, Cat# Q32854). We used 6.25 ng DNA to prepare the DNA library. First, barcoded region was amplified using the following primers and 2× KAPA HiFi Hotstart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Cat# KK2602), which yielded ~350 bp product. PCR products were purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat# A63881). Nextera XT Index Kit protocol (Illumina, Cat# FC-131-1024) was used to add indices and Illumina sequencing adapters to each PCR sample. Next, products were purified using AMPure XP bead (Beckman Coulter, Cat# A63881) purification protocol. The libraries were then run on a 3% agarose gel, and the product was extracted using NEB Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit (NEB, Cat# T1020L). Next, we used Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies, Cat# 5067-4626) to evaluate the quality and average size of the libraries. Using Qubit dsDNA high-sensitivity kit, we measured the concentration and calculated the molarity of each library. Libraries were normalized to 4 nM, denatured, and diluted according to Illumina MiniSeq/NextSeq System Denature and Dilute Libraries Guide. After pooling, sequencing was performed using MiniSeq High Output Reagent Kit, 75-cycles (Illumina, Cat# FC-420-1001) or NextSeq 500/550 High output Reagent Kit v 2.5, 75-cycles (Illumina, Cat# 20024906). Raw reads were converted to barcode counts using a MATLAB script, which compared a database of all barcodes to the reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosener et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We identified the enriched or depleted hits by comparing the relative frequency of individual barcodes when the pooled library grew in the presence or absence of gemcitabine.

We discarded barcodes with less than 10 counts. We used ‘Wald statistical test’ and a cutoff value of 16-fold for enrichment and FDR-adjusted p-value of 0.05. Next, we performed gene set enrichment analysis with GAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2009</xref>) using KEGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanehisa et al., 2016</xref>) and GO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>) databases at a FDR-adjusted p-value of 0.1. We used published data on the KEIO strain collection (Supplementary file 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baba et al., 2006</xref>) to classify slow-growing knockouts. Specifically, we used the optical density measurements made after 24 hr of growth of the strain collection on minimal defined media (MOPS) and defined a cutoff value of 0.11 to discriminate normal and slow growth. We chose this cutoff value by the bimodal distribution of the density measurements in the dataset (this value separated the data into two unimodal histograms with 124 slow-growing strains and 4178 strains with normal growth).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Rapid gemcitabine breakdown assay</title><p>We picked from the KEIO strain collection the top 88 gemcitabine-resistant knockouts that were identified in the genetic screen.

We used the growth measurements from media supplemented with buffer after 15 min of incubation to identify fast degraders and growth measurements from media supplemented with buffer after 45 min of incubation to identify slow degraders. We used a statistical test to identify fast and slow degraders. For this test, we calculated the area under the growth curve (AUC) after blank subtraction for each replicate and used a one-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test to test whether the conditioned buffer from a knockout strain (three biological replicates) reduced or increased the AUC of the reporter strain compared to the buffer prepared with the wild-type strain (18 replicates).

Cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 media (Gibco, Cat# 11875-093) with 2 mM L-glutamine, 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Cat# 26140-079) and 25 mM HEPES Buffer (Corning, Cat# 25-060CI). The plates were centrifuged at 3000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and kept in a tissue culture incubator with 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 4 days of spheroid growth, we serially diluted bacterial cultures into the spheroid microplate and incubated the co-culture for 4 hr with gemcitabine (1.6-fold serially diluted across the columns). Note that all the tested bacterial mutants in this experiment were on <italic>pyrD</italic> knockout background (a pyrimidine auxotroph) to avoid bacterial proliferation in cell culture media that does not contain any nucleotides. Next, the plate was washed with cell culture media with 50 μg/ml gentamicin three times. To achieve this, we used 96-channel handheld electronic pipette (Integra, Viaflo 96) and made use of gravity force. 100 μL media was aspirated capturing the spheroid from the bottom of the wells. After the spheroids sank to the bottom of the tips, the tips were touched to the surface of a fresh plate containing culture media with 50 μg/mL gentamicin, leaving the spheroids in the new plate. We chose a 4 hr time interval to address two opposing requirements of the co-culture system – mitigate overgrowth of the bacterial cultures (which hinders spheroid growth irrespective of the drug) while still allowing enough incubation time to allow for drug degradation. While removal of bacteria after 4 hr may limit the bacterial impact, such a limitation will only result in underestimation of the bacterial impact (but will have no impact on how we evaluate how strains compare to one another).</p><p>After three washes, the 96-well plate was transferred to an S3 imaging platform (Incucyte, Sartorius) which is housed inside a tissue culture incubator. The plate was imaged every 6 hr to track spheroid growth and validate that there was no residual contamination of resistant bacteria (evident by bacterial overgrowth). After 7 days of growth, spheroids were washed once using cell culture media with 50 μg/mL gentamicin to get rid of any dead cell and cellular debris and a final microscopy image was captured. We calculated the area of individual spheroids using the Incucyte software (segmentation sensitivity: 40; minimum area filter: 2000 μm<sup>2</sup>). A MATLAB script was used to make the fitness landscapes by fitting polynomial equations. The following are the steps followed: (1) normalization by timepoint zero: we divided the last day spheroid area to day zero spheroid area (4 days post cell seeding). (2) Normalization by plate: we subtracted the minimum spheroid area from all spheroid areas and divided that value by second largest spheroid area in the plate minus minimum spheroid area. (3) Fitting 3D surface and calculating EC50 lines: we fitted a mesh surface using normalized spheroid areas (2D) using a four-degree polynomial function (‘poly44’). Lastly, we marked the EC50 line by calculating the coordinates of the 3D mesh surface where the values corresponded to a mid-response (value of 0.5). This experiment was performed with high resolution of conditions (12 × 8 conditions), which did not require technical replication.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Lab evolution experiment</title><p>We evolved bacteria in sub-inhibitory doses of gemcitabine using a standard serial transfer protocol (200 µM for BW25113, 750 µM for Nissle 1917, 100 µM for F-18) in a deep 96-well plate. For each strain, a single colony was picked for each individual evolution line and grown overnight in M9 media (three biological replicates per condition). The cultures were normalized to OD (600 nm) 1 and diluted 1:200 to a total volume of 1200 µl M9 (with or without gemcitabine). The 96-well plate was incubated at 37°C, 200 rpm shaking and was diluted 1:200 daily into fresh media for a period of 7 days (~53 generations). Resistance of evolving populations was measured daily by diluting the cultures 1:200 into a 384-well plate (35 µl per well) containing serially diluted gemcitabine (prepared in M9 at 2× concentration at a volume of 35 µL). The microplate was incubated at 37°C and 360 rpm double orbital shaking in automated plate reader (BioTek Eon) and absorbance (600 nm) was monitored every 10 min for 18 hr. All absorbance measurements were performed in technical triplicates. All downstream experiments were performed using the frozen last day populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Whole-genome sequencing and analysis of lab evolution experiment</title><p>We isolated single individual colonies from last day of the independently evolved populations by streaking them on LB agar plates. Eight colonies were selected and gemcitabine IC50 levels were determined using microtiter plate-based assay. The gDNA was extracted from selected clones using Zymo Quick-DNA Fungal/Bacterial Miniprep Kit (Cat# 11-321). Ancestor gDNAs from the replicates of each strain were pooled at equal ratio and processed as a single sample. DNA sequencing was performed by Seqcenter (Pittsburg, PA). Seqcenter prepared libraries using Illumina DNA Prep Kit and IDT 10 basepair UDI indices. Sequencing was performed on Illumina NextSeq 2000 device (2 × 151 bp reads). For all samples, demultiplexing, quality control, and adapter trimming were performed with bcl2fastq (Illumina) and trimgalore (Trim Galore, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_011847">SCR_011847</ext-link>). DNA sequencing yielded a median coverage of ~120× per reference genome. We used BreSeq tool to identify and annotate mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barrick et al., 2014</xref>). Mixed ancestor populations were run in breseq population mode to evaluate all existing mutation variants and all other samples were run as pure clones. The following are the NCBI accession numbers for the reference genomes we used in the analysis: CP009273 for <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113; CP058217.1 for <italic>E. coli</italic> Nissle 1917; and MLZI01000100.1 for F-18. The BreSeq gdtools SUBTRACT/COMPARE was used to substract mutations that existed in the ancestor population (mutations existing 30% or more were considered) from the independently evolved clones. Then, we inspected BreSeq reports to resolve unassigned junction evidence (we did not evaluate the unassigned missing coverage). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> includes the mutations identified in all clones after manual inspection of the BreSeq reports. Only the mutations that exist in the evolved clones but not in the ancestor were visualized on concentric circles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> using circa software (OMGenomics). Since F-18 genome consists of 113 contigs, the genomic locations shown on F-18 circa plot are undetermined. Mutations identified on contigs with low/unusual coverage were ignored (these are usually observed on small contigs that are shorter than 1 kb and frequently arise due to challenges in read mapping).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Obtaining spontaneous nupC mutants</title><p>We cultured 96 cultures of the BW25113 strain from individual colonies overnight in LB media (96 biological replicates). In the morning, 100 µL of each culture were plated with glass beads on M9 agar plates containing 0.5 mM gemcitabine. A day after, a single colony, corresponding to single spontaneous resistant mutant, was isolated from each agar plate. A 1.3 kb region spanning the entire <italic>nupC</italic> coding region was amplified by colony PCR and Sanger sequenced with forward (5′ <named-content content-type="sequence">TCACAGGACGTCATTATAGTG </named-content>3′) and reverse (5′ <named-content content-type="sequence">TGAGAGTAATTCATCGGCAC </named-content>3′) primers. We annotated mutations by pairwise alignment of the Sanger sequencing results with the <italic>nupC</italic> coding sequence of the reference genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Short insertions and deletions identified in the alignment were annotated as indels. Point mutations identified in the alignment were annotated as missense or nonsense mutations according to their impact on the coding sequence. Insertion of transposon was inferred by a truncated (local) alignment to a region in the <italic>nupC</italic> coding sequence followed by alignment of the remaining sequence to a known transposon. We note that mutations in the promoter region were not sequenced or annotated by this method due to the position of the primers. However, some mutations in this region may account for some of the spontaneous resistant mutants that were not annotated as having <italic>nupC</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Luria–Delbruck fluctuation experiment</title><p>For each strain, we inoculated four single colonies into 1 mL M9 medium and grew them at 37°C, 200 rpm shaking for 12 hr. Cultures were diluted to OD (600 nm) of 1 in M9. A 10<sup>–6</sup> dilution of OD1 was used to determine accurate CFU/OD (600 nm) by plating on LB agar plates. A 10<sup>–4</sup> dilution of OD 1 was further diluted 27-fold and transferred into 10 wells of a 96-well plate as 200 μL/well (initial population size [N<sub>0</sub>]: approximately 730 cells/well). The 96-well plate was incubated at 37°C, 1000 rpm shaking overnight. Next day, OD (600 nm) of two wells from the 96-well plate was measured to estimate the final population size (N<sub>t</sub>). Next, all cultures were diluted 1:40 into 1 mL of 0.9% saline. We plated 200 μL of each cell suspension on M9 agar plates (plating efficiency [ɛ], 1:40) containing selective amounts of gemcitabine (0.5 mM for BW25113, Nissle 1917, MG1655; 62.5 μM for F-18) or furazolidone (1 mg/mL for BW25113, Nissle 1917, MG1655; 2 mg/mL for F-18). Plates were incubated at 37°C for 18 hr, and the number of colonies was determined. Then, mutation rates were calculated using the RSalvador package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zheng, 2017</xref>). First, mutation frequency (m) was calculated using the function newton.LD.plating (and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using conf.LD.plating). Then mutation frequency (m) was divided to N<sub>t</sub> to find mutation rate per generation (<italic>p</italic>). These numbers later normalized to a gene that is 1000 bp long.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Justification for cell lines</title><p>Murine colorectal carcinoma cell line (CT26) used in this article was identified as Mycoplasma free, and the cell identity was confirmed by STR profiling (ATCC).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Landry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Peter J Turnbaugh (Reviewer #1); Alexander Muir (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For the findings to be fully supported, you would need a secondary screen/validation of the primary screen's results.</p><p>2) There are some questions regarding the spheroid system that would be best supported with new data but that minimally need to be answered by text edits and more discussions.</p><p>3) Some claims regarding how the models used apply to cancer need to be tampered and the limits of the systems used need to be better detailed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Key details are missing from the results and methods, a more detailed discussion of the knockout library is essential to interpret the results.</p><p>Recommend adjusting the language for the reporter strain assay for gemcitabine activity, since you're not technically measuring &quot;drug degradation&quot;. The term &quot;drug activity&quot; is more accurate, which is more agnostic to the mechanism through which the reporter strain growth is altered.</p><p>Title – should indicate that this is all in cell culture, no animal models of efficacy are shown.</p><p>Line 30 – the line &quot;one third of resistance mutations increase or decrease bacterial drug breakdown&quot; should be removed given that there is a lot of uncertainty about how many total resistance mutations exist and that the assay didn't look directly at drug breakdown.</p><p>Line 110 – This is a key point that could be highlighted more in the abstract and discussion. It's fascinating that mutations in a transporter can mask the impact of genes for drug metabolism, which really complicates how you think about the microbiome's role in pharmacology.</p><p>Line 125 – the nature of this collection is really vague. Need to describe briefly how this library was made and what it is (transposons? Clean deletions?). Methods should stand on their own without requiring citations.</p><p>Line 143 – 16-fold is way too conservative. 2-3 fold is more standard and arguably unnecessary given the p-value cutoff. While a secondary screen would be ideal, at a minimum these data should be re-analyzed at a less conservative cutoff.</p><p>Line 190 – specify how many hours.</p><p>Line 226 – need to specify how many strains were validated – just 3?</p><p>Figure 2c – change to micro symbol no uM.</p><p>Figure 3a – the numbers get really small here, with just 8 pure clones tested and 1 sequenced. Need to make sure to adjust the interpretations accordingly. Given this data it's possible to make statements about what was found, but general trends are impossible to infer. Typo: &quot;comensal&quot;.</p><p>Figure 4 – it's pretty vague in the methods how the mutations were manually curated. Need to provide more details and include the unfiltered output in a supplemental table. As is, it's unclear if nupC is the full signal or if a lot more is going on in these isolates.</p><p>Line 494 – need to add citations to support this claim.</p><p>Line 666 – typo: &quot;prymidine&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– My major issue with this manuscript is that the authors make pretty striking claims extending their largely in vitro work on bacterial resistance to gemcitabine to both: (1) in vivo bacterial resistance and (2) tumor gemcitabine response. For example, the abstract says &quot;The two studies […] showing that bacteria-drug interactions transpire locally and systemically and can influence chemoresistance in the host&quot;. The introduction further claims &quot;Our work reveals that bacterial adaptation to the frontline chemotherapy drug gemcitabine can take place rapidly and can ultimately increase the chemosensitivity of the hosting tumor&quot;, which the authors follow up by stating &quot;Given that administration of antibiotics can be detrimental to cancer patients, our work is potentially impactful since highlights that tumor colonization by chemotherapy metabolizing bacteria may not hamper anticancer treatment in the long run&quot;. However, there are no in vivo experiments presented to show that (1) the nupC mutations identified in vitro are actually selected in gemcitabine treated tumors or (2) nupC mutant bacteria affect tumor levels of gemcitabine, gemcitabine action in PDAC cells in a tumor or PDAC response to gemcitabine. I believe to make these extensive claims, the authors would need to provide such in vivo data, at least using animals models of pancreas cancer. In the absence of such data, I would suggest that the authors revise the abstract, introduction and discussion to moderate these extensions from their work to in vivo tumor biology.</p><p>– Regarding point (1), the high ex vivo dose of gemcitabine used in these experiments coupled with the rapid doubling rate in culture may lead to selection of resistance mechanisms that are different than those employed in an environment where perhaps the bacteria grow much more slowly and have access to nucleosides that can compete with gemcitabine (PMID: 30827862).</p><p>– Regarding point (2), the bacterial conditioning of gemcitabine -&gt; treatment of CT26 cells is not readily extrapolatable to the in vivo PDAC tumor situation. How does the dose of gemcitabine compare to intratumoral/intravenous concentration? How does the # of bacteria compared to cancer cell # in this experiment relate to the population of these cells in tumors? For these reasons, think it is very important to measure how tumors colonized with gemcitabine sensitive versus resistant bacteria impact intratumoral gemcitabine levels, gemcitabine action in PDAC cells and resulting tumor response.</p><p>– It is unclear to me why the authors chose to use CT26 organoids for these studies. Would not PDAC cells or organoids be more relevant?</p><p>– How do the doses of gemcitabine selected for screening and evolution compare not just to PDAC cell line IC50s but to intratumoral concentrations of gemcitabine?</p><p>– In line 219, the authors state they tested an additional 46 resistant strains. What basis was used for the selection of these additional strains.</p><p>– The authors have bacterial isolates with pretty different EC50 responses to gemcitabine. Do these isolates have different expression of the genes identified in the screening that could explain the baseline sensitivities of these isolates?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83140.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) For the findings to be fully supported, you would need a secondary screen/validation of the primary screen's results.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated the genetic screen in two formats: We repeated the screen with the same collection of knockout strains and we repeated the screen with independent strain collection (knockout strains that were independently cloned).

For example, the abstract says &quot;The two studies […] showing that bacteria-drug interactions transpire locally and systemically and can influence chemoresistance in the host&quot;. The introduction further claims &quot;Our work reveals that bacterial adaptation to the frontline chemotherapy drug gemcitabine can take place rapidly and can ultimately increase the chemosensitivity of the hosting tumor&quot;, which the authors follow up by stating &quot;Given that administration of antibiotics can be detrimental to cancer patients, our work is potentially impactful since highlights that tumor colonization by chemotherapy metabolizing bacteria may not hamper anticancer treatment in the long run&quot;. However, there are no in vivo experiments presented to show that (1) the nupC mutations identified in vitro are actually selected in gemcitabine treated tumors or (2) nupC mutant bacteria affect tumor levels of gemcitabine, gemcitabine action in PDAC cells in a tumor or PDAC response to gemcitabine. I believe to make these extensive claims, the authors would need to provide such in vivo data, at least using animals models of pancreas cancer. In the absence of such data, I would suggest that the authors revise the abstract, introduction and discussion to moderate these extensions from their work to in vivo tumor biology.</p></disp-quote><p>We the removed the last sentence of the abstract to remove any mention of a treated host (lines 34-36). We revised the introduction to clearly indicate that the presented work is only in-vitro and that conclusion regarding antibiotics should only be made if a similar adaptation is observed in treated patients (lines 107-113).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Regarding point (1), the high ex vivo dose of gemcitabine used in these experiments coupled with the rapid doubling rate in culture may lead to selection of resistance mechanisms that are different than those employed in an environment where perhaps the bacteria grow much more slowly and have access to nucleosides that can compete with gemcitabine (PMID: 30827862).</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text in multiple places (including the title and abstract) to further highlight that this study was performed in-vitro. We agree with the reviewer that growth of bacteria and nutrient availability may be different in the tumor microenvironment. However, very similar claims can be made for the cancer cells themselves (they too likely grow more slowly in the TME and have access to nucleosides). We think that the observation that gemcitabine toxicity in-vitro is comparable in bacteria and in cancer cells is key. We therefore think the premise that within the TME they both likely experience gemcitabine toxicity is a reasonable one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Regarding point (2), the bacterial conditioning of gemcitabine -&gt; treatment of CT26 cells is not readily extrapolatable to the in vivo PDAC tumor situation. How does the dose of gemcitabine compare to intratumoral/intravenous concentration? How does the # of bacteria compared to cancer cell # in this experiment relate to the population of these cells in tumors? For these reasons, think it is very important to measure how tumors colonized with gemcitabine sensitive versus resistant bacteria impact intratumoral gemcitabine levels, gemcitabine action in PDAC cells and resulting tumor response.</p></disp-quote><p>Measurements of gemcitabine peaks in plasma show that they vary considerably based on the dosing protocol in patients (PMID: 27007129). In extreme cases the plasma concentration can reach 320-512 µM in some patients. We agree with the reviewer that measurement of tumor sensitivity to gemcitabine as a function of the bacterial infection (wt vs. del-nupC) is important but it is clearly outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear to me why the authors chose to use CT26 organoids for these studies. Would not PDAC cells or organoids be more relevant?</p></disp-quote><p>Similarly, to many other chemotherapy drugs, the toxicity mechanism of gemcitabine is quite general and toxicity is expected in numerous cancerous and non-cancerous mammalian cells. We decided to use CT26 cells since this cell-line was used in the original work that described gemcitabine degradation by gammaproteobacteria in pancreatic tumors (PMID: 28912244). This work used CT-26 cells for both in-vivo and in-vitro experiments. CT-26 cells are also routinely used as a workhorse for in-vivo models of infected tumors (in the original work and in other studies). Therefore, the use of this CT-26 cells allows to compare our results to previous relevant studies and to build on our study for future in-vivo work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How do the doses of gemcitabine selected for screening and evolution compare not just to PDAC cell line IC50s but to intratumoral concentrations of gemcitabine?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have a reference for intratumoral gemcitabine concentrations. Measurements of gemcitabine peaks in plasma show it can reach a very high concentration (320-512 µM in some patients PMID: 27007129).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In line 219, the authors state they tested an additional 46 resistant strains. What basis was used for the selection of these additional strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose the 88 most resistance strains found in our screen. These included the top 42 strains shown in Figure 1E and additional 46 strains. We now clarify this in the text (lines 228-229).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors have bacterial isolates with pretty different EC50 responses to gemcitabine. Do these isolates have different expression of the genes identified in the screening that could explain the baseline sensitivities of these isolates?</p></disp-quote><p>We didn’t explore the molecular underpinning for these inter-strain differences. We agree with the reviewer that gene expression level provides a compelling underlying mechanism (however we have preliminary indications that the reasoning is more complex).</p></body></sub-article></article>
