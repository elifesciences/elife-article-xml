Here, we used fate-mapping reporter mice and single-cell transcriptomics coupled to antibody repertoire analysis to characterize the post-germinal center (GC) B cell compartment in a new mouse model of autoimmunity. Antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and memory B cells (MemBs) from spontaneous GCs grouped into multiple subclusters. ASCs matured into two terminal clusters, with distinct secretion, antibody repertoire and metabolic profiles. MemBs contained FCRL5+ and CD23+ subsets, with different in vivo localization in the spleen. GC-derived FCRL5+ MemBs share transcriptomic and repertoire properties with atypical B cells found in aging and infection and localize to the marginal zone, suggesting a similar contribution to recall responses. While transcriptomically diverse, ASC and MemB subsets maintained an underlying clonal redundancy. Therefore, self-reactive clones could escape subset-targeting therapy by perpetuation of self-reactivity in distinct subsets.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>memory B cell</kwd><kwd>antibody-secreting cell</kwd><kwd>single-cell sequencing</kwd><kwd>B cell receptor repertoire</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI130307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carroll</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR074105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carroll</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akama-Garren</surname><given-names>Elliot H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI007529</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akama-Garren</surname><given-names>Elliot H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30AI160909</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akama-Garren</surname><given-names>Elliot H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BEAT (No. 796988)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van den Broek</surname><given-names>Theo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001722</institution-id><institution>Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Academy Ter Meulen Fund TMB/16/285</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van den Broek</surname><given-names>Theo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In an autoimmune environment B cells mature from spontaneous germinal centers into transcriptomically and phenotypically diverse memory and antibody-secreting cells but maintaining shared clonal and potential self-reactive specificities which has important implications for pathogenic cell targeted depletion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pathogenesis is caused by self-reactive antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and sustained by memory B cells (MemBs). Numerous subsets of these B cells have been described in models of health and disease, but it is unknown whether and how these subsets change and relate to each other in autoimmune disease. Among MemBs, the major known subsets are conventional germinal center (GC)- and non-GC-derived MemBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Viant et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, atypical MemBs (AtMemBs) are present in models of acute and chronic infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Song et al., 2022</xref>), as well as in parasitic infection in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Portugal et al., 2017</xref>) and are similar to the age-associated B cells first described in ageing and autoimmune mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Phalke and Marrack, 2018</xref>). DN2 (IgD−CD27−) cells resemble AtMemB cells and are an expanded subset of B cells in human SLE. They likely have a naive B cell origin, and data suggest they can be readily activated to mature into ASCs in the extrafollicular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, these subsets of B cells maintain similarities to marginal zone (MZ) B cells, including the capacity to differentiate into ASCs. However, it is unclear how diverse these distinct subsets are and how clonally related they might be.</p><p>ASCs can also segregate into different subsets with specific properties related to lifespan (short- and long-lived) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nutt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Radbruch et al., 2006</xref>) and origin (GC- and EF-derived) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elsner and Shlomchik, 2020</xref>), though data on the differences in the metabolic profile and clonal overlap between these populations are still lacking. Importantly, experiments with LPS-driven derivation of B cells into ASCs have demonstrated the existence of multiple clusters of ASCs as they mature into alternate terminal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Scharer et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, the complexity of the ASC compartment remains underexplored.</p><p>In SLE, isotype-class switching and somatic hypermutations of autoreactive antibodies indicate antibody maturation in GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cappione et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, to investigate the post-GC subpopulations of B cells in SLE, we utilized a chimeric mouse model where self-reactive clones, which are derived from B cells with a wild-type (WT) B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, compete in spontaneous GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Degn et al., 2017</xref>). We used fate mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing to gain insight into the post-GC populations of B cells in both autoimmune chimeras and immunized chimeras. We found a diversity of ASCs at different maturation stages with distinct terminal states and multiple MemB cell clusters, including GC-derived FCRL5+ and CD23+ MemB cells. These ASCs and MemB subsets showed specific transcriptomic profiles, antibody repertoire profiles, and localization, suggesting functional diversity yet maintaining redundant clonality. Together, our findings outline the underlying complexity of the MemB and ASC compartments and indicates that therapeutic efforts to target autoreactive B cells must consider the likely reservoirs of self-reactivity in other subsets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fate-mapped B cells are distributed into four main clusters</title><p>To track WT B cells as they develop in an autoimmune environment, we used a mixed bone marrow (BM) chimera model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akama-Garren et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Degn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van der Poel et al., 2019</xref>). Irradiated host mice received a combination of BM donor cells from WT and 564 Igi mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berland et al., 2006</xref>), which bear transgenic BCRs with anti-RNP specificities. In this model, WT donor B cells expand, are selected into spontaneous GCs, mature into ASCs, and contribute to the circulation of self-reactive antibodies. To track activated B cells and their derived populations, Aicda-CreERT2-EYFP fate-mapping reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dogan et al., 2009</xref>) were used as donors for the WT B cell repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Fate-mapped WT B cells were purified, sorted, and processed for droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq. Moreover, we compared the response to that of foreign antigen WT chimeras immunized with a primary and secondary dose of haptenated protein.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>B cells with a WT repertoire are found in all compartments of autoimmune chimeras.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup to produce the autoimmune and immunized chimeras and selection for single-cell sequencing.

Expression of the EYFP reporter transcripts was confirmed. Using unsupervised clustering, the cells grouped into four clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), representing the major known B cell compartments: GC B cells (e.g. <italic>S1pr2</italic>), which are either dark zone (DZ, e.g. <italic>Mki67</italic>) or light zone (LZ, e.g. <italic>Cd83</italic>), ASCs (e.g. <italic>Xbp1</italic>), and MemBs (e.g. <italic>Sell</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). All compartments, LZ, DZ, MemB, and ASC clusters were clearly represented in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Using paired single-cell BCR sequencing and repertoire analysis, we observed clones with clear expansion in both autoimmune and immunized chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Indeed, in both conditions, we were able to find clones that had members belonging to all four clusters, exemplified by the phylogenetics of the most expanded clone in one autoimmune chimeric mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The GC mutational level was in a similar range between conditions, although autoimmune chimeras had more DZ and LZ replacement mutations. MemBs in autoimmune and immunized chimeras had a similar number of nucleotide replacement mutations. However, ASCs accumulated more mutations in immunized chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Nevertheless, ASCs in both conditions reached similar maximum levels of mutations (20 nt in autoimmune and 19 nt in immunized chimeras).</p><p>Cells from autoimmune chimeras showed more isotype diversification in all compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Importantly, both preferential and shared clonal usage of heavy chain genes were observed among the most used V genes in each condition. Seven V genes were shared among the top 10 V genes in autoimmune (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and immunized chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>): IGHVs 1–26, 1–53, 1–64, 1–72, 3–6, 6–3, and 9–3. V genes traditionally associated with nitro-phenyl (NP) specificity, like IGHVs 1–72 (a.k.a. V168) 6–3 and 1–53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xue et al., 2019</xref>), were more expanded upon immunization. On the other hand, autoimmune chimeras preferred IGHVs 1–50, 1–75, and 8–8, whereas IGHV 1–64 was used at a similar proportion in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Notably, commonly used V genes in both conditions had clonal usage frequency in a similar range to that observed in B cells from naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rettig et al., 2018</xref>). IGHV genes 1–72, 1–55, 1–64, 1–53, and 1–50 sequences are among the most closely related to that of the 564 IgI autoantibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the potential targets, we produced six monoclonal antibodies using the VDJ sequences from two autoimmune chimeric mice. The VDJ sequences originated from members of four different clones, including the most expanded clone from one mouse. We tested the reactivity of these antibodies using a native protein HuProt array containing more than 20,000 recombinant proteins. We combined the monoclonal antibodies into two pools (Mab1 and Mab2), each containing two distinct clones. We identified multiple potential binders, as exemplified by the top 30 rank based on fluorescence <italic>Z</italic>-score for each pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).

This approach has been important in establishing many of the current concepts of B cell autoimmunity such as receptor editing, follicular exclusion, and clonal deletion. However, introducing a BCR with a certain pre-determined affinity can potentially bias the observations of the rules governing the activation of those cells. Moreover, conclusions drawn from monogenic BCR mice are unlikely to accurately predict the response to self-antigen when a full repertoire of cells are competing for self-antigen and T cell help. Self-reactivity exists as a spectrum of affinities controlled by sensitive mechanisms that might have different regulatory properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Smith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The mixed BM chimera model used in our study allows for the pre-defined self-reactive cells to kick-start autoimmunity.

This VH family member appears in many scenarios such as MZ B cells reacting to HIV gp120 immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pujanauski et al., 2013</xref>) and self-reactive clones in FcgRIIB-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tiller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van der Poel et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, 1–53 is among the most commonly used genes in the mouse response to the hapten group NP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xue et al., 2019</xref>), most likely due to its similarity to IGHV 1–72. Thus, IGHV 1–53 can be considered part of the collection of baseline repertoire that gives rise to ‘polyreactive’ antibodies. Although polyreactive antibodies may be detrimental in autoimmunity, they are likely retained in the repertoire for use when a quick response to a foreign antigen is needed. Notably, mouse IGHV 1–53 is the mouse ortholog to human IGHV 1–69 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ighv1-53, 2023</xref>). IGHV 1–69 is commonly observed in broadly neutralizing antibodies in the anti-viral response, but together with IGHV 4–34, it is also a feature of antibodies in autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bashford-Rogers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Watson and Breden, 2012</xref>). Additionally, the ortholog to IGHV 4–34 in mice is IGHV 3–6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ighv3-6, 2023</xref>), which was the most clonally used gene in our autoimmune chimeras. This suggests that self-reactivity can be driven by predominant V genes that might initially be polyreactive but are further tailored in GCs. Altogether, these data suggest that there might be different ways to generate self-reactive pathogenic clones, starting with common V genes but leading to the usage of more specific ones. Distinguishing the contributions of originally polyreactive vs non-polyreactive clones will allow for better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to epitope spreading.</p><p>Many characteristics have been attributed to ASCs: short- vs long-lived, plasmablasts vs plasma cells, and EF- vs GC-derived. We observed two terminal clusters of ASC development with clear distinctions in the number of Ig transcripts, metabolic requirements and ER-stress-related gene expression. ASC_Late_1 had lower Ig counts and score signature for oxidative phosphorylation, together suggesting a reduced rate of antibody secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lam et al., 2018a</xref>). Intriguingly, ASC_Late_1 had more replacement mutations than ASC_Late_2 and a more diversified usage of isotype. Given that MemBs have accumulated mutations over-time in the GC and that our sequencing dataset was processed ~5 weeks after tamoxifen treatment while the lifespan of short-lived ASCs is estimated at ~2 weeks, reactivated MemBs are the likely origin of most ASC_Late_1 cells. Although pseudotime analysis leads us to classify ASC_Late_2 as one of the two terminal clusters, the immediately preceding cluster ASC_Mid_2 also possesses characteristics of mature ASCs as well, including prominent expression of <italic>Cxcr4</italic> and <italic>Slpi</italic>, which is a marker for BM and long-lived ASCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lam and Bhattacharya, 2018b</xref>), suggesting it could represent another terminal state.</p><p>We identified four MemB subclusters. MemB_1 has characteristics of GC B cells and likely represents recently egressed cells. MemB_2 has similar markers as atMemB and DN2 cells. MemB_3 shares similar characteristics to recently activated B cells. MemB_4 shows patterns of interaction with T cells (and resembles DN4 in humans). We suspect that the different properties of MemB_2 and MemB_4 exist to allow the B cell compartment to respond adequately in a diversity of contexts. Indeed, we observed distribution of MemB_2 GC-derived cells in the MZ and in bridging channels – convenient locations for immediate antigen surveillance and response. MemB_4 might represent T-dependent bona fide long-lived MemBs, maintaining a record of previous exposure and requiring involvement of T cells for retriggering.</p><p>Finally, we found that, to varying degrees, all subclusters of ASCs and MemBs shared members of the same clones. MemB_3 showed striking predominance in clonal overlap with ASCs of all subclusters, indicating this cluster is an activated version of all the other MemB subpopulations. The clonal overlap between all these subclusters was surprising, although not completely unexpected after finding overlapping clonality among ASCs and MemBs when analyzed separately. This overlap likely provides a wider safety-net, an insurance of long-lived memory and a readiness to reactivate to deal with prospective pathogens. On the other hand, this implicates that the efforts to target any one cellular compartment for the sake of therapeutically ablating autoimmunity may overlook the presence of shared self-antigen specificity across different cellular niches.</p><p>Overall, using a WT BCR repertoire mouse model that maps spontaneous GC-derived cells, we observed a diversity of subgroups, reflecting the inner complexities of the ASC and MemB compartments, with specific transcriptomic and repertoire characteristics, but with underlying redundant clonality.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Aicda</italic>CreERT2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C-A Reynaud, J-C Weill.

The arrays were washed according to the company protocol and were probed with the secondary antibody (Alexa-647-goat-anti-mouse IgG gamma-specific) under conditions optimized by CDI Labs for signal detection with GenePix software. Data were processed with CDI’s proprietary data analysis software (<italic>Z</italic>-score analysis).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy</title><p>Following 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation on ice for 3 hr, spleens were embedded in OCT (Fisher Healthcare), frozen in dry ice and stored at −80°C. Spleens were cut into 10 µm sections, blocked for 1 hr at RT with Blocking buffer (PBS, 0.01% Tween20, 2% BSA, and 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)) and stained O.N. at 4°C with antibodies diluted in Blocking buffer. Anti-CD169-BV510 (Biolegend) and anti-FCRL5-APC (biotechne) were used for staining. Slides were washed three times in PBS, 0.01% Tween20 and mounted with FluoroGel (Electron Microscopy Sciences) prior to image acquisition. Images were acquired with an OLYMPUS FV3000R resonant scanning confocal microscope equipped with four laser lines (405, 488, 514, and 633 nm), hybrid galvo and fast resonant scanning capabilities, ultra-sensitive GaAsP detectors with full spectral imaging and motorized XYZ stage for tiling. The images were processed in Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Two-tailed Mann–Whitney, one-way analysis of variance with Tukey correction and one-tailed unpaired Student <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed with Prism 9 (GraphPad).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mice were bred and maintained in the AAALAC-accredited facility at Harvard Medical School.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Betty Diamond as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both of the reviewers recognize the potential interest of this manuscript but have raised several concerns.</p><p>1) The authors should perform additional experiments to validate whether the memory B cell subsets identified using Fcrl5 and CD23 are spatially distinct. These experiments should include quantification of the imaging data and a revised flow cytometry gating strategy to identify memory B cell subsets. The imaging data will likely require an improvement in the quality of the staining to better identify the Fcrl5+ cells.</p><p>2) The authors should add additional discussion regarding how their memory B cell subsets related to subsets that have been previously identified in mice using markers such as CD80 and PDl2.</p><p>3) One of the immunization models used in this study relies on a secondary dose of NP-OVA to activate previously labeled GC-derived B cells. This acute system differs from the chronic B cell activation observed in the autoimmune disease model, in which labeled B cells can be constantly selected into continually ongoing and spontaneous GC and differentiate into antibody-secreting cells. The authors should explain in some lines the differences between these two models and why they decide to compare an acute NP-immunization model with a chronic autoimmune disease model?</p><p>4) The model of tamoxifen administration used in figures 1 to 5 (two doses of tamoxifen on days 4 and 7 after initial immunization) and then in figure 6 (tamoxifen diet for 12 weeks) are different. This might result in a different labeling pattern for the cells expressing AID or S1pr2-Cre. Have the authors made sure that both tamoxifen administration schedules are comparable in terms of cell labeling output?</p><p>5) In Figure 2, the authors identified two terminally differentiated clusters, ASC_Late_1 and ASC_Late_2, which display different transcriptomics. Using differentially expressed markers, can the authors identify these two ASC populations by flow cytometry as performed in Figure 6 for memory B cells?</p><p>6) In figure 3A, ASC_Late_1 has a very diverse isotype usage in the auto-immune mice but not in the immunized ones. On the contrary, ASC_Late_2 in both conditions is overwhelmingly dominated by IgM. Are authors convinced that both ASC populations arise from the autoimmune disease? Are the antibodies generated by both ASC subsets specific for auto-antigens?</p><p>7) In Figure 3A, isotype usage for each ASC cluster and in both conditions is shown. According to previous pseudo-time analysis, ASC_Late_2, which mainly displays an IgM BCR, is originated from ASC_Early_1 to ASC_Early_2 to ASC_mild_1 to ASC_mild_2 according to the pseudo-time analysis (figure 2B). However, all these progenitors' clusters display a much lower IgM expression, especially in the auto-immune model, indicating that they have already class-switched and wouldn't be able to give rise to IgM. How do the authors reconcile these two findings?</p><p>8) In lines 275 to 281, the authors describe and define the different Memory B cell clusters. According to these lines, MemB_1 is defined as recent GC-derived and MemB_3 corresponds to MemB as activated cells. However, in Figure 6, the authors focused on MemB_2 defined as Fcrl5+ and MemB_4 as CD23+, which are defined as atypical Bmem and Bmem depending on T cell for their activation respectively. Why did the authors choose to focus only on these two clusters? Did the authors confirm that MemB_1 and MemB_3 have a GC origin?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific points</p><p>1) The scheme in Figure 1A does not include the exact time points in which mice received tamoxifen and are then sacrificed.

The authors claim that expanded clones can be found in all 4 clusters, but looking closely at this figure the MemB cluster is scarcely represented. Previous work (Viant et al. 2020) showed that the memory B cell compartment is largely populated by single cell clones rather than expanded clones. Can the authors quantify the clonal expansion of memory B cells in their model (how many single-cell, 2-cell, 3-cell clones?).</p><p>4) In figure 1I, the authors show that two monoclonal antibody pools originating from autoimmune chimeras could bind to some auto-antigens from a human recombinant protein array. Why did the authors check the binding to human autoantigens and not mouse autoantigens?

It would be very insightful to also confirm the GC origin or not of the clusters ASC_Late_1 and ASC_Late_2 using this model. As ASC_Late_2 is mainly IgM, it could be that this population is not arising from GC reactions.</p><p>12) In lines 275 to 281, the authors describe and define the different Memory B cell clusters.

Unfortunately, the sparsity of these cells, in addition to the suboptimal performance of the anti-FCRL5 antibody in microscopy limited our capacity to do so. However, it was the observation of fate mapped cells in the Marginal zone area that led us to perform the short-term anti-CD45 i.v. injection labelling as a high throughput method for validation. Rapid staining with i.v. injected anti-CD45 antibody before organ extraction is a well-documented method to contrast localization between Marginal and Follicular zone B cells through flow cytometry, based on the fluorescent labelling of CD45(Cinamon et al., 2008). Indeed, Song et al. (2022) recently used this approach in support to the localization of a B cell population akin to our MemB_2 with a Tbet-reporter mouse after infection and found similar results with flow cytometry and imaging.</p><p>To support this approach, we are including flow cytometry data from the same samples using a traditional CD21 vs CD23 gating strategy to distinguish Marginal Zone and Follicular B cells, demonstrating the capacity to distinguish cells in these compartments. Importantly, using this traditional gating strategy we observe S1PR2+ fate mapped cells in the Marginal zone compartment; the concept of memory in the Marginal Zone remains largely unexplored and we hope our publication will support this idea.</p><p>We are including now all the FMOs for Figure 6 and the confirmation of i.v. staining as supplementary Figure 6- supplement 1 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should add additional discussion regarding how their memory B cell subsets related to subsets that have been previously identified in mice using markers such as CD80 and PDl2.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware of previous studies using CD80 and PDL2 for characterizing the Memory B cell compartment. Interestingly, we didn’t observe much expression of those genes in the clusters that we decided to focus on, MemB_2 and MemB_4, but did find them expressed for clusters MemB_1 and MemB_3, especially in the immunized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). These markers were first defined in the context of immunization and by specific staining with fluorophore labelled antigen and IgG1 positivity. We hypothesize that the distinct conditions of our model and the fact that we took the full Memory B cell compartment in consideration might account for the difference in expression pattern.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Normalized gene expression of <italic>Cd80</italic> (left) and <italic>Pdcd1lg2</italic>(coding for PD-L2, right), split by MemB cluster and condition.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81012-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One of the immunization models used in this study relies on a secondary dose of NP-OVA to activate previously labeled GC-derived B cells.

The authors should explain in some lines the differences between these two models and why they decide to compare an acute NP-immunization model with a chronic autoimmune disease model?</p></disp-quote><p>Our focus going into these experiments and in the development of this manuscript was to explore the diversity of wild type B cells developing in the autoimmune environment and to understand their clonal intersects, much of which was still unknown or understudied in the field. It was of course important for us to “anchor” our observations into a more traditional scheme, so that our data could be of broader use. We decided to use a traditional immunization scheme with the widely used 4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP) hapten coupled to Ovalbumin antigen as reference. We hope it can be appreciated that because we understand the major differences between these models, we refrain ourselves from major comparisons like differential expression analysis between conditions. Though we have explored those analysis we believed them to be outside the scope of this article. We propose that a more complete exploration of the system would likely require the usage of both acute and chronic foreign antigen presence as contrast. Indeed, recent analysis of chronic or severe viral infection are showing overlaps with self-reactive immune response characteristics (Woodruff et al., 2020, 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The model of tamoxifen administration used in figures 1 to 5 (two doses of tamoxifen on days 4 and 7 after initial immunization) and then in figure 6 (tamoxifen diet for 12 weeks) are different. This might result in a different labeling pattern for the cells expressing AID or S1pr2-Cre. Have the authors made sure that both tamoxifen administration schedules are comparable in terms of cell labeling output?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, as for the validation experiments demonstrated in Figure 6 in the manuscript, we used a similar strategy (diet) for tamoxifen induction in both <italic>Aicda</italic>- and <italic>S1pr2</italic>-Cre mice. We had a typo in the original manuscript, with the <italic>Aicda</italic> reporter validation done with tam diet for 8 weeks and left out of diet for 4 weeks, and all <italic>S1pr2</italic> reporter experiments done with a tam diet of 12 weeks. This is corrected in line 247 from the revised manuscript and displayed in the figures as well. Our goal with the tamoxifen diet was to maximize the number of cells that we could fate map since as soon as possible after the chimeras are produced, in contrast to acute labeling by injection of gavage. We have been able to observe the MemB populations in all scenarios, tamoxifen diet and injection with both Cre reporters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 2, the authors identified two terminally differentiated clusters, ASC_Late_1 and ASC_Late_2, which display different transcriptomics. Using differentially expressed markers, can the authors identify these two ASC populations by flow cytometry as performed in Figure 6 for memory B cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that further validation of these populations is granted, unfortunately the markers we pursued didn’t allow complete cluster discrimination through flow cytometry. We hypothesize this happened because most of the cluster gene markers for ASCs didn’t appear as positive or negative but represented different degrees of expression.</p><p>We show here <italic>Itga4</italic> (CD49d) as an example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), where we explored the staining for CD49d in our 564:<italic>S1pr2</italic> chimeras, within the S1PR2+ compartment, by conventional markers for B cells (B220+ CD138-), Plasmablasts (B220+ CD138+) and Plasma cells (B220- CD138+), confirming we can identify CD49d lo and hi populations in the Plasma cells as suggested by the single cell data, but these populations were also found in the B220+CD138+ gate, traditionally considered a less mature phenotype, complicating the marker usage interpretation.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Flow cytometry profile for CD49d expression for a representative 564:<italic>S1pr2</italic> chimera, showing the CD49d lo an CD49 hi populations within the B cell, Plasmablast and Plasma cell conventional gates.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81012-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In figure 3A, ASC_Late_1 has a very diverse isotype usage in the auto-immune mice but not in the immunized ones.

Are the antibodies generated by both ASC subsets specific for auto-antigens?</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesize that the discrepancy in isotype diversity between conditions (Immunized vs Autoimmune) more likely arises from the distinct antigenic exposure in the model. In the autoimmune mice there is likely recurrent exposure and ongoing response to a diversity of antigens, which leads to a larger engagement of cells into isotype switch, whereas the immunization strategy engages a more limited number of cells, most of which don’t seem to have switched yet, because of its acute and highly specific nature, and likely lesser degree of antigenicity and re-engagement of cells from the primary response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 3A, isotype usage for each ASC cluster and in both conditions is shown. According to previous pseudo-time analysis, ASC_Late_2, which mainly displays an IgM BCR, is originated from ASC_Early_1 to ASC_Early_2 to ASC_mild_1 to ASC_mild_2 according to the pseudo-time analysis (figure 2B). However, all these progenitors' clusters display a much lower IgM expression, especially in the auto-immune model, indicating that they have already class-switched and wouldn't be able to give rise to IgM. How do the authors reconcile these two findings?</p></disp-quote><p>Our intention with the Pseudotime analysis was to use an unsupervised method to find likely terminal stages in ASC development and support our assignment, which was originally driven by already known markers. We would like to note that the interpretation of Pseudotime analysis can be tricky and should be taken with caution. For example, the ‘time’ transitions are unfortunately not as clear cut and a few Mid_3 cells will be represented in Pseudotime_2 leading to ASC_2, and even a few cells from Late_2 can show in Pseudotime_1. Nevertheless, a useful way to understand Pseudotime trajectories is to think about it as a transportation system where every cell cluster is a stop. It is possible then that IgM individuals follow along the system but get out mostly at the cluster ASC_Late_2 stop. Indeed, we observe an interesting distribution in isotype usage when splitting the cells into those that were considered only for Pseudotime_1 or Pseudotime_2, with an enrichment of IgM cells already in ASC_Mid_3 stop (Author response 3).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Isotype usage per ASC cluster, showed only for cells assigned to Pseudotime_1 (left) or Pseudotime_2 (right).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81012-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In lines 275 to 281, the authors describe and define the different Memory B cell clusters.

Why did the authors choose to focus only on these two clusters? Did the authors confirm that MemB_1 and MemB_3 have a GC origin?</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to follow up on MemB_2 and MemB_4 because Fcrl5 and Cd23, two surface markers that characterize those clusters, are easily identifiable by flow cytometry and have traditional spatial distribution connotations in the context of B cell biology: Cd23 being a conventional marker for follicular B cells and Fcrl5 having been linked to the Marginal Zone compartment. It was interesting to us that such markers distinguished two populations of Memory B cells <italic>after</italic> leaving the GC, as distinct localization likely suggests distinct function. Moreover, FCRL5 allows us to us to link our interpretations to the work of other groups investigating the nature of “atypical” B cells in mice and human (DN2-like) and as a demonstration of that phenotype presence in our model. Importantly, as mentioned in the original manuscript, we believe this to be a confirmation of a DN2-like population within the GC-derived memory compartment. We expect this finding to be of high relevance to ongoing discussions on the nature of these cells within the autoimmune and B cell field at large as so far this phenotype has mostly been linked to recent activation from naïve B cells outside the GC.</p><p>We are of course interested in the other clusters as well but decided to constrain ourselves to two of them to maintain our research focused, as we learned that single cell rna-seq validation is on itself a daunting task to fit within a single publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific points</p><p>1) The scheme in Figure 1A does not include the exact time points in which mice received tamoxifen and are then sacrificed.

We have now tried to make this evident in the text. Indeed, we do find many singletons when analyzing each compartment separately. We would like to point that negative results (e.g. absence or limited clonal members) have a restricted interpretation in single cell repertoire given the limited number of cells that one is capable to query so far, even when droplet-based methods allow to sequence more cells that plate sorted methods do; and because of the dominance of cells with high immunoglobulin transcript count (ASCs) in the data tend to dominate over MemB and GC cells when being part of the same sequencing library.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In figure 1I, the authors show that two monoclonal antibody pools originating from autoimmune chimeras could bind to some auto-antigens from a human recombinant protein array.

Indeed, one of our long-term goals is the distinction of GC and Extrafollicular contributions to the ASC compartment that we think the reviewer is alluding to. Unfortunately, we cannot yet answer that question with this data and system. For example, let’s say that a cell emerges from the GC as a fate mapped MemB, but the transition to an ASC happens directly (MemB-to-ASC) in the Extrafollicular space, without returning to the GC; that ASC is by localization non-GC derived but would be GC-derived by lineage, this distinction is clouded in the long-term fate mapping approach and requires more detailed kinetics and spatial studies. We are working on a modification on the experimental design to address this precisely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) In lines 275 to 281, the authors describe and define the different Memory B cell clusters.

However, in Figure 6, the authors focused on MemB_2 defined as Fcrl5+ and MemB_4 as CD23+, which are defined as atypical Bmem and Bmem depending on T cell for their activation respectively. Why did the authors choose to focus only on these two clusters? Did the authors confirm that MemB_1 and MemB_3 have a GC origin?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see Essential revisions question 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) In Figure 6E, can authors include GL7 staining to exclude that labeled S1pr2+ and Fcrl5+ cells don't belong to the GC compartment. Also, quantification of the confocal images is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We used CD169, delineating the Marginal Zone through macrophage staining, as a reference to localization. As shown in the images provided, this allows us to clearly distinguish the boundaries of the follicles and can be confident these don’t represent GC B cells (which can be seen in red clusters within the follicle).</p></body></sub-article></article>
