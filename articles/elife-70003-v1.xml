The primary aim of this work is to determine how cancer risk perceptions and provider communication behaviors, in addition to known demographic factors, influence the uptake of both cervical and CRC screening or a single screen among women in southeast Michigan.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Fourteen health services and communication behavior questions were adapted from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) and administered to a multiethnic sample of adults in southeast Michigan. The outcome variable was self-reported up-to-date cervical cancer and/or CRC screening as defined by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Demographic and cancer risk/communication behavior responses of the four screening populations (both tests, one test, no tests) were analyzed with multinomial regression for all comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 394 respondents, 54% were up to date for both cervical and CRC screening, 21% were up to date with only cervical cancer screening and 12% were up to date for only CRC screening. Of the 14 risk perception and communication behavior questions, only ‘Did your primary care physician (PCP) involve you in the decisions about your health care as much as you wanted?’ was significantly associated with women having both screens compared to only cervical cancer screening (aOR 1.67; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.57). The multivariate model showed age, and Middle East and North African (MENA) ethnicity and Black race, in addition to PCP-patient dyad decision-making to be associated with the cancer screenings women completed.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Optimizing PCP-patient decision-making in health care may increase opportunities for both cervical cancer and CRC screening either in the office or by self-sampling. Understanding the effects of age and the different interventional strategies needed for MENA women compared to Black women will inform future intervention trials aimed to increase both cancer screenings.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work was supported by NIH through the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research UL1TR002240 and by NCI through The University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center P30CA046592-29-S4 grants.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cervical cancer screening</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer screening</kwd><kwd>women</kwd><kwd>physician communication</kwd><kwd>fatalism</kwd><kwd>MENA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA046592-29-S4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Resnicow</surname><given-names>Ken</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR002240</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>Diane M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The physician involving the woman as much as she wants in her health care is significantly associated with up-to-date dual cervical and colorectal cancer screening compared to being up to date in only cervical cancer screening.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Women 50–65 years of age have the lowest cervical cancer screening rate among those 21–65 years of age, as reported in three national surveillance databases: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), and Health Center Patient Survey (HCPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harper et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, women 50–65 years of age also have the lowest colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates among those 50–75 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">American Cancer Society, 2020</xref>). Only half of the women in this age group are up to date for both screens, while 25% have cervical only, 12% CRC only, and 12% have neither screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harper et al., 2021a</xref>). As we have previously reported in the evaluation of women in southeast Michigan, those more likely to be up to date for only cervical cancer screening compared to both CRC and cervical cancer screens are younger women and women of Middle East and North African (MENA) ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harper et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>MENA women in southeastern Michigan have become an at-risk hidden population for health care as there is no US Census category that represents their ethnicity on national surveillance health surveys. The Arab immigration to the Detroit area (known as the ‘Arab capital of North America’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crowder, 2015</xref>] happened over the past century in four waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Semaan, 2015</xref>]) in part due to homeland wars and economic poverty, with an opportunity to relocate for better employment opportunities in the auto-industry in southeastern Michigan. Early Arab immigrants were Christian and primarily from Lebanon, Israel, and Syria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cumoletti and Batalova, 2018</xref>) with later increased immigration by Muslim Arabs from primarily Palestine, Iraq, and Yemen. While Arab immigration to the United States has been increasing year over year since the 1950s, health care indicators such as cervical cancer screening, incidence, or mortality have only been reported for Arab Americans after the September 11, 2001, attacks when an Arab American identity was forged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Seeff and McKenna, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwartz et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Over the past two decades, cervical cancer screening rates have improved among MENA women who were significantly less likely to ever receive cervical cancer screening in their lifetime than White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dallo and Kindratt, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yassine et al., 2010</xref>) to the most recent report showing near equivalency with White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harper et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harper et al., 2021b</xref>). However, while the cervical cancer screening prevalence for MENA women is similar to White women, participation in both CRC and cervical cancer screening differs for MENA women. Instead of half obtaining both cancer screenings, only 18% of MENA women are up to date for both, 50% have cervical cancer screening only, 7% CRC screening alone, and 20% report no screening at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harper et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>Personal risk perceptions, and cancer perceptions and knowledge as well as physician communication behaviors, are powerful influencers of screening uptake. In particular, fatalism about cancer leads to less participation in cancer screening programs among White, African American, and Hispanic race/ethnicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Niederdeppe and Levy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chavez et al., 1997</xref>). Greater perceptions of self-cancer risk relative to other people have been linked with an increased uptake of CRC screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao and Nan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blalock et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atkinson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition, physician communication behaviors may be a key modifiable determinate of cancer screening behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peterson et al., 2016</xref>) so much so that increasing communication behavior is included as a major objective in the <italic>Healthy People 2030</italic> guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">HP 2030 Guidelines, 2020</xref>). Simple physician recommendations for a prevention intervention have been successful in increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kempe et al., 2019</xref>), CRC screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hudson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atkinson et al., 2015</xref>), and cervical cancer screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luque et al., 2018</xref>). But more specific communication patterns that examine involvement in health care decisions and dealing with women’s feelings of uncertainty might better deconstruct the association with the cancer type and its related screening behaviors.</p><p>The primary aim of our study was to determine if CRC and/or cervical cancer screening uptake among the multiethnic sample of White, Black, and MENA women 50–65 years of age from southeast Michigan was associated with personal risk perceptions, cancer risk perceptions, and physician communication behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Survey measures</title><p>A cross-sectional health survey that included screening determinants questions from the NCI HINTS 5 study was developed and piloted for southeast Michigan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harper et al., 2021a</xref>). Only women 50–65 years of age who answered questions about cervical cancer and CRC screening were included in this study. Questions about hysterectomy and colectomy were not included in the survey. Prior demographic descriptors significant to this screening population were included in the analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harper et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">HP 2030 Guidelines, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The respondent’s perceptions of the communication behaviors of her primary care physician (PCP) were assessed with seven items adapted from the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marshall et al., 2001</xref>). These include questions such as ‘Did your primary care physician give you the chance to ask all the health-related questions you had?’ on a four-point Likert scale (1-4): always, usually, sometimes, and never. The risk perception and knowledge section of HINTS were developed from the Health Belief Model, the Precaution Adoption Model, the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, the Self-Regulation Model of Health Behavior, and the Protection Motivation Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vernon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The seven questions included items such as ‘When I think about cancer, I automatically think about death’ which were also scored on a four-point Likert scale (1-4): strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, somewhat agree, strongly agree. While these two sets of seven questions are often aggregated for a summary score, we found the detailed questions provided more insight about the screening behaviors.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Survey questions.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Cancer risk perception and knowledge</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Cancer is most often caused by a person’s behavior or lifestyle</td></tr><tr><td> It seems like everything causes cancer</td></tr><tr><td> I'd rather not know my chance of getting cancer</td></tr><tr><td> There’s not much you can do to lower your chances of getting cancer</td></tr><tr><td> There are so many recommendations about cancer prevention, it’s hard to know which ones to follow</td></tr><tr><td> When I think about cancer, I automatically think about death</td></tr><tr><td> How likely are you to get cancer in your lifetime compared to others your age?</td></tr><tr><th>Physician communication behavior – In the past 12 months, how often did your PCP …</th></tr><tr><td> Give you the chance to ask all health-related questions</td></tr><tr><td> Give you the attention you needed to your feelings/emotions</td></tr><tr><td> Involve you in the decisions about your health care as much as you wanted</td></tr><tr><td> Make sure you understood the things you needed to do to take care of your health</td></tr><tr><td> Explain things in a way you could understand</td></tr><tr><td> Spend enough time with you</td></tr><tr><td> Help you deal with feelings of uncertainty about your health or health care</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>For the MENA sample, the survey was distributed at 12 diverse settings of MENA interest across three southeast Michigan counties. MENA women completed the survey using online forms or paper forms, in Arabic or English, and at home or by interviewer. The remaining sample was obtained via telephone and online methods. A landline or cellphone random dial phone interview conducted by Harris Interactive Inc sampled White and African American/Black adults in the Rogel Cancer Center catchment area, which comprises about two-thirds of the state. An online sample was recruited through Dynata which oversampled African American/Black residents in the catchment area.

The demographic data were analyzed by means and frequencies. The answers to the communication behavior questions and the risk-related questions were collapsed (always/usually vs. sometimes/never) and dichotomized (strongly/somewhat disagree vs. somewhat/strongly agree) for Kruskal–Wallis analysis across the four screening populations. Multinomial logistic regression modeling was used to determine the significantly different communication and risk predictors for the four screening populations adjusting for the demographic variables. It is important to this study that comparator screenings were more than the no screening option, which has been the most commonly reported method of analysis. It is clear from the screening rates that women screen for CRC and cervical cancer differently. Allowing the analysis to include each of these screens alone as a comparator may provide insights into associations with the differential screening outcomes.

We focused on understanding the many combinations of screening uptake that occur and found different predictors for dual or single CRC and cervical cancer screening among women in southeast Michigan. In prior work, having a chronic disease increased CRC or cervical cancer screening rates compared to no screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harper et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cofie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borrayo and O'Lawrence, 2016</xref>) and other studies have shown that cancer fatalism is a major barrier to screening uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clarke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jun and Oh, 2013</xref>). In this work, neither having chronic diseases nor cancer risk perceptions, such as cancer fatalism, had an influence on any cervical cancer or CRC screening behavior pattern. We did however find that positive PCP communication including the woman in her health care as much as she wants (PCP-patient dyad decision-making) was associated with completing both CRC and cervical cancer screening compared to no screen, but even more importantly also compared to only cervical cancer screening – <bold>the first new insight from this work</bold>.</p><p>When one screen alone was completed, women indicated no associated involvement by the PCP in their health care decisions, whereas if there is significant PCP-patient dyad decision-making, there is a higher likelihood that both screens are completed. This creates a hypothesis that comprehensive cancer screening may best be accomplished through a PCP-patient relationship and not through targeted single cancer site screenings. To date, in the United States, specific organ cancer screenings are directed by the respective specialties. For instance, gynecologists dominate the screening method and frequency recommendations for cervical cancer screening just as gastroenterologists dominate for CRC screening. Even the USPSTF guidelines, based in primary care, consider single cancer screenings alone, without the possibility of synergistic multi-organ screenings. In addition, single cancer screenings have been the mainstay of US population programs to date with some success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wong and Miller, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pollack et al., 2020</xref>). But our results may indicate that a single cancer screen when done outside the PCP-patient relationship is perceived more as a test to be done rather than part of general wellbeing. We hypothesize a solution of home-based or self-screening options to target dual cervical cancer (primary HPV testing) and CRC (fecal immunochemical testing with DNA) screening to be used in the PCP-patient dyad decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El Khoury et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gorin et al., 2021</xref>). The self-screening option could also allow the general internist who does not provide gynecologic exams the ability to be effective in this PCP-patient dyad. Moreover, we hypothesize that the PCP-patient dyad relationship may further enhance follow-up after any abnormal screenings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tsui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peterson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p><bold>The second new insight</bold> from this work is that age continues to be an important predictor of these two screens, but in opposite directions. Within the 50–65 years’ age range, younger women participate more in cervical cancer screening and older women participate more in CRC screening. We hypothesize a two-level system solution: one patient-centric and one physician-centric. The patient-centric phenomenon is based in the woman’s choice of her PCP. Women who choose a gynecologist as the PCP have less opportunity for dual cancer screening options, as the physician relationship is likely to be focused on the reproductive years and end at the time of menopause in her fifties, and certainly by 65 when there are no further routine reasons for gynecologic care. Likewise, we hypothesize that women who choose a general internist as the PCP are more likely to focus on other medical issues as most general internists do not provide gynecologic exams. Furthermore, we hypothesize that women who have a family physician as a PCP are the group most likely to have both screens completed as both cancer preventions are part of the foundational PCP-patient relationship of family medicine care. While it is patient-centric to choose the PCP, it is physician-centric for test ordering. We hypothesize for future work that family medicine physicians order dual screening more often than gynecologists or general internists.</p><p><bold>The third new insight</bold> is the documentation of the disparities in cancer screening among MENA women which are not well reported due to US Census race/ethnicity categories. Currently race/ethnicity must be indicated by having the respondent write in their MENA heritage rather than having it as a separate preidentified racial/ethnic category. We have shown in this work that MENA women are rarely screened for CRC, be it alone or in addition to cervical cancer screening. Past work also shows MENA women have little CRC screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harper et al., 2021a</xref>). In addition, we have shown that it is not religion itself, but rather the cultural ethnicity of MENA that is associated with the behaviors. We hypothesize that both physician and patient education in the MENA community about patient involvement in decision-making and the screens themselves will improve both cervical cancer and CRC screening.</p><p>Finally, we are the first to show for Black women in southeast Michigan that there are significant strong associations between the positive PCP-patient dyad in decision-making and the completion of both CRC and cervical cancer screening compared to cervical cancer screening alone even after adjustment for age. We hypothesize that the PCP-patient dyad for Black women occurs in patient-centered medical homes as the health care structure in which they seek care leading to dual screening.</p><p>In summary, this work shows that race/ethnicity, age, and physician communication behavior are three independent influencers associated with completing both CRC and cervical cancer screening compared to cervical cancer screening alone. This work provides a baseline for several future studies.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Strengths</title><p>This study compared differential screenings for <bold>dual cervical cancer and CRC</bold> whereas all prior literature has only compared a single screening to no screening. In addition, these two specific internal organs (cervix and colorectum) were intentionally paired in a novel way because their barriers are quite similar: Risk factors for CRC screening in racially diverse populations include less than a high school education, low income, no health insurance, and no regular health care provider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2021</xref>). Other barriers to CRC screening include fatalism, religious beliefs, lack of self-worth, sexually related concerns, history of sexual abuse, and past negative experiences with screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcalá et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knight et al., 2015</xref>). These are the same barriers that others have shown for cervical cancer screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cadman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harper et al., 2020</xref>). This study provides the baseline data needed to explore screening uptake when both cervical cancer and CRC screenings are provided as an at-home screening option compared to in-office procedural appointments.</p><p>A <bold>second major strength</bold> of this study is the inclusion of MENA women who have little representation in translational clinical research. We have been able to show new deficits in CRC screening not previously identified for MENA women, establishing a baseline prevalence.</p><p>Moreover, our methodologic approach is a strength in that epidemiologic risk factors for more than one cancer screen do not exist; and those studies of a single cancer screening do not consider the association with communication and risk perception understanding. Understanding the differences for completion of one screen but not another is important to establish as prior screening strategies targeting a single screen may have missed the opportunity to present options for other cancer screenings. Finally, the population weighting previously done on this database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harper et al., 2021a</xref>) provides generalizability of results for Southeast Michigan.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Limitations</title><p>This is a cross-sectional survey implemented in the community, by Internet and phone providing a onetime sampling of self-reported health outcomes; as such, it is not possible to infer causal relationships between constructs or items in the survey. Likewise, self-reported health outcomes are not equivalent to validated medical record or claims database verification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">St Clair et al., 2017</xref>). Health outcomes are mistakenly overestimated by about half of those who have not received the screen, whereas they are accurately reported by those who are screened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonafede et al., 2019</xref>). An additional limitation is the self-report nature of the health descriptors. There has not been any literature indicating the veracity of self-report descriptors including health states, education, income, or other health behaviors. Both health descriptors and outcomes have been linked to social acceptability and expected responses, as well as subject to linguistic misunderstandings either from language translation or meaning of the question itself, and inaccurate recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">St Clair et al., 2017</xref>). While this is a limitation, none of our covariates were significantly associated with any outcome after adjustments in the model.</p><p>Finally, our work applies to the United States and the health care structure it provides. These results may not be applicable to other national health care systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Optimizing PCP-patient decision-making in health care may increase opportunities for both cervical cancer and CRC screening either in the office or by self-sampling. Understanding the effects of age and the different interventional strategies needed for MENA women compared to Black women will inform future intervention trials aimed to increase both cancer screenings.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH through the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research UL1TR002240 and

Towards those goals, they adapted and administered behavioral questions from the Health Information National Trends Survey to a multiethnic population sample in Southeast Michigan. Self-reported cancer screenings for the cancers (as defined by the USPSTF updated guidelines) served as the variable outcome. The study has public health merit in its identification of distinct predictors for cervical cancer and colorectal cancer screenings. The insights from this work on screening behavior differences among women, the perception of cancer risks and impact of positive provider communication, point to the need for exploring new ways for more holistic and integrated cancer prevention with a targeted focus.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cancer risk perception and knowledge and physician communication behaviors: specific influences on cervical cancer and colorectal cancer screening in women 50-65 years old&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Farah Usmani (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The Referees found the work of potential interest for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> but have also made specific recommendations for your consideration, which are summarized as follows:</p><p>1. In a general journal and for the readers that may not be essentially familiar with the demographics in the State of Michigan, some historical context should be given for the presence of a relatively large MENA population in the region.</p><p>2. In reference to the study finding that younger women participate more in the cervical cancer screenings while the older women participate more in the colorectal cancer screenings, the authors should examine hypotheses to deconstruct this empiric age-specific and/or cancer-specific division(s). For instance, a plausible reason for decreased uptake of cervical cancer screening by older women could perhaps be the perception that they have been menopausal and symptomless, and hence would be free from reproductive tract disorders including cancers.</p><p>3. If available, the data on the religious beliefs of the participants should be included in Table 1. Also, potential correlative differences in MENA women (e.g., between Muslim versus Christian) should be addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>4. As per the stylistic specifications of <italic>eLife</italic>, titles of <italic>eLife</italic> manuscripts should not use a colon and two-part titles should also be avoided.

This is a first notification of this health gap that we are happy to have established in the literature. Our Discussion section has been rewritten to include the third paragraph which is devoted to the hypothesis generating questions that come from our results.</p><p>In the US, our first hypothesis is that this phenomenon is driven from the provider side, not the patient side. Hence, gynecologists, general internists and family medicine physicians are the front line physicians for cancer screenings.</p><p>Women in the US have the opportunity to declare any one of these specialties as their Primary Care Physician (PCP).</p><p>Our hypothesis is that the woman stays with her gyn if she started early in her reproductive life with a gyn as her PCP, and the gyn is focused on cervical cancer screening through the age of 65 where it is no longer recommended. Likewise, the woman who chooses a general internist for her PCP usually is referred to a gyn for the pelvic exam as this is not in the scope of practice for most general internists — nor is their office equipped for the requirements for chaperoning, and the equipment needs of a table with stirrups, specula and sampling devices. In addition, as women gather new medical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, COPD, rheumatoid arthritis, she is more likely to switch to the general internist providing therapeutic care as her current PCP. This is often around the age of 50, where the focus of the health care is on the already established diseases and not on screening for new cancers, especially not those that require a speculum exam.</p><p>On the other hand, family medicine physicians practice the full scope of care and are in the position to provide both gyn and GI cancer screenings. Our next project will be to evaluate the provider type who orders the screening tests from the large claims databases such as Medicare or Optum to see where the correlation between physician type and dual or single cancer screens occurs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. If available, the data on the religious beliefs of the participants should be included in Table 1. Also, potential correlative differences in MENA women (e.g., between Muslim versus Christian) should be addressed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this suggestion as did collect this information and were able to reconstruct the Results section with this perspective.</p><p>Three supplementary tables have been added to the Results section. Supplementary table I shows that while overall Muslims screen differently than all other religions, the MENA women do not show differences in screening by Muslim vs Christian religion. We describe in the 4<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the Discussion section that this reflects on the culture of MENA being more important than the religion.</p><p>Supplemental table 2 shows the multivariate multinomial modeling of religion vs.</p><p>race/ethnicity to predict dual, single or neither screening. This table shows that screening is not associated with religion when the model is adjusted for both religion and race/ethnicity. This supports the 4<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p>Supplemental table 3 shows the differences in cancer risk perception and physician communication behaviors by religion. This table shows that Christians and Jewish women have a significantly higher agreement that there is not much you can do to lower your chances of getting cancer than do Muslim women. Similarly, when the Jewish women think about cancer, a large portion automatically think about death, es eciall com ared to Muslim women. Finally, Muslim women are the least to be involved with their PCP in a dyad decision making relationship. These results are incorporated into Table 6 where adjustments for religion, race, age and all univariate predictors were made. The results of Table 6 show that the culture of MENA women overrides the religion in significant prediction for cancer screenings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We have hypothesized that the age dichotomy is generated from the woman's characteristics — if she has chosen a gyn as a PCP she is likely to get a cervical cancer screen in her 50's but the patient will be gone to her practice by the time she is 65; similarly if the woman has chosen a general internist for her PCP, it is unlikely that she will have a cervical cancer screen between 50 and 65 but will have a CRC screen.</p><p>Likewise we hypothesized that the dual screening vs single vs no screenings comes from the type of physician ordering the test rather than by a patient's characteristics, as a general internist is unlikely to remember to refer out for the cervical cancer screening and cannot do it in the office. We hypothesize that home based cervical and CRC screenings would alleviate the issue of in office screening.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ref. 1.
