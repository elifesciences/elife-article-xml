depends on cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) or to neighboring cells. Loss of such attachment triggers a type of programmed cell death known as anoikis, the acquisition of resistance to which is a key step in cancer development. The mechanisms underlying anoikis resistance remain unclear, however. The intracellular F-actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in sensing the loss of cell–ECM attachment, but how its disruption affects cell fate during such stress is not well understood. Here, we reveal a cell survival strategy characterized by the formation of a giant unilocular vacuole (GUVac) in the cytoplasm of the cells whose actin cytoskeleton is disrupted during loss of matrix attachment. Time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy showed that large vacuoles with a diameter of &gt;500 nm accumulated early after inhibition of actin polymerization in cells in suspension culture, and that these vacuoles subsequently coalesced to form a GUVac. GUVac formation was found to result from a variation of a macropinocytosis-like process, characterized by the presence of inwardly curved membrane invaginations. This phenomenon relies on both F-actin depolymerization and the recruitment of septin proteins for micron-sized plasma membrane invagination. The vacuole fusion step during GUVac formation requires PI(3)P produced by VPS34 and PI3K-C2α on the surface of vacuoles. Furthermore, its induction after loss of matrix attachment conferred anoikis resistance. Our results thus show that the formation of a previously unrecognized organelle promotes cell survival in the face of altered actin and matrix environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>giant unilocular vacuole</kwd><kwd>anoikis</kwd><kwd>macropinocytosis</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix detachment</kwd><kwd>F-actin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020R1A3B2079551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jeongsik</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Dahyun</given-names></name><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Dae-Sik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022M3H9A2083956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sang-Hee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014364</institution-id><institution>Samsung Science and Technology Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SSTF-BA2001-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jeongsik</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Dahyun</given-names></name><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Dae-Sik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Formation of a giant unilocular vacuole through a macropinocytosis-like process in cells with disrupted actin cytoskeleton promotes resistance to anoikis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells of higher organisms contain various functional organelles with characteristic morphologies. These organelles compartmentalize the cell interior and are dynamically remodeled or newly formed as adaptive responses to changes in the cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scott et al., 2004</xref>). The formation of large intracellular vacuoles has been observed across diverse eukaryotic species. Most plant cells, for example, contain a large acidic vacuole that occupies most of the cell volume and functions to maintain turgor pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Taiz, 1992</xref>). Large vacuoles have also been described in mammalian cells. In the developing vascular system, for instance, the emergence of a sizeable intracellular vacuole is thought to underlie endothelial lumenization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamei et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, glioblastoma cells expressing oncogenic Ras protein manifest increased macropinocytosis and accumulation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles that result in a nonapoptotic form of cell death known as methuosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maltese and Overmeyer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Overmeyer et al., 2008</xref>). White adipocytes in fat tissue also form a large unilocular sac (lipid droplet) that occupies most of the cytoplasm but contains lipids rather than extracellular fluid. However, whether the ability to form large vacuoles is a generally conserved functional program across mammalian cell types has remained unknown.</p><p>Loss of extracellular matrix (ECM) attachment in normal epithelial cells can induce a form of programmed cell death known as anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frisch and Francis, 1994</xref>). However, metastatic tumor cells occasionally circumvent such death induction by cell–cell adhesion and cell clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Labuschagne et al., 2019</xref>). Both cell–ECM interaction and cell–cell adhesion directly affect the actin cytoskeleton via integrin or cadherin proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bachir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertocchi et al., 2017</xref>). However, whether extracellular information transmitted to the cell interior via the actin cytoskeleton determines cell fate, such as cell survival or death, has been unclear.</p><p>We now show that, in normal epithelial cells that are highly sensitive to the loss of matrix attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Debnath et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schafer et al., 2009</xref>), acute disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in matrix-detached cells promotes cell survival rather than cell death (i.e., anoikis resistance). This survival is associated with the emergence of a giant unilocular vacuole (GUVac) that occupies most of the cell volume. The formation of this giant organelle was found to depend on a previously undescribed form of macropinocytosis that requires actin depolymerization and septin recruitment for micron-sized inward plasma membrane curvature. Genetic suppression of GUVac formation in matrix-detached cells led to cell death in response to inhibition of actin polymerization, suggesting that GUVac formation is essential for cell survival in an altered matrix environment. Our findings have thus uncovered a cellular strategy based on the formation of a unique type of organelle to ensure cell survival under conditions of cellular stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formation of GUVacs induced by F-actin disruption in epithelial cells originating from secretory tissues in the absence of matrix attachment</title><p>Detachment of MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells from ECM has previously been shown to induce entosis, a nonapoptotic form of cell death initiated by the invasion of one cell by another and resulting in the formation of an entotic vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Overholtzer et al., 2007</xref>). While exploring this phenomenon, we occasionally found an unusual type of cell that contained a single GUVac that occupied almost the entire cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). These GUVacs differed from entotic vacuoles in that they did not contain cells (i.e., no cell-in-cell structures were apparent). Given that ECM detachment results in a gradual change in the actomyosin cytoskeleton, we tested whether changes to either actin or myosin might be associated with GUVac formation. Treatment with latrunculin B (LatB) or cytochalasin D (CytoD), inhibitors of F-actin polymerization, induced a gradual increase in the number of cells with a GUVac during suspension in both MCF10A and human primary mammary epithelial cells (HMEpiCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, treatment with an actin stabilizer (jasplakinolide), an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization (nocodazole), a myosin inhibitor (blebbistatin), or inhibitors of Rho, the Rho kinase ROCK (Y-27632), Rac (EHT 1864), or Cdc42 (ML 141) had no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). To further demonstrate the effect of actin depolymerization on GUVac formation, we overexpressed the SpvB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harterink et al., 2017</xref>), a toxin derived from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> that can cause complete loss of actin filaments in cells and observed similar phenotype to cells treated with LatB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>), confirming that actin depolymerization during the loss of matrix attachment promotes GUVac formation. To investigate the potential of generating GUVac in response to actin stress across various cell lines, we examined established cell lines derived from multiple tissues. Interestingly, we noted that cells originating from secretory tissues, such as gastric (HFE-145, AGS, MKN-45), thyroid (BCPAP), and pancreatic (PANC-1) tissues, displayed a tendency to form GUVac, similar to what was observed in mammary MCF10A and HMEpic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E, and I</xref>). In contrast, cell types from other tissues did not exhibit this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). These results suggested that the development of GUVac might be an intrinsic adaptive program specific to epithelial cells derived from secretory tissues.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Giant unilocular vacuole (GUVac) formation induced by F-actin disruption in matrix-deprived mammary epithelial cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy images of suspended MCF-10A cells showing entotic vacuole or GUVac formation after culture for 24 hr.

At 6 hr after the onset of LatB treatment, suspended cells already contained several indentations resembling nascent vacuoles at the cell surface, whereas cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Examination of the cells at 12 and 24 hr revealed that the resulting vacuoles gradually increased in size and fused with each other, eventually giving rise to one giant vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). We validated these observations by live imaging of suspended MCF-10A cells expressing both mCherry-H2B, which labels nuclei, and plasma membrane-targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Time-lapse images clearly confirmed that individual nascent vacuoles that arose at ~2 hr after exposure to LatB became enlarged and eventually merged into one GUVac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), consistent with the analysis of fixed samples. Adherent cells or suspended cells incubated with reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) did not form GUVacs under treatment with LatB or cytochalasin D, suggesting that matrix attachment suppresses GUVac formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we attempted to determine whether GUVac displays markers of other endomembrane systems. At early time points (1 hr), we observed several large vesicles that had taken up 70 kDa dextran and exhibited EEA1 or Rab5, markers of early endosomes. By 6 hr, some of these large vesicles showed LysoTracker positivity, indicating a transition from early to late endosomal fate, similar to the maturation process of conventional macropinocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, once the vesicles fused, grew, and became GUVac, these markers did not consistently correspond with the GUVac membrane but were instead unevenly distributed around it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). This made it difficult to determine whether they were localized to separate organelles or part of the GUVac membrane. Interestingly, we found that the Transferrin receptor (TfR), which also marks a general membrane population involved in the endocytic pathway (such as PM invagination), was evenly distributed within the GUVac membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Therefore, GUVac appears to possess heterogeneous characteristics of the endocytic membrane, mainly with the TfR marker (likely due to PM invagination) and some partial endomembrane system markers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Macropinocytosis-like process contributes to GUVac formation</title><p>To further characterize the mechanism of GUVac biogenesis, we next applied transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the ultrastructure of matrix-detached MCF-10A cells at various times after exposure to LatB. At 6 hr, we detected inwardly curved structures at the plasma membrane in LatB-treated cells but not in DMSO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The diameter of these endocytic structures was &gt;500 nm, similar to that of macropinocytosis-derived endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Swanson, 2008</xref>). To examine whether GUVac formation is the result of macropinocytosis, we tested the effect of 5-(<italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger inhibitor that is widely applied to block macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koivusalo et al., 2010</xref>). Treatment with EIPA resulted in significant inhibition of GUVac formation in suspended cells treated with LatB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). We also observed that LatB-treated suspended cells engulfed fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled high-molecular-weight dextran (70 kDa), which is not capable of being taken up by micropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2015</xref>). This engulfment was inhibited by EIPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). We next utilized super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to examine this phenomenon in live cells at earlier time points following LatB treatment. We found that a portion of the plasma membrane stained with CellMask showed signs of invagination with a diameter of approximately 1 µm. Within 1 hr after LatB treatment, these invaginations eventually pinched away from the cell surface. In contrast, control cells did not exhibit any inward plasma membrane invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The live super-resolution imaging results strongly indicate that the formation of large vesicles (0.5–1 µm in diameter) primarily originates from the invaginated plasma membrane. Furthermore, we visualized the live uptake of high-molecular-weight dextran (70 kDa) in conjunction with CellMask plasma membrane staining in suspended cells immediately after LatB treatment. We observed the gradual accumulation of dextran-positive macropinosomes in LatB-treated cells, but such accumulation was not observed in control cells. These macropinosomes were found to be colocalized with the invaginated plasma membrane, as revealed by live spinning-disk confocal and super-resolution SIM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the initial formation of these large vesicles results from the internalization of substantial portions of the plasma membrane. This distinctive form of macropinocytosis-like phenomenon responsible for GUVac formation is unique in that it relies on actin depolymerization and exhibits inwardly curved plasma membrane structures, in contrast to the conventional macropinocytosis, which entails actin polymerization and the creation of outward membrane protrusions for engulfing extracellular fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Swanson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Macropinocytosis-like process contributes to giant unilocular vacuole (GUVac) formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of suspended MCF-10A cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or latrunculin B (LatB) for the indicated times.

The actin cortex, positioned beneath the plasma membrane, has a crucial function in preserving membrane tension. When disrupted, it can result in micron-sized membrane fluctuations in the continuous membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cannon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weems et al., 2023</xref>).

We thus speculated that a member (or members) of the septin family might play a role in the initial step of macroinocytosis-like process. A recent study demonstrated that fluorescent protein-tagged septin 6 is recruited to the plasma membrane of matrix-detached blebbing cells, specifically to the convex region (from an intracellular viewpoint) located between the blebs, where the plasma membrane exhibits an inward curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weems et al., 2023</xref>). Using super-resolution SIM analysis at an earlier time point (6 hr) of suspension with LatB, we observed that mCherry-tagged septin 6 was recruited and organized into a semi-circular structure at the inwardly curved plasma membrane. This recruitment was hindered when the cells were treated with forchlorfenuron (FCF), a known septin inhibitor that hinders the assembly and functionality of septin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weems et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Consistently, treatment with FCF or the co-depletion of two key members of the septin family, septin 2 and septin 9, effectively suppressed GUVac formation in suspended MCF-10A cells exposed to LatB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>).

These findings suggested that septin 6 (potentially along with other members) is recruited to the fluctuating cell membrane via the AH domain.

We therefore reasoned that the generation of PI(3)P by these enzymes might contribute to vacuole fusion during GUVac formation. To investigate this possibility, we applied TEM and super-resolution SIM to observe the size of vacuoles in suspended VPS34 KO, PI3K-C2α KO, and VPS34-IN1-treated cells at various time points after LatB treatment. We detected the formation of internal vacuoles at 1, 3, and 6 hr in these KO and VPS34-IN1-treated cells as in the WT and vehicle-treated cells. However, in contrast to WT and vehicle-treated cells, in which the vacuoles fused to form a single giant vacuole (i.e., GUVac) over time, the vacuoles in the KO and VPS34-IN1-treated cells did not increase in size even after 12–24 hr of LatB treatment, resulting in the failure of GUVac formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). Finally, the vacuoles induced in suspended cells by LatB treatment were positive for PI(3)P but not for PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (which can also be generated by PI3K-C2α), as revealed by expression of the specific probes mCherry-2xFYVE and mCherry–PH-TAPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Posor et al., 2022</xref>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

Vacuolization in mammalian cells has been suggested to be associated with cytotoxicity and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Papini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shubin et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore first tested whether cells with GUVacs are undergoing cell death by immunostaining for cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptotic death. Suspended MCF-10A cells under the control condition were typically aggregated and negative for cleaved caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>), consistent with previous data showing that cadherin-mediated cell–cell adherens junctions prevent anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hofmann et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, treatment of suspended cells with EDTA, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator that blocks cadherin function, resulted in significant suppression of cell aggregation (without induction of GUVac formation) and thereby triggered anoikis associated with cleavage of caspase-3. Treatment of suspended cells with LatB also prevented cell aggregation, similar to the effect of EDTA, but it did not induce cleavage of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). We also detected activation of survival signaling by the kinase AKT and the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 in the LatB-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To substantiate the finding that matrix-detached cells with the ability to form GUVacs can avoid cell death, we further measured cell viability with a trypan blue exclusion assay. We obtained similar results showing that cells with LatB-induced GUVac formation were protected from EDTA-induced cell death even after prolonged suspension culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). Treatment with soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) can induce cell death by the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kischkel et al., 1995</xref>), and we therefore also tested whether GUVac formation allows cells to escape such ligand-induced cell death. Simultaneous treatment of matrix-deprived MCF-10A cells with both LatB and sFasL for 24 hr did not prevent sFasL-induced cell death or result in GUVac formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In contrast, prior treatment of the cells with LatB for 24 hr (a condition that allowed GUVac formation) prevented cell death induced by subsequent treatment with sFasL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), suggesting that GUVac formation suppresses cell death signaling. Furthermore, PI3K-C2α KO and VPS34 KO cell lines, which are defective in GUVac formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), were susceptible to EDTA-induced cell death even in the presence of LatB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and I</xref>), confirming that GUVac formation promotes cell survival under stress associated with altered matrix and actin environments. We also monitored the fate of cells with GUVacs after they were returned to the normal adherent condition in the absence of LatB. Time-lapse live imaging revealed that cell adherence to the matrix was followed by the gradual breakup of the GUVac into smaller vacuoles, which were in turn eventually eliminated in association with the adoption of a normal adherent morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).

As a result of this macropinocytosis-like process, followed by dynamin-mediated pinching off, vacuoles accumulate within the cell and gradually coalesce, a process facilitated by the synthesis of PI(3)P, involving the activity of VPS34 and PI3K-C2α.

We have now demonstrated the emergence of a hitherto unrecognized organelle, namely GUVac, in mammary epithelial cells, as well as in other cell lines from the secretory organs, triggered by the detachment from the ECM. GUVac formation is initiated by an unconventional macropinocytosis-like process that requires actin depolymerization and septin recruitment to the plasma membrane to achieve micron-sized inward membrane curvature. The resulting vacuoles that accumulate in the cell gradually merge in a manner dependent on the activity of VPS34 and PI3K-C2α, eventually forming a single giant membrane-bound sac that occupies a large proportion of the cell volume. Importantly, cells that have developed a GUVac in response to the loss of attachment and disruption of actin architecture manifest resistance to anoikis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, the formation of GUVac is reversible when cells return to normal adherent conditions, suggesting that GUVac formation to support the survival of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) might be reversed when the cells seed the metastatic niche.</p><p>CTCs are cancer cells that have been shed from a primary tumor and circulate in the bloodstream. Sustained detachment from ECM and hemodynamic shear stress threaten the survival of CTCs, with the result that only a small proportion of these cells escape cell death during circulation in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Massagué and Obenauf, 2016</xref>). A previous study of the effects of fluid shear stress on the viability of CTCs revealed that surviving cells manifest diminished F-actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xin et al., 2019</xref>). Given our current finding that the inhibition of F-actin assembly in suspended cells promotes GUVac formation, it is plausible that surviving CTCs induce GUVac formation to maintain their viability in the face of hemodynamic shear stress in the blood. Clinical observations have provided evidence of large vacuoles in some breast CTCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolostova et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, recent research has shown that intracellular microbiota of circulating breast cancer cells promotes host cell survival by increasing resistance to fluid shear stress through disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, thereby facilitating metastatic colonization in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2022</xref>). Given the ability of various bacterial toxins to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbieri et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harterink et al., 2017</xref>; e.g., SpvB shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>), it will be of interest to explore whether breast CTCs harboring intracellular bacteria are able to form GUVacs during their circulation in the bloodstream and whether such potential GUVac formation is reversible after the cells have seeded the metastatic niche. CTCs are also eliminated by immune cells and require strategies to escape from this immune surveillance if they are to establish metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mohme et al., 2017</xref>). The interaction of FasL expressed on natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells with Fas on CTCs triggers apoptosis in the latter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pereira-Veiga et al., 2022</xref>). Of interest in this regard, we found that treatment with sFasL failed to induce apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells containing GUVacs, suggesting that GUVac formation might also function as a mechanism of immune evasion in CTCs. Whether GUVacs are indeed present in CTCs of breast cancer patients and whether such GUVac formation is associated with metastasis warrant further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Complementary DNAs encoding mCherry-H2B and membrane-targeted EGFP tagged with Igκ leader sequence at the N-terminal and transmembrane domain of platelet-derived growth factor receptor at the C-terminal were cloned into the pBABE-puro vector.

To acquire time-lapse images of live suspended cells in fixed positions right after treatment with DMSO or LatB, cells were suspended on confocal dishes coated in fibronectin. The dishes were incubated at 37°C for 5 min, which allowed cells to attach to the dishes with the round cell shape slightly. The media were changed to new ones containing CellMask (1:10,000), 70 kDa TMR-dextran (0.1 mg/ml), and DMSO or LatB, and the cells were immediately imaged with a spinning-disk confocal or SIM microscope.

To determine whether GUVac displays markers of other endomembrane systems, we analyzed several markers, including EEA1, Rab5, LC3B, LAMP1, and Transferrin receptor (TfR). At early time points (1 h), we observed several large vesicles that had taken up 70kDa Dextran and exhibited EEA1 or Rab5, markers of early endosomes. By 6 hours, some of these large vesicles showed lysotracker positivity, indicating a transition from early to late endosomal fate, similar to the maturation process of conventional macropinocytic vesicles (see new Figure 1-figure supplement 2A). However, once the vesicles fused, grew, and became GUVac, these markers did not consistently correspond with the GUVac membrane but were instead unevenly distributed around it (new Figure 1-figure supplement 2B, C). This made it difficult to determine whether they were localized to separate organelles or part of the GUVac membrane. Interestingly, we found that the Transferrin receptor (TfR), which also marks a general membrane population involved in the endocytic pathway (such as PM invagination), was evenly distributed within the GUVac membrane (new Figure 1-figure supplement 2B, D). Therefore, GUVac appears to possess heterogeneous characteristics of the endocytic membrane, mainly with the TfR marker (likely due to PM invagination) and some partial endomembrane system markers. However, further analysis would be required to confirm this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Formation of a giant unilocular vacuole via macropinocytosis-like process confers anoikis resistance&quot; describes an interesting observation and provides initial steps towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanism.</p><p>The manuscript describes that the majority of non-tumorigenic mammary gland epithelial cells (MCF-10A) in suspension initiate entosis.

Almost every experiment is conducted in suspended cells that were treated with actin depolymerising drugs (e.g. LatB) and thus almost all key conclusions are based on the results of these experiments. I only have a few suggestions that would improve these experiments or change their outcome and interpretation. Yet, I believe it is essential to identify the endogenous pathway leading to the actin depolymerisation that drives the formation of GUVacs in detached epithelial cells (or alternatively to figure out how it is suppressed in most detached cells). A first step in that direction would be to investigate the polymerization status of actin in MCF-10a cells that 'spontaneously' form GUVacs and to test if these cells also become resistant to anoikis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments and fully acknowledge the limitations of our approach. Many detached cells likely tend to contact each other for cell aggregations to suppress GUVac formation. However, it is unclear whether cells that spontaneously form GUVac in suspension have a weakened F-actin structure, which would be valuable to investigate in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it would be great (and I believe reasonably easy) to better characterise molecular markers of GUVacs (LAMP's, Rab's, Cathepsins, etc....) to discriminate them from other endosomal organelles</p></disp-quote><p>In response to a similar comment from Reviewer 1, we analyzed markers of other endocytic compartments, including EEA1, Rab5, Transferrin receptor (TfR), LC3B, and LAMP1. At early time points (1 h), we observed several large vesicles that had taken up 70kDa Dextran and exhibited EEA1 or Rab5, markers of early endosomes. By 6 hours, some of these large vesicles showed lysotracker positivity, indicating a transition from early to late endosomal fate, similar to the maturation process of conventional macropinocytic vesicles (see new Figure 1-figure supplement 2A). However, once the vesicles fused, grew, and became GUVac, these markers did not consistently correspond with the GUVac membrane but were instead unevenly distributed around it (new Figure 1-figure supplement 2B, C). This made it difficult to determine whether they were localized to separate organelles or part of the GUVac membrane. Interestingly, we found that the Transferrin receptor (TfR), which also marks a general membrane population involved in the endocytic pathway (such as PM invagination), was evenly distributed within the GUVac membrane (new Figure 1-figure supplement 2B, D). Therefore, GUVac appears to possess heterogeneous characteristics of the endocytic membrane, mainly with the TfR marker (likely due to PM invagination) and some partial endomembrane system markers. However, further analysis would be required to confirm this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Loss of cell attachment to extracellular matrix (ECM) triggers aniokis (a type of programmed cell death), and resistance to aniokis plays a role in cancer development. However, mechanisms underlying anoikis resistance, and the precise role of F-actin, are not fully known.</p><p>Here the authors describe the formation of a new organelle, giant unilocular vacuole (GUVac), in cells whose F-actin is disrupted during loss of matrix attachment. GUVac formation (diameter &gt;500 nm) resulted from a previously unrecognised macropinocytosis-like process, characterized by inwardly curved micron-sized plasma membrane invaginations, dependent on F-actin depolymerization, septin recruitment, and PI(3)P. Finally, the authors show GUVac formation after loss of matrix attachment promotes resistance to anoikis.</p><p>From these results, the authors conclude that GUVac formation promotes cell survival in environments where F-actin is disrupted and conditions of cell stress.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript is clear and well-written, figures are all presented at a very high level.</p><p>A variety of cutting-edge cell biology techniques (eg time-lapse imaging, EM, super-resolution microscopy) are used to study the role of the cytoskeleton in GUVac formation. It is discovered that: (i) a macropinocytosis-like process dependent on F-actin depolymerisation, SEPT6 recruitment, and PI(3)P contributes to GUVac formation, and (ii) GUVac formation is associated with resistance to cell death.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the concise summary of our study and positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript is highly reliant on the use of drugs, or combinations of drugs, for long periods of time (6hr, 18hr..).

As suggested, we employed siRNAs targeting Septin2 and Septin9 in cells treated with LatB as an alternative to the drug combination approach.

As the reviewer correctly noted, F-actin inhibition is known to reduce apoptotic signaling (PMID: 16072039). However, we observed that anoikis resistance is lost when GUVac is suppressed through knockout of either PI3KC2alpha or VPS34 in cells with F-actin disrupted by LatB (Figure 5I). This suggests that GUVac plays a role in suppressing apoptosis independently of F-actin depolymerization-induced apoptosis resistance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To test the role of septins in GUVac formation only recruitment studies and no direct functional work is performed.

To clarify the specificity of the VPS34 antibody in the Western blot analysis of VPS34 KO clones, we compared these samples with those from siRNA-mediated VPS34-depleted cells (see new Figure 4-Supplement 1E, which replaces the original Figure). Consistent with the known size of VPS34 at approximately 100 kDa, we observed a clear disappearance of the VPS34 band at around 100 kDa in the sgVPS34 clones, which was comparable to the size observed in siRNA-treated cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Figure 2B: Only 4 cells were counted.

However, subsequent experiments that combined TEM with super-resolution microscopy, as shown in Figure 4D-F, produced similar data on plasma membrane invagination, as depicted in Figure 2B, which is the initial step in the formation of GUVac.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C: do cells shrink after treatment with EIPA or LatB? Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the data presented in our original manuscript were misleading. Control cells treated with DMSO display multiple cell-in-cell structures (known as 'entosis'), which typically results in a larger overall cell size compared to EIPA or LatB-treated non-entotic single cells. This might have created the impression that cells shrink relative to the control under EIPA or LatB treatment. We hope this explanation has answered the reviewer’s question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3A: The changes in the localization of mCherry-Spetin6 appear to be very dramatic.

In Figure 3B, we quantified only the number of filament-like Septin6 structures predominantly observed in LatB-treated cells, rather than measuring changes in the relative fluorescence intensity of Septin6 between the plasma membrane and the cytosol. Although we could not estimate the proportion of total Septin6 recruited to the plasma membrane from the cytosol based solely on Figure 3A-B, conducting plasma membrane fractionation experiments with endogenous Septin6, followed by Western blot analysis, would be valuable for addressing this issue in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3D: Please also provide data for the 6h time-point (as in all other experiments).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for omitting the 6-hour time point, which may have caused confusion.

Throughout the study, we primarily used an 18-hour LatB treatment to evaluate GUVac formation, as this longer period allows for gradual vesicle fusion. In contrast, we utilized 6-hour treatments to demonstrate that Septin6 recruitment and subsequent plasma membrane invagination occur at earlier time points, as evidenced by the data in Figure 2G (super-resolution live imaging) and Figure 4D (electron microscopy analysis).
