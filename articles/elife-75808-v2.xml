The ER protein seipin is key for LD biogenesis. Seipin forms a cage-like structure, with each seipin monomer containing a conserved hydrophobic helix and two transmembrane (TM) segments. How the different parts of seipin function in TG nucleation and LD budding is poorly understood. Here, we utilized molecular dynamics simulations of human seipin, along with cell-based experiments, to study seipin’s functions in protein–lipid interactions, lipid diffusion, and LD maturation. An all-atom simulation indicates that seipin TM segment residues and hydrophobic helices residues located in the phospholipid tail region of the bilayer attract TG. Simulating larger, growing LDs with coarse-grained models, we find that the seipin TM segments form a constricted neck structure to facilitate conversion of a flat oil lens into a budding LD. Using cell experiments and simulations, we also show that conserved, positively charged residues at the end of seipin’s TM segments affect LD maturation. We propose a model in which seipin TM segments critically function in TG nucleation and LD growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>seipin</kwd><kwd>lipid droplets</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farese</surname><given-names>Robert V</given-names><suffix>Jnr</suffix></name><name><surname>Walther</surname><given-names>Tobias C</given-names></name><name><surname>Voth</surname><given-names>Gregory A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The functions of seipin in triacylglycerol nucleation and lipid droplet maturation are studied with all-atom and coarse-grained simulations along with cell experiments, providing a novel model for lipid droplet formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lipid droplet (LD) is a fat-storing organelle, surrounded by numerous coat proteins and a phospholipid (PL) monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thiam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walther et al., 2017</xref>). LDs store excess metabolic energy as highly reduced carbon triacylglycerol (TG) and can mobilize fatty acids for energy generation or membrane biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ducharme and Bickel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walther and Farese, 2012</xref>). Due to their key role in metabolism, failure of LD biogenesis leads to metabolic diseases, such as lipodystrophy. Additionally, overwhelming the capacity of cells to form LDs is thought to be crucial for the development of diseases linked to obesity, such as fatty liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greenberg et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Current models of LD biogenesis posit that lipid droplet assembly complexes (LDACs) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bilayer determine LD formation sites and facilitate LD growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arlt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prasanna et al., 2021</xref>). LDACs, consisting of seipin and lipid droplet assembly factor 1 (LDAF1) in humans, or seipin/Fld1, Ldb16, and Ldo in yeast, efficiently catalyze the initial stages of LD formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klug et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The absence of seipin, effectively removing LDAF1 as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2019</xref>), changes LD number and morphology dramatically, resulting in aggregated, small LDs and/or few supersized LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fei et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Szymanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, investigating how seipin works is key to understanding LD biogenesis.</p><p>Human seipin is an undecamer, forming a ring structure in the ER. Each subunit contains a lumenal domain, flanked by two transmembrane (TM) segments and short cytoplasmic tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arlt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klug et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lundin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). The lumenal domain has a conserved hydrophobic helix (HH) thought to insert into the lumenal leaflet of the ER membrane. It was suggested that the HH of human seipin, and in particular S165 and S166, is a key tethering site for TG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prasanna et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zoni et al., 2021b</xref>) and might provide a binding site of LDAF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). Yeast seipin lacks the HH, which may explain why it is not sufficient for function in LD formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arlt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klug et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). A recent study on yeast seipin suggests its binding partner, Ldb16, provides several serine and threonine residues in the PL tail region, thereby working as a replacement of the conserved HH of seipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klug et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we capitalized on new information on seipin TM segments to investigate their roles in TG nucleation and LD maturation using all-atom (AA) and coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We discover a cage-like geometry of seipin TM segments facilitates a conversion of a planar oil lens into a unique ER-LD neck structure. Using cell experiments and CG simulations, we provide evidence that conserved, positively charged residues at the end of seipin’s TM segments are critical for LD growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Seipin TM segments are thought to be critical for seipin functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). The resolved structures, however, do not include TM segments likely because of their flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we modeled seipin structure including the TM segments with the residues ranging from Arg23 to Arg265 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) based on a yeast seipin structural model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arlt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klug et al., 2021</xref>) and our cryoelectron microscopy data of purified human seipin that partially resolved the TM segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; see Methods). The locations and orientations of TM segments in the cryoelectron data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were used in modeling the TM segments. However, due to the low resolution, we could not identify the residues in the TM segments. Therefore, the TM segments of the seipin model present here are subject to further validation. Next, we compared the residues of the TM segments of the resolved yeast seipin model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arlt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klug et al., 2021</xref>) and our human seipin model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). While the aromatic hydrophobic residues of the TM segments face the other subunits (outward) in the human seipin model, the nonaromatic hydrophobic residues of the TM segments are in those positions in the yeast seipin model.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structural model of human seipin.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Structure of a seipin subunit.

To analyze the interactions between protein residues and lipids, we performed the AA simulation of human seipin in a 3-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<sc>D</sc>-glycero-1-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer containing 6% triolein for 3 µs. To study protein–lipid interactions, we reduced the resolution of the AA simulation by molecularly grouping each lipid or protein residue as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>. We then calculated the normalized coordination number by molecule or the coordination number per molecule (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="|" open="|" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>). This quantity, thought of as the concentration-independent coordination number, indicates how much each protein residue prefers interaction with PL or TG (see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The HH exhibited a narrow spike, indicating preferential aggregation with TG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). S166 had the largest value with TG in the analysis, consistent with other computational studies using CG simulations with the Shinoda–DeVane–Klein (SDK) or MARTINI force fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prasanna et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zoni et al., 2021b</xref>). Although the modified parameters of TG have a reduced charge distribution to reproduce the interfacial tension against water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim and Voth, 2021</xref>), the TG glycerol moiety can form hydrophilic interactions with protein residues in our AA simulation (e.g., S166). In contrast, the N- and C-terminal TM segments have weaker but broader interactions with TG. Because N- and C-terminal TM segments, and HH, have helical structures, the attraction map had a weakly defined periodicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). For instance, V163, S166, and F170 faced the membrane center, increasing the accessibility of TG. In contrast, F164 and L168 faced the lumenal interface, which prevented interactions with TG.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Seipin hydrophobic helix (HH) and transmembrane (TM) segments attract triacylglycerol (TG).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Molecular groupings of lipids.

As expected, S166 had a strong interaction with TG glycerol groups as they form a hydrophilic interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The alignment of the insertion depths of S166 and TG glycerol moiety likely amplified the interaction. W257, which can form a hydrophilic interaction with TG glycerol groups, had a high value as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, we note that those results were normalized by the number of CG atoms. If we compare the coordination number of TG glycerol groups and that of TG tail groups, TG tail groups will mostly have a higher value because there are 12 hydrophobic tail groups and 1 glycerol group for each TG molecule at the reduced resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Therefore, while hydrophilic interactions at the hydrophobic phase are significant, the largest driving force of TG nucleation inside the seipin ring is provided by hydrophobic interactions of TG with seipin HH and N- and C-terminal TM segments.</p><p>To understand how seipin influences the dynamics of lipids, we computed the position-dependent diffusion coefficient relative to the center of the mass of the lumenal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). While all lipids had comparable diffusion coefficients in the protein-free region (7.5–10.0 nm away from the seipin center), diffusion became slower near the TM segments and HH due to interactions with the protein. The decreased rate of diffusion coefficient is correlated with the contact area of protein. For instance, lumenal PLs up to 7 nm from the seipin center had the lowest diffusion coefficients because of the HH and switch region in the lumenal leaflet. In contrast, the cytosolic leaflet only contained the N- and C-terminal TM segments at the seipin boundary, leading to higher diffusion coefficients. The diffusion coefficients for TG were between those of cytosolic and lumenal PLs because TG molecules close to the lumenal leaflet can interact with the HH. In addition, strong attractions of TG with protein residues can further reduce the rate of diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We note that the slower diffusion of the lipids that are near the protein have been discussed in previous papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Javanainen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Niemelä et al., 2010</xref>). The mean squared displacement of the lumenal PLs trapped inside the seipin ring, referred to as proteinized PLs, leveled off at later simulation times due to confinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Such confinement can increase the bending modulus of this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schachter et al., 2020</xref>), thereby working as a rigid base to ensure the direction of LD budding to the cytosolic side along with the rigid lumenal domain of seipin.</p><p>LD biogenesis is a microscopic/mesoscopic process, having its time and length scales beyond those accessible by present day AA MD simulations. For instance, during our 3-µs-long AA MD simulation we observed recruitment of TG inside the seipin complex, but not TG nucleation. To access the relevant time and length scales, we instead developed CG lipid and seipin models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>). Linear, four-site models were used for lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grime and Madsen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2022b</xref>). Every four protein residues were linearly mapped to one CG atom to match the resolution with CG lipids. We also placed 24 PL molecules inside the HH ring with the orientation consistent with other PL molecules in the lumenal leaflet and considered these as a part of protein. This is based on the AA MD simulation that demonstrated PLs inside the HH ring are trapped. We constructed an elastic network model (ENM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haliloglu et al., 1997</xref>) by connecting a pair of seipin CG atoms via an effective harmonic bond with a spring constant (sc) of 0.2 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> if the distance is less than 1.5 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Such a choice was made to best reproduce the fluctuations from AA MD simulation data. To understand the impact of the stiffness of harmonic bonds, we also made a model with a sc of 2 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>. To achieve the known stability of seipin in a bilayer membrane, nonbonded protein–lipid interactions were based on the lipid–lipid interactions. Attraction scaling factors that change the force and potential depth linearly are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2022b</xref>). Although it is not obvious how to quantitatively incorporate the AA MD simulation data into phenomenological CG models, higher scaling factors between TG-HH and TG-TM can be qualitatively justified by the high attractions of those pairs indicated in the analysis of the AA MD simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Seipin lowers the critical concentration of triacylglycerol (TG) nucleation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Coarse-grained (CG) model of human seipin oligomer.

To test this hypothesis, we performed the CG simulations of spherical bilayers with a diameter of 40 nm. The radius of the spherical bilayer is comparable that of the actual ER tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Georgiades et al., 2017</xref>). The initial structures had evenly distributed 2 mol% TG molecules. Because the TG concentration is below the critical concentration for its phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamilton and Small, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khandelia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zoni et al., 2021a</xref>), TG nucleation did not occur in the lipid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). In contrast, the system that includes the seipin complex showed a nucleated TG lens inside the complex due to the attractions between TG-TM and TG-HH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). As a control simulation, we included a single seipin subunit in the lipid system and carried out the CG MD simulation. TG nucleation did not happen in the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), indicating that a single subunit falls well short of TG nucleation. Therefore, high protein density at the seipin site provides for collective and cooperative interactions with TG, catalyzing TG nucleation. To support our findings of seipin’s role in facilitating TG nucleation, we also performed MARTINI CG model simulations in a bilayer, containing 2% TG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). While TG was dissolved in the reference lipid system without seipin, TG formed its distinct phase inside the seipin complex. Such seipin-driven TG nucleation was observed in the recent other computational studies using MARTINI or SDK CG force fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klug et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prasanna et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zoni et al., 2021b</xref>). Given that these studies used different approaches to model the TM segments but came to the same conclusion, it is expected that the lumenal domain of seipin, especially the HH, is critical in TG nucleation, while the locations and orientations of the TM segments contribute less to TG nucleation. Interestingly, yeast seipin that lacks the HH could not facilitate TG nucleation in the simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klug et al., 2021</xref>), consistent with the experimental observations in which yeast seipin alone is not functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Exploiting the computationally highly efficient nature of our low-resolution CG models, we also investigated LD maturation. In particular, to study the impact of the cage-like structure of the seipin oligomer and their TM segments in LD biogenesis, we simulated various geometries of seipin in the spherical bilayers containing 6% TG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the first model, we removed the TM segments, and the resulting model only contained the lumenal domain. In the second model, we removed six continuous subunits from the seipin oligomer, and the resulting model contained five subunits. As a reference, we also carried out simulations of the pure lipid system and the 11mer-containing system. Because the TG concentration was above the critical concentration, TG nucleation occurred in those systems even in the system without seipin. However, the resulting morphologies of oil lenses of those systems were different as shown in the final snapshots and characterized by anisotropy. First, in the lipid system, a nucleated TG lens was flat and had high anisotropy to minimize the membrane deformation penalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2022b</xref>). In contrast, in the 11-subunit model, a nucleated TG lens was located on top of the seipin lumenal domain, surrounded by seipin TM segments. This resulted in a significant change in the shape of the oil lens from high anisotropy in the lipid system, minimizing the membrane deformation penalty, to low anisotropy in the seipin-containing systems. Given the nucleation percentages were comparable in those simulations, a change in anisotropy can be attributed to the seipin TM, not to the amount of nucleated TG molecules. Importantly, the seipin TM segments constrained the XY area where TG can be in the bilayer, pushing excessive TG molecules to the budding LD. This results in the formation of the ER-LD neck structure, consistent with an experimental tomogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salo et al., 2019</xref>). An equilibrated diameter of the ER-LD structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), approximated by a diameter of the circle formed by the end residues of N- and C-terminal TM segments, also agreed well with the experimentally measured data, which is in the range of 13–17 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salo et al., 2019</xref>). We note the TM segments tilted away from the oligomeric center during LD growth; therefore, the diameter of the seipin ring increased with simulation time. We also simulated the 11-subunit model with a spring constant of 2.0 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The higher spring constant reduced the diameter of the ER-LD neck structure. However, the nucleation percentage and morphology of the formed oil lens had little difference with the previous system that contained the ENM with a spring constant of 0.2 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cage-like geometry and neck formed by seipin transmembrane (TM) segments are key to modulating the morphology of a forming oil lens.</title><p>The first row shows the clipped snapshots of the equilibrated frames, and the second row shows the closeup view of the seipin.

The resulting morphology of an oil lens from the CG MD simulations was also between those results. The TG oil lens was elongated to the region where there was no seipin subunit; however, it was constrained in the region of seipin subunits, especially by their TM segments. The equilibrated anisotropy was also between the lipid and 11-subunits systems. Finally, we simulated the seipin model that only contained the lumenal domain. Such a complex does not form a mobile focus in cells likely because it fails to form an oligomer, it is not stable in bilayers, or it is degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). However, simulating this system can provide further valuable insight on the roles of the TM segments. The resulting oil lens showed little difference from the lipid system without seipin. The anisotropy was high, and the formation of the ER-LD neck structure was abolished.</p><p>It is worth noting that the mechanisms of oil growth can be predicted from analysis of the nucleation percentage and anisotropy. A sharp increase in the nucleation percentage indicates oil coalescence, as shown in ~70 M MD time steps in the 5-subunit system and ~100 M MD time steps in the 11-subunit system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, the nucleation percentage grew slowly in the seipin model without the TM segments from ~200 M MD time steps, indicating Ostwald ripening. Finally, a sudden increase followed by a sharp decrease in anisotropy in the 11-subunit system implies a slow coalescence. When any two TG molecules in distinct oil lenses are within 2 nm, those oil lenses are considered one oil lens, as shown by a step increase in the nucleation percentage at 100 M MD time steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Such a snapshot resembles two humps, increasing anisotropy. After ~110 M MD time steps, the oil lenses are fully merged into one spherical lens, reducing anisotropy to zero. Controlled coalescence at the seipin site will be discussed later.</p><p>To investigate the more advanced biogenesis steps, we simulated a larger spherical bilayer with a diameter of 60 nm and 6% TG. We also constructed a hENM model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lyman et al., 2008</xref>) using the fluctuations obtained from the AA simulation of seipin in the bilayer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The calculated root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) from the AA and CG simulations agreed well in bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Consistent with the previous results, the seipin TM segments defined the oil boundary, facilitating the transport of TG into the LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The equilibrated anisotropy was close to zero, indicating a spherical shape of the forming oil lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Collectively, our tests demonstrate that the ring geometry of seipin TM segments is key to defining the boundary of the forming oil lens and creating the unique ER-LD structure.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Coarse-grained (CG)-molecular dynamics (MD) shows lipid droplet (LD) growth in a large bilayer.</title><p>‘CG MD simulations of spherical bilayers containing 6% triacylglycerol (TG) with a diameter of 60 nm were carried out’.

In contrast, the N- and C-terminal tail regions, exposed to the cytosol, are not conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test whether the nonconserved, cytosolic tails are important for LD formation, we experimentally constructed seipin-ΔTERM, which lacks the N-terminal region (1–22 amino acids) and C-terminal region (268–398 amino acids). First, we confirmed that seipin-ΔTERM has the same membrane topology with wildtype protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) and assembles discrete seipin foci in the ER.

To test the importance of those residues, we experimentally made the two mutant seipin constructs, seipin-FL-tipA and seipin-ΔTERM-tipA, in which their arginine and histidine residues at the ends of seipin’s TM segments were mutated to alanine. Despite the absence of charged residues, those seipin constructs are correctly inserted into the ER bilayer and stably formed foci as same as wildtype seipin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

The resulting CG simulations demonstrated that those residues no longer interacted with the interface of the cytosolic leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Instead, the whole TM segments were immersed in the forming oil lens, leading to the destruction of the ER-LD neck structure. In particular, the residues at the end of TM segments lost contact with the outer membrane during oil coalescence when a seipin-free oil lens approached the seipin ring and merged with the oil lens contained within it. The loss of the ER-LD neck structure resulted in a flat oil lens, as shown in our CG system that did not include seipin or that had seipin without TM segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Capitalizing on highly CG models of lipids and seipin, we investigate LD maturation, showing that a cage-like geometry of seipin TM segments forms a constricted neck, converting a planar oil lens into a unique ER-LD, facilitating LD growth. In contrast, the system that lacked seipin or contained seipin without TM segments resulted in a flat oil lens with high anisotropy.</p><p>Using cell-based experiments and CG simulations, we further identified certain essential and dispensable parts of human seipin. We show that the nonconserved N- and C-terminal cytosolic regions of human seipin are not required for LD formation. Therefore, truncated seipin models used in the current and previous computational studies are reasonable due to the dispensability of the cytosolic tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klug et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prasanna et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zoni et al., 2021b</xref>). We also provide evidence that the conserved, positively charged residues located at the borders of the seipin TM segments are crucial for LD maturation. Mutating those residues to alanine resulted in an intermediate LD phenotype with more and nonuniform shaped LDs than those formed in wild-type cells. However, these mutations did not alter seipin’s membrane topology. In the CG simulations, seipin TM segments were immersed in an oil lens when interactions between those residues and PL interfacial and head groups became reduced.</p><p>Based on our data, we propose a model in which the positively charged residues, located at the borders of seipin TM segments, anchor the TM segments at the cytosolic side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This was particularly important in maintaining the ER-LD neck structure during oil coalescence. When a seipin-free oil lens approaches a seipin-positioned oil lens, the TM segments should keep their positions in the bilayer to maintain the ER-LD neck structure. Strong electrostatic interactions between the seipin residues at the borders of seipin TM segments and the membrane interface of the cytosolic leaflet inhibited rapid coalescence. Instead, TG in the seipin-free lens was transported to the seipin-positioned oil lens in a controlled manner. A slow coalescence at the seipin site is implicated in anisotropy analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

During LD growth, lipids or proteins such as <italic>LiveDrop</italic> migrate from the ER onto LD through the populated TM region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olarte et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The diameter of the ER-LD neck structure during the LD growth phase is larger than during the initial nucleation stage as demonstrated in the CG simulations. The widely spread TM segments will promote lipid and protein influx to LDs.</p><p>Finally, we discuss the limitations of our study. First, LDAF1 is not included in our simulations as its structure and number in the seipin oligomer are not identified yet. LDAF1 is predicted to have a double hairpin structure, which increases the density of TM segments inside the seipin oligomer. Therefore, including LDAF1 in simulations will likely change protein–lipid interactions in the system and lipid diffusion. Second, the CG simulations benefited from highly CG models to simulate large systems and study advanced LD biogenesis steps. However, seipin sequence-specific features are missing in the seipin model. Also, since this is a phenomenological model, the quantities calculated are not directly related to the underlying AA systems.</p><p>Taken together, we suggest a model in which seipin TM segments are key for LD biogenesis by assisting TG nucleation, controlling lipid diffusion, defining the boundary of the forming oil lens, maintaining the ER-LD neck structure, and controlling oil coalescence. Our study thus provides a broader and deeper understanding of the roles of the TM segments, critical for seipin function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>AA MD simulation</title><p>The seipin simulation in a POPC bilayer including 6% triolein was carried out for 3 µs.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Lucie Delemotte as Reviewing Editor and José Faraldo-Gómez as Senior Editor. All reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission. We appreciate that the revisions required might entail a substantial effort, which might also exceed the typical scope and timeframe permitted for revisions at <italic>eLife</italic>. However, editors and reviewers recognize the interest and originality of the work; therefore, rather than declining this submission, we would like to invite you to revise the manuscript in a manner that convincingly resolves the critical issues raised by the reviewers. To enable you to do so, we will reconsider your revised manuscript irrespective of the timeframe required for these improvements. Please also note it is probable that your revised manuscript will be sent to the same reviewers for a re-evaluation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more thorough investigation of the quality of the models of the transmembrane regions of Seipin.</p><p>2) Improved sampling of the conformational space in atomistic simulations (introducing replicas).</p><p>3) A thorough characterization of the role of the charged residues and the residues in transmembrane position on protein expression, membrane insertion and topology.</p><p>4) A list of concrete predictions from the coarse-grained model that can be tested experimentally or by atomistic MD simulations.</p><p>5) Release of data and models to be openly available to the community.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Whilst a well-structured project, and representing a considerable amount of data, I have a couple of concerns on how well the experiments support the findings.</p><p>Chiefly, I am uncertain of how confident we can be of the modelled TM regions. Whilst fine to include, I feel that the bulk of the figures which interpret these regions are at risk of over-interpreting what might be low-accuracy input models. Seeing as even a small change in TM helix angle or register can cause dramatic artefacts, the model here seems potentially insufficient for use.</p><p>At the very least the following points should be addressed:</p><p>– These models should be made available for download, for verification and use by other researchers.</p><p>– The packing of side chains in the TM domains should be shown, as the image in Figure 1a has very limited use.</p><p>– How do the helices compare to the recent structure of the seipin from yeast [Klug et al., 2021, Nat Comms]? Are there any conserved geometries or side chain packing that could be used to refine or support the model used here?</p><p>– It is stated that the structural density in S1 was used to guide the modelling, but from the figure it is impossible to see how this was done. If there is reasonable density for the TM helices that can be shown, it should be. Otherwise, this comparison is misleading.</p><p>– The principal component analysis in Figure 3 suggests huge movements of the TM helices. This might be due to naturally high dynamics, however might also reflect a low quality input model. Ideally, some other data could corroborate these dynamics, but failing that at the very least the progression of each pair of TM helices (out of 11) should individually be projected on PC1 and PC2. This would show if the dramatic dynamics seen in the figure is happening in each subunit (which would support the author's claims) or if each subunit is doing something different. This would both show that the simulation is not ergodic, and also suggest that subunits are &quot;collapsing&quot; into different conformations, so possibly a result of an issue in the input model.</p><p>The second part, which focuses on the lens formation, is a neat piece of work, and directly addresses the biological question of LD formation. The outcomes from this section seem plausible, however I have a couple of points which should be addressed:</p><p>– The simulations are very coarse-grained, and it's open for debate how well a molecule with 3 tails like TAG can be represented by a 4-bead model. Ideally, some &quot;bridging&quot; simulations using something like Martini could be used on a smaller system to demonstrate that the same observations can be made.</p><p>– Are the dynamics of the CG system the same as the AT system, as in, are the same extremes in TM angles observed?</p><p>Combining these last two points – I wonder if random modelling of the TMs would not produce the same results, as the effect seems to be mostly due to the length of the TM helices and the position of the basic residues. If so, I'd argue that the first part of the study is not really necessary for the study, and overall makes the work weaker.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The conclusions of the study rely heavily on a structural model that is described only superficially. How was the density map/model presented in Figure S1 determined? The transmembrane residues were modelled based on the structure of the yeast protein that is not publicly available (Arlt et al., BioRxiv 2021). How does this model compare with the predicted Alphafold structure? Information on the transmembrane segment residues and the transmembrane segment conformational changes would be particularly relevant.</p><p>– It is stated that the switch region leads to lower lipid permeability on the luminal leaflet. This is potentially interesting but could the presence of the bulky luminal domain explain this behaviour (and not the Switch region per se)? Please comment.</p><p>– It would be interesting to show the analysis on the evolutionary conservation of the transmembrane residues. Additional mutagenesis of conserved residues to demonstrate their functional relevance would also be helpful.</p><p>– In Figure 6 the conclusion is &quot;Therefore, high protein density at the seipin site provides for collective and cooperative interactions with TG, catalyzing TG nucleation&quot;. This appears unjustified since Seipin monomers were not used as control. Instead, it seems that a single TM protein lacking the TAG-binding hydrophobic helix was used.</p><p>– The identification of the charged residues flanking transmembrane segments is potentially interesting. However, given the role of charged residues in protein topogenesis the authors should exclude that the phenotype is not indirect due to poor expression or changes in membrane topology.</p><p>– According to Yan et al., (2019), Seipin luminal domain (without the TMs) expresses well and appears to oligomerize. This contrasts with the what is described on page 14: “Finally, we simulated the seipin model that only contained the luminal domain. Such a complex does not form a mobile focus in cells likely because it fails to form an oligomer, it is not stable in bilayers, or it is degraded”. Please comment on the discrepancy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done a very nice piece of work. Overall, the quality is high, the results are very interesting, and the discussion of the results is fresh and insightful.</p><p>Nonetheless, please let me propose a few ideas to improve the quality of the manuscript further.</p><p>The main weakness of the study is the limited sampling of the atomistic simulation model. If the reviewer is not mistaken, the authors did only one simulation. While its length was 3 microseconds, it is short given that the formation of a triglyceride (TG)-rich lipid phase is limited by lipid diffusion, which is a slow process, and since the transmembrane helices of seipin block diffusion, hence slowing down the formation of the TG-rich phase. This concern is increased by the fact that the development of the coarse-grained (CG) model is partly based on atomistic simulation data. The authors are encouraged to improve the sampling of atomistic simulations by carrying out a couple of additional simulations that would start from a different initial state / lipid configuration.</p><p>In Methods, the methodology of cryo-EM imaging spectroscopy is not presented. These descriptions would be useful, since the structure of the transmembrane region in the simulation models is based on cryo-EM imaging data (Figure S1) and educated guesses.</p><p>The results in Figure 4 are interesting since they present (first) evidence of the rate of lipid diffusion inside a cage-like protein complex. The lipid diffusion data outside but in the vicinity of the seipin oligomer, in turn, is consistent with previous studies (such as, Javanainen et al., (J Phys Chem Lett 8, 4308 (2017)(supplementary) and Niemela et al., (JACS 132, 7574 (2010)))), which could be briefly discussed here.</p><p>Page 13 (&quot;To study the impact of the cage-like structure of the seipin oligomer and their TM segments in LD biogenesis…&quot;). These simulations were carried out at 6 mol% TG, which is above the critical concentration of TG clustering. What happens if the TG concentration is 2 mol%, as in previous simulations discussed earlier in the paper? These additional simulations would be relevant, since they would clarify the relative importance of different seipin units in the clustering of TG (seipin luminal domain, different numbers of transmembrane helices).</p><p>Main conclusions of the paper are based on the CG model, and the conclusions are consistent with current experimental knowledge. However, since the CG model is phenomenological and its properties can be tuned (scaling factor, among others), the question is, what new insight the present CG simulation data can generate that could be tested in experiments and more detailed atomistic simulations? In other words, are the authors able to present experiments to test the key predictions in this paper?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75808.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Whilst a well-structured project, and representing a considerable amount of data, I have a couple of concerns on how well the experiments support the findings.</p><p>Chiefly, I am uncertain of how confident we can be of the modelled TM regions.

This might be due to naturally high dynamics, however might also reflect a low quality input model. Ideally, some other data could corroborate these dynamics, but failing that at the very least the progression of each pair of TM helices (out of 11) should individually be projected on PC1 and PC2. This would show if the dramatic dynamics seen in the figure is happening in each subunit (which would support the author’s claims) or if each subunit is doing something different. This would both show that the simulation is not ergodic, and also suggest that subunits are “collapsing” into different conformations, so possibly a result of an issue in the input model.</p></disp-quote><p>The depicted PC1 and PC2 motions were associated with their maximum and minimum values; Therefore, they can look exaggerated. We would not expect all-atom simulations can show complete ergodicity of the TM segment movements even if the input model was very accurately resolved due to the limited time scale and the large size of seipin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second part, which focuses on the lens formation, is a neat piece of work, and directly addresses the biological question of LD formation. The outcomes from this section seem plausible, however I have a couple of points which should be addressed:</p><p>– The simulations are very coarse-grained, and it’s open for debate how well a molecule with 3 tails like TAG can be represented by a 4-bead model. Ideally, some “bridging” simulations using something like Martini could be used on a smaller system to demonstrate that the same observations can be made.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included additional higher CG resolution MARTINI simulations in Figure 3e; The 4-bead CG models are now published in J. Phys. Chem. B 2022, 126, 2, 453–462.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Are the dynamics of the CG system the same as the AT system, as in, are the same extremes in TM angles observed?</p><p>Combining these last two points – I wonder if random modelling of the TMs would not produce the same results, as the effect seems to be mostly due to the length of the TM helices and the position of the basic residues. If so, I’d argue that the first part of the study is not really necessary for the study, and overall makes the work weaker.</p></disp-quote><p>The RMSF from the CG simulations agrees reasonably well with that from the AA simulations; Also, the radius of the TM segments in CG simulations becomes larger due to TG nucleation and LD maturation, which was not possible to see in the more limited AA simulation. We feel the first part of the study is valuable and adds to the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The conclusions of the study rely heavily on a structural model that is described only superficially. How was the density map/model presented in Figure S1 determined? The transmembrane residues were modelled based on the structure of the yeast protein that is not publicly available (Arlt et al., BioRxiv 2021). How does this model compare with the predicted Alphafold structure? Information on the transmembrane segment residues and the transmembrane segment conformational changes would be particularly relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated our methods section to explain how the density map/model was obtained in detail. Arlt et al., is now published in Nat Struct Mol Biol 2022. The Alphafold-predicted TM structure of human seipin seems to deviate from the expectations in the field. Despite its publicity, Alphafold is not a panacea, especially for membrane proteins.

This appears unjustified since Seipin monomers were not used as control. Instead, it seems that a single TM protein lacking the TAG-binding hydrophobic helix was used.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a new simulation that includes only one seipin monomer.

We have updated Figure 3d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The identification of the charged residues flanking transmembrane segments is potentially interesting. However, given the role of charged residues in protein topogenesis the authors should exclude that the phenotype is not indirect due to poor expression or changes in membrane topology.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional experiments to address this. See Figure 6a.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– According to Yan et al., (2019), Seipin luminal domain (without the TMs) expresses well and appears to oligomerize. This contrasts with the what is described on page 14: &quot;Finally, we simulated the seipin model that only contained the luminal domain. Such a complex does not form a mobile focus in cells likely because it fails to form an oligomer, it is not stable in bilayers, or it is degraded&quot;. Please comment on the discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>It was hard to find an article only with the last name (Yan) of the first author and the publication year (2019). Given the context, we assumed the reviewer tried to refer to Dev. Cell. 2018, 47, 2, 248-256. We have carefully reviewed this paper again. However, this article does not include any in-vivo experiments with the seipin luminal domain (without the TMs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have done a very nice piece of work. Overall, the quality is high, the results are very interesting, and the discussion of the results is fresh and insightful.</p><p>Nonetheless, please let me propose a few ideas to improve the quality of the manuscript further.</p><p>The main weakness of the study is the limited sampling of the atomistic simulation model. If the reviewer is not mistaken, the authors did only one simulation. While its length was 3 microseconds, it is short given that the formation of a triglyceride (TG)-rich lipid phase is limited by lipid diffusion, which is a slow process, and since the transmembrane helices of seipin block diffusion, hence slowing down the formation of the TG-rich phase. This concern is increased by the fact that the development of the coarse-grained (CG) model is partly based on atomistic simulation data. The authors are encouraged to improve the sampling of atomistic simulations by carrying out a couple of additional simulations that would start from a different initial state / lipid configuration.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s positive feedback. We agree with the reviewer that the sampling of atomistic simulations was limited as this is a fairly large system and TG does not nucleate within the all-atom time scale. To address the reviewer’s concerns, we have argued the followings:</p><p>First, many lipids moved more than a dimension of the periodic box.</p><p>Second, this is the longest all-atom seipin simulation to date as a single trajectory.</p><p>Third, we have complemented our all-atom simulations with the MARTINI CG model simulations, which are now included in Figure 3e.</p><p>Finally, we have extended our all-atom simulations by 500 ns, and the results were consistent with the previous 3 microsecond simulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Methods, the methodology of cryo-EM imaging spectroscopy is not presented. These descriptions would be useful, since the structure of the transmembrane region in the simulation models is based on cryo-EM imaging data (Figure S1) and educated guesses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated our Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results in Figure 4 are interesting since they present (first) evidence of the rate of lipid diffusion inside a cage-like protein complex. The lipid diffusion data outside but in the vicinity of the seipin oligomer, in turn, is consistent with previous studies (such as, Javanainen et al., (J Phys Chem Lett 8, 4308 (2017)(supplementary) and Niemela et al., (JACS 132, 7574 (2010)))), which could be briefly discussed here.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s input on this. We have discussed those aspects in our updated manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 13 (&quot;To study the impact of the cage-like structure of the seipin oligomer and their TM segments in LD biogenesis…&quot;). These simulations were carried out at 6 mol% TG, which is above the critical concentration of TG clustering. What happens if the TG concentration is 2 mol%, as in previous simulations discussed earlier in the paper? These additional simulations would be relevant, since they would clarify the relative importance of different seipin units in the clustering of TG (seipin luminal domain, different numbers of transmembrane helices).</p><p>Main conclusions of the paper are based on the CG model, and the conclusions are consistent with current experimental knowledge. However, since the CG model is phenomenological and its properties can be tuned (scaling factor, among others), the question is, what new insight the present CG simulation data can generate that could be tested in experiments and more detailed atomistic simulations? In other words, are the authors able to present experiments to test the key predictions in this paper?</p></disp-quote><p>Although we did not indicate this in the manuscript, the idea of the mutant construct (seipin-∆TERM-tipA) was actually proposed to the experimentalists from the simulators based on the coarse-grained simulations. While we analyzed our coarse-grained simulations, we found that the charged residues at the borders seem to be important, and therefore we proposed the mutant construct (tipA construct) to our experimental collaborators. Consistent with our initial expectations, the mutant construct could not produce mature lipid droplets properly. To support this finding more, we added additional experiments during the revisions (Figure 6a).</p></body></sub-article></article>
