processing. The nervous systems of poikilothermic animals must have evolved mechanisms enabling them to retain their functionality under varying temperatures. Auditory receptor neurons of grasshoppers respond to sound in a surprisingly temperature-compensated manner: firing rates depend moderately on temperature, with average Q<sub>10</sub> values around 1.5. Analysis of conductance-based neuron models reveals that temperature compensation of spike generation can be achieved solely relying on cell-intrinsic processes and despite a strong dependence of ion conductances on temperature. Remarkably, this type of temperature compensation need not come at an additional metabolic cost of spike generation. Firing rate-based information transfer is likely to increase with temperature and we derive predictions for an optimal temperature dependence of the tympanal transduction process fostering temperature compensation. The example of auditory receptor neurons demonstrates how neurons may exploit single-cell mechanisms to cope with multiple constraints in parallel.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02078.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02078.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02078.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Warm-blooded animals—including mammals and birds—expend large amounts of energy in keeping their body temperature constant regardless of how hot or cold their environment is. By contrast, the body temperature of cold-blooded animals—including amphibians, reptiles, and insects—follows that of their surroundings. Cold-blooded animals must therefore have evolved a means to cope with the effects of changes in temperature, but exactly how they do this is not clear.</p><p>Now, Roemschied et al. have obtained new insights into this process by studying the nerve cells in grasshoppers that allow them to hear sounds. The auditory system of the grasshopper comprises sensory receptor neurons that are located on the abdomen of the insect. Sound waves move the tympanal membrane, which causes ion channels within the cell membranes to open. This enables the neurons to produce an electrical signal known as a spike.</p><p>Recordings from grasshoppers revealed that changing the outside temperature by up to 10°C affected the rate at which the neurons produced spikes by only about half the amount expected. Given that these neurons do not receive inputs from any other cells, this ability to withstand changes in temperature must be intrinsic to the neurons themselves. Consistent with this, computational modeling showed that while the activity of individual ion channels did indeed vary with changes in temperature, these changes in ion channel activity had little overall effect on the rate at which a neuron produced spikes.</p><p>Whereas it has previously been assumed that compensation for changes in temperature occurs at the level of networks of neurons, the work of Roemschied et al. reveals that such compensation can occur in individual cells, and that it need not require a lot of energy to be expended.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02078.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02078.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>grasshopper</kwd><kwd>insect auditory periphery</kwd><kwd>mathematical neuron models</kwd><kwd>energy efficiency</kwd><kwd>sensitivity analysis</kwd><kwd>temperature compensation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01GQ0901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roemschied</surname><given-names>Frederic A</given-names></name><name><surname>Schreiber</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eberhard</surname><given-names>Monika JB</given-names></name><name><surname>Ronacher</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name><name><surname>Schreiber</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01GQ0972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schleimer</surname><given-names>Jan-Hendrik</given-names></name><name><surname>Schreiber</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01GQ1001A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ronacher</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name><name><surname>Schreiber</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK 1589/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roemschied</surname><given-names>Frederic A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ronacher</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name><name><surname>Schreiber</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The firing rates of neurons in the grasshopper auditory system are surprisingly robust to changes in temperature, and cell-intrinsic mechanisms are sufficient to explain this temperature insensitivity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Changes in temperature considerably modulate physico-chemical processes and, consequently, also affect neural processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt–Nielsen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robertson and Money, 2012</xref>). The dependence of neural activity on temperature poses a particular challenge for animals without central heat regulation, like insects, who are permanently exposed to temperature fluctuations. These animals must have evolved intrinsic mechanisms at the behavioral, systems, or cellular level that help to circumvent temperature-induced behavioral modulations. Such compensatory mechanisms, however, may also come into play for homeothermic animals under pathological conditions, like fever or hypothermia in mammals.</p><p>Nevertheless, our understanding of generic design principles that enhance robustness to temperature fluctuations remains limited. The goal of this study is to identify mechanisms and limitations of cellular temperature compensation at the level of firing rates. We start from a characterization of the temperature dependence of neural responses in an insect auditory system, which we find to be surprisingly robust to temperature changes. The absence of network inputs to these receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vogel and Ronacher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemens et al., 2011</xref>) suggests that a cellular mechanism underlies the observed temperature compensation and hence raises the more general question to what extent temperature compensation can be achieved at the level of individual cells. Based on generic conductance-based models of spike generation, we then show that the experimentally observed degree of temperature compensation can be explained by physiological properties intrinsic to single cells despite a substantial dependence of ion channels on temperature.</p><p>Temperature dependence is usually quantified by the so-called <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> value, which characterizes the relative change of a variable when temperature rises by 10°C.

In contrast, we found that grasshopper auditory receptor neurons on average increased their firing rate by only ∼40–50% (corresponding to a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> value of 1.4–1.5). Receptor responses are shaped by a cascade of two major steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gollisch and Herz, 2005</xref>)—(1) auditory transduction, which translates the vibrations of the tympanal membrane into receptor currents and (2) spike generation. Temperature compensation of the response must be achieved by compensatory mechanisms in these individual components or their combined output.</p><p>Based on a computational analysis, we first investigate how the second component, that is cellular spike generation in terms of the translation from input current to firing rate, can be temperature compensated in generic model neurons and identify conductances whose temperature dependence favors robustness. As energy efficiency of signaling is an important constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niven and Laughlin, 2008</xref>), we also resolve whether the identified mechanisms for temperature compensation come at an additional metabolic cost and identify the key parameters of temperature dependence that increase energy efficiency of action-potential generation as well as of the maintenance of the resting potential. Moreover, we show that information transfer (via spike rates) is fostered by temperature increments.</p><p>Second, we combine spike generation with a phenomenological model of mechanotransduction and predict properties of the temperature dependence of this nonlinear transformation that would allow for an efficient compensation in firing rates to the degree observed in our experimental data. As our model-based approach generalizes beyond the grasshopper system, our findings can be expected to reflect principles that could be implemented in many invertebrate and vertebrate species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Temperature dependence of locust auditory receptor neuron responses to acoustic stimuli</title><p>Based on recordings of auditory receptor neurons in the metathoracic ganglion of the grasshopper <italic>Locusta migratoria,</italic> we quantified the dependence of the firing rate on temperature. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows voltage responses to stimulation at three different sound intensities and two different temperatures, as well as spike shapes.

To circumvent this bias, we assessed the temperature dependence of a model neuron as the root-mean-squared difference between the firing rates at the two temperatures (mean taken across input currents), normalized by the mean rate elicited at the colder temperature. We refer to this quantity as RMSD. It reflects the average relative change in firing rate with temperature.

Across all model combinations, the relative change, RMSD, was distributed between 0.22 and 2.14, with a median of 0.68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This means that, intuitively, the median of the average change in firing rate of an f-I curve was 68%. The analysis showed that the effect of temperature on spike generation depended strongly on the specific temperature dependence of the ionic conductances. A fraction of models (18%) exhibited temperature compensation with relative changes in firing rate comparable to those found experimentally (RMSD &lt;0.5). This result shows that a low dependence of firing rate on temperature is feasible despite a substantial (and hence realistic) dependence of the individual conductances on temperature.</p><p>Next, we asked which of the nine parameters (i.e., the temperature dependence of peak conductances and transition rates) most affected the dependence of firing rate on temperature. To this end, we performed a systematic sensitivity analysis in the nine-dimensional space of all possible parameter combinations. We created—for each parameter—a distribution of local changes in RMSD induced by changes in that parameter. Specifically, this distribution captured changes in RMSD between all neighboring points along a specific parameter's dimension. Each distribution sampled the whole parameter space (i.e., all possible combinations of the other parameters), also see ‘Materials and methods’. The <italic>impact</italic> of a given parameter on the temperature dependence of the f-I curve was then defined as the median of its specific distribution, directly relating the impact of a parameter to its quantitative effect on RMSD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> depicts the impact values of all <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> parameters on the RMSD. The sum of all absolute values of impacts is normalized to unity. The impact sign, that is whether an increase in a parameter on average led to an increase or decrease in the observable, is indicated by + and −, respectively.

Moreover, we note that our results are not unique to the Connor–Stevens model. An analysis of a structurally different Traub–Miles model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Traub et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benda, 2002</xref>) showed that an equally low temperature dependence is possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>On a side note, a visualization of the RMSD across the complete nine-dimensional parameter space based on dimensional stacking is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>, see ‘Materials and methods’ for details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeBlanc et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>). Dimensional stacking maps the nine-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional representation with nine axes. Ordering of the axes is arbitrary and hence requires optimization to maximize visual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we introduce a new way to determine optimal axes order, defined directly by the ranking of impact scores. Parameters with highest impact on the RMSD are depicted on large-scale axes and parameters with low impact on small-scale axes. The success of the ordering is reflected in the visually structured areas of equal RMSD. As only a subset of all parameters had relevant influence on the RMSD, optimal axes ordering led to a clear visual structure. In contrast, for arbitrary axes ordering visual structure would be hard to recognize.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Temperature effects on f-I threshold and slope</title><p>As we saw, the temperature dependence of potassium channels plays a crucial role for temperature compensation.

Based on biophysically-motivated neuron models, we identified mechanisms that account for the experimentally observed <italic>cell-intrinsic</italic> temperature compensation. Our theoretical analysis suggests that spike generation itself can be relatively temperature insensitive, even though the conductances involved are affected by temperature changes. Importantly, mechanisms increasing the robustness to temperature changes need not compromise the energy efficiency of action-potential generation nor the resting cost. In general, the capacity to transmit rate-based information of sound intensity moderately increased with temperature due to the increase in steepness of the f-I curve. We also predict optimal temperature dependencies of the tympanum-mediated transduction process from sound to receptor current that contribute to temperature compensation. On a side note, we introduced a computationally efficient way to optimize visualization of model-derived observables in a high-dimensional parameter space in the context of dimensional stacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeBlanc et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Temperature dependence of firing rate in single neurons</title><p>Neuronal processing is significantly challenged by variation in temperature due to the changes in chemical and physical processes.

The temperature robustness of these neurons is hence comparable to that of ‘warm-insensitive’ neurons in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Curras and Boulant, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Temperature compensation has been studied in the context of neurons embedded in a network in a variety of systems (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wechselberger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robertson and Money, 2012</xref>). Temperature compensation in grasshopper receptor neurons, by comparison, must be based on cell-intrinsic processes. A similar temperature compensation that must be based on a single-cell mechanism has so far—to our knowledge—only been described experimentally for tarsal hairs in the locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miles, 1985</xref>).</p><p>The cell-intrinsic mechanisms identified in our computational study attribute the observed robustness to a balancing of opposing processes. Phenomenologically, a rise in slope (consistent across the whole parameter range explored) is compensated for by an increase in the threshold of the f-I curve, minimizing the effect of temperature across a broader range of inputs. While alterations in threshold can be produced by changes in peak conductances of ion channels, they have also been described experimentally by heating in invertebrate systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkhardt, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams and Pearson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kispersky et al., 2012</xref>) in agreement with our observations. Biophysically, a heating-induced increase in the speed of repolarizing gating kinetics is opposed by an increase in peak potassium conductances which promote a more negative resting potential (as can be derived from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ35">Equation 2</xref>). Although the balancing is not perfect, average deviations on the order of not more than 50% can be easily achieved with strongly temperature-dependent conductances (in particular, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf76"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>;</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for all activation- and inactivation rates) for ∼18% of the models. The temperature dependence of both delayed-rectifier and A-type potassium channels has a particularly large impact on temperature compensation. This matches experimental observations in neurons of the pancreas of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2006</xref>) and molluscan neurons as well as previous simulations of an extended Hodgkin–Huxley model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rush and Rinzel, 1995</xref>) and is consistent with the effect of peak conductances on firing rate, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schreiber et al., 2004</xref>). Our results also hold for reference models quantitatively different from the original Connor-Stevens model—both for the total fraction of temperature-compensated models RMSD &lt;0.5) and the strong influence of potassium channel dynamics on the temperature dependence of firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), ‘Materials and methods’ for details. These findings show that our results generalize beyond the specific quantitative choice of peak conductance parameters of the Connor–Stevens model. This is further supported by the fact that a structurally different Traub–Miles model could also exhibit a temperature dependence of firing rate as low as that described for the Connor–Stevens model.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Energy efficiency and information transfer</title><p>For auditory receptor neurons in the grasshopper energy efficiency of spike generation is likely to be a relevant factor, also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niven and Farris (2012)</xref>. Firing rates in these cells approach 400 Hz and likely entail a high total cost of electrical signaling. Our results, however, show that temperature compensation need not impair energy efficiency of spike generation nor of maintenance of the resting potential. The rate of sodium channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) proved to be most relevant in setting the energy consumption per spike generated, which is consistent with simulations and dynamic clamp experiments in various model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hasenstaub et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sengupta et al., 2010</xref>). We demonstrated that energy efficiency improved with heating for a wide range of temperature dependencies of ion channels, as was previously described for a model with fixed <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf77"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). A fast sodium inactivation limits the duration of the spike; this was consistent with the experimental data, as spike width decreased with heating. Most importantly, the key parameters regulating the energy efficiency of spiking were different from those regulating temperature compensation of firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The results could be confirmed for alternative measures of energy (separability of sodium and potassium currents as well as the total potassium current). Apart from confirming the role of sodium channel inactivation, these analyses substantiated that the delayed-rectifier potassium channel kinetics (which were most influential to the robustness of firing rate) did not substantially contribute to metabolic costs based on potassium currents. Overall, our analysis focusses on a major source of metabolic cost: the flow of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions which on larger time scales can be compensated by the Na-K-ATPase. For completeness it should be noted, however, that in living cells metabolic costs can also arise from the flow of other ions not included in our study, like Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Summarizing the considerations on metabolic cost, we find most noteworthy that from an evolutionary perspective, the relevant features—robustness of firing rate to temperature changes and reduction of metabolic cost—could both be achieved in parallel.</p><p>Nevertheless, temperature compensation and energy efficiency would be of little use if the fundamental function of information transmission was impaired. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that higher temperatures are also advantageous for the transmission of information about sound intensity. This conclusion is based on our finding that the slope of the f-I curve increased with heating. The capacity to transmit information was affected most by the temperature dependence of the delayed-rectifier potassium conductance. These data, however, need to be interpreted with care. We cannot exclude that channel-type specific stochastic dynamics further influence information transfer in ways not captured by our approach. Implementing the specific stochastic dynamics for the whole parameter space of more than 260.000 models, however, goes beyond the scope of this study and merits future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Optimization of the input layer is important</title><p>Auditory receptor neurons in the grasshopper constitute the bottom layer of a feedforward network: approximately 80 receptor neurons converge to ∼15 local neurons, which in turn project to ∼20 ascending neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vogel and Ronacher, 2007</xref>). All auditory input passes through this peripheral network, which preprocesses information and extracts behaviorally-relevant features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemens et al., 2011</xref>). The large investment into high firing rates and a comparatively high redundancy between neurons in this layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Machens et al., 2001</xref>) also increases the need for energy-efficient spike generation. Optimization of receptor neurons in terms of temperature compensation hence seems a reasonable ‘strategy’, as all effects of temperature on receptor neurons will be passed on to downstream neurons, where they may multiply. Although we currently do not know to which extent other parts of the auditory system are compensated, it is likely to ‘pay off’ to constrain the effects of temperature in the initial stages. Downstream neurons, in contrast, may be expected to adopt different strategies, as they can make use of different mechanisms: balancing of inhibition and excitation for robustness to temperature changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robertson and Money, 2012</xref>) as well as an increase in population and temporal sparseness for energy efficiency and information transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clemens et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Temperature dependence of the transduction process</title><p>While the considerations above refer to spike generation, little is known about the temperature dependence of the preceding transduction process. One hypothesis is that a change in the half-maximum sound intensity of the transduction process could foster temperature compensation in firing rate. Our computational analysis shows that, indeed, a slight shift of transduction to lower sound intensities with higher temperatures may be favorable. Such a shift would occur if the amplitude of the tympanal vibration increased with heating and a stimulus of given intensity hence opened more transduction channels. However, the computationally-derived changes are relatively moderate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that the tympanal vibration in cicadas is relatively temperature independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fonseca and Correia, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The other two parameters characterizing transduction (saturation current and dynamic-range width) reflect properties of the transduction channels (i.e., their peak conductance and activation range, respectively). The increase in dynamic-range width with heating can be interpreted as a decrease in gating force in a gating-spring model for the transduction as proposed for mechanosensory transduction in bullfrog saccular hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howard and Hudspeth, 1988</xref>). Again, increases in temperature are advantageous, because the gating-force magnitude is inversely related to transduction accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Netten et al., 2003</xref>). Depending on the spike-generation process, increases or decreases in the saturation current foster temperature compensation. The former may directly arise from the temperature dependence of the transduction channels' maximal conductance. The latter may require additional heat-sensitive channels with a modulatory influence on the transduction process, such as thermosensitive transient receptor channels (TRPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kang et al., 2012</xref>), which in principle could down-regulate the saturation level of the transduction function via their increased calcium response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chadha and Cook, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Generally, the analysis shows that the transduction process can contribute to temperature compensation. While spike generation alone is sufficient to mediate robustness of the firing rate, a matched temperature dependence of the transduction process may allow for more flexibility in the ‘choice’ of spike generation parameters, including the possibility to meet additional constraints.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Altogether, our data show that auditory receptor neurons in the grasshopper represent an example of remarkable cell-intrinsic temperature compensation in the absence of network effects. Our computational analysis clarifies that spike generation alone can achieve this high degree of invariance of firing rate to temperature changes. The identified mechanisms generalize to spike generation in other cell types. Moreover, additional nonlinear processing by static nonlinearities (here interpreted as the transduction process involving the tympanal membrane, but on a wider scope also reflecting properties of synaptic transmission) may foster temperature compensation, if well matched with the temperature dependence of spike generation. Overall, the dependence of neuronal processing on temperature merits further investigation, in particular as temperature fluctuations are an oftentimes underestimated variable in mammalian systems too.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental animals and electrophysiology</title><p>Experiments were performed on adult <italic>L. migratoria</italic>, obtained from a commercial supplier and held at room temperature (22–25°C).

To this end, we re-analyzed the experimental data, separately focusing on the early phase of stimulus presentation (10–40 ms post stimulus onset), and the late phase (70–100 ms post stimulus onset). Effects of adaptation were reflected in a ratio of the respective parameter values (early-versus-late phase) that differed from one. While individual characteristics of experimentally measured firing-rate curves were subject to adaptation (e.g., the slope at half-maximum sound level was steeper early on and shallower in the later part), the early-to-late ratios did not significantly change with temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Single-neuron models</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Model definition</title><p>We performed simulations of neuronal membrane potential dynamics using a single-compartment Connor–Stevens model (original model described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connor et al., 1977</xref>;

The distribution's 25% and 75% percentiles are indicated as error bars (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). For each observable, impact values were normalized to give unity when summed across all nine parameters. The sign of the impact provides an estimate of the qualitative influence of the parameter on the observable, that is whether an increase in the parameter value leads to an increase or decrease in the observable. We considered an impact reliable if both percentiles (25% and 75%) had the same sign as the impact.</p><p>Note that our impact evaluation constitutes a <italic>global</italic> sensitivity analysis, comparable to the Morris one-at-a-time method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morris, 1991</xref>). In contrast to the latter approach, we use a full factorial (grid) set of inputs instead of a random one. Moreover, our measure is based on the median instead of the mean of a distribution of differences in the observable. Yet, the interpretation of a high absolute impact is comparable to that of a high (absolute) mean elementary effect (the sensitivity measure in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morris 1991</xref>), as is the interpretation of a large interquartile range of the difference distributions to a large standard deviation of the elementary effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>RMSD minimization with a genetic algorithm</title><p>Alternatively to the coarse parameter grid search, we also used optimization by a genetic algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mitchell, 1998</xref>) to validate the minimum RMSD.

The method is described in detail, for categoric observables, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeBlanc et al. (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor et al. (2006)</xref>. Mainly, the method maps the <italic>N</italic>-dimensional data to a two-dimensional representation by iteratively slicing the data in one dimension and stacking the slices in 2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). In this representation, the position of each pixel in the two-dimensional image corresponds to one parameter combination, and its color encodes the value of the observable. The image has <italic>N</italic> axes of different scales, each associated with one parameter. Visual informativeness of a dimensional stacking image crucially depends on the order in which the dimensions are stacked, that is, the axes order. The parameter dimensions associated with larger variability in the observable should be assigned larger-scale axes; those with lowest variability the small-scale axes. Sorting the axes with respect to their impact on the observable prior to dimensional stacking hence leads to a visually informative image, where color changes can be easily related to changes of the observable with individual parameters. For this study, we used the ranking of absolute impact scores (described above) to define the ‘optimal’ stack order, extending the optimization method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeBlanc et al. (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor et al.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors describe experiments showing temperature insensitivity in locust auditory receptor neurons (Q10&lt; 1.5) and then pursue a modeling approach to explain these results. They concentrate on the spiking mechanisms itself and use an ensemble modeling approach to identify model neurons that will show comparable temperature insensitivity while expressing membrane currents with normal Q10s. These modeling experiments identify key processes (parameters) that give rise to the temperature 'compensation' and show that well-compensated models show a shift in threshold that partially cancels the shift in F-I slope that all models show. They also address the issues of information transfer and metabolic cost as temperature increases and find no restrictions for compensated models. They then use a reverse engineering method to address temperature compensation in the transduction mechanisms (receptor potential). The finding are of general interest because many neurons, including peripheral mammalian neurons, experience temperature changes and these studies show that such changes are easily accommodated/compensated by systems of membrane currents with normal Q10s.</p><p>The three reviewers are from different backgrounds and have different overlapping expertise; their reviews reflect their different backgrounds and expertise, but they all agree that four major revisions are needed.</p><p>1) While conciseness is a virtue it should not sacrifice clarity and completeness. We encourage the authors to expand their style in Introduction, Results, and even Methods to add more rationale and fuller explanations of what they did and how the models were constructed and used. In particular the section “Model-based inference of the auditory transduction function” was very difficult to follow. We suggest that the authors expand this section and fully explain what they did, how they did it, and why they did it.</p><p>2) Like prior studies by Laughlin and others on the metabolic cost of neuronal signaling, the authors use Na flux as a proxy for ion pump activity and as their measure of metabolic cost during spiking and at rest. The authors should provide clear rationale for why the cost of other ions were excluded. This seems particularly relevant in light of the authors' finding that the properties of Na channels, more than those of other channels, influence energy efficiency in these model neurons. The model used only includes Na and K currents and so other ions cannot be considered and the cost of K is tied to the cost of Na by the Na/K pump but this and the inherent limitations it imposes on the conclusion should be made explicit.</p><p>3) One reviewer crystallized concerns about the experimental component of the work: “My concerns are with the acquisition of the biological data, particularly with respect to temperature control and measurement…” The authors should make their experimental procedures crystal clear (in both Results and in Methods) and should address each of the questions posed by this reviewer.

We encourage the authors to expand their style in Introduction, Results, and even Methods to add more rationale and fuller explanations of what they did and how the models were constructed and used. In particular the section “Model-based inference of the auditory transduction function” was very difficult to follow. We suggest that the authors expand this section and fully explain what they did, how they did it, and why they did it</italic>.</p><p>We have expanded all paragraphs, with a main focus on Results and Methods. In particular the section “Model-based inference of the auditory transduction function” has been rewritten. We have also added a total of six supplemental figures (using the figures supplements in the <italic>eLife</italic> format) for more detailed information on the analyses.</p><p><italic>2) Like prior studies by Laughlin and others on the metabolic cost of neuronal signaling, the authors use Na flux as a proxy for ion pump activity and as their measure of metabolic cost during spiking and at rest. The authors should provide clear rationale for why the cost of other ions were excluded. This seems particularly relevant in light of the authors' finding that the properties of Na channels, more than those of other channels, influence energy efficiency in these model neurons. The model used only includes Na and K currents and so other ions cannot be considered and the cost of K is tied to the cost of Na by the Na/K pump but this and the inherent limitations it imposes on the conclusion should be made explicit</italic>.</p><p>We extended the analysis and included additional measures of energy efficiency/cost). The results for measures of charge separation (for spiking cost) are now shown. Moreover, costs are now also estimated based on the potassium currents (results presented in supplemental figures to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Despite minor quantitative changes, the main findings hold for all measures. As pointed out by the referees, costs arising from the flow of other ions can contribute to the metabolic cost in living cells, but are not included in the model. We assume that the major cost in our study arises from the activity of the Na-K-ATPase.</p><p><italic>3) One reviewer crystallized concerns about the experimental component of the work: “My concerns are with the acquisition of the biological data, particularly with respect to temperature control and measurement…” The authors should make their experimental procedures crystal clear (in both Results and in Methods) and should address each of the questions posed by this reviewer. They should also make arguments about how much error there would have to be to affect their conclusion</italic>.</p><p>Below we are addressing all concerns of the reviewer and provide more detail on the experimental procedures. The calibration curve is now included as a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The errors in temperature measurement would indeed have to be large in order to substantially affect our results. To moderately change a firing-rate Q10 value from 1.5 to 1.6, the temperature error would have to be on the order of 1 degree Celsius or more. Our error ranges, as can be seen from the calibration curve, are much lower.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should apply appropriate statistical tests to the biological data in all cases where temperature appears to affect a characteristic, e.g., spike width, so that the reader is confident that the temperature change is large enough to measure valid Q10s</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we have performed additional statistical tests. Tests of differences between warm and cold spike rates are now provided as a function of sound intensity (a corresponding table can be found in a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Also, a rank sum test was used to test whether the Q10 values of the individual characteristics (spike saturation rate, etc) are significantly different from 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0.

In addition, we use measures of charge separation (for spiking cost), which quantify the degree of overlap between sodium and potassium currents and are hence conceptually different from a cost estimated by pure current flow of one ion type. Nevertheless, also charge separation is biased towards one ion type, as it quantifies the fraction of the Na current that is not counterbalanced by a simultaneous potassium current. This is why we now characterize the “alternative scenario” as well, i.e. the amount of total potassium current that is not counterbalanced by a simultaneous Na current. Despite quantitative differences between the individual measures, temperature dependence of Na channel inactivation remains the main player in all cases and exerts the largest influence on metabolic cost (or energy efficiency). Besides, the main player for firing rate compensation (i.e., the temperature dependence of potassium channel kinetics, Q10(n)) has only little impact on the potassium-current-based metabolic cost.</p><p><italic>Another comment concerns the tests for robustness of their findings to the particular choice of model neuron that the authors describe in the paper.

During a 40-seconds-long recording, we cannot exclude that temperature further decreased and hence the effective temperature change was larger than assumed by our conservative approach. This way, however, an underestimation of Q10 values is excluded.

We ask whether mean firing rates at the two temperatures are different, separately analyzed for each sound intensity level (supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These data show that differences only are significant at larger sound intensities. For lower intensities noise is too large to allow for a clear differentiation. This also indicates that the temperature dependence of the saturation-firing rate is more reliable than the rate estimated at half-maximum sound intensity. Second, we tested whether the Q10 values (presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) are significantly different from 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. Again, Q10 values of the half-maximum sound intensity rates are statistically weaker than the saturation-rate based Q10 values. The latter are significantly different from 1.0 as well as 2.0. For the half-maximum intensity values statistical significance is (strictly) only given for difference from 1.0, but not 2.0.
