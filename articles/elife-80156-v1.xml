crucial role in genome function. The H3.3 histone chaperone complex HIRA accumulates in PML NBs upon senescence, viral infection or IFN-I treatment in primary cells. Yet, the molecular mechanisms of this partitioning and its function in regulating histone dynamics have remained elusive. By using specific approaches, we identify intermolecular SUMO-SIM interactions as an essential mechanism for HIRA recruitment in PML NBs. Hence, we describe a role of PML NBs as nuclear depot centers to regulate HIRA distribution in the nucleus, dependent both on SP100 and DAXX/H3.3 levels. Upon IFN-I stimulation, PML is required for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) transcription and PML NBs become juxtaposed to ISGs loci at late time points of IFN-I treatment. HIRA and PML are necessary for the prolonged H3.3 deposition at the transcriptional end sites of ISGs, well beyond the peak of transcription. Though, HIRA accumulation in PML NBs is dispensable for H3.3 deposition on ISGs. We thus uncover a dual function for PML/PML NBs, as buffering centers modulating the nuclear distribution of HIRA, and as chromosomal hubs regulating ISGs transcription and thus HIRA-mediated H3.3 deposition at ISGs upon inflammatory response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>H3.3</kwd><kwd>PML nuclear bodies</kwd><kwd>histone chaperones</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomonte</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomonte</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomonte</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EPIPRO ANR-18-CE15-0014-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomonte</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CHROMACoV ANR-20-COV9-0004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomonte</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IFN-Epi-IM ANR-21-CE17-0018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomonte</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name><name><surname>Corpet</surname><given-names>Armelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LabEx DEvweCAN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomonte</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-61</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomonte</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AFM-Telethon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Plans stratégiques MyoNeurALP &amp;

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hirose et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lallemand-Breitenbach and de Thé, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2020</xref>). PML NBs are 0.1–1 μm diameter hollow sphere structures that vary in size and number depending on cell type, cell-cycle phase, or physiological state, highlighting their stress-responsive nature. The tumor-suppressor PML protein is the primary scaffold of PML NBs and forms an outer shell, together with the SP100 nuclear antigen, surrounding an inner core of dozens of proteins that localize constitutively or transiently in PML NBs. PML (also known as TRIM19) is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing protein superfamily characterized by a conserved N-terminal RBCC motif essential for PML polymerization. Several isoforms of PML exist, all containing the RBCC motif and three well-characterized small-ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) modification sites at lysines K65, K160, and K490 and a SUMO interacting motif (SIM) enabling its interaction with SUMOylated proteins.</p><p>PML NBs have been involved in a wide variety of biological processes such as senescence, antiviral response, transcriptional regulation, DNA damage response, or stemness suggesting that they are fully significant structures. The molecular mechanisms through which they exert their broad physiological impact are not fully elucidated yet. However, as MLOs, they potentially have three different mode of actions (for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corpet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hirose et al., 2022</xref>). First, they can serve as hotspots promoting specific biochemical reactions such as SUMOylation. PML NBs are enriched in the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme UBC9, which mediates SUMOylation of various proteins including PML thus enforcing PML-PML interactions via intermolecular SUMO-SIM interactions. SUMOylated proteins within PML NBs can drive the multivalent recruitment of inner core protein clients through their SIM, possibly via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corpet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sahin et al., 2014</xref>). Second, PML NBs may buffer/sequestrate specific factors which could lead to their substantial depletion for the surrounding nuclear space. Third, while PML NBs are in general devoid of DNA, except in specific cases (for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corpet et al., 2020</xref>), they reside in the interchromatin nuclear space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boisvert et al., 2000</xref>) and can associate with specific genomic loci thus acting as chromosomal hubs adequately regulating associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ching et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Delbarre et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kurihara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shiels et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). PML NBs have been found associated with both transcriptionally-active domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boisvert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kurihara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), as well as heterochromatin regions such as telomeres suggesting an important function in chromatin domain organization and regulation of their transcriptional state (for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Delbarre and Janicki, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Targeted deposition of histones variants is crucial for chromatin homeostasis and the maintenance of cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allis and Jenuwein, 2016</xref>). Among histone H3 variants, H3.3 is expressed throughout the cell cycle and is incorporated onto DNA in a DNA-synthesis-independent manner by dedicated histone chaperone complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martire and Banaszynski, 2020</xref>). Histone cell cycle regulator A (HIRA) chaperone complex, composed of HIRA, ubinuclein 1 or ubinuclein 2 (UBN1 or UBN2) and calcineurin-binding protein CABIN1, is responsible for H3.3 deposition in transcriptionally active regions including enhancers, promoters and gene bodies, as well as in nucleosome-free regions and DNA damage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ray-Gallet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) (for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martire and Banaszynski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ricketts and Marmorstein, 2017</xref>). HIRA has also been recently shown to be involved in the transcription-mediated recycling of parental H3.3 by microscopy approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Torné et al., 2020</xref>). Although HIRA complex is diffusively distributed in the nuclei of proliferating somatic cells, it accumulates in PML NBs upon various stresses such as senescence entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banumathy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rai et al., 2017</xref>), or interferon type I (IFN-I) treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rai et al., 2017</xref>), which encompasses IFNα and IFNβ cytokines. These latter events underscore a role of HIRA in intrinsic anti-viral defense via chromatinization of incoming viral genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rai et al., 2017</xref>) as well as stimulation of innate immune defenses in the case of viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>However, the exact significance of HIRA localization in PML NBs upon inflammatory stress response, as well as the role of the PML NBs themselves, remain to be defined. PML NBs may act as concentrating places for enzymatic reactions such as SUMOylation, or as buffering/sequestration structures for various chromatin-related proteins, or be a means to target them to specific chromatin regions juxtaposed to PML NBs. Here, we explored the different functions of PML NBs in response to IFN-I stimulus and focused our investigation on their interplay with the histone chaperone HIRA. We show that PML NBs act as nuclear depot centers for HIRA, depending on PML/SP100 levels, as well as on DAXX/H3.3 histone availability. Mechanistically, HIRA localizes in PML NBs in a SP100 and SIM-SUMO-dependent manner upon IFN-I treatment. In addition, we provide evidence that PML is required for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression, and that ISGs loci juxtapose to PML NBs, thus confirming a role of PML NBs as chromosomal hubs implicated in gene regulation. ChIP-Seq analysis reveals a long-lasting H3.3 deposition on the 3' end of ISGs, which is partly dependent on HIRA and PML, but independent of HIRA localization in PML NBs. Together, our results put forward a dual role of PML/PML NBs during the inflammatory response: they act both as buffering centers to modulate HIRA availability in the nucleoplasm, and as chromosomal hubs regulating ISGs transcription, and thus, HIRA-mediated H3.3 deposition at ISGs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HIRA accumulation in PML NBs correlates with an increase in PML and SP100 concentration</title><p>Several stimuli, such as IFN-I treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rai et al., 2017</xref>), can trigger HIRA accumulation in PML NBs. As a first step towards deciphering the mechanism of HIRA localization in PML NBs, we investigated the stoichiometry-dependent recruitment of HIRA in PML NBs. Treatment of human primary foreskin diploid fibroblast BJ cells with the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C), a strong stimulant of the IFN-I pathway, or with the Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) cytokine, triggered a strong accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), similarly to a control IFN-I treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The accumulation was abrogated by addition of ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of the JAK-STAT pathway downstream of the IFN-I receptor, underscoring the involvement of the IFN-I signaling pathway in primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). IFNβ, poly(I:C) and TNFα induced an IFN-I dependent increase of the PML and SP100 proteins and their SUMOylated forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>), as well as their mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) confirming previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guldner et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stadler et al., 1995</xref>). Of note, IFNβ slightly increased HIRA mRNA (1.26 fold) and protein levels (1.34 fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Treatment with other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 or the IL-8 chemokine, did not increase PML protein levels or SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), nor affected HIRA localization that remained pan-nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). HIRA accumulation in PML NBs was not a consequence of senescence as cells treated with IFNβ continued to replicate as shown by EdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

The latter localizes constitutively in PML NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ishov et al., 1999</xref>). Further studies suggest that the partitioning of polySIM chimeras in the condensed PML NB phase is controlled by the availability of SUMOylated lysines on the PML protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2016</xref>). We thus hypothesized that HIRA’s partitioning in PML NBs could be regulated by SUMO-SIM interactions. We first investigated whether HIRA and PML/SUMO could interact together in cellulo. Proximity Labelling Assay (PLA) allows the detection of closely interacting protein partners in situ at distances below 40 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sahin et al., 2016</xref>). Using PLA, we detected interaction foci between PML and SUMO2/3 as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sahin et al., 2016</xref>), with the number of interaction foci increasing significantly upon IFNβ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>), which is known to stimulate PML SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stadler et al., 1995</xref>). We then assessed the interactions between HIRA and PML or HIRA and SUMO2/3. We could detect a significant interaction between these proteins in presence of IFNβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>), accordingly to the accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs. Positive PLA signal between HIRA and SUMO2/3 could either mean that HIRA is SUMOylated or that HIRA interacts with other SUMOylated proteins. The molecular mass of HIRA remained unchanged upon IFNβ treatment of primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>), which is not in favor of post-translational modification of HIRA with SUMO groups. In addition, ectopic HIRA mutated on K809, identified as a possible SUMOylated lysine in a SUMO screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hendriks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schimmel et al., 2014</xref>), was still recruited in PML NBs similar to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that at least K809 SUMOylation is dispensable for HIRA recruitment in PML NBs.

Depletion of SUMOs led to a significant decrease of HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon IFNβ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Of note, in absence of SUMOs, PML NBs appear as large aggregates devoid of DAXX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), reminiscent of the alternative PML NBs structures observed during mitosis, in human embryonic stem cells or in human sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corpet et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, presence of SUMO proteins, that can undergo LLPS in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2016</xref>), seems key to promote partitioning of HIRA. Increasing the pool of free SUMOs by ectopic expression did not trigger HIRA accumulation in PML NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) suggesting that SUMOs need to be conjugated to specific proteins to trigger HIRA partitioning in PML NBs.</p><p>To further substantiate the requirements for non-covalent SUMO-SIM interactions in mediating HIRA accumulation in PML NBs, we used the Affimer technology, previously known as Adhiron. Affimers are artificial protein aptamers consisting of a scaffold with two variable peptide presentation loops that can specifically bind with high affinity and high specificity to their binding partners. A recent screen identified several Affimers that inhibit SUMO-dependent protein-protein interactions mediated by SIM motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>). We selected the S1S2D5 Affimer that specifically targets both SUMO1 and SUMO2/3-mediated interactions and which possesses a consensus SIM motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>). Inducibly expressed S1S2D5-His Affimer showed a nuclear staining with accumulation of the Affimer in PML NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), as expected for a synthetic peptide that exhibits a SIM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>). S1S2D5-His Affimer expression prevented the accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs upon IFNβ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), without affecting HIRA nor PML protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Despite a recurrent diminution in the amount of the ectopic PML proteins following addition of mouse IFNα, possibly because of a lower efficiency of the doxycyline induction of ectopic PML transcription in IFN-I treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), the wild type PML rescued HIRA accumulation in ectopically formed PML NBs unlike the PML 3K, which showed no colocalization with HIRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Of note, super resolution microscopy analyses of PML 3K-expressing MEFs reveal that PML 3K form spherical structures exactly like WT PML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sahin et al., 2014</xref>). These data demonstrate that PML SUMOylation on K65, K160, and K490 is required for HIRA recruitment in PML NBs.</p><p>Multivalent interactions between client SIM motifs and SUMOylated lysines on the PML protein are implicated in client recruitment in PML NBs, as shown for DAXX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sahin et al., 2014</xref>). Using JASSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beauclair et al., 2015</xref>) and GPS-SUMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), we selected a set of five putative SIM motifs in HIRA protein sequence and tested whether they were involved in HIRA recruitment in PML NBs by mutating them individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Cells expressing the wild-type (WT) tagged version of HIRA (HIRA-HA WT) displayed ectopic HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon IFNβ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), as well as without IFNβ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). HIRA-HA mSIM1 and mSIM3 mutants did not show sufficient expression in individual cells to analyze their localization. HIRA-HA mSIM4 and mSIM5 mutants showed a normal accumulation in PML NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the HIRA-HA mSIM2 showed a significant decrease in its accumulation in PML NBs with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) or without (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) IFNβ treatment. This data confirms the importance of the SUMO-SIM interaction pathway in general, and at least, the putative SIM2 motif for the recruitment of the overexpressed ectopic HIRA in PML NBs regardless of the presence of IFNβ. Unfortunately, the levels of HIRA-HA mSIM2 expression remained very low at the cell population level compared to HIRA-HA WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), preventing any biochemical analyses. Since SP100 is increased upon IFNβ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and is required for HIRA localization in PML NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>), we sought to refine further its contribution for HIRA accumulation in PML NBs. Knock-down of SP100 abrogated HIRA partitioning in PML NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), confirming previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>), without impacting DAXX localization at PML NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Overexpression of an ectopic EYFP-SP100 protein rescued HIRA accumulation in PML NBs, as well as an ectopic EYFP-SP100 mutated on its main SUMOylation site K297R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). Overall, our data argue for a multistep molecular mechanism, involving PML SUMOylation, a putative SIM motif on HIRA, as well as SP100 regardless of its SUMOylation on K297R, in the accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs following activation of the IFN-I signaling pathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>HIRA accumulation in PML NBs depends on DAXX and H3.3 levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence microscopy visualization of HIRA-HA or HIRA-Myc marked respectively with HA and Myc antibodies (green) and PML (red) in BJ HIRA-HA WT and BJ HIRA-Myc WT cells.

Importantly, ectopic expression of HIRA led to its accumulation in PML NBs without the need of IFN-I stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ye et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that PML NBs could buffer an excess of HIRA proteins. In addition, quantification of nucleoplasmic levels of HIRA outside PML NBs showed a significant decrease after IFNβ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that PML NBs could act as sequestration places for HIRA upon IFN-I, leading to its substantial depletion from the surrounding nuclear space. We thus focused our attention on understanding the molecular mechanisms of this putative buffering function. Remarkably, PML NBs have a strong connection with the H3.3 chromatin assembly pathway. Soluble newly synthesized H3.3-H4 dimers localize in PML NBs in a DAXX-dependent manner in human primary cells, before deposition onto chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corpet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Delbarre et al., 2013</xref>). We thus reasoned that a modulation of the nucleoplasmic pool of DAXX or H3.3-H4 could impact on the HIRA accumulation in PML NBs by competing for binding sites within PML NBs or by modulating the chaperone activity of HIRA, respectively. Knockdown of DAXX led to a significant increase of the baseline amounts of cells showing HIRA accumulation in PML NBs in the absence of IFN-I treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This HIRA behavior was not affected by ruxolitinib, excluding a contribution of the IFN-I signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but was still dependent on SP100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). No significant increase for PML protein was observed confirming that PML concentration changes is not an absolute prerequisite for the accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The reverse approach consisting in the overexpression of an ectopic Myc-DAXX protein completely abrogates HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon IFN-I treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). Thus modulation of DAXX levels regulates HIRA accumulation in PML NBs.</p><p>To study the impact of soluble H3.3 levels on HIRA behavior, we used a cell line expressing an inducible HA-tagged form of H3.3 (BJ eH3.3i). Treatment with doxycyclin triggered a strong, yet highly variable, expression of eH3.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), consistent with the polyclonal nature of the cells. As expected, doxycyclin did not impact HIRA localization in PML NBs in absence of IFNβ, and IFNβ triggered a normal accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Induced expression of eH3.3 did not significantly impact on HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon IFNβ at a cell population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, close examination of individual cells showed an impaired accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs in cells with a strong expression of eH3.3, unlike low eH3.3 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Quantification of the mean eH3.3 nuclear fluorescence intensity showed that it was low on average in nuclei with accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs. On the contrary, nuclei with absence of HIRA in PML NBs correspond to those with a significant shift towards higher eH3.3 intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Similar results were obtained in human primary lung fibroblasts excluding a cell-type effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These data highlight a strong antagonism between the presence of a H3.3 nucleoplasmic pool above a threshold, and HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon IFNβ treatment. Thus, while PML NBs do not seem to play a major role as SUMOylation hotspots for HIRA, they function as buffering/sequestration places for HIRA dependent on the physiological state of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PML depletion but not HIRA impairs ISGs expression</title><p>In order to look whether PML NBs could also function as regulatory hubs together with HIRA in the inflammatory response, we first analysed if HIRA and PML participate in ISGs transcriptional regulation. IFN-I is responsible for the upregulation of hundreds of ISGs as part of the innate immune response participating in the inhibition of virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shaw et al., 2017</xref>). We analyzed the expression of a selected set of ISGs, <italic>MX1</italic>, <italic>OAS1</italic>, <italic>ISG15,</italic> or <italic>ISG54</italic> (<italic>IFIT2</italic>) in cells treated with IFNβ for 6 or 24 hr. mRNA levels of these ISGs increased strongly after IFNβ treatment, peaking at 6 hr of treatment and slightly decreasing at 24 hr post addition of IFNβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Depletion of HIRA had no significant impact on ISGs expression at 6 and 24 hr of IFNβ stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rai et al., 2017</xref>). Compared to ISGs transcription climax at 6 hr post IFNβ, the peak of accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs at 24 hr post addition of IFNβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>) suggests that the latter might not be directly involved in ISGs transcriptional upregulation. In contrast, PML depletion led to a significant reduction in ISGs expression both at 6 and 24 hr after IFNβ stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). <italic>MX1</italic>, <italic>OAS1</italic>, <italic>ISG15,</italic> or <italic>ISG54</italic> mRNA levels were only 27%, 16%, 28%, or 35% of the levels observed in 6 hr IFNβ-treated cells, respectively. Thus, these results suggest an essential role of PML in the IFN-I-dependent transcriptional upregulation of ISGs, which is independent of HIRA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Interferon-stimulated gene loci are juxtaposed to PML NBs after IFN-I stimulation</title><p>PML NBs make direct physical contacts with surrounding chromatin regions and these associations may serve to modulate genome functions and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corpet et al., 2020</xref>). In the context of the IFNγ inflammatory response, genes within the MHCII locus are located in proximity of PML NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gialitakis et al., 2010</xref>). Given the above results, we thought to examine the spatial connection between PML NBs and specific ISG loci. We performed immunostaining of the PML protein, together with fluorescence in situ hybridization (immuno-FISH) to detect the <italic>PML</italic>, <italic>MX1</italic>, <italic>OAS1</italic> gene loci in cells treated or not with IFNβ. PML was used as a positive ISG control since previous immuno-trap analyses found a specific interaction between PML NBs and the <italic>PML</italic> gene locus upon IFNα treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ching et al., 2013</xref>). To evaluate the specificity of potential spatial changes, we also scored localization of the Grehlin and Obestatin Prepropeptide (<italic>GHRL</italic>) locus, which is not an ISG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eggenberger et al., 2019</xref>) and is localized in heterochromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becker et al., 2017</xref>). Visual inspection showed an overall closer locus-to-PML NB proximity of <italic>PML</italic>, <italic>MX1</italic> and <italic>OAS1</italic>, but not <italic>GHRL</italic>, in IFNβ-treated cells relative to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To quantify the association of PML NB with ISG loci, we calculated the mean minimal distance (mmd) between each locus and the center of the closest PML NB per nucleus in untreated and treated cells. A decreased distance could be a consequence of the increased number and size of PML NBs upon IFNβ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We thus normalized the mmd for the ISGs to the one calculated for the <italic>GHRL</italic> locus. A marked decrease in the mmd of PML NBs with the three loci was scored at 48 hr, which was significant for <italic>PML</italic> and <italic>MX1</italic> loci, reaching a calculated mmd of 0.67 µm and 0.72 µm, respectively, as compared to 1.06 µm for the <italic>GHRL</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also confirm the presence of HIRA in PML NBs juxtaposed to ISGs by triple labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The requirement of PML for the acute peak of transcription of ISGs at 6 hr of IFNβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), in comparison to the occurrence of the juxtaposition of PML NBs with the ISGs loci at 48 hr post addition of IFNβ suggests that existing PML NBs are not directly involved in the transcriptional control of ISGs, but rather nucleate at ISGs loci from the PML proteins initially involved in ISGs transcription.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>PML NBs become juxtaposed to ISGs loci upon IFN-I treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal fluorescence microscopy visualization of IF-FISH against PML proteins (green) and <italic>GHRL</italic> control gene locus (red) or <italic>PML</italic>, <italic>MX1</italic> or <italic>OAS1</italic> ISGs loci (red) in BJ cells treated with IFNβ at 1000 U/mL for 48 hr.

We thus wondered whether PML and HIRA could functionally impact endogenous H3.3 deposition on ISGs using an H3.3-specific antibody previously validated in ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). The amount of H3.3 remained unaffected by 24 hr of IFNβ stimulation excluding a putative ISG-like behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We first investigated H3.3 incorporation on <italic>MX1</italic>, <italic>OAS1,</italic> and <italic>ISG54</italic> (<italic>IFIT2</italic>) by qPCR. Three distinct regions of the selected ISGs were analyzed: the promoter region, located just upstream (–120 pb) of the transcriptional start site (TSS), the middle of the coding region (mid), and a distal site in the coding region near the TES (see map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). A slight decrease of H3.3 occupancy at promoter regions was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The reduction following IFN-I stimulation likely reflects transcription-induced nucleosome depletion known to happen for many genes upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Workman, 2006</xref>). Remarkably, IFNβ stimulation induced H3.3 incorporation most noticeably over the distal sites of the coding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This was concomitant with an increase in H3K36me3, a histone mark added by the methyltransferase SETD2, which moves with RNA pol II during transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Use of a control IgG antibody did not lead to any significant amount of immunoprecipitated DNA (% input) in any of the conditions highlighting the specificity of our ChIP experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, no change in H3.3 occupancy was observed at an enhancer region known to be enriched with H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pchelintsev et al., 2013</xref>), underscoring the specificity of H3.3 accumulation in ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Normalization of H3.3 signal over the total H3 histones signal, which showed no major changes in histone density, confirmed the increased amount of H3.3 at ISGs with a preference for the TES regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This fits with the known replication-independent replacement of canonical H3 histones with H3.3 during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Workman, 2006</xref>). No noticeable H3.3 increase was observed at representative mid or TES regions at 6 or 12 hr of IFNβ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, H3.3 increased deposition most likely takes place after the peak of ISGs transcription at 6 hr of IFNβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, H3.3 deposition continued to increase for an extended period of time and was even higher at 48 hr of IFNβ, suggesting that it could leave a long-lasting chromatin mark on ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>HIRA and PML depletions impair H3.3 enrichment at distal regions of ISGs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (top) Schematic representation of <italic>MX1</italic>, <italic>OAS1,</italic> and <italic>ISG54</italic> gene loci.

The levels of H3.3 significantly increased on ISGs in IFNβ-treated cells with a clear bias towards the TES regions of the genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, no significant difference of H3.3 enrichment could be observed across the non-ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We selected genes with the highest difference in H3.3 enrichment at the TES region between IFNβ-treated and non-treated cells, and performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. GO analysis showed a clear enrichment in genes involved in IFNα and IFNγ response comforting the specific enrichment of H3.3 on the TES region of ISGs as a prolonged response to an IFN-I stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To evaluate the identity of H3.3-enriched genes in an unbiased manner, we performed an independent GO analysis on all genes found in the ChIP peak calls. This yielded similar results with IFNα and IFNγ responses being the most highly significant GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, these findings establish that IFN-I triggers a specific long-lasting H3.3 deposition on ISGs following IFN-I stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>H3.3 deposition on ISGs is impaired upon HIRA or PML depletion</title><p>We next wondered whether HIRA and/or PML was essential for H3.3 deposition at ISGs. Cells were depleted of HIRA or PML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, left) and treated with IFNβ for 24 hr, before performing ChIP on H3.3. Knock-down of HIRA or PML led to a modest but consistent decrease in H3.3 at mid or TES regions of selected ISGs, suggesting the implication of these two proteins for the long-lasting H3.3 deposition on ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, right). ChIP-Seq analysis confirmed a mild, but still significant, decrease in the loading of H3.3 at the TES on the panel of ISGs (<italic>P</italic>-value = 4,76e-03 for HIRA knock-down (KD) or 1.262e-03 for PML KD, as assessed by a paired Student’s t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G</xref>). Representative <italic>MX1</italic>, <italic>STAT1,</italic> and <italic>GCH1</italic> genes, confirmed the deficit in H3.3 loading at the TES region of ISGs in the absence of HIRA or PML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Of note, overexpression of HIRA, which increases the nucleoplasmic pool of HIRA as well as its accumulation in PML NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), triggered an increase in H3.3 loading upon IFN-I, as compared to cells with endogenous levels of HIRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). We thus conclude that HIRA and PML both contribute to the increased long-lasting H3.3 deposition at the TES region of ISGs following the transcriptional peak associated to IFN stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs is not necessary for transcription-coupled H3.3 deposition at ISGs</title><p>Given the role of PML NBs in HIRA buffering, and their function as chromosomal hubs regulating transcription of associated ISGs and H3.3 deposition on these genes, we then wanted to investigate if these two functions were interconnected. PML is known to be required for HIRA loading on ISGs as already published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>), and as confirmed by reanalysis of McFarlane data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While proximity of PML NBs with ISGs could be a means to target HIRA on these genes, we hypothesize that HIRA buffering in PML NBs and its role in H3.3 deposition at ISGs upon IFN-I stress might be two independent events. We thus analyzed if the accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs was a prerequisite for the increased deposition of H3.3 on ISGs. We depleted SP100 that strongly impairs HIRA recruitment in PML NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>). SP100 depletion did not prevent H3.3 loading at the ISGs TES upon IFN-β stimulation, but on the contrary increased it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). Of note, SP100 depletion led to an important increase in ISGs transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). This is consistent with its role as a general transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seeler et al., 1998</xref>), and with the higher H3.3 loading on ISGs in these conditions. Simultaneous knock-down of SP100 and HIRA in IFN-I treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) reduced H3.3 deposition at the level of the control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, this demonstrates that the increase in H3.3 loading on ISGs TES upon SP100 knockdown and following IFN-β stimulation is mediated by HIRA independently of its localization in PML NBs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>HIRA mediates H3.3 deposition during transcription of ISGs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histogram shows H3.3 enrichment obtained through ChIP experiments on BJ cells treated with the indicated siRNAs for 48 hr and with IFNβ at 1000 U/mL for the last 24 hr of siRNAs treatment.

After having dissected the molecular mechanisms responsible for HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon IFN-I treatment, we investigated the functional interplay of the PML NBs-HIRA-H3.3 axis in inflammatory response. Our work has revealed two independent roles for PML/PML NBs in (1) acting as buffering centers to modulate HIRA complex nucleoplasmic availability upon inflammatory stress and (2) regulating the transcriptional status of ISGs and the HIRA-mediated incorporation of H3.3 at these loci.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon inflammatory stresses is dependent on functional SUMO-SIM interactions and on SP100</title><p>While senescence was the first stress shown to induce accumulation of HIRA complex in PML NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banumathy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), IFN-I signaling pathway was recently shown to be responsible for similar behavior of HIRA upon a viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rai et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we extend and corroborate these findings to various inflammatory stresses, including TNFα, or a synthetic dsRNA (PolyI:C) that increase the amount of PML and SP100 proteins. We show that HIRA partitioning in PML NBs is mediated by SUMO-SIM interactions, that can be inhibited by saturating PML/PML NBs SUMO sites with specific Affimers or a SIM-containing client such as DAXX. We identified a putative SIM motif on HIRA sequence that participate in its recruitment in PML NBs. Interestingly, the VLRL SIM motif identified is followed by a Serine in the position 229 (S229). Phosphorylation adjacent to SIM motifs can lead to an increased affinity towards SUMO1 lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cappadocia et al., 2015</xref>). Other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation could thus be important in regulating HIRA partitioning by changing the affinity between HIRA and SUMOylated PML proteins/partners. Of note, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) mediated-phosphorylation of HIRA on S697 was suggested to drive HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon senescence entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ye et al., 2007a</xref>). Our data using <italic>Pml<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs reconstituted with PML WT or PML 3K highlight the importance of PML main SUMOylation sites in recruiting HIRA complex. In addition, SP100, a general transcriptional repressor and a resident protein of PML NBs, is also critical for HIRA accumulation in PML NBs, independently of its SUMOylation. Overall, our data demonstrate that SUMO-SIM interactions are essential but not sufficient for HIRA accumulation in PML NBs after IFN-I treatment. Hence, the use of SUMO-specific Affimers opens interesting avenues to interfere with client recruitments in PML NBs including HIRA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PML NBs as buffering centers to regulate nucleoplasmic HIRA levels</title><p>Our study unveils an important aspect of the PML NBs-HIRA interplay, with PML NBs acting as buffering centers to regulate the excess pool of nucleoplasmic HIRA. First, previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ye et al., 2007b</xref>) confirmed by the present one, show that overexpression of an ectopic HIRA is sufficient to induce its accumulation in PML NBs in untreated cells. Second, we show that HIRA intensity level in the nucleus, outside PML NBs, decreases upon IFN-I treatment, while HIRA protein amounts slightly increases. Third, overexpression of DAXX totally abrogates HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon IFN-I treatment, suggesting that DAXX could occupy all available binding sites for HIRA partitioning in PML NBs. Fourth, DAXX knock-down induces a significant increase of untreated cells showing HIRA accumulation in PML NBs. These data support the hypothesis that the freeing of binding sites (in siDAXX treated cells) or the increase in binding sites (IFN-I treated cells) for HIRA might trigger its accumulation in PML NBs. Finally, overexpression of the HIRA substrate H3.3 as a pool of free soluble H3.3 in the nucleoplasm impairs HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon IFN-I treatment.</p><p>The functionality of HIRA localization in PML NBs, first demonstrated during senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), remains to date elusive. An exciting hypothesis resulting from our data is that some acute stresses could massively retarget chromatin-bound HIRA from steady-state to specific stress-induced loci, leaving an extra pool of unbound HIRA, which then accumulates in PML NBs to be used for future duties. This buffering also depends on the amount of available binding sites for HIRA in PML NBs, as well as on the histone chaperone/cargo pool itself (HIRA/DAXX/H3.3 levels). Whether the sequestration of HIRA in PML NBs could as well impact its histone chaperone function elsewhere in the nucleus remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>PML regulates ISGs transcription and PML NBs associate with ISGs loci</title><p>A second important functional aspect unveiled in our study is the involvement of PML/PML NBs in the regulation of ISGs transcription, and the HIRA-mediated deposition of H3.3 at IFN-I stimulated ISGs. First, we show the importance of the PML protein for the initial burst of transcription of ISGs at 6 hr of IFNβ treatment. This is consistent with previous studies showing the association of PML NBs with nascent transcripts after IFNβ stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fuchsová et al., 2002</xref>), and the role of PML in ISGs induction following viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alandijany et al., 2018</xref>). PML proteins could be recruited to transcriptionally active ISGs by a specific, yet to be defined, protein-protein interaction. Previous studies showed that the nuclear DNA helicase II (NDH II), which is essential for gene activation, relocates in PML NBs in a transcription-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fuchsová et al., 2002</xref>). The authors suggested PML NBs could play a role in the transcriptional regulation of ISGs attached to PML NBs, although this was not investigated. Here, by using immuno-FISH, we demonstrate a juxtaposition of a subset of ISG loci with PML NBs at late time-points of IFNβ stimulation, confirming the potential role of PML NBs as regulatory chromosomal hubs. These data add to the likely importance of PML NBs-gene loci association for the regulation of specific sets of genes in a cell and stimulus-context manners, as exemplified recently for pluripotency-related genes in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sun et al., 2023</xref>). Because PML targeting at specific gene loci is sufficient to induce de novo formation of PML NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brouwer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Erdel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaiser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), we hypothesize that chromatin-bound PML proteins involved in ISGs transcription could act as seeds to mediate neo-nucleation of PML NBs at ISG loci (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Alternatively, displacement of ISGs-containing chromatin loops close to preexisting PML NBs could still be at play to explain this closer association upon IFNβ stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>H3.3-induced deposition at TES regions of transcribed ISGs is mediated by both HIRA and PML</title><p>Our data also reveal a role of the PML-HIRA axis in the H3.3 deposition on ISGs. Endogenous H3.3 deposition shows a strong preference for the ISGs TES regions, consistent with previous reports obtained in mouse cells overexpressing exogenous H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sarai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tamura et al., 2009</xref>). Also, our data highlight a long-lasting deposition of H3.3 up to 48 h after IFN-I stimulation, well beyond the peak of transcription of the ISGs. Deposition of endogenous H3.3 was reduced in the absence of PML consistent with the role of PML NBs in targeting H3.3 to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Delbarre et al., 2013</xref>), and in line with the role of PML in chromatinization of latent viral genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>). Because PML depletion impairs transcription of ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alandijany et al., 2018</xref>), it could indirectly affect H3.3 deposition at TES regions, which is linked to the transcriptional activity of ISGs per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sarai et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the implication of PML in the loading of HIRA on ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>) could be a result of the PML-regulated ISGs transcription, which could consequently impact on the HIRA-mediated H3.3 deposition on these loci. It is not unlikely that other H3.3 chaperones, such as the DAXX/ATRX complex, could compensate the absence of HIRA for H3.3 deposition as already observed for viral genomes chromatinization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, the remodeling protein CHD2, which has been shown to incorporate H3.3 on the promoters of myogenesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harada et al., 2012</xref>) could participate in H3.3 deposition at ISGs loci after IFN-I induction. Nonetheless, these data indicate the importance of a PML-HIRA axis to regulate H3.3 deposition on ISGs loci. Whether HIRA also mediates H3.3 recycling during transcription at ISGs via interaction with the RNA pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Torné et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</xref>) and/or with an H3K36me3 methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sarai et al., 2013</xref>) should be investigated further. Thus, these data open interesting perspectives to study the maintenance of chromatin states at ISGs during inflammatory responses.</p><p>Finally, given the accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs upon IFNβ stimulation, an important question to address was whether this accumulation is required for HIRA-dependent H3.3 deposition at ISGs. The H3.3 ChIP analyses conducted in absence of HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon IFN-I due to the depletion of SP100 showed an enrichment of H3.3 at ISGs loci, which decreased upon the additional knock-down of HIRA. These data support the importance of HIRA for the H3.3 deposition at ISGs, and favor the absence of correlation between HIRA accumulation in PML NBs and the deposition of H3.3 at ISGs loci, at least upon acute IFN-I stimulus. This further supports a role of PML NBs as nuclear depots for HIRA following an acute stress, possibly for its subsequent use after the acute stress resolution.</p><p>The role of the prolonged H3.3 deposition on ISGs can be multiple. First, this long-lasting mark could contribute to the acquisition of a functional IFN response memory. Indeed, H3.3 was shown to mediate memory of an active state upon nuclear transfer in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ng and Gurdon, 2008</xref>). In addition, in MEFs, IFNβ stimulation creates a transcriptional memory of a subset of ISGs, which coincides with acquisition of H3.3 and H3K36me3 on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kamada et al., 2018</xref>). A second stimulation with IFNβ allows a faster and greater transcription of so called &quot;memory ISGs&quot;, which is dependent on H3.3 deposition during the first stimulation phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kamada et al., 2018</xref>). In HeLa cells, PML was shown to be required for the stronger re-expression of HLA-DRA after IFNγ restimulation, a locus that remained juxtaposed to PML NBs after transcription shut-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gialitakis et al., 2010</xref>). Second, H3.3 deposition may also serve to directly regulate ISGs expression. In mouse cells, H3.3 was found to be phosphorylated on Serine 31 on macrophages-induced genes following bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulation, a post-translational mark serving as an ejection switch for the ZMYND11 transcriptional repressor, and allowing the transcriptional amplification of the target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armache et al., 2020</xref>). Whether H3.3S31P is increased on ISGs upon IFN-I remains to be investigated.</p><p>Altogether, we propose a dual role for PML/PML NBs in regulating, on the one hand, HIRA nucleoplasmic pool and on the other hand, ISGs transcription and HIRA-mediated H3.3 deposition (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). PML NBs play a role of nuclear buffering centers for HIRA complex, to control its availability in the nucleoplasm, and thus possibly regulating its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, PML is required for ISGs transcription promoting H3.3 loading on these genes and could indirectly serve as a platform to load HIRA on ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>). While HIRA depletion does not affect ISGs transcription per se, it could participate in H3.3 deposition at ISGs, a function that is likely uncorrelated to its accumulation in PML NBs during an acute stress. Furthermore, as mentioned above, H3.3 deposition at ISGs after a first stimulus allows faster and greater transcription of ISGs upon restimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kamada et al., 2018</xref>). Juxtaposition of PML NBs with ISGs at late times after IFN-I treatment could help to keep a memory of the physiological state of the cell. PML would remain in close proximity to ISGs to regulate them upon a second wave of IFN-I stimulation and HIRA accumulation in PML NBs could also be a mean for the cell to make the chaperone complex available much faster in case of a second inflammatory wave.</p><p>In conclusion, our study highlights two important functional and independent roles for PML NBs in the inflammatory response, which add to their pivotal involvement in various stress responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and retro/lentiviruses production</title><p>Human BJ primary foreskin fibroblasts (ATCC, CRL-2522), human IMR90 fetal lung fibroblasts (ATCC, CCL-186), human HEK 293T embryonic kidney cells (Intercell, AG) and mouse MEFs embryonic fibroblasts <italic>Pml</italic><sup>+/+</sup> or <italic>Pml</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (from Dr. Lallemand-Breitenbach, and whose cell identity was authenticated by STR profiling) were cultivated in DMEM medium (Sigma-Aldrich, D6429) containing 10% of fetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma-Aldrich, F7524), 1% of penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, P4458), at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and humid atmosphere.

The list of 48 core ISGs and 48 non-ISGs equal in size to the core ISGs was taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>. In order to reduce the noise on the profiles, we selected for each gene the transcript with the highest H3.3 enrichment at the TES in the IFNβ treated condition. Genome browser snapshots of H3.3 enrichment were generated using Integrative Genomics viewer (IGV: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/</ext-link>).</p><p>We re-analysed the HIRA ChIP-Seq dataset from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>. Rapidly, fastq files were downloaded from GEO databank under the accession number GSE128173 and re-aligned to the human genome 19 (hg19) using Bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). MACS2 fold enrichment bigwig files were then used with the DeepTools suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>) to create profile-plots of the 48 core ISG used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFarlane et al., 2019</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analyses and figures</title><p>Histograms and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Please note that the revision will go back to the reviewers for comments on its suitability for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The central issue with the manuscript is that both reviewers found the premise interesting, but found the evidence presented somewhat lacking in strength. I would invite you to submit a revision that directly addresses these key points made by both reviewers.</p><p>1. Both reviewers found the claims of valency puzzling and lacking in evidence – I would suggest either buttressing these claims rigorously or perhaps toning down/removing these claims entirely.</p><p>2. Both reviewers suggest tightening the manuscript to focus on H3.3 chaperone-PML interactions. For e.g. reviewers noted that the evidence for HIRA interactions with PML was a bit weak, and suggested examining DAXX (another H3.3 chaperone). I concur.</p><p>3. Reviewers asked whether OE of HIRA and its potential deposition into PML NBs is SUMO-dependent or SUMO-independent. Overexpressing the SIM mutants from Figure 3F would address this question. In addition, the link between the proposed HIRA being stored at PML NBs could be strengthened by overexpressing HIRA and see at both short and late time points whether H3.3 is enriched on ISG genes.</p><p>4. Both reviewers commented on the lack of controls and quantification for all WBs- these will be necessary for reviewers to assess the strength of claims which rely on WB measurements.</p><p>5. Reviewer 2 had several specific comments on data that require clarifications, in some cases textual revisions will suffice (e.g. valency), in others, you may wish to provide additional evidence to buttress your major claims. E.g. for the PML mutants, ectopic localization is decreased after interferon treatment. These puzzling/contrary results could benefit from additional experiments, possibly looking at other partners in the HIRA complex.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript should be improved with a more straightforward purpose, focused on HIRA/PML interactions and H3.3 loading upon interferon stimulation. The current presentation is a bit puzzling first focused on what the authors call &quot;condensation and valency&quot;; then on the regulation by PML – but not HIRA – of ISG expression upon IFN β; then focus again on the role of HIRA and PML in H3.3 loading at ISG genes; and finally, back to HIRA localization at PML NBs upon H3.3 overexpression and acetylation inhibition. Many of these observations are interesting but not related to each other.</p><p>p5, according to my knowledge, there is a confusion between &quot;valency&quot; and &quot;concentration&quot; in the LLPS process. Valency refers to the number of interacting domains in a given molecule, high valency and high affinity controlling phase separation of molecules at low concentration.</p><p>First, the authors should rephrase their sentence concerning PML NBs, SUMOs and SIM (p5). In the publication &quot;Banani et al. 2016&quot;, the valency in droplet formation was investigated by changing the number of repeats of SUMO or SIMs in chimeric fluorescent proteins, mixed at various concentrations in vitro. In this publication, PML was used to support their conclusion on the role of stoichiometry in cells, showing that their fluorescent chimeric poly-SIM or poly-SUMO proteins were differentially recruited depending on the availability of SUMO moieties in their overexpressed GFP-PML. In cells, and in contrast to the phase diagram established in vitro, concentration of GFP-PML was not changed (nor the number of conjugated SUMO) and the co-condensation of GFP-polySIM with RFP-polySUMO chimeras was not assessed. For clarity of the reading, the authors should separate, using two sentences, the role of multiple SIM and SUMO in LLPS – depending on both valency, affinity, and concentration (Banani 2016) -, from the role PML sumoylation to recruit SIM-proteins in cells (Sahin 2014).</p><p>Then, in figure 1, the authors studied HIRA localization at PML NBs when PML protein amount was increased by IFN-I pathway stimulations (known to activate PML transcription). They did not evaluate &quot;PML valency&quot;, but rather PML concentration increase. Indeed, poly(I:C), TNF or INF β treatments increased both HIRA at PML NBs and PML protein amount. PML protein amount was not affected by IL6 or 10 exposure, which had no effect on HIRA localization (Figure 1C and Figure 1-supplementary1 B). More importantly, both unsumoylated and sumoylated PML proteins were increased upon IFN β or poly(I:C) treatment, but the fraction of sumoylated PML relative to total PML proteins did not change compared to untreated cells (Figure 1C).</p><p>Assessing PML transcript level upon treatments would also help in better characterizing the change in PML amount indicated by WB (quantification of WB?).</p><p>In addition, in figures 2 and 3, neither the number of SUMOylation sites on PML required for HIRA recruitment, nor its polySUMOylation were not assessed.</p><p>In figure 3F, the authors identified a putative SIM2, but not SIM4 nor 5, as required for HIRA localization at PML NBs. This supports a specific role of HIRA SIM2 sequence rather than a general effect of valency (number of interacting domains in HIRA). Thus, the authors should rephrase the title and content of this paragraph to indicate that HIRA accumulation at PML nuclear bodies correlates with increase in PML concentration, rather than valency.</p><p>How do the authors explain that ectopic PML and PML 3K mutant decreased after interferon treatment? The effect is huge and requires at least an explanation. Is it an inhibition of the transcriptional induction by doxycycline by INF β signaling?</p><p>How are localized the other members of the HIRA complex upon interferon β and in Pml-/- MEFs expressing PMLWT or 3K mutant?</p><p>The authors conclude from Figures 1 and 2 that HIRA recruitment at PML NBs upon IFN β (or TNF, poly(I:C)) correlates with PML amount and depends on sumoylation. In Figure 1—figure supplementary 1D, the amount of endogenous HIRA looks higher upon IFN β, as in Figure3D or in HIRA IF in 3E. The authors should assess whether this increase is systematic. In particular, HIRA transcription level should be quantified in IFN β-treated compared to untreated cells, and quantification of HIRA proteins relative to loading controls should be shown.</p><p>In addition, it is unclear to me why addition of IFN β is required for HIRA localization at PML NBs in pml-/- MEFs transduced with Dox-inducible myc-PML (Figure 2-supplementary 1D; Figure 3D). IFN β signaling cannot increase PML transcription in those cells. How could the author explain here the need for IFNβ? Again, is it relative to any HIRA increase by IFNβ? Could HIRA increase contribute to HIRA localization at PML NBs upon IFN β (as suggested by figure 6)?</p><p>Alternatively, this could be mediated by increase in SP100. Indeed, SP100 is, as PML, a wellknown interferon-upregulated gene. The authors confirmed SP100 is required for HIRA localization at PML NBs upon INF β (Figure 3-supplementary 1). They should also assess whether the SP100 increase could explain the IFN effect on PML ectopically expressed.</p><p>There are several SP100 isoforms, and all should be also induced by interferon signaling. Yet, IFN β did not increase endogenous SP100 proteins in the experiment shown in Figure 3—figure supplementary1 B. A larger crop of the Western blot analysis would allow to check both the effect of the SiRNA and interferon on the SP100A, B, C and HMG isoforms. To my view, the authors could investigate further this requirement of SP100 for the mechanism of HIRA trafficking and localization at PML NBs and, especially regarding the role of SUMO and SIM. It has been shown that SP100 is recruited by sumoylated PML at PML bodies and may be itself sumoylated there, at least upon stress. Is the sumoylation site of SP100 required for HIRA recruitment at PML NBs?</p><p>Then, the authors assessed ISG expression, HIRA-containing PML NBs localization relative to ISG loci, and then focused on H3.3 loading at transcriptional-end site. Figure 4A shows that HIRA is not involved in IFN-induced ISG expression, which only requires PML, as an early process. This looks unrelated to the focus of the manuscript (HIRA/PML/chromatin status). The authors should move Figure 4A to supplementary figures. The text should also to be shortened to maintain a clear focus on the crosss talk.</p><p>In addition, baseline levels of ISG transcripts upon HIRA and PML knock down should be shown (in supplementary), comparing BJ cells with siHIRA or siPML to those transfected with the control siLuc in absence of IFNβ treatment.</p><p>The authors highlighted the kinetic aspects of the H3.3 increase at the TES of ISGs from 6 to 48h after IFN treatment, while the maximal expression of ISGs was obtained at 6h. If PML and HIRA sustain H3.3 at TES, siPML and siHIRA should impair this kinetic. The authors should also assess H3.3 fold change at some ISG TES with time.</p><p>Although of interest, the data presented in Figure 6 seems quite preliminary to conclude on a HIRA buffering role of PML NBs, and looks more related to the mechanism by which HIRA localization is controlled. SIM is usually a b-strand-like conformation and interacts with a groove of SUMO. Is the SIM2 sequence still accessible when HIRA is bound to H3.3 or in the whole HIRA chaperone complex? TSA could alter acetylation more broadly, which was also proposed to regulate SUMO/SIM interactions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80156.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The central issue with the manuscript is that both reviewers found the premise interesting, but found the evidence presented somewhat lacking in strength.

Specifically, we show that DAXX depletion triggers a moderate, but significant increase in HIRA accumulation in PML NBs, while DAXX overexpression completely abrogates HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon IFN-I treatment.</p><p>We believe these new data support our claims that HIRA localization in PML NBs is dependent on the availability of free binding sites and that both PML and SP100 concentrations as well as DAXX and H3.3 levels regulate HIRA accumulation in PML NBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Reviewers asked whether OE of HIRA and its potential deposition into PML NBs is SUMO-dependent or SUMO-independent. Overexpressing the SIM mutants from Figure 3F would address this question. In addition, the link between the proposed HIRA being stored at PML NBs could be strengthened by overexpressing HIRA and see at both short and late time points whether H3.3 is enriched on ISG genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included in Figure 3-supplement Figure 1C data with overexpression of the HIRA mSIM mutant without IFN-I treatment. This mutant shows impaired accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs with or without IFN-I (Figure 3F and Figure 3-supplement Figure 1C), suggesting that accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs is dependent on SUMO-SIM interactions regardless of the IFN-I treatment.</p><p>In addition, we have now included ChIP-qPCR data on H3.3 enrichment on ISGs after HIRA overexpression (Figure 6-supplement figure 2A-B). We see a moderate increase in H3.3 enrichment when HIRA is overexpressed. However, as stated below, we believe that HIRA accumulation in PML NBs and its role in H3.3 deposition on ISGs are two independent events. Thus, overexpression of HIRA triggers both HIRA accumulation in PML NBs as part of a buffering mechanism and can lead to increase deposition of H3.3 on ISGs due to the increase of the nucleoplasmic pool of HIRA available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Reviewer 2 had several specific comments on data that require clarifications, in some cases textual revisions will suffice (e.g. valency), in others, you may wish to provide additional evidence to buttress your major claims. E.g. for the PML mutants, ectopic localization is decreased after interferon treatment. These puzzling/contrary results could benefit from additional experiments, possibly looking at other partners in the HIRA complex.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully addressed all reviewers' comments requiring clarifications, e.g. on valency issues. Concerning the localization of the ectopic PML WT and mutant, their localization is not decreased after IFN treatment, but it is just their expression that is lower than in absence of mIFNa. Nevertheless, the expression of these ectopic PML is sufficient to be seen on a single cell basis by immunofluorescence, and thus allows us to conclude that the PML 3K mutant does not rescue HIRA localization in PML NBs.</p><p>We believe that our pLVX-TetOne inducible plasmid (used either for Myc-PML or H3.3-HA ectopic expression) is less induced by doxycyclin when IFN-I is added in the medium. We haven't found the reason for this observation but speculate that the massive increase in transcription after IFN-I addition might reduce the doxycyclin-inducible expression of the plasmid due to a limitation in the number of RNA polymerases available. In any case, this effect does not prevent us from drawing firm conclusions since we compare the rescue obtained with PML WT or PML 3K mutant in similar conditions (+dox +mIFNa) (Figures 3D-E). We already clearly state in the text that &quot;Despite a diminution in the amount of the ectopic PML proteins following addition of mouse IFNa (Figure 3D), the wild type PML rescued HIRA accumulation in ectopically formed PML NBs unlike the PML 3K (Figure 3E).&quot;</p><p>Concerning the other partners of the HIRA complex, it is already shown that they are all present in PML NBs together with HIRA (Cohen et al., 2018) but we also provide an IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) of all members of the HIRA complex present in PML NBs upon IFNβ treatment in human primary fibroblasts.

The current presentation is a bit puzzling first focused on what the authors call &quot;condensation and valency&quot;; then on the regulation by PML – but not HIRA – of ISG expression upon IFN β; then focus again on the role of HIRA and PML in H3.3 loading at ISG genes; and finally, back to HIRA localization at PML NBs upon H3.3 overexpression and acetylation inhibition. Many of these observations are interesting but not related to each other.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the absence of focus in the manuscript. As stated above, we have now remodeled the manuscript in a more straightforward manner. We now clearly convey two main conclusions regarding (1) the mechanistic accumulation of HIRA in PML NBs which could act as buffering places for HIRA and (2) the independent role of PML in regulating ISGs transcription and thus indirectly regulating HIRA loading on ISGs, with both proteins thus impacting on H3.3 deposition. These two conclusions are indeed independent of each other, but we believe that it is very interesting that they are put together in a same article exactly to put forward that these are two independent roles of PML/PML NBs in regulating HIRA dynamics.</p><p>A long-standing question in the field is indeed to understand the role of HIRA accumulation in PML NBs and whether PML NBs could play a direct role in providing HIRA on neighboring loci. We believe that our data now prove that these are two independent functions of PML NBs. HIRA can accumulate in PML NBs upon IFN-I treatment, and independently be loaded on ISGs to regulate H3.3 deposition. Indeed, the role of PML in ISGs transcription indirectly regulates HIRA loading on ISGs upon IFN-I. In addition, our data using SP100 knock-down which totally abrogates HIRA localization in PML NBs does not prevent HIRA-mediated H3.3 deposition on ISGs confirming that these are two independent events. HIRA mediated H3.3-deposition is highly linked to the transcriptional status of ISGs since upon PML knock-down, there is less ISGs transcription, less HIRA loading on ISGs and less H3.3 deposition. On the contrary, upon SP100 knock-down, there is an increase in ISGs transcription, mirrored by an increase in H3.3 deposition mediated by HIRA, as shown with our new ChIP-qPCR data on H3.3 in the double SP100+HIRA knock-down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p5, according to my knowledge, there is a confusion between &quot;valency&quot; and &quot;concentration&quot; in the LLPS process. Valency refers to the number of interacting domains in a given molecule, high valency and high affinity controlling phase separation of molecules at low concentration.</p><p>First, the authors should rephrase their sentence concerning PML NBs, SUMOs and SIM (p5). In the publication &quot;Banani et al. 2016&quot;, the valency in droplet formation was investigated by changing the number of repeats of SUMO or SIMs in chimeric fluorescent proteins, mixed at various concentrations in vitro. In this publication, PML was used to support their conclusion on the role of stoichiometry in cells, showing that their fluorescent chimeric poly-SIM or poly-SUMO proteins were differentially recruited depending on the availability of SUMO moieties in their overexpressed GFP-PML. In cells, and in contrast to the phase diagram established in vitro, concentration of GFP-PML was not changed (nor the number of conjugated SUMO) and the co-condensation of GFP-polySIM with RFP-polySUMO chimeras was not assessed. For clarity of the reading, the authors should separate, using two sentences, the role of multiple SIM and SUMO in LLPS – depending on both valency, affinity, and concentration (Banani 2016) -, from the role PML sumoylation to recruit SIM-proteins in cells (Sahin 2014).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this very useful comment and have now modified the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Then, in Figure 1, the authors studied HIRA localization at PML NBs when PML protein amount was increased by IFN-I pathway stimulations (known to activate PML transcription). They did not evaluate &quot;PML valency&quot;, but rather PML concentration increase. Indeed, poly(I:C), TNF or INF β treatments increased both HIRA at PML NBs and PML protein amount. PML protein amount was not affected by IL6 or 10 exposure, which had no effect on HIRA localization (Figure 1C and Figure 1-supplementary1 B). More importantly, both unsumoylated and sumoylated PML proteins were increased upon IFN β or poly(I:C) treatment, but the fraction of sumoylated PML relative to total PML proteins did not change compared to untreated cells (Figure 1C).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we did not assess PML 'valency' per se but only its protein and SUMOylation levels. As stated above, we have now removed all claims on 'valency' and only focus on the increase in PML and SP100 protein levels.

This supports a specific role of HIRA SIM2 sequence rather than a general effect of valency (number of interacting domains in HIRA). Thus, the authors should rephrase the title and content of this paragraph to indicate that HIRA accumulation at PML nuclear bodies correlates with increase in PML concentration, rather than valency.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now rephrased the title and content of this paragraph according to the relevant suggestions of the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How do the authors explain that ectopic PML and PML 3K mutant decreased after interferon treatment?

In Figure 1—figure supplementary 1D, the amount of endogenous HIRA looks higher upon IFN β, as in Figure3D or in HIRA IF in 3E. The authors should assess whether this increase is systematic. In particular, HIRA transcription level should be quantified in IFN β-treated compared to untreated cells, and quantification of HIRA proteins relative to loading controls should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now quantified all WBs and indeed see a slight significant increase in HIRA protein levels (1.34 fold) upon IFNβ (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1C), correlating with a slight increase in HIRA mRNA levels as assessed by RT-qPCR in cells treated or not with IFNβ (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1C). While we do not think that this small increase is responsible for HIRA accumulation in PML NBs upon IFNβ (as compared to the 40 fold increase upon HIRA overexpression which triggers ectopic HIRA accumulation in PML NBs without the need for IFNβ), it might slightly contribute to it. We have now rephrased the text according to this result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it is unclear to me why addition of IFN β is required for HIRA localization at PML NBs in pml-/- MEFs transduced with Dox-inducible myc-PML (Figure 2-supplementary 1D; Figure 3D). IFN β signaling cannot increase PML transcription in those cells. How could the author explain here the need for IFNβ? Again, is it relative to any HIRA increase by IFNβ? Could HIRA increase contribute to HIRA localization at PML NBs upon IFN β (as suggested by figure 6)?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3 —figure supplementary 1B, we use mouse IFNa (and not IFNβ) to show that HIRA accumulation in PML NBs is conserved in MEFs Pml+/+, and lost in MEFs Pml-/-. We agree with the reviewer that in our rescue system, in principle, mouse IFNa cannot increase transcription of the exogenous PML in these cells. Yet, in order to be in similar conditions to compare with MEFs PML-/-, we used mouse IFNa to show that exogenous PML WT can rescue HIRA accumulation in PML NBs while exogenous PML 3K cannot. HIRA protein levels do no show major changes upon mouse IFNa addition in MEF cells as shown by WB quantification (Figure 3D). We hypothesize that PML overexpression and/or increase in endogenous SP100 upon mouse IFNa addition (as suggested below by the reviewer) is sufficient to induce HIRA accumulation in PML NBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, this could be mediated by increase in SP100. Indeed, SP100 is, as PML, a wellknown interferon-upregulated gene. The authors confirmed SP100 is required for HIRA localization at PML NBs upon INF β (Figure 3-supplementary 1). They should also assess whether the SP100 increase could explain the IFN effect on PML ectopically expressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we could not assess this since our SP100 antibody did not work in mouse cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several SP100 isoforms, and all should be also induced by interferon signaling. Yet, IFN β did not increase endogenous SP100 proteins in the experiment shown in Figure 3—figure supplementary1 B. A larger crop of the Western blot analysis would allow to check both the effect of the SiRNA and interferon on the SP100A, B, C and HMG isoforms.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the WB was not appropriate for SP100. We have now put a new WB (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1B or 1F) clearly showing the strong increase in SP100 protein levels upon addition of IFNβ, consistent with our new WB added in Figure 1D. Our siRNA against SP100 is taken from Everett and Orr, J. Virol 2008 (doi:10.1128/JVI.0230807) and targets all SP100 isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To my view, the authors could investigate further this requirement of SP100 for the mechanism of HIRA trafficking and localization at PML NBs and, especially regarding the role of SUMO and SIM. It has been shown that SP100 is recruited by sumoylated PML at PML bodies and may be itself sumoylated there, at least upon stress. Is the sumoylation site of SP100 required for HIRA recruitment at PML NBs?</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide novel data (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1D-F) analyzing the role of SP100 SUMOylation site in the localization of HIRA in PML NBs. We found that EYFP-SP100 K297R localizes correctly in PML NBs even in absence of endogenous SP100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), as shown previously (Cuchet-Lurenço et al., 2011). EYFP-SP100 K297R rescued HIRA localization in PML NBs to the same extent as the EYFP-SP100 WT protein (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1D-E). Thus, while SP100 plays an important role in the recruitment of HIRA in PML NBs, its SUMOylation <italic>per se</italic> does not seem to be required for HIRA accumulation in PML NBs. This is not antinomic with the role of HIRA putative SIM for its localization in PML NBs. We hypothesize that HIRA could both be dependent on SP100 levels and on the SUMOylation of other proteins (such as PML) for its accumulation in PML NBs. SP100 could play the role of an adapter protein facilitating the recruitment of HIRA next to PML NBs but its internalization would remain dependent on the SUMOylation of PML.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>EYFP-SP100 localizes in PML NBs in absence of endogenous SP100.</title><p>Fluorescence microscopy visualization of HIRA (green) together with PML (red) and EYFP-SP100 (pseudocolored in cyan) in BJ cells treated with an siRNA against SP100 for 48h and transduced with a lentivirus expressing EYFP-SP100 WT or K297R for 48h.
