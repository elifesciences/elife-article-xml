While previous work has implicated that they may provide neuroprotection by potentially influencing coordinated sets of genes and pathways, most of them remain largely uncharacterized in ischemic conditions. In this study, we used the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model in the immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT-22 and carried out an RNAi screen on epigenetic regulators. PRMT5 was identified as a novel negative regulator of neuronal cell survival after OGD, which presented a phenotype of translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus upon oxygen and energy depletion both in vitro and in vivo. PRMT5 bound to the chromatin and a large number of promoter regions to repress downstream gene expression. Silencing <italic>Prmt5</italic> significantly dampened the OGD-induced changes for a large-scale of genes, and gene ontology analysis showed that PRMT5-target genes were highly enriched for Hedgehog signaling. Encouraged by the above observation, mice were treated with middle cerebral artery occlusion with the PRMT5 inhibitor EPZ015666 and found that PRMT5 inhibition sustains protection against neuronal death in vivo. Together, these findings revealed a novel epigenetic mechanism of PRMT5 in cerebral ischemia and uncovered a potential target for neuroprotection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oxygen-glucose deprivation</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd><kwd>hippocampal neuronal cell line</kwd><kwd>primary cortical neurons culture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Air force medical university</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21QNPY084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Jiaji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An RNAi screen in mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line targeting epigenetic regulators revealed a novel neuroprotection of Prmt5 and uncovered its nucleus translocation feature and epigenetic mechanism in cerebral ischemia.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ischemic stroke, which accounts for 87% of all strokes, is the second most common cause of death and the leading cause of acquired disability in adults worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brott and Bogousslavsky, 2000</xref>). However, current therapy represented by rapid circulation restoration only benefits ~5% of patients due to the narrow treatment window and small vessel blockage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brott and Bogousslavsky, 2000</xref>). There is an urgent need in developing neuroprotective drugs that provide an alternative strategy to minimize neural cell loss and maximize the potential for recovery, which finally extend the therapeutic window for recanalization and improve clinical outcomes after stroke. To develop such effective therapies, genomic approaches have been employed to elucidate the mechanism of ischemic stroke-induced brain damage and the underlying molecular basis. In particular, genome-wide association, genome sequencing, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies have identified many genomic loci, genes, and pathways that are associated stroke, providing potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Söderholm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dichgans et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations play important roles in the pathogenesis of stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stanzione et al., 2020</xref>). Epigenetic alterations are reversible changes in DNA or histone modifications, chromatin structure, and non-coding RNAs, and serve critical roles in the regulation of gene activity. For example, global DNA methylation, histone methylation, histone acetylation, microRNAs, enhancer RNAs, and circular RNAs were found to show significant changes after cerebral ischemia in animal models or human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stanzione et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of DNA methyltransferases or histone deacetylases by genetic or chemical mechanisms was shown to protect against stroke-induced brain damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Polycomb repressive complex genes were found to play important roles in neuroprotection after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuehner and Yao, 2019</xref>). Thus, epigenetic regulators present novel opportunities for both stroke research and therapeutic interventions, and they may provide neuroprotection by potentially influencing coordinated sets of genes and pathways.</p><p>Both animal and cell culture models have been developed to facilitate the study of cerebral ischemia. In vivo, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rodents can produce reliable and well-reproducible infarcts and became a commonly used approach to mimic human ischemic stroke. In vitro, many cell-based models, using cells treated with chemical inhibitors, enzymatic induction, or hypoxia and energy depletion, were developed to replicate key features of ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurian and Pemaih, 2014</xref>). Even though they cannot recapitulate the complex response of stroke in intact animals, they serve as convenient and amenable tools to study ischemia-reperfusion injuries via biochemical, genetic, and genomic methods. For example, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment has been widely used to examine the cellular mechanisms involved in cerebral ischemia and identify potential neuroprotective agents and pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstock et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we used the OGD model in the immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT-22 and carried out an RNAi screen on epigenetic regulators. We identified PRMT5 as a novel negative regulator of neuronal cell survival after OGD. We further showed that it promoted cell death by repressing genes involved in Hedgehog signaling, and its inhibition provides protection against ischemic injuries both in vitro and in vivo. Together, our findings revealed a novel epigenetic mechanism that contributes to neuronal cell death in cerebral ischemia and uncovered a potential target for neuroprotection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNAi screen identified PRMT5 as a negative regulator of neuron survival after OGD</title><p>To systematically identify epigenetic factors that regulate cellular responses after cerebral ischemia, we used the well-established OGD protocol as an in vitro model for ischemic injury in the mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT-22. We carried out an RNAi screen using a custom shRNA library targeting selected epigenetic regulators. We first optimized the OGD treatment procedure on HT-22 cells and examined the length of OGD on cell survival. We chose 8 hr of oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by 24 hr of normal culture for the screen because it caused significant amount of cell death with small but consistent percentage of surviving cells. Next, we selected 125 genes involved in epigenetic and chromatin regulation and generated an shRNA library targeting these genes in the pLKO.1 vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To perform the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we transduced HT-22 cells with the shRNA library, selected for puromycin-resistant cells, and split the cells into two equal populations. One population was frozen as a pellet and used later as the library-transduced cells. The other was treated with the optimized OGD procedure. After the treatment, the cells were cultured under normal conditions and expanded for another 10 d to allow those that survived OGD to grow. The OGD-treated cells were collected and frozen as a pellet as well. We extracted genomic DNA from both the library-transduced and the OGD-treated cell pellets, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified the shRNAs from the genomic DNAs, and sequenced the shRNA pools from the two cell populations using the Illumina platform. Based on the representation of the shRNAs in the cells, we found that most of the shRNAs were depleted after OGD treatment, suggesting that the genes they target are likely required for cell survival during or after OGD. Importantly, we also found a small number of shRNAs that showed increased representations after OGD, suggesting that the inhibition of their target genes likely promoted cell survival. Encouragingly, shRNAs against <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>, <italic>Pcgf6,</italic> and <italic>Mga</italic> were among those that are enriched after OGD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with the notion that DNA methylation and polycomb repressive complexes play important roles in stroke injury and neuroprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endres et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNAi screen identified PRMT5 as a negative regulator of neuron survival after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the study methodology.

Therefore, we decided to focus on <italic>Prmt5</italic> and set out to validate its role in ischemic cell death. To rule out potential off-target effects by the <italic>Prmt5</italic> shRNA in the screen, we designed additional shRNAs against <italic>Prmt5</italic> in a different vector pGIPZ. We found that <italic>Prmt5</italic> knockdown (KD) by the original pLKO.1 shRNA as well as the two new pGIPZ shRNAs all led to significant improvement in HT-22 cell survival after OGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, treatment of the cells with a small-molecule PRMT5 inhibitor EPZ015666 resulted in similar outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), further supporting the fact that PRMT5 is responsible for the protective effect. Consistent with the above results based on cell numbers, PRMT5 inhibition significantly reduced OGD-induced HT-22 cell death in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Finally, in addition to the immortalized HT-22 cell line, <italic>Prmt5</italic> shRNA or PRMT5 inhibitor promoted the survival of primary mouse neurons in culture after OGD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Together, these results clearly demonstrated that PRMT5 plays an important role during OGD and its inhibition protects neuronal cells against OGD-induced damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PRMT5 protein translocates into the nucleus upon ischemic injury</title><p>To understand the molecular function of PRMT5 in OGD, we examined the behavior of its protein product by imaging in HT-22 cells. It was found that PRMT5 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm under normal conditions. Upon OGD treatment, however, it relocates to the nucleus and becomes enriched in the nuclear compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To rule out any potential artifacts caused by the antibody, we knocked-in an HA-tag to the C-terminus of the endogenous <italic>Prmt5</italic> gene in HT-22 cells using CRISPR-mediated genome editing, and re-examined PRMT5 localization with the HA antibody. Similarly, we found that the endogenous HA-tagged PRMT5 translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus after OGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To complement the imaging results, we carried out biochemical fractionation of the HT-22 cells and separated the cellular content into cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic, and chromatin-bound fractions. Consistent with the above, PRMT5 protein moved from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in OGD-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Further, we found that PRMT5 protein became largely chromatin-bound, suggesting that it may participate in OGD-induced transcriptional responses. Finally, we repeated the experiments in OGD-treated primary mouse neurons in culture and observed the same result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Oxygen-glucose deprivation led to PRMT5 nuclear translocation in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining to show PRMT5 cellular localization after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in HT-22 cells.

The left MCAO model was applied to mimic ischemic injury in the mouse brain and examined PRMT5 localization in both the ipsilateral and contralateral side by immunohistochemistry. Similar to what was observed in cultured cells, PRMT5 signal was mostly detected in the cytoplasm on the contralateral side, but became highly enriched in the nucleus on the ipsilateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Upon closer examination, PRMT5 nuclear translocation was detected in both the penumbra area and ischemic core of the ipsilateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We further verified these observations by immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Importantly, biochemical fractionation of the neuronal tissues again showed that PRMT5 not only translocates into the nucleus but also binds to the chromatin upon ischemic injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As PRMT5 has been implicated in chromatin and gene regulation, these results strongly suggested that PRMT5 may enter the nucleus and bind the chromatin to regulate neuronal gene expression upon OGD.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Middle cerebral artery occlusion led to PRMT5 nuclear translocation in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining to show PRMT5 cellular localization in ipsilateral and contralateral sides after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).

To test whether PRMT5 directly regulates gene expression and contributes to OGD-induced transcriptional changes, we carried out PRMT5 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in HT-22 cells treated with OGD. In total, we identified 16,061 peaks bound by PRMT5. Interestingly, a significant fraction of the PRMT5-bound genomic regions (56%) are near the transcription start sites (TSSs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), consistent with the notion that PRMT5 may regulate downstream gene expression. Indeed, when intercepted with the RNA-seq data, we found that PRMT5 occupies the promoter regions of a large fraction of the 2090 genes that were down-reversed genes in OGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Furthermore, the OGD-repressed genes appeared to be dependent on PRMT5 as <italic>Prmt5</italic> KD largely reversed their expression changes in OGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Therefore, we defined these genes that are bound by PRMT5, downregulated after OGD treatment but rescued by <italic>Prmt5</italic> KD as PRMT5-target genes in OGD. And the above results suggested that under OGD conditions PRMT5 enters the nucleus and suppresses the expression of its target genes. Gene ontology analysis showed that PRMT5-target genes are highly enriched for Hedgehog signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To validate the above findings based on genomic data, we carried out ChIP quantitative PCRs (ChIP-qPCRs) as well as reverse transcription quantitative PCRs (RT-qPCRs) on selected OGD-repressed PRMT5-target genes, including <italic>Ptch1</italic> and <italic>Smo</italic>. It was found that PRMT5 indeed occupied their promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>) and is responsible for their downregulation after OGD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Together, our findings strongly supported the notion that upon oxygen and glucose deprivation, PRMT5 promotes neuronal cell death by repressing the expression of genes involved in Hedgehog signaling. <italic>Prmt5</italic> silencing provides neuroprotection by preventing the inhibition of Hedgehog pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PRMT5 inhibition promotes neuron survival after ischemic injury in mouse brain</title><p>To test the relevance of our model in vivo, we first examined the behavior of the PRMT5-target genes in OGD in ischemic injury in mice.

We treated adult mice with either solvent only or the PRMT5 inhibitor EPZ015666 intranasally and then induced ischemic injury in the left side of the brain with the MCAO procedure. After the surgery, we first assessed the neurological damage based on behavioral changes and then sacrificed the animals and examined the damages in their brain tissue. Indeed, we found that PRMT5 inhibition resulted in significant protective effects. Specifically, EPZ015666 treatment reduced the infarct volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and increased the number of NeuN-positive neurons after MCAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). It also reduced the water content and tissue swelling caused by infarction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Most importantly, we found that EPZ015666 treatment led to significantly improved functional recovery in the animals as evidenced by the reduction in the neurological deficit scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Therefore, new approaches to define genes with functional relevance are essential to understand stroke and identify potential therapeutic targets. In that sense, genetic screens can provide a more direct strategy to search for genes that support neuronal cell survival during stroke conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstock et al., 2016</xref>). The development of RNAi and CRIPSR technologies, as well as the multiplex screening method, further promoted fast and convenient screens in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sioud, 2020</xref>). Here, we carried out a small-scale RNAi screen in HT-22 cells and identified a list of epigenetic factors that regulate neuronal cell death under ischemic conditions. Our study illustrates the power of forward genetics for the systematic study of ischemic stroke-induced injuries and presents a new strategy for the identification of neuroprotection agents.</p><p>Among the hits from the screen, we focused on <italic>Prmt5</italic> as its silencing presented the strongest phenotype. PRMT5 belongs to the evolutionarily conserved arginine methyltransferase protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2022</xref>). It catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-methionine to the guanidino nitrogen atoms of arginine as monomethylation and symmetric demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2022</xref>). PRMT5 has been implicated in various developmental processes and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Motolani et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, it is overexpressed in many cancers and elevated PRMT5 expression often correlates with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Ronai, 2020</xref>). Conversely, its depletion or inhibition leads to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Ronai, 2020</xref>). In addition, PRMT5 is also required for early embryonic development and the maintenance of embryonic and neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chittka et al., 2012</xref>). However, we found that <italic>Prmt5</italic> silencing by RNAi or inhibition by a small molecule enhances neuronal cell survival upon ischemic injury both in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with our findings, <italic>Prmt5</italic> silencing was reported to reduce oxidative stress-induced cell death in renal ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diao et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, PRMT5 appears to play dual roles in cell viability in a context-dependent fashion, being pro-proliferation in cancer and stem cells but pro-cell death under ischemic conditions.</p><p>Mechanistically, we showed that PRMT5 protein translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus upon oxygen and energy depletion both in vitro and in vivo. Like other arginine methyltransferase family members, subcellular localization of PRMT5 protein appears to be cell type specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koh et al., 2015</xref>). In embryonic stem cells, it is predominantly cytoplasmic in self-renewing condition, but relocates to the nucleus upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gkountela et al., 2014</xref>). During mammalian embryonic development, it shuttles between the cytosol and the nucleus to fulfill its many functions in gene regulation and epigenome silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ancelin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). In cancer, PRMT5 protein was found to show different cellular localization between normal and tumor tissues and between tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nicholas et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that its compartment-specific functions may regulate distinct molecular programs. In our study, we showed that PRMT5 is highly expressed in neurons and localizes predominantly in the cytoplasm under normal conditions, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chittka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ratovitski et al., 2015</xref>). Under OGD or ischemic conditions, it relocates to the nucleus and contributes to neuronal cell death. As transcription factors can interact with PRMT5 and regulate its cellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shilo et al., 2013</xref>), we speculate that PRMT5 may be recruited to the nucleus to carry out its function in transcriptional regulation by factor(s) in response to ischemia.</p><p>PRMT5 plays important roles in gene regulation by methylating histones, transcription factors, and spliceosome proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanc and Richard, 2017</xref>). It also interacts with ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers to control gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dacwag et al., 2007</xref>). We found that as PRMT5 translocates to the nucleus upon OGD, it binds to the chromatin and a large number of promoter regions to repress downstream gene expression. This is consistent with the notion that PRMT5 often acts as a transcription repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabbrizio et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, OGD treatment alone caused similar numbers of genes to be up- or downregulated. However, PRMT5-target genes are mostly downregulated after OGD and are enriched for those involved in cell survival. Thus, OGD or stroke-induced neuronal cell death may largely be caused by the repression of survival pathways and re-activating these pathways may thereby provide an important mechanism for neuroprotection.</p><p>Hedgehog signaling is an important signaling pathways that is frequently used during development for intercellular communication, as well as regeneration and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carballo et al., 2018</xref>). In nervous system-specific hedgehog, sonic hedgehog (SHH), canonically binds and inactivates PTCH1 inhibition of SMO for downstream GLI-1 signaling cascade, which has particularly marked roles in nervous system cell-type specification and limbs patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briscoe and Ericson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>). Many studies have emphasized its impact on neural cell survival and tissue regeneration/repair after ischemic stroke. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chechneva et al., 2014</xref> found that SHH signaling activation has promoted on neural cell survival and tissue regeneration/repair after ischemic stroke. Moreover, SHH agonist could also induce a decrease in blood–brain barrier permeability and an increase of newly generated neurons and neovascularization in the MCAO model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chechneva et al., 2014</xref>). In in vitro studies, the expression of SHH, PTCH1, and GLI-1 was significantly downregulated within 24 hr after OGD exposure, which were closely associated with increasing numbers of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yin et al., 2020</xref>). Activation of SHH signals promoted CREB and AKT phosphorylation, upregulated the expressions of BDNF, neuroligin, and neurexin, and decreased NF-κB phosphorylation following OGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yin et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the regulation of PRMT5 on SHH signaling may be one of the important mechanisms of its ischemia protection.</p><p>As mentioned above, PRMT5 plays critical roles in tumorigenesis and is therefore a therapeutic target that is actively pursued for cancer treatment. Several PRMT5 inhibitors, some of which highly potent, are in clinical trials to test their safety and efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tao et al., 2019</xref>). It will be interesting to systematically test their effect in protecting against neuronal cell death in cell-based and animal models of stroke in order to gain more insights to the molecular events after stroke as well as develop potential therapeutic interventions.</p><p>There were two major limitations that should be contemplated when interpreting these results. On the one hand, HT-22 is an immortalized mouse hippocampal cell line, which is a subline derived from parent HT4 cells that were originally immortalized from cultures of primary mouse hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pascual et al., 2012</xref>). There exists to a certain extent difference from primary neurons under OGD stress and may be affected by cell proliferation regulatory elements in HT-22. On the other hand, the PRMT5 function seems to closely link to its subcellular localization. The nuclear PRMT5 plays specific roles in transcription regulation by directly modulating the activity of several transcription factors or by methylating histones (H4R3, H2AR3, H3R8, and H3R2), while the cytoplasmic expression of PRMT5 is involved in splicing, translation, and regulation of receptor–ligand signaling and organelle integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koh et al., 2015</xref>). The mechanism of how PRMT5 is involved in neuroprotection needs further research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>HT-22 cells and primary cortical neurons culture</title><p>HT-22 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Richard Dargusch (Salk).

Brains were sectioned into 2-mm-thick coronal slices and stained in 2% TTC at 37°C for 15 min in the dark and then photographed. The infarct tissue areas were measured using Image-Pro Plus. To account for edema, the infarcted area was estimated by subtracting the uninfarcted region in the ipsilateral hemisphere from the contralateral hemisphere, and the infarct volume was expressed as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>ChIP and high-throughput sequencing</title><p>ChIP was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, HT-22 cells were subjected to OGD treatment and crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Formaldehyde was quenched by 200 mM glycine and cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were transferred to 15 mL conical tubes and collected by centrifugation. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer A (50 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.5], 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]), incubated at 4°C for 10 min, and collected by spinning at 1300 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. Cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer B (10 mM Tris–Cl [pH 8], 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail), incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Nuclei were pelleted by spinning at 1300 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. The pellet was suspended with lysis buffer B (10 mM Tris–Cl [pH 8], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, and protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated for 15 min on ice. Chromatin shearing was conducted with cells on ice using a microtip attached to Misonix 3000 sonicator. Sonicate 8–12 cycles of 30 s ON and 90 s OFF around 30-watt power output. A final concentration of 1% Triton X-100 was added and gently mixed by pipetting. The chromatin solution was clarified by spinning at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 30 min. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with 50 uL Dynabeads protein G (Life Technology) conjugated preliminary antibodies antibody overnight at 4°C. The immunoprecipitated material was washed five times with wash buffer (10 mM Tris–Cl [pH 8], 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 0.5 M LiCl, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate) and once with TE buffer (pH 8.0), then, eluted by heating for 30 min at 65°C with elution buffer (50 mM Tris–Cl [pH 7.5], 10 mM EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). To reverse the crosslinks, samples were incubated at 65°C overnight, then the eluted was digested with a final concentration of 0.5 μg/mL RNasesA at 37°C, followed by a final concentration of 0.5 μg/mL Proteinase at 55°C for 2 hr. The immunoprecipitated DNA were then purified using the DNA clean and concentrator 5 column (Zymo Research). The ChIP DNA was used for qPCRs using the indicated primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), and data were plotted as the percentage of input. All experiments were performed three or more times, and representative results are shown in the figures. For ChIP-seq, 1 ng precipitated DNA or input was used to generate sequencing libraries using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation Kit (Illumina). The resulting libraries were sequenced on Next-Seq (Illumina). Two biological replicates were performed, and combined reads were used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>For ChIP-seq, reads were filtered if they had a mean Phred quality score of less than 20. They were aligned to the mm10 assembly using Bowtie v1.2 with parameters -v 2 -m 1 <monospace>--best</monospace> <monospace>--strata</monospace>. Reads that aligned to the same genomic coordinates were considered duplicates and removed using the MarkDuplicates tool in the Picard Tools suite v1.86. Fragment length estimates were obtained using Homer v4.3. Coverage tracks were generated using the genomecov tool in the BEDtools suite after extending the aligned reads to the estimated fragment lengths. Coverage tracks were normalized to coverage per 10 million mapped reads. Peaks were called using SICER v1.1 and the following parameters: species = mm10, redundancy threshold = 100, window size = 200, effective genome fraction = 0.77, gap size = 600, FDR = 0.000001. Peaks were labeled as ‘TSS’ if they overlapped with the TSS of a gene in the GENCODE vM12 annotation, and they were labeled as ‘gene body’ if they did not overlap with a TSS but did overlap with any other part of a gene body. They were labeled as ‘intergenic’ if they did not overlap with either of the previous two.</p><p>For RNA-seq, reads were filtered if they had a mean Phred quality score of less than 20. They were aligned to the mm10 assembly using STAR v2.6.0c. Gene counts were obtained using the featureCounts tool in the Subread package v1.5.1 with the GENCODE vM12 annotation. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using DESeq2 with the following model: ~KnockDown + Treatment + KnockDown:Treatment. DEGs were required to have an FDR of less than 0.05 and a fold change of 1.5 or greater. ‘Down Reversed Genes’ were those that had a significant negative fold change in the OGD vs. control contrast and also a significant positive fold change in the interaction term contrast. The enrichment plot was generated using GSEA v.3.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were presented as means ± SEM.

They identified PRMT5 as a novel negative regulator of neuronal cell survival after OGD. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments were then performed to evaluate the roles of PRMT5 in OGD and ischemic stroke-induced injury. The authors found that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 protected against neuronal cell death in both in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, they found that in response to OGD and ischemia, PRMT5 was translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus, where PRMT5 bound to the chromatin and promoter regions of targeted genes to repress the expression of downstream genes. Further, they showed that silencing PRMT5 significantly altered the OGD-induced changes for a large-scale of genes. In a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), PRMT5 inhibitor EPZ015666 protected against neuronal death in vivo. This study reveals a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Overall, the authors have done elegant work showing the role of PRMT5 in neuronal cell survival.

While stroke stands as the second leading cause of death globally, and the burden of post-onset disability is substantial, particularly surging at a faster rate in low- and middle-income countries compared to high-income countries. The exploration of new drugs for stroke treatment holds profound societal implications. The concept of neuroprotective drug development is not novel; over the past half-century, considerable research and resources have been invested in this field. Yet, progress appears to be notably limited, and interest is currently waning.</p><p>Our research team is dedicated to devising rapid and cost-effective functional screening strategies grounded in the nervous system. Through this forward research approach, we aim to delve into potential neuroprotective targets across various neurological diseases. This endeavor not only bears significance for acute stroke but also holds potential application value for a spectrum of generalized nerve injuries.</p><p>Building on your insights, our upcoming studies will involve in vivo animal experiments, integrating the PRMT5 nuclear translocation mechanism. We anticipate that our continued research will benefit from further professional insights and guidance from your expertise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Haoyang Wu et al. have shown that the symmetric arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 binds to the promoter region of several essential genes and represses their expression, leading to neuronal cell death.

Your comments and suggestions hold immense value for us, contributing significantly to the enhancement of our work. We acknowledge with honesty that this research journey has been a prolonged and challenging experience.</p><p>The major functional study, as indicated by the CHIP-seq data record, was concluded between 2017 and 2019. Since then, our efforts and resources have been devoted to conducting in-depth mechanism and regulation research for PRMT5. Notably, PRMT5 is involved in 4-5 types of histone arginine methylation, and it plays a role in complex modification effects for proteins in the cytoplasm. Despite employing a variety of investigative methods, understanding and controlling these intricate mechanisms in experimental design have proven quite challenging. This not only places us at a disadvantage compared to some competitors but also hinders the creative potential of our lab team.</p><p>We firmly believe that there is ample room for further research on the role of PRMT5 in the nervous system. We aspire to collaborate with other research teams to explore this area collectively.</p></body></sub-article></article>
