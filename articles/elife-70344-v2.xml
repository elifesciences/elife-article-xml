Furthermore, the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC mediated pH-dependent recruitment of <italic>SWI/SNF</italic> to an acidic transcription factor in a reconstituted nucleosome remodeling assay. Simulations showed that protonation of histidines within the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC leads to conformational expansion, providing a potential biophysical mechanism for regulation of these interactions.

A key regulated parameter is intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>), which influences all biological processes by determining the protonation state of titratable chemical groups. These titratable groups are found across many biological molecules, from small-molecule osmolytes to the side chains of amino acids. While early work suggested that pH<sub>i</sub> was a tightly constrained cellular parameter, more recent technologies have revealed that pH<sub>i</sub> can vary substantially in both space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Llopis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seksek and Bolard, 1996</xref>). Moreover, changes in pH<sub>i</sub> can regulate metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busa and Nuccitelli, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Young et al., 2010</xref>), development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Needham and Needham, 1997</xref>), proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busa and Crowe, 1983</xref>), and cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Okamoto, 1994</xref>), among other processes. Intriguingly, stress-associated intracellular acidification appears to be broadly conserved, suggesting that a drop in pH<sub>i</sub> is a primordial mechanism to coordinate the general cellular stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drummond et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gores et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O’Sullivan and Condon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Triandafillou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yao and Haddad, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is adapted to an acidic external environment (pH<sub>e</sub>), and optimal growth media is typically at pH 4.0–5.5. The plasma membrane (Pma1) and vacuolar (Vma1) ATPases maintain near neutral pH<sub>i</sub> of ~7.8 by pumping protons out of the cell and into the vacuole, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martínez-Muñoz and Kane, 2008</xref>). When cells are starved for carbon, these pumps are inactivated, leading to a rapid acidification of the intracellular space to pH ~6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kane, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Orij et al., 2009</xref>). This decrease in intracellular pH<sub>i</sub> is crucial for viability upon carbon starvation and is thought to conserve energy, leading to storage of metabolic enzymes in filamentous assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>), reduction of macromolecular diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Munder et al., 2016</xref>), decreased membrane biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Young et al., 2010</xref>), and possibly the noncovalent crosslinking of the cytoplasm into a solid-like material state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Munder et al., 2016</xref>). These studies suggest that many physiological processes are inactivated when pH<sub>i</sub> drops. However, some processes must also be upregulated during carbon starvation to enable adaptation to this stress. These genes are referred to as ‘glucose-repressed genes’ as they are transcriptionally repressed in the presence of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeRisi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zid and O’Shea, 2014</xref>). Recently, evidence was presented of a positive role for acidic pH<sub>i</sub> in stress-gene induction: transient acidification is required for induction of the transcriptional heat-shock response in some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Triandafillou et al., 2020</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which the transcriptional machinery senses and responds to pH changes remain mysterious.</p><p>The <italic>S</italic>ucrose <italic>N</italic>on<italic>-F</italic>ermenting genes (<italic>SNF</italic>) were among the first genes found to be required for induction of glucose-repressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Neigeborn and Carlson, 1984</xref>). Several of these genes were later identified as members of the SWI/SNF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlson, 1987</xref>), an 11-subunit chromatin remodeling complex that is highly conserved from yeast to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiba et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peterson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peterson and Herskowitz, 1992</xref>). The SWI/SNF complex affects the expression of ~10% of the genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> during vegetative growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sudarsanam et al., 2000</xref>). Upon carbon starvation, most genes are downregulated, but a set of glucose-repressed genes, required for utilization of alternative energy sources, are strongly induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zid and O’Shea, 2014</xref>). The SWI/SNF complex is required for the efficient expression of several hundred stress-response and glucose-repressed genes, implying a possible function in pH-associated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biddick et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sudarsanam et al., 2000</xref>). However, we still lack evidence for a direct role for SWI/SNF components in the coordination of pH-dependent transcriptional programs or a mechanism through which pH sensing may be achieved.</p><p>10/11 subunits of the SWI/SNF complex contain large intrinsically disordered regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and in particular, 4/11 SWI/SNF subunits contain glutamine-rich low-complexity sequences (QLCs). QLCs are present in glutamine-rich transactivation domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kadonaga et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kadonaga et al., 1987</xref>) some of which, including those found within SWI/SNF, may bind to transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Prochasson et al., 2003</xref>) or recruit transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janody et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laurent et al., 1990</xref>). Intrinsically disordered regions lack a fixed three-dimensional structure and can be highly responsive to their solution environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holehouse and Sukenik, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moses et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the SWI/SNF QLCs contain multiple histidine residues. Given that the intrinsic pK<sub>a</sub> of the histidine sidechain is 6.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Whitten et al., 2005</xref>), we hypothesized that these glutamine-rich low-complexity regions might function as pH sensors in response to variations in pH<sub>i</sub>.</p><p>In this study, we elucidate <italic>SNF5</italic> as a pH-sensing regulatory subunit of SWI/SNF. <italic>SNF5</italic> is over 50% disordered and contains the largest QLC of the SWI/SNF complex. This region is 42% glutamine and contains seven histidine residues. We investigated the relationship between the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC and the cytosolic acidification that occurs during acute carbon starvation. By single-cell analysis, we found that intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) is highly dynamic and varies between subpopulations of cells within the same culture. After an initial decrease to pH<sub>i</sub> ~ 6.5, a subset of cells recovered their pH<sub>i</sub> to ~7. This transient acidification followed by recovery was required for expression of glucose-repressed genes. The <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC and four embedded histidines were required for rapid gene induction. SWI/SNF complex histone remodeling activity was robust to pH changes, but recruitment of the complex to a model transcription factor was pH-sensitive, and this recruitment was mediated by the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC and histidines within. All-atom simulations indicated that histidine protonation causes a conformational expansion of the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC, perhaps enabling interaction with a different set of transcription factors and driving recruitment to the promoters of glucose-repressed genes. Thus, we propose changes in histidine charge within QLCs as a mechanism to sense pH changes and instruct transcriptional reprograming during carbon starvation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Induction of <italic>ADH2</italic> upon glucose starvation requires the <italic>SNF5</italic> glutamine-rich low-complexity sequence with native histidines</title><p>The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex subunit <italic>SNF5</italic> has a large low-complexity region at its N-terminus that is enriched for glutamine, the sequence of which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

These parameters were optimized empirically based on the features of glutamine-rich regions in the <italic>S. cerevisiae proteme</italic> (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). By these criteria, the S288c <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain had 144 QLCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We found that proline and histidine were enriched (&gt;50–100%-fold higher than average proteome abundance) in yeast QLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), with similar patterns found in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> proteomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Enrichment for histidine within QLCs was previously described across many <italic>Eukaryotes</italic> using a slightly different method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ramazzotti et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the codons for glutamine are a single base pair mutation away from proline and histidine. However, they are similarly adjacent to lysine, arginine, glutamate, and leucine, yet QLCs are depleted for lysine, arginine, and glutamate, suggesting that the structure of the genetic code is insufficient to explain the observed patterns of amino acids within QLCs. We also considered the possibility that histidines might be generally enriched in low-complexity sequences. In fact, this is not the case: histidines are 50% more abundant in yeast QLCs than in all other low-complexity sequences identified using Wootton–Federhen complexity (see Materials and methods). Thus, histidines are a salient feature of QLCs.</p><p>The N-terminus of <italic>SNF5</italic> contains one of the largest QLCs in the yeast proteome and is in the top 3 QLCs in terms of number of histidines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>).

Despite the relatively poor sequence conservation across the N-terminal disordered regions in <italic>SNF5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), every region consisted of at least 18% glutamine (max 43%) and all possessed multiple histidine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; the phylogeny considered and the total number of QLCs for each species are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). A broader survey of the tree of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) indicates that the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC was likely gained in the lineage leading to the <italic>Ascomycota</italic> and is not present in most <italic>Metazoa</italic> (animals). In summary, enrichment for glutamine residues interspersed with histidine residues appears to be a conserved sequence feature, both in QLCs, in general, and in the N-terminus of <italic>SNF5,</italic> in particular, implying a possible functional role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zarin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the functional importance of the glutamine-rich N-terminal domain in <italic>SNF5,</italic> we engineered three <italic>SNF5</italic> mutant strains: a complete deletion of the <italic>SNF5</italic> gene (<italic>snf5Δ</italic>); a deletion of the N-terminal QLC (<italic>ΔQsnf5</italic>); and an allele with four histidines within the QLC mutated to alanine (<italic><sub>HtoA</sub>snf5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>).</p><p>As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laurent et al., 1990</xref>), <italic>snf5Δ</italic> strains grew slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>). In contrast, growth rates of <italic>ΔQsnf5</italic> and <italic><sub>HtoA</sub>snf5</italic> were similar to WT during continuous growth in either fermentable (glucose) or poor (galactose or galactose/ethanol) carbon sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A–D</xref>) and showed minimal defects when grown in glucose, carbon-starved for 24 hr, and then reinoculated into glucose media. However, a strong growth defect was revealed for <italic>ΔQsnf5</italic> and <italic><sub>HtoA</sub>snf5</italic> strains when cells were carbon-starved for 24 hr and then switched to a poor carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6E and F</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC is important for adaptation to new carbon sources. Deletion of the <italic>SNF5</italic> gene has been shown to disrupt the architecture of the SWI/SNF complex, leading to loss of other subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peterson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). To test if deletion of the QLC leads to loss of <italic>Snf5p</italic> protein or failure to incorporate into SWI/SNF, we immunoprecipitated the SWI/SNF complex from strains with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag at the C-terminal of the core <italic>SNF2</italic> subunit. We found that the entire SWI/SNF complex remained intact in both the <italic>ΔQsnf5</italic> and <italic><sub>HtoA</sub>snf5</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7A</xref>). Silver stains of the untagged <italic>Snf5p</italic> and Western blotting of TAP-tagged <italic>SNF5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Puig et al., 2001</xref>) strains showed that all <italic>SNF5</italic> alleles were expressed at similar levels to wild-type both in glucose and upon carbon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7B</xref>). Together, these results show that deletion of the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC is distinct from total loss of the <italic>SNF5 gene</italic> and that this N-terminal sequence is important for efficient recovery from carbon starvation.</p><p>We hypothesized that slow recovery of <italic>ΔQsnf5</italic> and <italic><sub>HtoA</sub>snf5</italic> strains after carbon starvation was due to a failure in transcriptional reprogramming. The alcohol dehydrogenase <italic>ADH2</italic> gene is normally repressed in the presence of glucose and strongly induced upon carbon starvation. This regulation depends on SWI/SNF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peterson and Herskowitz, 1992</xref>). Therefore, we used <italic>ADH2</italic> as a model gene to test our hypothesis. We assayed SWI/SNF occupancy at the <italic>ADH2</italic> promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of SWI/SNF complexes with a TAP-tag on the C-terminus of the <italic>SNF2</italic> subunit from strains with various <italic>SNF5</italic> alleles, followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). These experiments showed that the wild-type complex is robustly recruited to the <italic>ADH2</italic> promoter upon carbon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). However, this recruitment is reduced in <italic>ΔQsnf5</italic> and <italic><sub>HtoA</sub>snf5</italic> strains.</p><p>Next, we assayed transcription of the <italic>ADH2</italic> gene using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We found that robust <italic>ADH2</italic> expression after acute carbon starvation was dependent on the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC and the histidines within (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This defect was far stronger in the <italic>ΔQsnf5</italic> and <italic><sub>HtoA</sub>snf5</italic> strains than in <italic>snf5Δ</italic> strains; <italic>snf5Δ</italic> strains did not completely repress <italic>ADH2</italic> expression in glucose and showed partial induction upon carbon starvation, while <italic>ΔQsnf5</italic> strains tightly repressed <italic>ADH2</italic> in glucose (similar to WT), but completely failed to induce expression upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest a dual role for <italic>SNF5</italic> in <italic>ADH2</italic> regulation, both contributing to strong repression in glucose and robust induction upon carbon starvation. The <italic>ΔQsnf5</italic> and <italic><sub>HtoA</sub>snf5</italic> alleles separate these functions, maintaining WT-like repression while showing a strong defect in induction.</p><p>The RT-qPCR and ChIP assays report on the average behavior of a population. To enable single-cell analysis, we engineered a reporter strain with the mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>) fluorescent protein under the control of the <italic>ADH2</italic> promoter integrated into the genome immediately upstream of the endogenous <italic>ADH2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9A</xref>). We found high cell-to-cell variation in the expression of this reporter in WT strains: after 6 hr of glucose starvation, <italic>P<sub>ADH2</sub>-mCherry</italic> expression was bimodal; about half of the cells had high mCherry fluorescence and half were low. This bimodality was strongly dependent on preculture conditions and was most apparent upon acute withdrawal of carbon from early log-phase cells that had grown for &gt;16 hr with optical density at 600 nm (O.D.) never exceeding 0.3 (see Materials and methods). If cells became partly saturated at any time during preculture, <italic>ADH2</italic> induction was more rapid and uniform. Complete deletion of <italic>SNF5</italic> eliminated this bimodal expression pattern; again, low levels of expression were apparent in glucose and induction during starvation was attenuated. As in the RT-qPCR analysis, the <italic>ΔQsnf5</italic> strain completely failed to induce the <italic>P<sub>ADH2</sub>-mCherry</italic> reporter at this time point and mutation of four central histidines to alanine was sufficient to mostly abrogate expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Mutation of a further two histidines had little additional effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9B–D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the dual function of <italic>SNF5</italic> leads to switch-like control of <italic>ADH2</italic> expression. In glucose, <italic>SNF5</italic> helps repress <italic>ADH2</italic>. Upon carbon starvation, <italic>SNF5</italic> is required for efficient induction of <italic>ADH2</italic>. The <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC and histidine residues within seem to be crucial for switching between these states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC is required for <italic>ADH2</italic> expression and recovery of neutral pH</title><p>Multiple stresses, including glucose starvation, have been shown to cause a decrease in the pH of the cytoplasm and nucleus (nucleocytoplasm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dechant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gores et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Triandafillou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yao and Haddad, 2004</xref>).

To calibrate the pHluorin sensor, we calculated the ratio of intensities of fluorescence emission after excitation with 405 and 488 nm light in cells that were ATP-depleted and permeabilized in media of known pH. We obtained a near linear relationship between ratios of fluorescence intensity and pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, Materials and methods).

We used a fluorescence-based strategy in vitro to investigate these potential pH-sensing mechanisms. A center-positioned, recombinant mononucleosome was assembled on a 200 bp DNA fragment containing a ‘601’ nucleosome positioning sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dechassa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The nucleosomal substrate contained two binding sites for the Gal4 activator located upstream and 68 base pairs of linker DNA downstream of the nucleosome. The mononucleosome contained a Cy3 fluorophore covalently attached to the distal end of the template DNA, and Cy5 was attached to the H2A C-terminal domain. The Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores can function as a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair only when the Cy3 donor and Cy5 acceptor are within an appropriate distance (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li and Widom, 2004</xref>). In the absence of SWI/SNF activity, the center-positioned nucleosome has a low FRET signal, but ATP-dependent mobilization of the nucleosome toward the distal DNA end leads to an increase in FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brune et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith and Peterson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou and Narlikar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Indeed, it was previously demonstrated that the QLC of Snf5p mediates interaction with the Gal4-VP16 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Prochasson et al., 2003</xref>). To assess recruitment of SWI/SNF, we set up reactions with an excess of nonspecific competitor DNA. In these conditions, there is very little recruitment and remodeling without interaction with a transcription factor bound to the mononucleosome DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). In this context, we found that the QLC of <italic>SNF5</italic> was required for rapid, efficient recruitment of SWI/SNF by the Gal4-VP16 activator, and that the pH of the buffer affected this recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Within the physiological pH range (6.5–7.6), recruitment and remodeling increased with pH. This behavior might correspond to the recruitment of SWI/SNF to genes that are active at high pH<sub>i</sub> during growth in glucose. We predict that interactions with transcription factors at glucose-repressed genes would show the opposite behavior, that is, recruitment would be increased at lower pH<sub>i</sub>. SWI/SNF complexes deleted for the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC (containing <italic>ΔQsnf5</italic>p) had constitutively lower recruitment and were completely insensitive to pH changes over this same range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

Furthermore, these results suggest that the histidines within the <italic>SNF5 QLC</italic> must be present and deprotonated to enable interaction with VP16.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Protonation of histidines leads to conformational expansion of the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC</title><p>How might pH change be sensed by <italic>SNF5</italic>? As described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), glutamine-rich low-complexity sequences (QLCs) are enriched for histidines, and they are also depleted for charged amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Charged amino acids have repeatedly been shown to govern the conformational behavior of disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Müller-Späth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sorensen and Kjaergaard, 2019</xref>). Given that histidine protonation alters the local charge density of a sequence, we hypothesized that the charge-depleted QLCs may be poised to undergo protonation-dependent changes in conformational behavior. To test this idea, we performed all-atom Monte Carlo simulations to assess the conformational ensemble of a 50 amino acid region of the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC (residues 71–120) that contained three histidines, two of which we had mutated to alanine in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We performed simulations with histidines in both uncharged and protonated states to mimic possible charges of this polypeptide at the pH found in the nucleocytoplasm in glucose and carbon starvation, respectively. These simulations generated ensembles of almost 50,000 distinct conformations (representative images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To quantify conformational changes, we examined the radius of gyration, a metric that describes the global dimensions of a disordered region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Protonation of the wild-type sequence led to a striking increase in the radius of gyration, driven by intramolecular electrostatic repulsions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, left). In contrast, when 2/3 histidines were replaced with alanines, no such change was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, right). For context, we also calculated an apparent scaling exponent (<italic>ν<sup>app</sup></italic>), a dimensionless parameter that can also be used to quantify chain dimensions. This analysis showed that protonation of the wild-type sequence led to a change in <italic>ν<sup>app</sup></italic> from 0.48 to 0.55, comparable to the magnitude of changes observed in previous studies of mutations that fundamentally altered intermolecular interactions in other low-complexity disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sorensen and Kjaergaard, 2019</xref>). These results suggest that small changes in sequence charge density can elicit a relatively large change in conformational behavior. An analogous (albeit less pronounced) effect was observed for the second QLC subregion that we mutated (residues 195–233) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that charge-depleted disordered regions (such as QLCs) are poised to undergo pH-dependent conformational rearrangement. This inference offers the beginnings of a mechanism for pH sensing by SWI/SNF: the conformational expansion of the QLC sequence upon nucleocytoplasmic acidification may tune the propensity for SWI/SNF to interact with transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Protonation of histidines leads to conformational expansion of the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the <italic>SNF5</italic> gene (center) with the N-terminal QLC in orange and the two simulated peptides in dark orange.

However, the physiological role of these pH<sub>i</sub> fluctuations and the molecular mechanisms to detect them remain poorly understood. Prior results have emphasized the inactivation of processes in response to cytosolic acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is unclear how necessary modifications to the cell can occur if cellular dynamics are uniformly decreased. Much less has been reported regarding a potential role of fluctuations in pH<sub>i</sub> as a signal to activate specific cellular programs. In this work, we found that transient acidification is required for activation of glucose-repressed genes. Therefore, our work establishes a positive regulatory role for nucleocytoplasmic pH changes during carbon starvation.</p><p>Previous studies of intracellular state during glucose starvation based on population averages reported a simple decrease in pH<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Orij et al., 2009</xref>). In this work, we used single-cell measurements of both pH<sub>i</sub> and gene expression, and found that two coexisting subpopulations arose upon acute glucose starvation, one with pH<sub>i</sub> ~ 5.5 and a second at ~6.5. The latter population recovered to neutral pH<sub>i</sub> and then induced glucose-repressed genes, while the former remained dormant in an acidified state. We have not yet determined the mechanism that drives the bifurcation in pH response. It is possible that this bistability provides a form of bet-hedging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levy et al., 2012</xref>) where some cells attempt to respond to carbon starvation, while others enter a dormant state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Munder et al., 2016</xref>). However, we have yet to discover any condition where the population with lower pH<sub>i</sub> and delayed transcriptional activation has an advantage. An alternative explanation is that these cells are failing to correctly adapt to starvation, perhaps undergoing a metabolic crisis, as suggested in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jacquel et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>It is becoming clear that intracellular pH is an important mechanism of biological control. It was previously shown that the protonation state of phosphatidic acid (PA) determines binding to the transcription factor Opi1, coupling membrane biogenesis and intracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Young et al., 2010</xref>). We focused our studies on the N-terminal region of <italic>SNF5</italic> because it is known to be important for the response to carbon starvation and contains a large low-complexity region enriched in both glutamine and histidine residues. Histidines are good candidates for pH sensors as they can change protonation state over the recorded range of physiological pH fluctuations, and their pK<sub>a</sub> can be tuned substantially depending on local sequence context. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC and the histidines embedded within were required for transcriptional reprogramming.</p><p>Our in vitro assays showed that the intrinsic ATPase and nucleosome remodeling activities of SWI/SNF are robust to pH changes from 6.5 to 7.6. However, recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex by a model transcription factor (GAL4-VP16) was pH-sensitive, and this pH dependence was dependent on both the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC and the four central histidines within this domain. In this case, the recruitment by GAL4-VP16 was inhibited at pH 6.5. We speculate that low pH<sub>i</sub> favors release of SWI/SNF from activators that it is bound to in glucose conditions, and then the subsequent partial recovery in pH<sub>i</sub> could allow it to bind to a different set of activators (e.g., <italic>ADR1</italic> and <italic>CAT8</italic>), thus recruiting it to genes that are expressed during starvation. This model is consistent with the requirement for both acidification and subsequent neutralization for expression of <italic>ADH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In principle, the conformational dynamics of the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC could be distinct at all three stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). There are almost certainly additional pH-sensing elements of the transcriptional machinery that also take part in this reprogramming; multiple candidates are present among the of transcription factors that were enriched in our RNA-seq experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Low-complexity sequences, including QLCs, tend to be intrinsically disordered and therefore highly solvent exposed. A recent large-scale study of intrinsically disordered sequences showed that their conformational behavior is inherently sensitive to changes in their solution environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holehouse and Sukenik, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moses et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, our simulations revealed that histidine protonation may lead the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC to expand dramatically. This provides a potential mechanism for pH sensing: upon acidification, histidines become positively charged, leading QLCs to adopt a more expanded state, perhaps revealing short linear interaction motifs (SLIMs), reducing the entropic cost of binding to interaction partners, preventing polar-mediated protein-protein interactions, or facilitating electrostatic-mediated contacts. The enrichment of histidines in QLCs hints that this could be a general, widespread mechanism to regulate cell biology in response to pH changes.</p><p>Glutamine-rich low-complexity sequences have been predominantly studied in the context of disease. Nine neurodegenerative illnesses, including Huntington’s disease, are thought to be caused by neurotoxic aggregation seeded by proteins that contain polyglutamines created by expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2014</xref>). However, polyglutamines and glutamine-rich sequences are relatively abundant in <italic>Eukaryotic</italic> cells: more than 100 human proteins contain QLCs, and the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and <italic>Drosophilid</italic> phyla have QLCs in ~10% and ~5% of their proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schaefer et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, there is clear evidence of purifying selection to maintain polyQs in the <italic>Drosophilids</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huntley and Clark, 2007</xref>). This prevalence and conservation suggest an important biological function for these sequences. Recent work in <italic>Ashbya gossypii</italic> has revealed a role for QLC-containing proteins in the organization of the cytoplasm through phase separation into liquid droplets to enable subcellular localization of signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). More generally, polyglutamine has been shown to drive self-association into a variety of higher-order assemblies, from fibrils to nanoscopic spheres to liquid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peskett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Posey et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these results imply that QLCs may offer a general mechanism to drive protein-protein interactions. In this study, we have identified a role for QLCs in the SWI/SNF complex as pH sensors. Our current model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) is that the <italic>SNF5</italic> QLC partakes in heterotypic protein interactions that are modulated by protonation of histidines when the cell interior acidifies. However, we do not rule out the possibility for homotypic interactions and higher-order assembly of multiple SWI/SNF complexes.</p><p>All cells must modify gene expression to respond to environmental changes. This phenotypic plasticity is essential to all life, from single-celled organisms fighting to thrive in an ever-changing environment, to the complex genomic reprogramming that must occur during development and tissue homeostasis in plants and animals. Despite the differences between these organisms, the mechanisms that regulate gene expression are highly conserved. Changes in intracellular pH are increasingly emerging as a signal through which life perceives and reacts to its environment. This work provides a new role for glutamine-rich low-complexity sequences as molecular sensors for these pH changes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

We assembled plasmids by PCR or gene synthesis (IDT gene blocks) followed by Gibson cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>). Then, plasmids were linearized and used to overwrite the endogenous locus by sigma homologous recombination using homology to both ends of the target gene.</p><p>The <italic>ΔQsnf5</italic> gene lacks the N-terminal 282 amino acids that comprise a glutamine-rich low-complexity domain. Methionine 283 serves as the ATG for the <italic>ΔQ-SNF5</italic> gene. In the <italic><sub>HtoA</sub>snf5</italic> allele, histidines 106, 109, 213, and 214 were replaced by alanine using mutagenic primers to amplify three fragments of the QLC region, which were combined by Gibson assembly into an <italic>SNF5</italic> parent plasmid linearized with BamH1 and Sac1.</p><p>We noticed that the slow growth null strain phenotype of the <italic>snf5Δ</italic> was partially lost over time, presumably due to suppressor mutations. Therefore, to avoid these spontaneous suppressors, we first introduced a CEN/ARS plasmid carrying the <italic>SNF5</italic> gene under its own promoter and the <italic>URA3</italic> auxotrophic selection marker. Then, a kanMX6 resistance cassette, amplified with primers with homology at the 5′ and 3′ of the <italic>SNF5</italic> gene, was used to delete the entire chromosomal <italic>SNF5</italic> ORF by homologous recombination.

A 3′ fragment of the <italic>SNF5</italic> and SNF2 genes was PCR amplified without the Stop codon. This segment does not contain a promoter or an ATG codon for translation initiation. The TAP tag was then amplified by PCR and cloned together with the 3′ of <italic>SNF5</italic> and <italic>SNF2</italic> ORFs by Gibson assembly into pRS plasmids with linearized Sac1 and Asc1.

Carbon starvation media was SC media without glucose, supplemented with sorbitol, a nonfermentable carbon source to avoid osmotic shock during glucose starvation (6.7 g/L YNB + ammonium sulfate; 2 g/L amino acid mix and 100 mM sorbitol).

Cells were pre-cultured overnight to log-phase (or subjected to other indicated pre-culture conditions) and then seeded at an A600 of 0.1 (based on a path length of ~0.3 cm) in SC media with various carbon sources. All measurements were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Glucose starvation</title><p>Cultures were incubated in a rotating incubator at 30°C and grown overnight (14–16 hr) to an OD between 0.2 and 0.3. Note that it is extremely important to prevent culture OD from exceeding 0.3, and results are different if cells are allowed to saturate and then diluted back. Thus, it is imperative to grow cultures from colonies on plates for &gt;16 hr without ever exceeding OD 0.3 to obtain reproducible results. Typically, we would inoculate 3 mL cultures and make a series of 4–5 1/5 dilutions of this starting culture to be sure to catch an appropriate culture the following day. 3 mL of OD 0.2–0.3 culture were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 3 min and resuspended in 3 mL starvation media (SC sorbitol at various pH<sub>e</sub>). This spin and resuspension was repeated two more times to ensure complete removal of glucose. Finally, cells were resuspended in 3 mL of starvation media. For flow cytometry, 200 μL samples were transferred to a well of a 96-well plate at each time point. During the course of time-lapse experiments, culture aliquots were set aside at 4°C. An LSR II flow cytometer with an HTS automated sampler was used for all measurements. 10,000 cells were analyzed at each time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Nucleocytoplasmic pH measurements</title><p>Nucleocytoplasmic pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) was measured by flow cytometry or microscopy.

The settings used for LSR II flow cytometer were AmCyan (excitation 457, emission 491) and FITC (excitation 494, emission 520). AmCyan emission increases with pH, while FITC emission decreases. A calibration curve was made for each strain in each experiment. To generate a calibration curve, glycolysis and respiration were poisoned using 2-deoxyglucose and azide. This treatment leads to a complete loss of cellular ATP, and the nucleocytoplasmic pH equilibrates to the extracellular pH. We used the calibration buffers published by Patricia Kane’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diakov et al., 2013</xref>): 50 mM MES (2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid), 50 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), 50 mM KCl, 50 mM NaCl, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, 10 mM sodium azide, 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose.

For ATPase assays, two unlabeled primers used (PrimerW: 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTG</named-content>-3′, PrimerS: 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GATCCTAATGACCAAGGAAAGCA</named-content>-3′) under same PCR conditions with NEB Taq DNA Polymerase with 1× NEB ThermoPol Buffer. 400 nM fluorescently labeled and unlabeled mononucleosomes were reconstituted via salt gradient at 4°C with a peristaltic pump as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luger et al., 1999</xref>), with 600 mL high salt buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M KCl, 1 mM DTT) exchanged with 3 L of low salt buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT) over 20 hr. The quality of the nucleosomes was checked by visualizing proteins on a 5% native-PAGE gel and scanning fluorescence ratios of labeled nucleosomes on an ISS PC1 spectrofluorometer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-3"><title>FRET-based nucleosome remodeling</title><p>The fluorescence resonance energy transfer between Cy3-labeled DNA and Cy5-labeled octamer was used to measure the remodeling and recruitment activity of SWI/SNF using an ISS PC1 spectrofluorometer. The remodeling activity was measured by the increase in FRET signal in that occurred as a consequence of nucleosome sliding the DNA template. The reaction was performed under three different pH conditions: pH 6.5 (25 mM MES, 0.2 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 70 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT), pH 7 (25 mM Tris, 0.2 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 70 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT), and pH 7.6 (25 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 70 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT). Remodeling reactions contained 2 nM or 4 nM (WT or mutant) SWI/SNF, 5 nM nucleosome, and 100 µM ATP or AMP-PNP. A 100 s pre-scan of the reaction was taken before the reaction started and the time-dependent fluorescence measurements started after addition of ATP or AMP-PNP for 1000s at room temperature. Similarly, recruitment assays were performed in three different buffer conditions: pH 6.5, pH 7, and pH 7.6. The recruitment assays contained 2 nM or 4 nM (WT or mutant) SWI/SNF, 5 nM nucleosome, 4 nM competitor DNA, 100 µM Gal4–VP16 (Protein One, P1019-02) and 100 µM ATP or AMP-PNP, together with respective controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sen et al., 2017</xref>). 100 s of pre-scans and 1000s of time-dependent enzyme kinetics were measured. At least 2–4 kinetic traces were collected per reaction. Data were normalized to their respective pre-scans to account for variation between reactions. The time-dependent FRET signals were excited at 530 nm and measured at 670 nm. The data analysis was performed using the OriginLab software package.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-4"><title>ATPase activity measurements</title><p>7-Diethylamino-3-[N-(2-maleimidoethyl)-carbamoyl]-coumarin-conjugated phosphate binding protein A197C (MDCC-PBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brune et al., 1994</xref>) was used to detect inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) release from ATPase activity in real time. Before the reaction, ATP was cleared of free P<sub>i</sub> by performing a mopping reaction. In order to mop the ATP, 10 mM ATP was incubated with 1 U/mL PNPase (Sigma, N2415-100UN) and 200 µM 7-methylguanosine (Sigma, M0627-100MG) in mopping buffer (25 mM HEPES, 75 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT) for 2 hr at room temperature. ATPase assay reaction conditions were 2 nM SWI/SNF, 5 nM nucleosome, and 100 µM ATP in respective pH buffers; pH 6.5 (25 mM MES, 0.2 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 70 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT), pH 7 (25 mM Tris, 0.2 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 70 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT), or pH 7.6 (25 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 70 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT). The measurements were performed on a Tecan Infinite 1000, with excitation at 405 nm and emission at 460 nm. Pre-scan measurements were taken to detect the basal level of signal per reaction. The time-dependent measurements were taken after starting the reaction by ATP addition. At least 3–4 kinetic traces were analyzed using the steady-state equation using GraphPad Prism 8 software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>All-atom simulations</title><p>All-atom simulations were run with the ABSINTH implicit solvent model and CAMPARI Monte Carlo simulation (V2.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://campari.sourceforge.net/">http://campari.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vitalis and Pappu, 2009</xref>).

For SNF5<sup>71-120</sup> simulations, 20 independent simulations were run for each combination of pH (as defined by histidine protonation state) and mutational state. For SNF5<sup>195-223</sup>, the high glutamine content made conformational sampling challenging, as has been observed in previous glutamine-rich systems, reflecting the tendency for polyglutamine to undergo intramolecular chain collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Newcombe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Warner et al., 2017</xref>).

The authors find that a Qrich low complexity sequence (QLC) in the SNF5 subunit of SWI/SNF, and His residues within this sequence, are required for the response to glucose starvation. Sequence analysis indicates that QLCs with an enrichment of His are common in many eukaryotes. Using a fluorescent ADH2 reporter to track the transcription response to glucose starvation, and a fluorescent pH reporter. Single cell measurements of ADH2 induction and intercellular pH during carbon starvation at different external pH conditions led the authors to conclude that the signal for induction of ADH2 is the transient intracellular acidification that occurs in response to glucose starvation. SNF5 QLC is required both for normal kinetics of transient acidification and for additional steps during ADH2 induction. RNA-seq of WT and SNF5 QLC mutants at different conditions identified 4 groups of genes with different regulatory patterns. Bioinformatic analyses showed that genes involved in acute glucose-starvation response are pH and SNF5 QLC-dependent. in vitro nucleosome remodeling assays were used to demonstrate that neither the SNF5 QLC nor pH (over the relevant range) regulate ATPase or nucleosome remodelling activity. However, using a remodeling assay that depends on transcription factor recruitment, wild type SWI/SNF, but not SWI/SNF with the SNF5 QLC deleted, shows decreased recruitment at lower pH. All atom Monte Carlo simulations predict that segments of the QLC undergo protonation dependent conformational expansion, which is suggested to form the mechanistic basis of pH-sensitive transcription factor interactions. Sequence analysis demonstrates that QLCs with His residues are conserved in SWI5 across many fungi, and that QLCs are and more particular histidines in these low complexity regions, were proposed to play an evolutionarily conserved role in many eukaryotes based on in silico sequence analyses.</p><p>The conclusions of the authors are mostly well supported by their experimental findings. Starting with the in silico sequence analyses that indicate a broad evolutionary relevance of QLCs and their histidines, the authors move on to dissect QLC function at multiple scales. Growth assays in combination with the pADH2 fluorescence reporter (verified by RT-qPCR) and with pHluorin examine cells at the population and single-cell level. The in vitro assays and Monte Carlo simulations aim at deciphering the underlying molecular mechanism of the observed QLC perturbations.. Both data and methods are carefully presented, with detailed descriptions of the methodological approach (e.g. snf5∆ slow growth phenotype loss and how this was solved). The authors further provide analysis code and resources online, which supports reproducibility. For most experiments, quantification is provided, and statistical tests used appropriately.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The one experiment that needs additional explanation/analysis is the in vitro nucleosome remodeling assay. First, do the graphs show single traces or are they averages?</p></disp-quote><p>These are averages of 2-4 independent kinetic traces. This is stated in the methods, but we will have also added this information to the legend. There is some day to day variability but the patterns that we highlight are consistent. We will have clarified the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, in the supplemental data, the ATPase data were fit, but the fits (and accompanying errors) are not provided-only a representative trace.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a representative example. No consistent differences were found. We will clarify in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the analysis would be more complete if the His mutant of the QLC was included.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these data to figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, he authors could describe their conclusions from these data more clearly. In Figure 5D, the decrease in remodeling with decreasing pH is clear for the wild type traces. It also seems clear that the δ QLC is not pH responsive. However, what is the interpretation of the higher baseline (no TF) signal, including the pattern at the end of the trace, and lower overall remodeling (at all pH). Is it the author’s model that both the QLC and another region in SWI/SNF are required for interaction with VP16, and that the QLC interaction is pH sensitive (thus without the QLC, there is still recruitment but it is not pH sensitive)?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the small differences in baselines of negative controls is just technical variation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recognizing that this assay is not the focus of the paper, and that the authors are careful not to over interpret it, it does provide an important level of mechanistic insight.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer. Indeed, reconstitution is inherently limited due to its reductionist nature. However, we can distinguish between two key models: modulation of intrinsic chromatin remodeling activity of SWI/SNF versus modulation of recruitment to chromatin. This assay nicely supports the latter mechanism. Furthermore, our new data suggest that the presence of histidines in a low-protonation state is required for interaction with VP16.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Since calibration curves are quite central for the pH measurements, exemplary curves should be provided in the supplementary data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these curves (new Figure 2 supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. While the pADH2 reporter assay is well-controlled with ADH2 mRNA RT-qPCR, it would be interesting to know if the induction effects are also observable on the protein level. Clearly, the authors show that translation of new transcripts is required for pH recovery using cyclohexamide. However, even if no additional experiments (like ADH2 Western blot) are performed, at least some information (possibly from previous publications) about how the findings on the transcriptional level/on the level of ADH2 mRNA induction correspond to the protein level.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t have an antibody for ADH2p, however the main assay we use in the paper requires both transcription and translation of the reporter gene (pADH2-mCherry). The manuscript is very clearly focused on the role of SWI/SNF in transcriptional activation, therefore we won’t investigate possible effects of pH or SWI/SNF on protein stability at this time. This is an interesting topic for future studies though!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The statistical test used for RT-qPCR data in Figure 1D should be provided (for example in Figure 4C, the statistical test and the figure are nicely described).</p></disp-quote><p>These are Bonferroni-corrected t-tests. We have added this information to the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 4B, it is difficult to see the underlying box plots.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the data points a more transparent to make the box plots more apparent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For the sake of completeness, the authors might want to add how the results differ if culture OD exceeds OD 0.3 before the assays (lines 541+542).</p></disp-quote><p>ADH2 induction happens much more quickly if the culture exceeds OD 0.3, and the effects of the SNF5 alleles are less apparent.

The authors present an exciting model of pH sensing, in which few histidines govern pH-sensitive transcription factor interactions upon carbon starvation in S. cerevisae. By dissecting how a QLC can act as a pH sensor to translate carbon starvation into transcription changes needed for adaptation, the authors provide new insight into disordered protein function (potentially identifying a class of pH sensitive LCDs), and a novel mechanism linking environment (i.e. pH) to transcription control. The authors provide interesting speculation as to how similar mechanisms could be broadly conserved, and highlight examples of pH changes that occur in cells (including human cells). This work is therefore of broad general interest to the field of disordered proteins, transcription, and (potentially) cellular metabolism and its links to disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Expertise lacking: molecular dynamics simulations</p><p>Referee Cross-commenting</p><p>I also agree that the authors should revise this interesting manuscript to address the points raised by the reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The intracellular milieu, including pH, is important for proper functioning of cellular processes. To be able to react to changes, cells need sensing and subsequently correction mechanisms. In the manuscript of Ignacio Gutiérrez et al., the authors showed that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> histidines in a glutamine-rich low complexity sequence (QLC) in the N-terminus of SNF5, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes, are important for transcription response during carbon starvation. Their model is that a transient acidification leads to protonation of the histidines in the QLC of SNF5 resulting in a</p><p>conformation change. After a transient acidification, the conformational expansion is reversed leading to interaction with different transcription factors and ultimately to an altered transcriptional response. It is an interesting idea that chromatin remodelers, which are highly important transcription regulators, serve as a pH sensor to adapt gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, this indeed is the intended scope of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A bit of the enthusiasm is gone, as the QLC of SNF5 is not conserved in humans, where the authors speculate in the discussion that QLCs of other SWI/SNF subunits could be important here. However, human QLCs are not enriched for histidines according to their analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have gone back and re-evaluated our bioinformatic analysis with a revised definition of QLCs based on a more rational argument (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2). In this new analysis, QLCs are enriched for histidine in all organisms that we investigated, including humans. This enrichment is especially apparent when comparing QLCs to other low complexity sequences (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As QLC including histidines are frequent across many proteins in several other species, the authors claim that these regions could commonly function as pH sensors, but evidence for this is also missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We started to investigate the hypothesis that SNF5 is a pH-sensor, “enrichment for glutamine residues interspersed with histidine residues appears to be conserved sequence feature, both in QLCs in general, and in the N-terminus of SNF5 in particular, implying a possible functional role (40).” It is beyond the scope of our current work to demonstrate pH sensing in multiple organisms, or in a large number of different protein complexes. However, we plan to follow up with these kinds of studies in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors address an important topic and show SNF5 QLC-dependent effects, their data also leave many open questions and the model needs further support of additional data.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The authors define QLCs as “stretches of low-complexity sequences containing at least 10 glutamines” (p.5). They show an enrichment of alanine, proline and histidine in QLCs in yeast, however, this is not very evident in the SNF5 case directly in the defined QLCs. The N-terminus contains 2 QLCs (26 aa, 64aa), but the relevant histidines are mainly adjacent to the QLCs.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We carefully reconsidered our definition of QLCs in the revised manuscript since our previous working definition was a good starting point, but somewhat arbitrary. Our new definition of a QLC is a sub-region of the proteome in with an average fraction of glutamine residues of 25% or higher (minimum fraction), with a maximum interruption between any two glutamine residues of less than 17 residues, and the where the whole QLC is at least 15 residues in length (minimum length) (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). Systematic variation of the maximum interruption size revealed that 17 residues was the value that maximized the number of QLCs and the number of residues found within QLCs, offering an optimally permissive value under the 0.25 or greater fraction of glutamine threshold. Using this new definition of QLCs, we found that the N-terminus of SNF5 is mostly QLC, including all of the relevant histidines in this study (new figure 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Due to additional glutamines in the vicinity, the authors refer here as SNF5 QLC of a 282 amino acid region. This region is further poorly conserved, but a range of ascomycetes showed also high glutamine and several histidine residues in the N-terminus of SNF5. However, it is not clear how evolutionary conserved this feature is across other species.</p></disp-quote><p>We have zoomed out to encompass proteomes that more broadly cover the Eukaryotic tree of life. This allowed us to determine that this sequence feature was gained in basidiomycete and ascomycete fungi, indicating conservation for ~1 billion years, but was not present in. the ancestor of the metazoa (animals).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the QLC is not conserved in humans and QLCs in humans are not enriched for histidines. It is unclear why the authors only focused on ascomycetes to look at evolutionary conservation. They should extend their studies to provide an idea in which species their proposed model might play a role and what the evolutionary advantage might be to lose the SNF5 QLC. As histidines are also not enriched in human QLCs, the authors should comment on the relevance of their proposed mechanisms for humans (e.g. number of QLCs, QLCs including histidines).</p></disp-quote><p>See above. Metazoa don’t appear to have lost the sequence, rather it is gained in the fungi. We also used recent structures to compare BAF and SWI/SNF. Both complexes contain large clusters of low complexity sequences poised near the DNA exiting the nucleosome (see new Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Interestingly, BAF does have one QLC in that position.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the growth of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> under poor carbon sources seems not to depend on SNF5 QLC or the histidines in this region, the authors observe a strongly reduced growth rate if the switch to poor carbon sources is preceded by a 24h glucose starvation. How is the growth rate if they are provided with glucose again after the starvation or pH is kept low for longer? Glucose starvation will also lead to a drop of intracellular ATP concentration and consequently impair ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. After starvation, the cells may depend more on remodelers to restore the chromatin. The authors should do additional experiments to be able to discriminate the source of reduced cell growth after starvation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the experiment switching from glucose to starvation and back to glucose Figure 1—figure supplement 6.</p><p>With respect to: &quot;do additional experiments to be able to discriminate the source of reduced cell growth after starvation.&quot; We believe that it’s likely that failure to induce a key set of starvation response genes to metabolically adapt to carbon starvation is part of the reason for reduced growth (figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the C-terminus of SNF5 is interacting with the acidic patch of the nucleosomes (e.g. Han et al., 2020), the N-terminus of SNF5 has been shown to be important for interaction with acidic transcription activators (Neely et al., 2002).

It is extremely sick and we believe that it rapidly acquires suppressor mutations (or perhaps undergoes poorly defined epigenetic conversions).
