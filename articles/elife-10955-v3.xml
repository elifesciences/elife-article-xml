Yet, the evolutionary forces that cause such collective responses to evolve are poorly understood. Here, we develop analytical methods and evolutionary simulations based on experimental data from schooling fish. We use these methods to investigate how populations evolve within unpredictable, time-varying resource environments. We show that populations evolve toward a distinctive regime in behavioral phenotype space, where small responses of individuals to local environmental cues cause spontaneous changes in the collective state of groups. These changes resemble phase transitions in physical systems. Through these transitions, individuals evolve the emergent capacity to sense and respond to resource gradients (i.e. individuals perceive gradients via social interactions, rather than sensing gradients directly), and to allocate themselves among distinct, distant resource patches. Our results yield new insight into how natural selection, acting on selfish individuals, results in the highly effective collective responses evident in nature.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10955.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10955.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10955.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In nature, we see many examples of highly coordinated movements of groups of individuals; think of a flock of birds turning swiftly in unison or a crowd of people filing through the exit of a building. A common feature of these behaviors is that they occur without any centralized control, and that they involve sudden and often dramatic changes in the 'collective state' of the group (i.e. speed, or the distances between individuals). In the past, researchers have likened these transitions in collective behavior to phase transitions in physical systems, for example, the transition between liquid water and water vapor. However, it is not clear how such collective responses could have evolved.</p><p>Natural selection is an evolutionary process whereby individuals with particularly 'fit' traits produce more offspring than others. Over many generations, these beneficial traits tend to become more common in the population. Hein, Rosenthal, Hagstrom et al. developed a mathematical model to investigate whether the capacity of a population to perform collective motions could evolve through natural selection.</p><p>The model shows that over many generations, populations consistently evolve a unique collective trait whereby small responses of individuals to an environmental cue can cause spontaneous changes in the collective state of the local population. These transitions in collective state greatly enhance the ability of individuals to locate and exploit resources. Hein, Rosenthal, Hagstrom et al.’s findings suggest that natural selection acting on the behavior of individuals can cause a population to evolve a distinctive, collective behavior.</p><p>The next challenge will be to identify a biological system in which the evolution of collective motion can be studied experimentally to test these predictions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10955.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10955.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Collective Behavior</kwd><kwd>Physical Computation</kwd><kwd>Swarm</kwd><kwd>Optimization</kwd><kwd>Decision-making</kwd><kwd>Explore-exploit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000913</institution-id><institution>James S.

For example, when fish schools are attacked by predators, 'flash expansion' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pitcher et al., 1993</xref>) and other coordinated collective motions, made possible above a certain group size, reduce individual risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handegard et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, fish can track dynamic resource patches far more effectively when they are in a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berdahl et al., 2013</xref>). When an individual responds to a change in the environment (e.g., predator, resource cue), this response propagates swiftly through the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosenthal et al., 2015</xref>), altering the group’s collective motion. How are such rapid, coordinated responses possible? These responses may occur, in part, because the nature of social interactions makes animal groups highly sensitive to small changes in the behavior of individual group members; theoretical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couzin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D’Orsogna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kolpas et al., 2007</xref>) and empirical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tunstrøm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buhl et al., 2006</xref>) studies of collective motion have revealed that minor changes in individual behavior, such as speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tunstrøm et al., 2013</xref>), can cause sudden transitions in group state, reminiscent of similarly sudden phase transitions between collective states in physical systems (such as the solid-liquid-gas transitions as a function of increasing temperature). It has been proposed that individuals may trigger such changes in collective state by responding to the environment, thereby initiating a coordinated response at the group level (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couzin et al. (2002)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kolpas et al. (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Couzin and Krause, 2003</xref>). This mechanism requires that the behavioral rules of individual animals within a population have evolved in a way that allows groups to transition adaptively among distinct collective states. The evolutionary processes that could lead to this population-level property, however, remain poorly understood.</p><p>The feedback between the behavioral phenotypes of individuals, the collective behaviors that these phenotypes produce, and individual-level fitness consequences has made it challenging to study how complex collective behaviors evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Torney et al., 2011</xref>). Many species, including fish and birds, form groups in which members have low genetic relatedness, which implies that kin selection alone cannot explain the evolution of collective behavior. Moreover, while natural selection acts on the behavioral phenotypes of selfish individuals, collective behaviors are group-level, or perhaps even population-level, properties rather than heritable individual phenotypes. To understand how collective behaviors evolve, then, one must first understand the mapping between individual phenotypes and collective behavior, and between collective behavior and individual fitness.</p><p>Here, we take advantage of detailed studies of the social interaction rules and environmental response behaviors of schooling fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berdahl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katz et al., 2011</xref>) to develop a biologically-motivated evolutionary model of collective responses to the environment. Using analytical methods and evolutionary simulations, we study how individual behavioral rules produce collective behaviors, and how collective behaviors, in turn, govern the fitness and evolution of selfish individuals. To relate individual and collective behaviors to fitness, we consider a fundamental task faced by fish and other motile organisms: finding and exploiting dynamic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stephens et al., 2007</xref>). In our model, individuals respond to the locations of near neighbors and also to local measurements of resource quality. Each individual achieves a fitness determined by the resource level it experiences over its lifetime. We use this framework to explore the evolution of complex collective responses to the environment, and how such responses are related to transitions in collective state.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Model development</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral rules</title><p>We model the movement behaviors of each individual in a population of size <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> using two experimentally-motivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berdahl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katz et al., 2011</xref>) behavioral rules: a social response rule and an environmental response rule. The social response rule is motivated by experimental studies of pairwise interactions among golden shiners (<italic>Notemigonus crysoleucas</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katz et al., 2011</xref>). Individual fish avoid others with whom they are in very close proximity. As the distance between individuals increases, however, interactions gradually change from repulsive to attractive, with maximum attraction occurring at a distance of two-four body lengths. For longer distances, individuals still attract one another but the strength of attraction decays in magnitude (Appendix section 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katz et al., 2011</xref>). As found in experimental studies of golden shiners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katz et al., 2011</xref>) and mosquitofish (<italic>Gambusia holbrooki</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herbert-Read et al., 2011</xref>) there need not be an explicit alignment tendency; rather alignment can be an emergent property of motion combined with the tendencies for repulsion and attraction described above.</p><p>To capture these observed social interactions (or ‘social forces’), we model the acceleration of individuals using a force-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katz et al., 2011</xref>).

In particular, in a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, individual golden shiners respond strongly to local sensory cues by slowing down in favorable regions of the environment, and speeding up in unfavorable regions. In contrast, fish respond only weakly to spatial gradients in environmental quality and instead adjust their headings primarily based on the positions of their near neighbors.

Throughout evolution, populations of social individuals achieve mean fitness values that are approximately five times higher than those of asocial populations, and a coefficient of variation in fitness approximately four times lower than that of asocial individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Notably, a single individual drawn from a population at the ESSt can invade a resident population of asocial individuals and the social strategy quickly sweeps through the population (Appendix section 2). To understand why this invasion occurs, consider a population of asocial individuals that slow down in favorable regions of the environment. If the environment does not change too rapidly, such individuals will accumulate in regions where the resource level is high. This phenomenon has been studied mathematically in the context of position-dependent diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schnitzer, 1993</xref>), and will occur, in general, when individuals lower their speeds in response to the value of an environmental cue. A social mutant that responds to the environment, and to its neighbors, can take advantage of the correlation between density and resource quality by climbing the gradient in the density of its neighbors (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>). In this case, the positions of neighbors contain information about the value of resources and social mutants quickly invade asocial populations leading to a rapid increase in mean fitness (Appendix section 2).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Evolved populations collectively compute properties of the environment</title><p>The high fitness of the evolved phenotype is due, in part, to a collective resource tracking ability, similar to that found in golden shiners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berdahl et al., 2013</xref>). Evolved individuals can find and track resource peaks as they move through the environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>; Materials and methods), whereas asocial individuals and social individuals with trait values far from the ESSt cannot (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>). Tracking occurs via a dynamic process. Individuals near the edge of the peak move rapidly, whereas individuals nearer to the peak center (where the resource value is high) move slowly (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>). As in fish schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berdahl et al., 2013</xref>), individuals turn toward near neighbors (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) and travel toward the peak center. This collective tracking behavior is particularly important when the resource field changes rapidly over time. As a resource peak moves, individuals at its trailing edge experience a resource value that becomes weaker through time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As the resource value becomes weaker, these individuals accelerate (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>), but turn toward neighbors on the peak (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) and thus travel toward the moving peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When the environment contains multiple resource peaks, evolved populations fuse spontaneously to form groups whose sizes correspond to that of the peak they are tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), even though no individual is able to assess peak size, or know whether there are multiple peaks in the environment. This behavior is consistent with recent sonar observations of foraging marine fish showing that fish form shoals that match the sizes of dynamic resource patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertrand et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertrand et al., 2014</xref>).

(<bold><bold>B</bold></bold>) When environments contain multiple resource peaks, evolved populations divide into groups that match peak sizes, e.g., in a two-peak environment, the size of group on each peak is proportional to peak size. Total size of two peaks is constant so that the larger the first peak (Peak 1, x-axis), the smaller the second peak.

It is tempting to conclude that these trait values are determined by the nature of the environment alone. However, the fact that the evolutionary trajectories of social and asocial populations are so different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), suggests that the collective behaviors discussed above strongly influence the outcome of evolution.

For large <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf134"><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, inter-individual distances are large, and individuals move through the environment quickly.

The location of transitions between states depends on the parameters of the social response rule (e.g., number of neighbors an individual pays attention to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf138"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The transitional regimes between these states are reminiscent of the first-order phase transitions that occur in some physical systems, for example at the transition between liquid water and water vapor. As in the liquid-vapor phase transition, transitions in collective state are characterized by strong hysteresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). If the population begins with large <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf139"><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, mean distance to neighbors remains stable for decreasing <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf140"><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and then decreases abruptly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Appendix Figure 9</xref> upper curve). If <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf141"><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is then increased, mean distance to neighbors increases but follows a different functional relationship with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf142"><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, lower curve).

In the hysteresis region, the rate at which groups of individuals form spontaneously (and therefore nucleate a transition from the <italic>dispersed</italic> to <italic>cohesive</italic> state) depends strongly on <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf147"><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>; when <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf148"><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is near the upper bound of the hysteresis region, the time required for a group to form spontaneously is very long (see Appendix section 5.4).

This suggests that the behavior of an individual in this region can be approximated by considering only its interactions with individuals that are on the resource peak (i.e., where density is high). Using this assumption, we derive analytically the rate at which new individuals join (or rejoin) a group on the resource peak (Appendix section 6.5).

In fact, under a time rescaling, our model is equivalent to one in which the relative strength of social forces varies across the environment (Appendix section 4).

The mechanism that promotes this evolution involves the use of public information: when individuals respond to the environment by slowing down in regions of high resource quality – a behavior that is adaptive even in the absence of social interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Appendix Figure 2</xref>) – their positions become correlated with the locations of resources. Social individuals can exploit this public information by climbing gradients in the density of their neighbors. As in simple, game-theoretic models of social foraging (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark and Mangel, 1984</xref>), social individuals gain a fitness advantage by using information about the environment gleaned by observing neighbors. Because of this, asocial populations are readily invaded by social mutants and collective behaviors evolve (Appendix section 2).</p><p>Evolutionarily stable populations occupy a distinctive location in behavioral state space: one in which small changes in individual behavior cause large changes in collective state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). When individuals respond to local environmental cues by accelerating or decelerating, local populations transition between the collective states shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This creates the strong spatial gradient in population density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and allows groups to track dynamic features in the environment rapidly. Perturbations of this evolutionarily stable state cause individuals either to weigh social information too heavily (i.e., small <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf215"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ψ</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and/or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf216"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ψ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), in which case groups fail to explore effectively (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix Figure 7</xref>), or to weigh personal information too heavily (i.e., large <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf217"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ψ</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and/or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf218"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ψ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), in which case individuals fail to exploit the social information that enables dynamic resource tracking (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix Figure 7</xref>). Because of this, mutants with phenotypes far from the evolutionarily stable state are removed from the population by natural selection. The transitions we observe in collective state bear a resemblance to phase transitions in physical systems, and our results lend credence to the hypothesis that natural selection can result in the evolution of biological systems that are poised near such bifurcation points in parameter space.

In our model, populations perform a collective computation through their social and environmental response rules. When individuals are exposed to a heterogeneous resource environment, their responses to the environment cause a modification of the local population density; individuals aggregate in regions where the resource cue is strong. The population performs a physical computation in the formal sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schnitzer, 2002</xref>): physical variables – the positions and relative densities of neighbors – represent mathematical ones – spatially resolved estimates of the quality of resources in the environment. The environments considered in our study bear a strong resemblance to those encountered in dynamic coverage problems in distributed control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bachmayer and Leonard, 2002</xref>), dynamic optimization problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Passino, 2002</xref>), and Monte Carlo parameter estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKay, 2003</xref>). Combining an evolutionary approach to algorithm design with collective interactions may therefore be a useful starting point for optimization schemes or control algorithms for autonomous vehicles, particularly if the structure of social interactions leads to bifurcation points in behavioral parameter space as in the model studied here.</p><p>Understanding the feedback loop between individual behavior, collective behavior of populations, and selection on individual fitness is a major challenge in evolutionary theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guttal and Couzin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Torney et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pruitt and Goodnight, 2014</xref>). Our framework closes this loop and demonstrates how distributed sensing and collective computation can evolve through natural selection on the decision rules of selfish individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s5-1"><title>Resource environment</title><p>Our model of the resource environment incorporates three salient features of the resource environments that schooling fish and other social foragers encounter in nature. These features are: 1) spatial variation in resource quality, 2) temporal variation in resource quality, and 3) characteristic length scales of resource patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stephens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertrand et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertrand et al., 2014</xref>).

individual-based models that include social interactions have often depicted social interactions by assuming that individuals monitor metric 'zones'. Individuals avoid neighbors in a small zone of avoidance, and align and move toward neighbors within larger zones of social interactions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guttal and Couzin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couzin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chou et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we use an alternative model that depicts social interactions as forces that act to modify individuals’ accelerations. This approach is closely related to force matching methods that have been applied to data to infer the strength of pairwise social interactions among individuals. We assume that social forces depend on distance in a way that creates short-range repulsion among individuals, strong intermediate range attraction, and weak attraction for longer ranges in agreement with results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katz et al.

In the context of a homogeneous environment this description can be used to predict the points in parameter space at which the uniform, purely solitary state becomes unstable, and to demonstrate that heterogeneous states cannot be stable at high enough background velocity. Although the continuum description is only an approximation, it is able to qualitatively predict many of the features of our multi-agent simulations, which makes the mechanisms responsible for this behavior mathematically more explicit. In order to derive continuum equations, we begin with a Liouville equation for the probability density of all the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf395"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> particles within the full phase space, and derive a hierarchy of equations by taking moments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flierl et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Born and Green, 1946</xref>). This hierarchy can be closed by assuming that stochastic forces are sufficiently strong to ensure independence of the individual agents.

This leads to extremely low probabilities of critical droplet formation near the transition temperature. In order to test whether this effect is responsible for the hysteresis in our model equations, we performed long time numerical simulations using values of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf508"><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> within the hysteresis region, allowing us to estimate the nucleation rate of the cohesive phase. We performed replicate simulations with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf509"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> agents, restarting the simulations each time the agents were able to form the cohesive state. The results of this simulation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Appendix Figures 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">12</xref>, illustrating the super-exponential growth in the mean nucleation time as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf510"><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> increases.

When <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf511"><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> increases above 1.7, the expected time for nucleating the cohesive state becomes extremely large, leading to strong hysteresis.

We model agents as being either in a cohesive state near a resource peak or in a dispersed state. Using the model parameters and some simple assumptions about the dynamics, we calculate the fraction of particles approaching the resource peak that are able to enter the cohesive state. Using this model, we quantitatively estimate the rate at which agents are able to find the peak and the advantage of social agents versus asocial agents. We begin by stating a number of assumptions, each of which arises from some feature of our multi-agent model, that help make our theoretical analysis tractable.</p><sec id="s34"><title>6.1 Assumptions</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The environmental response function is <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf516"><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>ψ</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>ψ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>, indicating a single peak located at the origin and a preferred background velocity of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf517"><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:msub><mml:mi>ψ</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:msqrt></mml:math></inline-formula> in regions far from the resource peak.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Agents travel at the speed dictated by the environmental response function Ψ, so that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf518"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>Ψ</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:math></inline-formula>.

The model is based on two behavioral rules: a social response rule and an environmental response rule. It is a force-based model, in which the interactions with other agents and the environment are captured in terms of potentials that encode these rules. Parameters that are allowed to evolve include an individual's preferred speed when there is no environmental cue, and the sensitivity of an individual to an environmental cue.</p><p>It is found that the parameters evolve to robust evolutionarily stable states, and these are typically places in parameter space near transitions to other collective states. This allows groups to respond quickly to changes in the environment. It is argued that such changes in the collective state resemble a phase transition in physical systems.</p><p>The manuscript presents an important and substantial advance in understanding the evolution of collective motion of animals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper considers a model for collective motion in the presence of a time-varying resource environment, in which the characteristics of future generations of the agents evolve according to how well the current generation obtained resources.

The authors build up on the relatively well-studied dynamics of non-evolving swarms of interacting particles, introduce important empirically-derived features, and create a comprehensive evolving model which reproduces several common and intuitively-appealing behavioural patterns of such animal groups. In addition to a thorough modeling effort, I especially appreciate the extensive analytic and simplified computational estimates of each important facet of the observed dynamics. Such highly-focused &quot;sub-models&quot; help a reader to verify that the contributions of basic mathematical and biological mechanisms to the rather complex observed phenomenology are understood correctly.</p><p>A major issue that naturally comes to one's mind while reading the manuscript is how the results would be affected by adding a realistic feature of a gradual depletion of well-localized resources by swarming consumers. How a rate of such depletion would affect the evolutionary patterns? In the present form, the manuscript is already loaded with new insights, hence, I think, that a qualitative and perhaps even speculative discussion of this topic would suffice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Minor Comments):</italic></p><p>The analogy to the 1-order phase transition based on the density contrast and hysteresis curve could be developed a step further: In traditional first-order phase transitions the hysteresis is caused by the instability of small-size nuclei of an emerging phase. Could something similar be said about the transition between dispersed and cohesive states?</p><p>The word &quot;criticality&quot; seems to become too fashionable and abused in many not directly relevant contexts. In its true meaning, a critical state and critical point terminate the line of first-order phase transition rather than sits &quot;close to it&quot;. In addition, it is characterized by many unique properties (such as non-analytic behaviour of potentials, scale-free correlations, etc.) which are not mentioned and apparently are irrelevant here. So I would recommend to simply refer to such evolutionary stable state as to one being close to the localized-delocalized transition line.</p><p>Same with the word &quot;computation&quot;, which, in my understanding, describes some mathematical actions.

We observe that agents undergo what appears to be a discontinuous change in local density as a function of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf627"><mml:mtext>Ψ</mml:mtext></mml:math></inline-formula>, so the observed transition more closely resembles a first order phase transition than a second order phase transition. Because of this, we do not expect the kind of power law scaling near the transition point that is a characteristic of second order transitions, and the search for a critical exponent would not be meaningful. On the other hand, hysteresis is a hallmark first order phase transitions so that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and Appendix <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> provide evidence that the analogy to phase transitions is sound. Additionally, we have expanded discussion of the hysteresis behavior present in our model and added additional numerical results (Appendix section 5.4) to further clarify the connection between the behavior of our system and first order phase transitions in physical systems (subheading “Evolved populations are poised near abrupt transitions in collective state”, see also the response to reviewer #2’s comment).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] A major issue that naturally comes to one's mind while reading the manuscript is how the results would be affected by adding a realistic feature of a gradual depletion of well-localized resources by swarming consumers.

In the first alternative scenario, we assumed that individuals deplete the resource very quickly. As one might expect, social cues provide little useful information about the locations of resources when resources are quickly depleted, and as a consequence, the evolutionary trajectories under fast resource depletion resemble those of asocial individuals. Under more moderate levels of resource depletion, however, the evolutionary trajectories shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of the main text are largely unchanged; social individuals evolve to an evolutionarily stable state in which <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf628"><mml:mtext>Ψ</mml:mtext></mml:math></inline-formula>0 values are near the transition point in collective state when the resource is at a low value, and individuals cross the transition shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in regions where the resource value is high. We have added a discussion of these new results to the manuscript (paragraph three, subheading “Evolved populations are poised near abrupt transitions in collective state”).</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Minor Comments):</p><p><italic>The analogy to the 1-order phase transition based on the density contrast and hysteresis curve could be developed a step further: In traditional first-order phase transitions the hysteresis is caused by the instability of small-size nuclei of an emerging phase.
