experiencing durable responses. However, the majority of patients currently do not respond to CBT and the molecular determinants of resistance have not been fully elucidated. Mounting clinical evidence suggests that the clonal status of neoantigens (NeoAg) impacts the anti-tumor T cell response. High intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), where the majority of NeoAgs are expressed subclonally, is correlated with poor clinical response to CBT and poor infiltration with tumor-reactive T cells. However, the mechanism by which ITH blunts tumor-reactive T cells is unclear. We developed a transplantable murine lung cancer model to characterize the immune response against a defined set of NeoAgs expressed either clonally or subclonally to model low or high ITH, respectively. Here we show that clonal expression of a weakly immunogenic NeoAg with a relatively strong NeoAg increased the immunogenicity of tumors with low but not high ITH. Mechanistically we determined that clonal NeoAg expression allowed cross-presenting dendritic cells to acquire and present both NeoAgs. Dual NeoAg presentation by dendritic cells was associated with a more mature DC phenotype and a higher stimulatory capacity. These data suggest that clonal NeoAg expression can induce more potent anti-tumor responses due to more stimulatory dendritic cell:T cell interactions. Therapeutic vaccination targeting subclonally expressed NeoAgs could be used to boost anti-tumor T cell responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neoantigens</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>cross-presenting DC</kwd><kwd>checkpoint blockade</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005190</institution-id><institution>Melanoma Research Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spranger</surname><given-names>Stefani</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007038</institution-id><institution>Lung Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spranger</surname><given-names>Stefani</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 5F31CA261093-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Kim Bich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pew-Steward Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spranger</surname><given-names>Stefani</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard S (1953) and Linda B Stern Career Development Professorship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spranger</surname><given-names>Stefani</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vivo modeling of neoantigen-restricted heterogeneity shows that clonal expression of neoantigens enhances anti-tumor T cell responses by increasing the stimulatory capacity of dendritic cells in the lymph node.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Engaging tumor-reactive immune responses has been an incredibly powerful tool in the fight against cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esfahani et al., 2020</xref>). Cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells recognize peptides on class I major histocompatibility complexes (MHCI) expressed on tumor cells, and following recognition mediate specific lysis of their target cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stinchcombe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isaaz et al., 1995</xref>). While CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can recognize many tumor-associated antigens, peptides specific to tumor cells are best suited to drive the most powerful anti-tumor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schietinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Minati et al., 2020</xref>). Amongst the tumor-specific antigens, the class of so-called neoantigens (NeoAg) is best understood thus far. NeoAgs are predominantly derived from non-synonymous mutations in highly expressed protein coding transcripts within the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schumacher et al., 2019</xref>). It has been shown that patients responding to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBT) often experience an expansion in NeoAg-reactive T cells within tumor-infiltrating T cells, as well as in circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Rooij et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Riaz et al., 2017</xref>). Further, adoptive cell transfer of NeoAg-specific T cells may be beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robbins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verdegaal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gros et al., 2014</xref>) and vaccination can induce objective responses toward tumor-specific NeoAgs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carreno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keskin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johanns et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ott et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The presence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is established as a positive prognostic marker of response to CBT and overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van der Leun et al., 2020</xref>). Over the past years, many studies have aimed to establish a correlation between the presence of NeoAgs and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells within the tumor resulting in findings that increased NeoAg burden is positively associated with T cell infiltration in some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rooney et al., 2015</xref>). Despite enormous efforts, several independent reports suggest that NeoAg load alone cannot predict response to CBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mauriello et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGrail et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Samstein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghorani et al., 2018</xref>). Of note, it seems the prognostic value of NeoAg burden depends on the baseline presence of a T cell infiltrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mauriello et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGrail et al., 2021</xref>). This can be best illustrated in cancer types with high mutational burden, such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and colon cancer. In those cancer types, a sizable proportion of patients lack a productive T cell infiltrate, despite an abundance in predicted NeoAgs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mauriello et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGrail et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spranger et al., 2016</xref>). Past studies have indicated that alterations in tumor cell-intrinsic signaling pathways can mediate poor T cell infiltration, typically by means of poor T cell activation or poor T cell recruitment into the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nguyen and Spranger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lawson et al., 2020</xref>). However, these alterations do not account for all patients failing to respond to CBT while harboring high numbers of predicted NeoAgs. Recent studies suggest that intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), which might be highest in patients with high mutational burden, impacts the responsiveness to CBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGranahan et al., 2016</xref>). Clinical data suggest that clonal NeoAg expression is associated with response to anti-PD-1 CBT in a cohort of patients with NSCLC and with significantly increased overall survival in melanoma patients, following treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGranahan et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, subclonal NeoAg expression in tumors with high ITH was found to be associated with poor CBT responses and poor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration. These observations were confirmed in a transplantable mouse model using subclones derived from a UVB-irradiated murine melanoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While these initial studies strongly suggest that high ITH impairs the anti-tumor immune response, the mechanisms of how the anti-tumor immune response is impaired are still unknown. To interrogate the effect of ITH on anti-tumor T cell responses, we generated a syngeneic transplantable murine lung tumor model that enables us to precisely modulate the degree of ITH using naturally developed NeoAgs. Using two NeoAgs with different degrees of immunogenicity, we elucidated that responses against the weaker NeoAg were potentiated only in the clonal setting. This synergistic effect was established during T cell activation by cross-presenting conventional type I dendritic cells (cDC1), which acquired a more mature phenotype if they presented both antigens. Intriguingly, RNA-based vaccines targeting the weak NeoAg augmented immune responses in tumors with high ITH, highlighting the potential therapeutic value of targeting weakly immunogenic subclonal NeoAgs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cancer cells expressing NeoAgs elicit diverse anti-tumor immune responses</title><p>Next-generation genome sequencing combined with MHCI binding prediction algorithms and in vivo validation have allowed for the identification of bona fide NeoAgs expressed in murine tumor lines including MC38, B16F10, and TRAMP-C1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yadav et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matsushita et al., 2012</xref>).

Strikingly, at days 7 and 10, the T cell response against Aatf was only detectable in mice implanted with KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> tumors and was absent in mice bearing KP-Het<sup>High</sup> or KP<sup>Aatf</sup> tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). At day 14, the Aatf and Adpgk responses were similar in all tested conditions, suggesting mixed effects of tumor size, antigen availability, and loss of functional capacity of T cells over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). The observed enhanced T cell response against a weakly immunogenic NeoAg is also observed when Cpne1 was co-expressed with Adpgk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). We considered the possibility that increasing NeoAg load in a cell could increase immunogenicity by expressing the two weakly immunogenic NeoAgs, Aatf and Cpne1, together. However, this provided no benefit to the Aatf response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Since we observed differences in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration between KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> and KP-Het<sup>High</sup>, we first assessed the number of tumor-infiltrating cDC1. However, while we observed dynamic changes in the absolute numbers of cDC1 over time, no significant difference was found between the two tumor conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Assessing the number of tumor cell debris carrying mCherry<sup>+</sup> cDC1 in the TdLN further affirmed that the differences in T cell activation were not driven by a lack of migratory cDC1 bringing antigen to the TdLN as similar frequencies were detected between the two tumor conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Analysis of the mCherry MFI amongst the mCherry<sup>+</sup> cDC1 similarly showed no significant difference between the KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> and KP-Het<sup>High</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that neither cDC1 recruitment to the tumor, trafficking to the TdLN, nor amount of available antigen can explain the observed differences in T cell activation.</p><p>In the homogeneous KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> setting, it is conceivable that epitope spreading in response to a rapid and strong Adpgk-specific T cell response might lead to an increase in available Aatf antigen as killing of KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> cells would result in release of both Adpgk and Aatf-containing debris. This increase in antigen abundance could explain an increase in activation of Aatf-reactive T cells compared to the KP-Het<sup>High</sup> setting. To test whether antigen availability alone might explain the differences in T cell response, we inoculated mice with lethally irradiated tumor cells using single-antigen-expressing tumor cell lines (KP<sup>Aatf</sup> or KP<sup>Adpgk</sup>), or the KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> and KP-Het<sup>High</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To ensure robust responses, we recalled T cell responses with an equal mixture of purified Adpgk and Aatf short peptides combined with cyclic-di-GMP as an adjuvant 10 d after the initial injection of irradiated tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Then 11 d post recall, T cell responses were assessed using an IFNγ ELISpot assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistent with our previous observations, we observed that the Aatf-specific T cell response was dependent on the context of the NeoAg expression patterns, with greater expansion of Aatf-specific T cells in response to KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> tumor debris compared to either KP<sup>Aatf</sup> or KP-Het<sup>High</sup> tumor debris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, we did observe that the Adpgk response was sensitive to lower antigen availability as mice injected with irradiated KP-Het<sup>High</sup> tumor cells, where only 50% of the cells express Adpgk, also exhibited a significantly reduced expansion of Adpgk-specific T cells in the periphery compared to KP<sup>Adpgk</sup> and KP-Het<sup>Low</sup>, both tumors where all the cells express Adpgk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This result is consistent with previous reports on the correlation between antigen availability and strength of T cell response, where providing less Adpgk debris resulted in a corresponding decrease in the Adpgk-specific response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bullock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westcott et al., 2021</xref>).

To test this notion, we regenerated the KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> cell lines by expressing Adpgk linked at the C-terminus of ZsGreen (ZsG) while Aatf maintained its expression with mCherry establishing KP-Het<sup>Low(ZsG-Adpgk,Aatf)</sup>, and a corresponding KP<sup>ZsG-Adpgk</sup> as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We confirmed that these tumor cell lines recapitulated the previously observed outgrowth kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Given that we established the importance of cDC1 for T cell priming, we focused our analysis on this DC subset and used mCherry and ZsGreen as a readout for tumor cell debris engulfment and antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We first determined the proportion of single-fluorophore or double-fluorophore positive cDC1 in the TdLN at day 7 post tumor implantation and found that in KP-Het<sup>High</sup> tumors most of the cDC1 carrying detectable debris were either mCherry<sup>+</sup> or ZsGreen<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In stark contrast, most tumor cell debris-positive cDC1 found in the TdLN-draining KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> tumors were double positive for both mCherry and ZsGreen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Within the single positive cDC1 subset in both tumors, there was a bias toward ZsGreen<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which could be attributed to the stability of this fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Antigen presentation on dendritic cells in the tumor-draining lymph node mirror antigen expression patterns in the tumor microenvironment (TME).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental schematic for (<bold>B, C</bold>).

We therefore assessed the expression of CD40 and CD80 on single or double fluorophore-positive cDC1 populations in the TdLN. Affirming our initial hypothesis, we observed significantly greater expression of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80 in double-positive cDC1 compared to mCherry<sup>+</sup> cDC1 that engulf only Aatf-containing debris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). CD40 expression was comparable between Adpgk-ZsGreen<sup>+</sup> and double-positive cDC1, while CD80 was highly expressed on both these cDC1 populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), suggesting that the Adpgk-specific T cell response might induce upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules. In sum, these findings suggest that the antigen-dependent interaction between cDC1 and Adpgk-specific T cells could result in increased activation (‘licensing’) of cDC1, and subsequently, an increased capacity of cDC1 to prime Aatf-reactive T cells, if the same cDC1 also presents the weaker NeoAg.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Prophylactic RNA vaccination expands Aatf-specific T cells and increases response of heterogeneous tumors to CBT</title><p>Clinically, a high degree of ITH is associated with poor responses to CBT. To determine whether our established model system faithfully recapitulated resistance to therapy, we inoculated KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> or KP-Het<sup>High</sup> in C57BL/6 mice and treated mice with dual CBT, consisting of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies on days 7, 10, 13, and 16. Consistent with clinical observations, our model showed that KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> tumors could be fully controlled following therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, KP-Het<sup>High</sup> tumors, engineered to resemble tumor with high ITH, showed mixed responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Therefore, we aimed to determine whether prophylactic vaccination might increase tumor control of KP-Het<sup>High</sup> tumors in the context of dual CBT. Mice were vaccinated with self-amplifying RNA (replicons) encased in a lipid nanoparticle administered intramuscularly (i.m.) and boosted i.m. 2 wk after the initial dose.

Our analysis of the cDC1 compartment in tumors with clonal NeoAg expression further suggested that CD40:CD40 ligand interactions would enhance induction of Aatf-reactive effector T cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies have shown that CD40 stimulation could induce strong systemic anti-tumor responses leading to regression of tumors in preclinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Mierlo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sandin et al., 2014</xref>), and it has also been shown to synergize with CBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westcott et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morrison et al., 2020</xref>).

Understanding how ITH weakens anti-tumor immunity will enable the development of rational therapies for patients with ITH and increase response rates in patients treated with immunotherapy. We utilized a reductionist approach to study the effect of heterogeneous NeoAg expression on the resulting anti-tumor immune response in a transplantable mouse tumor model. By comparing NeoAgs expressed in subclonal or clonal settings, we discovered that immune responses against poorly immunogenic NeoAg were enhanced when clonally expressed with a strong NeoAg. Mechanistically, we identified that subclonal expression of NeoAgs resulted in presentation of peptides on distinct populations of cross-presenting cDC1, which showed lower expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD40, if presenting only a peptide with a low-binding affinity. Therapeutic vaccination against weak NeoAgs demonstrated synergy with CBT only when the first dose was administered along with an anti-CD40 agonist antibody. In sum, our data suggest that while subclonally expressed NeoAgs elicit weaker anti-tumor T cell responses against less immunostimulatory peptides, these poorly immunogenic peptides may still be viable candidates for therapeutic vaccination in combination with targeted DC maturation.</p><p>In tumors with low ITH, we observed migratory cDC1 carrying both antigens to the TdLN. These cDC1 showed higher expression levels of the co-stimulatory ligands CD40 and CD80 compared to cDC1 carrying only the weak NeoAg. It is possible that the difference in tumor debris carried by the cDC1 could result in different interactions with T cells against the stronger NeoAg in the TdLN. Our observation of increased CD40 on cDC1 carrying immunogenic NeoAg is consistent with the concept of DC licensing, where a DC carrying both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> epitopes is being ‘licensed’ by the helper T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu and Murphy, 2022</xref>). Recent work demonstrated that cDC1 can be licensed by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which induce a more mature phenotype via interaction of CD40 with CD40L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu and Murphy, 2022</xref>). By inducing a more mature phenotype, ‘licensed’ cDC1 were found to have a greater ability to prime the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response. Further, it was shown that CD40 expression alone on cDC1 results in a more robust expansion of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, further evidence that increased expression of CD40 might directly impact priming of tumor-reactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferris et al., 2020a</xref>). In our model, cDC1 presenting Adpgk or both antigens expressed more CD40 than cDC1 carrying Aatf debris. This association between CD40 levels and presence of Adpgk on cDC1 suggests that potent CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells could act in a similar manner as CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cell responses and enhance the stimulatory capacity of DCs. Additional work is needed to delineate transcriptional changes and the timing of these changes on these populations for greater mechanistic insights.</p><p>Our data thus far can exclude that the observed effect was primarily driven by epitope spreading, the resulting differences in antigen availability or tumor growth kinetics, as changes in NeoAg-specific T cell responses were preserved following implantation of lethally irradiated tumor cells expressing a single NeoAg or clonal or subclonal NeoAgs in tumors expressing two NeoAgs. While the more immunogenic Adpgk NeoAg response was dependent on the NeoAg load, we observed that the weaker Aatf response was significantly greater in mice implanted with irradiated KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> cells compared to cohorts injected with the same amount of antigen without a strong NeoAg (KP<sup>Aatf</sup>). This result highlights the importance of the context under which a NeoAg is expressed.</p><p>For the selection of potent NeoAgs, much emphasis has been placed on the binding affinity of the NeoAg peptide to MHC and the relative binding to its wildtype counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schumacher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verdegaal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gubin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duan et al., 2014</xref>). However, these predictions focus on high-affinity NeoAgs in isolation and not on functional immunogenicity. It was recently shown that antigen dominance can dampen anti-tumor immunity in the context of two peptides with similar strong binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burger et al., 2021</xref>). Therapeutic vaccination against the sub-dominant NeoAg enhanced anti-tumor immunity. In our system, however, we observe that the antigen with the higher affinity (Adpgk; 4.3 nM) did provide ‘help’ rather than competition for binding of H2-Db with the Aatf antigen with a lower affinity of 90 nM. While we did observe that the Adpgk response was dominant, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kotturi et al., 2008</xref>), we also saw a greater expansion of both NeoAg-specific responses when both antigens were clonally expressed. This observation suggests a therapeutic potential for thus far unused NeoAgs with a lower binding affinity to MHC. It is interesting to note that Aatf was first identified as a potential NeoAg, but was described to be unlikely immunogenic due to its mutant amino acid being located near the carboxy terminus of the peptide, therefore less likely to bind with the TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yadav et al., 2014</xref>). Our finding underscores the importance of validation of NeoAg immunogenicity in vivo. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the importance of studying NeoAgs with highly variable immunogenicity as this might preclude detrimental effects of immunodominance between multiple high-affinity NeoAgs. This might be especially important clinically as the NeoAg landscape in patients currently does contain peptides with predicted weaker affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luksza et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We developed therapeutic regimens to enhance an Aatf-specific response in KP-Het<sup>High</sup> tumors that was comparable to what we observed in KP-Het<sup>Low</sup>. This therapy comprised antigen-specific vaccination, anti-CD40 and CBT while neither dual combination was sufficient. This observation suggests that to eradicate a heterogeneous tumor harboring weak and subclonal NeoAgs requires (1) boosting an antigen-specific response, (2) enhancing the productive priming response by providing co-stimulation, and (3) preventing T cell exhaustion by CBT. Our results mirror those from other preclinical models which showed CD40 agonism and CBT synergizing in treating mice with colon tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westcott et al., 2021</xref>) and significant prolonged survival in a pancreatic cancer model treated with a DC vaccine paired with CD40 agonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lau et al., 2020</xref>). For optimal translation into clinical practice, it will be critical to determine which antigen-specific T cell responses would benefit the most from CD40 agonism and determine how the observed synergy between weak and strong NeoAgs can be exploited best in a vaccine setting. Given the importance of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the role to license DC, it will likewise be critical to decipher the differences between CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> helper responses, as discussed above. Another consequence of DC licensing is that mature DCs can produce chemokines to facilitate recruitment of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, thereby increasing the likelihood of interacting with cognate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to activate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castellino et al., 2006</xref>). This notion is highly consistent with our observation that Aatf-reactive T cells are detectable at earlier timepoints when expressed homogeneously compared to the heterogeneous NeoAg expression pattern. Future studies employing tools to detect NeoAg-presentation on cDC1 and identification of NeoAg-reactive T cells in situ will be needed to understand how spatial organization of these cells affects the priming response. While our observations are predominately focused on the initial priming of a NeoAg T cell response, cDC1-mediated re-stimulation of effector T cells is also a critical feature in the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spranger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gardner et al., 2022</xref>). However, within the tumor the expression patterns of NeoAg will likely be even more critical as spatial analysis of the tumor suggests the formation of areas of clonal growth, resulting in patches of NeoAg expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milo et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, in tumors with heterogeneous NeoAg expression, cDC1 will consequently only present NeoAg from surrounding tumor cells, thus limiting the stimulatory potential for tumor-infiltrating T cells. It is plausible that this process might accelerate the induction of terminal T cell exhaustion.</p><p>In sum, our study provides critical mechanistic insights into how heterogeneous NeoAg expression mediates weaker anti-tumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Our work underscores the necessity of improving prediction of functional NeoAg immunogenicity in a patient-specific context, considering ITH, expression level, and binding affinity. Understanding these parameters, their dependencies, and their collective impact on the functional immunogenicity of each NeoAg has the potential to expand the number of actionable NeoAgs for targeted vaccination. The model we developed is a powerful preclinical tool for these future studies with more complex modeling of tumors that better reflect the clinical situation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 were purchased from Taconic Biosciences and Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Batf3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and bred in-house.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Pramod K Srivastava as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ehsan Ghorani (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are some issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. It is often unclear what the figures show. Figures5 and 6: what are those red and blue circles? Are they HetHigh? Why not say so? What are the dirty yellow cells? These are basic rules of having a legend that tells what is what. A reader can guess, but that should not be the standard of scientific writing.</p><p>2. At other times, the rationale of the experiment, the experiment itself, and its interpretation are all unclear. Figure 3E-G are an example. The authors certainly understand their experiments; they just don't communicate it.

The manuscript relies of IFNγ production by splenocytes to measure immune responses against defined neoantigens. These measures are used to infer anti-cancer efficacy of reactive clones, but this is potentially problematic. This issue is actually nicely demonstrated by the results presented here: in Figure 1C, KP-Aatf growth is retarded vs KP-control, but in 1D this difference is lost in Rag KO mice……thus suggesting that either an anti-Aatf immune response was partially effective or that KP-Aatf harbours some other targets. By using IFNγ as the major readout and ignoring the fact this may be unreliable to measure anti-cancer efficacy, the reader is left unclear as to whether control of Het-low tumours is related to enhanced activity of anti-Adpgk, anti-Aatf or some other clone. A more convincing/definitive evaluation would be to adoptively transfer splenocytes from tumour bearing mice into animals bearing relevant tumours to show that tumour control can be achieved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript has significant shortcomings.</p><p>1.

The Discussion is unhelpfully verbose. Most of it focuses on excessive speculation and hypothesizing and distracts from the important observation of the study and its mechanism. It could be significantly abbreviated and focused. Importantly, far too many citations are careless, in that they overinterpret what has actually been published. These need to be corrected.</p><p>4. The title does not convey the message of the paper adequately.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a nice piece of work in many ways, but overall, the manuscript doesn't converge on the question originally posed: why are immune responses less effective against tumours with high ITH? Partly, this arises because the study explores both ITH and immunogenicity. I think the manuscript could be refocussed around the main findings which bear on epitope spreading. Additionally, some of the experimental approaches have important limitations and certain conclusions may be difficult to justify. I hope the following comments are helpful.</p><p>1. Cell lines may be different in ways other than neoantigen modification.</p><p>It is difficult to be certain that the multiple KP lines developed here are identical other than the modifications described. I agree they appear to have similar growth in Rag2 KO mice (it would be good to show growth of all the cell lines on one plot for comparison), but other differences in immunogenicity/immune evasion may be relevant and under explored. I am reassured that the two versions of Het-low appear to have similar growth characteristics, but note these are not identical! This supports the notion that subclones may harbour uncharacterised differences.</p><p>2. Measures of immunogenicity.</p><p>The manuscript relies of IFNγ production by splenocytes to measure immune responses against defined neoantigens. These measures are used to infer anti-cancer efficacy of reactive clones, but this is potentially problematic. This issue is actually nicely demonstrated by the results presented here: in Figure 1C, KP-Aatf growth is retarded vs KP-control, but in 1D this difference is lost in Rag KO mice……thus suggesting that either an anti-Aatf immune response was partially effective or that KP-Aatf harbours some other targets.</p><p>By using IFNγ as the major readout and ignoring the fact this may be unreliable to measure anti-cancer efficacy, the reader is left unclear as to whether control of Het-low tumours is related to enhanced activity of anti-Adpgk, anti-Aatf or some other clone. A more convincing/definitive evaluation would be to adoptively transfer splenocytes from tumour bearing mice into animals bearing relevant tumours to show that tumour control can be achieved.</p><p>3. DC maturation and CD4 responses.</p><p>A conclusion presented here is that &quot;CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against abundant, high affinity antigens can enhance CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against lower affinity NeoAgs by increasing the stimulatory capacity of cDC1&quot;. The suggestion that the CD8 epitope itself is relevant to DC maturation is not safe without considering the alternatives. In particular, the role of CD4 epitopes within the neoantigen sequence needs to be considered/discussed. Several studies have previously shown CD4 responses are frequently obtained from neoantigen vaccines.</p><p>4. IFNγ recall, DC maturation and tumour growth dynamics.</p><p>Aatf IFNγ recall is enhanced in Het-low vs Het-high bearing mice, but these are shrinking vs growing tumours. Could tumour growth dynamics rather than anti-Aatf responses be relevant here? This goes back to my point above of a more definitive experiments to show Aatf directed anti-cancer effects are enhanced.</p><p>A similar point may be relevant to Figure 4D/E: are differences in DC CD40/CD80 expression related to comparison of shrinking vs growing tumours? It isn't fully clear what cell lines were used to generate these data however.</p><p>5. Therapy.</p><p>The final figures turn to the question of whether immune responses against a subclonal/poorly immunogenic neoantigen can be boosted. But the experiments do not follow clearly on from what the study has established up to this point: that clonal co-expression of Adpgk and Aatf results in stronger immune responses against the latter. Specifically, do the authors suggest that triple therapy (Aatf vaccination/anti-CD40/checkpoint blockade) exploits the antigen spreading effect they have established?</p><p>A limitation is that the Het-high model bears no clonal neoantigens; incidentally, this is not representative of human cancers since even the most heterogenous tumours appear to harbour these (for instance, see the 2017 TRACERx NEJM paper). A more realistic model would be to mix Het-low with KP-Adpgk, in order to recreate both clonal (Adpgk) and subclonal (Aatf) neoantigens in a single tumour. The authors could then more cleanly explore their notion that subclonal targeting can be therapeutically beneficial through exploitation of epitope spreading from clonal/strong to subclonal/weakly immunogenic targets.</p><p>Finally, it is rather unclear what CD40 agonism is actually doing: does it specifically alter cDC1 biology in this model? It seems necessary to show data on the effects of anti-CD40 on cDC1 biology here. The final figure suggests that vaccine+anti-CD40 is equivalent to anti-CD40 alone: how does this fit with the data presented up to this point? Perhaps testing in a more realistic model of clonal/subclonal mutations will shed light on this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85263.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are some issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1.

In respect to the example, one conceivable explanation for increased response in KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> is epitope spreading towards Aatf following an Adpgk response.

The manuscript relies of IFNγ production by splenocytes to measure immune responses against defined neoantigens. These measures are used to infer anti-cancer efficacy of reactive clones, but this is potentially problematic. This issue is actually nicely demonstrated by the results presented here: in Figure 1C, KP-Aatf growth is retarded vs KP-control, but in 1D this difference is lost in Rag KO mice……thus suggesting that either an anti-Aatf immune response was partially effective or that KP-Aatf harbours some other targets. By using IFNγ as the major readout and ignoring the fact this may be unreliable to measure anti-cancer efficacy, the reader is left unclear as to whether control of Het-low tumours is related to enhanced activity of anti-Adpgk, anti-Aatf or some other clone. A more convincing/definitive evaluation would be to adoptively transfer splenocytes from tumour bearing mice into animals bearing relevant tumours to show that tumour control can be achieved.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this shortcoming of our studies. We agree with the reviewers’ assessment that the addition of Aatf induces some level of immune response and we apologize should we suggest the opposite. Aatf-only cells in fact have a non-zero response as assessed by ELISpot (Figure 2D). However, we observe that this immune response is not sufficient to contribute to a meaningful immune-mediated protection. We have entertained other means of monitoring the effector function of NeoAg responsive T cell responses, such as in vivo killing assays. However, the differences in antigen density due to different binding kinetics make such assays difficult to compare between antigens. Likewise, we had technical difficulties to optimize reliable multimer staining. Hence, we have opted for the ELISpot assay as the most robust assay.

At other times, the rationale of the experiment, the experiment itself, and its interpretation are all unclear. Figure 3E-G are an example. The authors must certainly understand their experiments; they just don't communicate it.

Partly, this arises because the study explores both ITH and immunogenicity. I think the manuscript could be refocussed around the main findings which bear on epitope spreading. Additionally, some of the experimental approaches have important limitations and certain conclusions may be difficult to justify. I hope the following comments are helpful.</p><p>1. Cell lines may be different in ways other than neoantigen modification.</p><p>It is difficult to be certain that the multiple KP lines developed here are identical other than the modifications described. I agree they appear to have similar growth in Rag2 KO mice (it would be good to show growth of all the cell lines on one plot for comparison), but other differences in immunogenicity/immune evasion may be relevant and under explored. I am reassured that the two versions of Het-low appear to have similar growth characteristics, but note these are not identical! This supports the notion that subclones may harbour uncharacterised differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that intraclonal heterogeneity is a strong driving factor impacting anti-tumor immunity. To exclude this feature from our studies we subcloned the KP parental cell line and identified a very stable clone which we called KP6S. We used this subclone to generate all subsequent cell lines used in this study. There may be minor differences in immunogenicity as we cultured the transduced KP6S lines, but we aimed for minimal contribution of tumor cell intrinsic differences affecting the immune response.

DC maturation and CD4 responses.</p><p>A conclusion presented here is that &quot;CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against abundant, high affinity antigens can enhance CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against lower affinity NeoAgs by increasing the stimulatory capacity of cDC1&quot;. The suggestion that the CD8 epitope itself is relevant to DC maturation is not safe without considering the alternatives. In particular, the role of CD4 epitopes within the neoantigen sequence needs to be considered/discussed. Several studies have previously shown CD4 responses are frequently obtained from neoantigen vaccines.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that consideration of the CD4 response is critical. We have generated multiple fusion sequences and repeatedly observed the increased immunogenicity of KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> tumors. The MHC-II epitope prediction analyses varied, identifying potential binders in some constructs and none in others. These are prediction analyses, so we cannot conclude definitively that the constructs themselves do not contain a unique CD4 epitope within the neoantigen sequence. However, we don’t expect these CD4 sequences, if they exist, to be maintained across the various constructs we used in this study, yet we still observe this increased response in the KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> tumor cell lines.</p><p>Furthermore, we regenerated the lines expressing Adpgk and Aatf to express the NeoAgs on separate constructs in order to characterize the dendritic cells draining from the tumor. With these new lines we established tumors that express the same exact sequences whether in KP-Het<sup>High</sup> or KP-Het<sup>Low</sup>. We expect these two tumors to express the same CD4 epitopes as they have been transduced with identical constructs. The recapitulation of the phenotype that we observed with these new lines (Supplemental Figure 7A-B) suggests that any existing CD4 response, that would be shared by both tumors, is insufficient to contribute to a robust anti-tumor response in KP-Het<sup>High</sup> tumors.</p><p>Thus, for the here shown study we solely focused on MHCI-driven responses. We agree that the established model system would be uniquely positioned to study the contribution of CD4 epitopes to an anti-tumor immune response, yet we believe this is beyond the scope of the work here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. IFNγ recall, DC maturation and tumour growth dynamics.</p><p>Aatf IFNγ recall is enhanced in Het-low vs Het-high bearing mice, but these are shrinking vs growing tumours. Could tumour growth dynamics rather than anti-Aatf responses be relevant here? This goes back to my point above of a more definitive experiments to show Aatf directed anti-cancer effects are enhanced.</p><p>A similar point may be relevant to Figure 4D/E: are differences in DC CD40/CD80 expression related to comparison of shrinking vs growing tumours? It isn't fully clear what cell lines were used to generate these data however.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that tumor size can contribute to the responses we observe. In order to rule out differences in tumor kinetics contributing to the immune response we injected mice with lethally irradiated KP-Het<sup>High</sup> and KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> and assessed immunity. In this case the tumor burden is similar between the two groups before both are completely cleared. Even in this setting where the tumor kinetics are very similar the most robust response is observed in mice injected with irradiated KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> tumors.</p><p>The cell lines used to generate Figure 4D-E used were the new ones referred to in the text in the relevant section, Suppl. Figure 7B. We have modified Figure 4A by labeling the general cell lines used in this study to better match the text. We also edited the figure legend to specify the lines used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Therapy.</p><p>The final figures turn to the question of whether immune responses against a subclonal/poorly immunogenic neoantigen can be boosted. But the experiments do not follow clearly on from what the study has established up to this point: that clonal co-expression of Adpgk and Aatf results in stronger immune responses against the latter. Specifically, do the authors suggest that triple therapy (Aatf vaccination/anti-CD40/checkpoint blockade) exploits the antigen spreading effect they have established?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out our data indeed suggest the triple therapy can induce a robust anti-tumor response observed in in mice bearing KP-Het<sup>High</sup> tumors. Clonal co-expression of both neoantigens does result in a more robust response of both NeoAg-specific T cells and upstream of that, changes to cDC1 maturation. We sought to use these results to develop an effective therapy for KP-Het<sup>High</sup> tumor-bearing mice. We focused on specifically augmenting the Aatf response by including anti-CD40 with the vaccine. All combined therapies are in clinical trials or approved thus enabling seamless translation of our findings into the clinic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A limitation is that the Het-high model bears no clonal neoantigens; incidentally, this is not representative of human cancers since even the most heterogenous tumours appear to harbour these (for instance, see the 2017 TRACERx NEJM paper). A more realistic model would be to mix Het-low with KP-Adpgk, in order to recreate both clonal (Adpgk) and subclonal (Aatf) neoantigens in a single tumour. The authors could then more cleanly explore their notion that subclonal targeting can be therapeutically beneficial through exploitation of epitope spreading from clonal/strong to subclonal/weakly immunogenic targets.</p><p>Finally, it is rather unclear what CD40 agonism is actually doing: does it specifically alter cDC1 biology in this model? It seems necessary to show data on the effects of anti-CD40 on cDC1 biology here. The final figure suggests that vaccine+anti-CD40 is equivalent to anti-CD40 alone: how does this fit with the data presented up to this point? Perhaps testing in a more realistic model of clonal/subclonal mutations will shed light on this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for making this point and for the experimental suggestions. Indeed, the clinical cases are likely more complicated than what we have modeled here. The intent of the paper is not to study more subtle changes in ITH as a tumor evolves and the resulting impact on the immune response and vice versa, which is beyond the scope of our study. Rather, we aimed to minimize the impact of other mechanisms of immune evasion in order to study two extremes of ITH as it pertains to NeoAg expression patterns and identify differences in the immune response. The goal of reducing complexity in this model becomes a limitation as the reviewer pointed out.</p><p>However, by using this model we were able to identify differences in cDC1 maturation markers between KP-Het<sup>High</sup> and KP-Het<sup>Low</sup> tumors. It is still unknown in our model if CD40 engagement is necessary to induce stronger anti-tumor responses and experiments to answer these questions are outside the scope of our work. Instead, we focused on CD40 upregulation in KP-HetLow tumors as an indication of enhanced DC function and a potential dial to manipulate DC function. We targeted CD40 by treating tumor-bearing mice with agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies. We agree that further studies of the downstream impact of CD40 agonism on cDC1 will be critical to better understand if CD40 signaling is necessary or sufficient for optimal anti-tumor responses.</p><p>The reviewer also pointed out that vaccine+anti-CD40 is equivalent to anti-CD40 alone. The results are not unexpected. In treatment, when a tumor is already present, raising a tumor-specific response may be insufficient if the tumor reaches a certain size. The additional challenge of T cell exhaustion is especially relevant. The data suggests that broadly targeting the immune response (anti-CD40 alone, anti-CD40+CBT, CBT alone) and specifically directing the immune response toward a certain epitope (replicon alone, anti-CD40+replicon) were both insufficient to see tumor control in KP-Het<sup>High</sup>. Instead, specifically targeting a weakly immunogenic tumor neoantigen and preventing exhaustion of that response was key to tumor control.</p><p>We believe our model is a valuable tool that can be modified to study more complex tumors that better match the clinical data. In fact, we have since generated more complex NeoAg setting which match the clinical setting. The obtained immune profiling is highly complex and far beyond the scope of the study shown here, yet the mechanism discovered here of synergy between strong and weak NeoAg responses remains preserved.</p></body></sub-article></article>
