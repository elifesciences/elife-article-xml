transporters (GLUT) control organism-wide blood-glucose homeostasis. In human, this is accomplished by 14 different GLUT isoforms, that transport glucose and other monosaccharides with varying substrate preferences and kinetics. Nevertheless, there is little difference between the sugar-coordinating residues in the GLUT proteins and even the malarial <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> transporter <italic>Pf</italic>HT1, which is uniquely able to transport a wide range of different sugars. <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 was captured in an intermediate ‘occluded’ state, revealing how the extracellular gating helix TM7b has moved to break and occlude the sugar-binding site. Sequence difference and kinetics indicated that the TM7b gating helix dynamics and interactions likely evolved to enable substrate promiscuity in <italic>Pf</italic>HT1, rather than the sugar-binding site itself. It was unclear, however, if the TM7b structural transitions observed in <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 would be similar in the other GLUT proteins. Here, using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the fructose transporter GLUT5 spontaneously transitions through an occluded state that closely resembles <italic>Pf</italic>HT1. The coordination of <sc>D</sc>-fructose lowers the energetic barriers between the outward- and inward-facing states, and the observed binding mode for <sc>D</sc>-fructose is consistent with biochemical analysis. Rather than a substrate-binding site that achieves strict specificity by having a high affinity for the substrate, we conclude GLUT proteins have allosterically coupled sugar binding with an extracellular gate that forms the high-affinity transition-state instead. This substrate-coupling pathway presumably enables the catalysis of fast sugar flux at physiological relevant blood-glucose concentrations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fructose transport</kwd><kwd>mechanism</kwd><kwd>MD simulations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drew</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drew</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delemotte</surname><given-names>Lucie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computational approach shows that the occluded state in GLUT transporters is equivalent to the transition state of soluble enzymes and this has the highest affinity for the substrate sugar.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glucose transporters (GLUT) facilitate the rapid, passive flux of monosaccharides across cell membranes at physiologically relevant concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 50 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mueckler and Thorens, 2013</xref>). In human, most GLUT isoforms transport D-glucose, but with different kinetics, regulation, and tissue distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mueckler and Thorens, 2013</xref>). For example, GLUT1 is a ubiquitously expressed transporter with saturation by D-glucose around 5 mM to maintain blood-glucose homeostasis, whereas the liver isoform GLUT2 is saturated at ~50 mM, enabling a high flux of glucose after feeding-induced insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thorens, 2015</xref>). Others, like GLUT4, are localized to intracellular vesicles, but will traffic to the plasma membrane of adipose and skeletal muscle cells in response to insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang and Czech, 2007</xref>). GLUT5 is the only member thought to be specific to <sc>D</sc>-fructose, and is required for its intestinal absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Douard and Ferraris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kayano et al., 1990</xref>). In this process, glucose is actively absorbed by sodium-coupled glucose transporters, while <sc>D</sc>-fructose is taken up passively by GLUT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koepsell, 2020</xref>). GLUT5 must therefore efficiently transport <sc>D</sc>-fructose at high sugar concentrations (<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> = 10 mM), whilst still maintaining sugar specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koepsell, 2020</xref>). It is poorly understood how GLUT proteins retain strict sugar specificity and how sugars are able to catalyze large conformational changes when they bind to GLUT proteins with weak (mM) affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>). As gate keepers to metabolic re-programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ancey et al., 2018</xref>), answers to these fundamental questions could have important physiological consequences for the treatment of diseases, such as cancer and diabetes.</p><p>GLUT transporters belong to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS), whose topology is defined by two six-transmembrane (TM) bundles connected together by a large, cytosolic loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>). Within the MFS, GLUT proteins belong to a separate subfamily referred to as sugar porters, which are distinct from other well-known sugar transporters such as LacY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pao et al., 1998</xref>). Sugar porters are subclassified based on a unique sequence motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maiden et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>), and crystal structures reveal that this motif corresponds to residues forming an intracellular salt-bridge network, linking the two bundles on the cytoplasmic side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2015</xref>).

Whilst GLUT proteins are made up from two structurally similar N-terminal (TM1–6) and C-terminal (7–12) bundles, structures have shown that glucose is not coordinated evenly, but almost entirely by residues located in the C-terminal bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, residues in the half-helices TM7b and TM10b make up a large fraction of the sugar-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>). The current working transport model is that the half-helices TM7b and TM10b undergo local conformational changes in response to sugar binding and control substrate accessibility to its binding site from the outside and inside, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, upon sugar binding from the outside, the inward movement of the extracellular gating helix TM7b is followed by the outward movement of TM10b, and the subsequent breakage of the cytoplasmic inter-bundle salt-bridge network, enabling the two bundles to move around the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>). In the inward-facing state, TM10b moves fully away from TM4b, sugar exits, and the protein spontaneously resets itself to the outward-open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Resetting back through an empty-occluded state is rate limiting and ~100-fold slower than via a loaded-occluded intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mueckler and Thorens, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lowe and Walmsley, 1986</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic highlighting the GLUT structural features and their major conformations in the transport cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural overview of a sugar porter, GLUT5 (PDB:4ybq).

(<bold>B</bold>) Schematic conformational cycle a sugar porter will undergo, based on currently available protein structures. Briefly, moving clockwise from top middle, the transporter will receive a sugar in the outward-open state (PDB:4ybq) (i). The transporter then undergoes a partial occlusion of the extracellular gate (outward occluded, ii, PDB:4zw9), followed by full occlusion (iii, PDB:6rw3). Once both gates are fully shut, the inner gates begin to open (inward occluded, iv, PDB:4ja3) where the salt-bridge residues begin to lose contact. Finally, the salt bridges are fully broken apart in an inward-open state (v, PDB:4yb9), and the sugar can be released into the cell. The transporter will then go through the same motions in reversed order in the absence of sugar to reset to the outward-open state (vi–viii). (<bold>C</bold>) The extracellular gate is formed by TM1b and TM7b half-helices, and the intracellular gate is formed by TM4b and TM10b half-helices. Residues defining these gates are shown as spheres. In the outward-open state (left), the extracellular gate is open, and intracellular gate is shut. In the inward-open state (right), the opposite occurs.

Nonetheless, <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 is very distantly related to GLUT proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and while GLUT proteins show strict sugar specificity, <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 transports a wide range of different sugars, making it unclear whether this occluded state would constitute a good representative of occluded state in GLUT proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Woodrow et al., 1999</xref>).

Based on the position of TM7b and biochemical analysis, it was concluded that the extracellular gating helix had evolved to transport many sugars, rather than the sugar-binding site itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>). Simply put, it was proposed that <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 was less selective in what sugars it transports as its extracellular gate shuts more easily. Whilst the allosteric coupling between TM7b and the sugar-binding pocket might be more pronounced in <italic>Pf</italic>HT1, we hypothesized that the fundamental basis for sugar coupling should be conserved in the GLUT proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>).

We thus selected to focus our efforts on the <sc>D</sc>-fructose transporter GLUT5 for two reasons. Firstly, GLUT5 is the only GLUT protein with structures determined in both outward- and inward-open conformations, which principal component analysis of <italic>n</italic> = 17 sugar porter structures, confirmed represents the two end states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>). Secondly, how non-glucose sugars are recognized by GLUT proteins is unknown, and a computational framework for a <sc>D</sc>-fructose-specific transporter would help to understand substrate specificity more broadly.</p><p>Initially, to fill in the ‘missing’ GLUT5 conformational states, homology models of <italic>rat</italic> GLUT5 were generated using relevant structures as templates: outward-occluded (<italic>human</italic> GLUT3), occluded (<italic>Pf</italic>HT1), and inward-occluded (<italic>E. coli</italic> XylE) and inward-open <italic>bison</italic> GLUT5 (Methods). To assess the stability of the generated homology models, hundreds of nanoseconds-long MD simulations on each of these models were performed in a model POPC membrane bilayer (Methods, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Each model was stable during the simulation, with a slightly higher root mean squared deviation (RMSD) in fully occluded, inward-occluded, and inward-open models, likely reflective of their intrinsic dynamics in absence of substrate as well as ICH mobility when the N- and C-terminal bundles are no longer held together by salt bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We attempted to apply machine learning methods selection for the selection of collective variables (CVs), as well as several steering methods using said CVs but we were unable to obtain proper state transitions or free energy surface (FES) convergence using these approaches (Methods). After a considerable number of attempts, we decided to select CVs for the string-of-swarms method based on the gating helices TM7 and TM10, which structural studies had shown were important to the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>) and to use TMD to generate an initial pathway interpolating between states (a more detailed discussion of this can be found in Methods and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

characterize the most probable transition pathway linking the outward- and inward-open states, and calculate the FES lining this pathway. To this end, we used the string-of-swarms method for GLUT5 both in its apo (rGLUT5<sup>empty</sup>) and <sc>D</sc>-fructose-bound (rGLUT5<sup>fructose</sup>) conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleetwood et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, each of the five different structural models was represented as beads along a string, with a further 11 beads added from configurations extracted from the TMD, yielding in total 16 beads spanning a tentative initial pathway defined in terms of their intra- and extracellular gate distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). From each of these beads, many short trajectories were launched (swarms) to iteratively seek an energy minimum along the string path (see Methods). In this approach, the string simulations converge when the string diffuses around an equilibrium position. This protocol has proven effective to sufficiently explore computational space for complex conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleetwood et al., 2020</xref>). After ~100 iterations, the strings had converged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), indicating that an equilibrium position was found. Nevertheless, we continued to run another ~450–650 iterations to ensure exhaustive sampling of the entire transition pathway, enabling an appropriate estimation of the free energy along the converged path.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The free energy landscape of GLUT5 with and without d-fructose bound</title><p>Once the strings had converged and equilibrium was reached, we calculated FESs based on the transitions of all equilibrium swarm simulations (see Methods). Comparing the FESs between these two conditions reveals obvious differences between rGLUT5<sup>empty</sup> and rGLUT5<sup>fructose</sup> simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). In the absence of <sc>D</sc>-fructose, the outward-open state is the most energetically favorable, with higher energy barriers to either occluded or inward-facing states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This calculation is consistent with experimental observations for the related XylE transporter, for which the outward-facing state is the most populated in the absence of sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jia et al., 2020</xref>). The FES of GLUT5<sup>empty</sup> is also consistent with structures that have shown that the strictly conserved salt-bridge network is only present on the cytoplasmic inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>), stabilizing the outward-facing state; single-point mutations to the salt-bridge network residues have indeed been shown to arrest GLUT transporters in the inward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schürmann et al., 1997</xref>). In the presence of sugar, the inward-facing states become accessible and are of similar energetic stability to the outward-facing states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The heights of the free energy barriers between outward and inward-facing states in presence and absence of substrate, respectively, are consistent with measurements of GLUT kinetics, as rates have been shown to be 100-fold faster for substrate bound than for empty-occluded transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mueckler and Thorens, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lowe and Walmsley, 1986</xref>). In other words, we can directly see the effect of substrate binding on sugar-induced conformational changes.</p><p>In the presence of <sc>D</sc>-fructose, the occluded state model of GLUT5 is exactly positioned between the two energetically favorable outward- and inward-facing states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Consistent with a transition state, the occluded state model is located on the highest energetic barrier along the lowest energy pathway between the two opposite-facing conformations. Moreover, transition into the occluded state from the outward states is energetically unfavorable for GLUT5 without sugar, but the presence of <sc>D</sc>-fructose clearly lowers the activation barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). These calculations are also consistent with the fact that GLUT transporters are required to spontaneously reset to the opposite-facing conformation through an empty-occluded transition after sugar release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>), that is gate rearrangements, forming intermediate states, must also be able to spontaneously close in the absence of sugar.</p><p>To further assess the stability of the conformational states described in the free energy landscape, we further launched unbiased molecular dynamics simulations from various energy wells depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> (see Methods). These simulations tended to drift from their local energy wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), often not converging into free energy minima. We reasoned that if this drift in the landscape was due to the selection of the CVs, that projections of these controls in other CV spaces should remain in an energy minima. We therefore calculated energy landscapes using other state-defining features as CVs, and subsequently projected the unbiased simulations onto these landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>). The simulations converged into their own or a neighboring energy well in these projections, indicating that the conformations from enhanced sampling are reliable. Taken together, and based on the overall differences in the free energy landscapes between rGLUT5<sup>empty</sup> and rGLUT5<sup>fructose</sup> simulations matching experimental observations, we conclude that the free energy landscapes represent a physiologically relevant GLUT5 conformational cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Conformational stabilization of <sc>D</sc>-fructose coordination in the occluded state</title><p>Since the presence of <sc>D</sc>-fructose lowers the energetic barriers between outward- and inward-facing states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), we reasoned that we should be able to extract the molecular determinants for <sc>D</sc>-fructose coordination in the occluded state from these simulations. Based on extensive biochemical data and the glucose-bound <italic>human</italic> GLUT3 structure, we know that D-glucose is transported with the C1-OH group facing the bottom of the cavity (endofacial) and the C6-OH group facing the top (exofacial) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnett et al., 1975</xref>). It is expected that <sc>D</sc>-fructose will be likewise transported by GLUT5 with the C1-OH group facing the endofacial direction, since substituents to <sc>D</sc>-fructose were better tolerated when added to the C6-OH position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tatibouët et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). <sc>D</sc>-fructose was unconstrained during TMD and string simulations. To evaluate the conformational heterogeneity of <sc>D</sc>-fructose, we binned the energy landscape, extracted configurations corresponding to each bin, and then clustered the <sc>D</sc>-fructose poses for these ensembles of configurations (see Methods). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, in the outward-open and outward-occluded conformations, <sc>D</sc>-fructose does not display any preferential binding mode, and the C1-OH group has no preferential orientation (brown sphere). In contrast, in the occluded state, the sugar becomes highly coordinated, adopting a single well-defined binding pose in approximately 65% of conformations that is ninefold more populated than the next most abundant pose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>, Methods, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).

The mutation of S391 to alanine in <italic>rat</italic> GLUT5 has been shown to weaken <sc>D</sc>-fructose binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>).

Hydrogen bonding to Q166 is thought to be a critical interaction required for transport, as it is the only N-terminal bundle residue seen to coordinate D-glucose in sugar-bound structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). Unexpectedly, the TM7a glutamine residues Q287 and Q288 coordinating the C2- and C3-OH groups of D-glucose in GLUT3 and other members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>), are not forming direct hydrogen bonds with <sc>D</sc>-fructose in the GLUT5 simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, D</xref>). We find, however, that the most highly coordinated waters in the MD simulations are located between Q287 and Q288 and <sc>D</sc>-fructose, which are within hydrogen-bond distance to the C2-OH and C3-OH groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4 structures, the bulky TM10 tryptophan residue directly coordinates the C1-OH group of D-glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>). GLUT5, however, lacks the TM10 tryptophan, and this residue is replaced by A395 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). It appears that S391 in TM10 is instead forming the C1-OH hydrogen-bond interaction, which was unexpected. The interaction between the S391 in TM10 and the C1-OH moiety means that Q287 side chain would be too far away to directly coordinate the C2-OH group of <sc>D</sc>-fructose. Although this would make the C2-OH less well coordinated, this reasoning is consistent with biochemical analysis. Specifically, GLUT5 can transport 2,5-dihydromannitol with similar kinetics to <sc>D</sc>-fructose, which is a sugar that is identical to the furanose form of <sc>D</sc>-fructose, but lacks the C2-OH group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, <sc>D</sc>-fructose epimers that differ by the orientation in any of the other –OH groups are thought to be unable to bind, since they do not display any cold competition for <sup>14</sup>C-<sc>D</sc>-fructose uptake when added to cells expressing <italic>human</italic> GLUT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Upon superimposition of all the major conformations along the GLUT transport cycle, the TM7b asparagine (N293) was shown to be the only sugar-coordinating residue significantly changing its position during the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because the TM7b asparagine residue is strictly conserved in all GLUT transporters and related sugar porters, it was proposed that the recruitment of the TM7b asparagine is a key and generic interaction required for coupling sugar binding with extracellular TM7b gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>). Consistently, in the simulations, the TM7b asparagine (N293) is also well positioned to coordinate the C4-OH group of <sc>D</sc>-fructose in the fully occluded state, and generally maintains hydrogen-bond distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, D</xref>). In addition to the TM7b asparagine (N293), a TM7b gating tyrosine (Y296) also forms an interaction to a histidine residue (H386) in TM10a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Both the TM10a histidine (H386) and the TM7b tyrosine (Y296) are unique to GLUT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>) and GLUT5 variants H386F, H386A, and Y296A have been shown to severely diminish <sc>D</sc>-fructose binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>). The TM7b tyrosine (Y296) appears to also interact with an asparagine residue (N324) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which is also generally within hydrogen-bond distance to the C6-OH group of <sc>D</sc>-fructose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

All GLUT5 variants were unable to transport D-glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The H386F and S391G mutations are particularly informative, as the corresponding residues do not participate in coordination of D-glucose in the glucose-bound GLUT structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>).

In all inward-facing states, the gating helix TM7b remains at a sharp angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>). Structural information suggests that the stabilization of TM7b via the asparagine coordination to a substrate sugar would induce TM7b to transition from a bent to a broken-helix conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>). To assess this structural transition, we compared the angle formed by TM7b throughout both rGLUT5<sup>empty</sup> and rGLUT5<sup>fructose</sup> simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Consistently, we observe that TM7b comparatively forms a sharper angle earlier in the transport cycle when sugar is present, indicating that indeed the conformational state of TM7b is connected with sugar recognition, and suggesting a mechanism whereby <sc>D</sc>-fructose binding induces transition into the occluded states. The angle of TM7b further decreases upon transition into the occluded state to fully shut the outside gate.</p><p>GLUT transporters harbor two strictly conserved tyrosine residues in TM7b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>) (Y297 and Y298), which form the substrate occlusion in the outward-occluded conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>Pf</italic>HT1, TM7b residues are considerably more polar and the TM7b tyrosine residues have been replaced by serine and asparagine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 mutations of TM7b gating residues were found to be just as critical to transport as residues coordinating D-glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, TM7b variants retaining transport competence shifted the substrate preference of <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 from D-glucose toward <sc>D</sc>-fructose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>). It was, thus, proposed that <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 had not evolved the sugar-binding site to be able to transport many sugars, but its extracellular gate. In MD simulations of GLUT5, the TM7b tyrosine residue Y296 that formed an interaction with H386, is located next to these occlusion-forming Y297 and Y298 residues. In most other GLUT isoforms, Y296 is a phenylalanine, and so to assess this interaction further we measured transport of an Y296F and the double H386F, Y396F variant. Consistent with the H386 required for <sc>D</sc>-fructose, coordination the double H386F, Y396F variant showed no transport activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly, the single Y296F variant retained robust <sup>14</sup>C-<sc>D</sc>-fructose transport with an ~40% improved performance (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Upon closer inspection, we find that the TM7b tyrosine is a phenylalanine residue in around 30% of more distantly related GLUT5 homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, independent co-evolution analysis corroborates that Y296 and H386 residues are forming an interaction in the occluded state of GLUT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mitrovic et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, in yeast-based forward-evolution screens of hexose transporters, the equivalent residue to Y296 in TM7b was the only single-residue-variant uncovered with a shifted substrate preference from D-glucose toward <sc>D</sc>-xylose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>). It is possible that the divergence of the TM7b residue from phenylalanine to tyrosine has evolved so that GLUT5 can transport an as yet, unidentified sugar in some tissues, which has been speculated previously, since GLUT5 is expressed in tissues with very low circulating levels of <sc>D</sc>-fructose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Douard and Ferraris, 2008</xref>).</p><p>To further demonstrate the importance of coupling between TM7b and the sugar-binding site, we combined single-point mutations that individually abolished <sc>D</sc>-fructose transport (H386F, S391G, and A395W) with the TM7b variant (Y296F). Interestingly, the combined variant is now re-able to transport <sc>D</sc>-fructose transport with ~40% wildtype activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), although it is still unable to transport D-glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Given the already low affinity (10 mM) of <sc>D</sc>-fructose for wildtype GLUT5, we are unable to measure kinetics of this combined variant under the current experimental setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saudea et al., 2022</xref>). Nonetheless, the much higher accumulation observed above background indicates multiple turnover events. Thus, whilst the GLUT5-binding site has evolved to specifically coordinate <sc>D</sc>-fructose, there is enough plasticity in the sugar-binding pocket that can allow for alternative interactions when combined with differences to extracellular TM7b gating residues, that is, as was recently concluded by analysis of the malarial parasite transporter structure <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>). So far, however, fully shifting sugar preferences from the natively preferred substrate to a different sugar remains elusive, and it is unlikely that mutations to the TM7b gating region are enough. For example, GLUT5 variants of the gating tyrosine Y297N and Y298S, constructed to match the more polar TM7b in the promiscuous transporter in <italic>Pf</italic>HT1, abolished <sc>D</sc>-fructose transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We expect that variants to influence global bundle dynamics, in addition to extracellular gating differences, are likely required.</p><p>Extracellular TM7b gate closure in the occluded conformation must somehow trigger the breakage of the intracellular salt-bridge network on the inside in order for the two bundles to come apart. The mutational analysis of sugar-binding residues supports the modeled <sc>D</sc>-fructose, which implies that the substrate sugar stabilizes both the closure of TM7b as well as an interaction with TM10a. MD simulations shows that when TM10a becomes locked in place by interaction with the substrate sugar, TM10b is able to move more independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>), which is facilitated by a very mobile GPXPXP helix-break motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the simulations, we see that the TM7b angle decreases from about 140 degrees to about 115 degrees without any noticeable change in TM10b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, as the TM7b angle reaches 115 degrees in the occluded state, TM10b undergoes a large shift in position. Interestingly, the salt-bridge residues, particularly those located between TM4 and TM11, do not fully break apart until TM10b has finished rearranging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B, C</xref>). This would indeed be consistent with the coordinated coupling between the inward movement of TM7b triggering the outward movement of TM10b to break the inter-bundle salt-bridge network.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>GLUT transporters are often presented as text-book examples of how small molecule transporters are functional equivalents of soluble enzymes. Yet, despite extensive kinetic, biochemical, and physiological analysis, we have a poor understanding of how GLUT structures fit into such a molecular description. Here, for the first time, we can confirm that the occluded state structure of <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>) provides a suitable template for modeling the transition state in a GLUT transporter. The classical description of enzyme catalysis is that there is relatively weak binding of the substrate to the enzyme in the initial state, but a tight binding in the transition state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henzler-Wildman and Kern, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klingenberg, 2005</xref>). This conceptual framework implies that in GLUT proteins the sugar would bind more tightly to the transition state, which would be consistent with the Induced Transition Fit of transport catalysis proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klingenberg, 2005</xref>. More specifically, in the occluded state, we find that TM7b is broken over the sugar-binding site to better coordinate <sc>D</sc>-fructose. The fundamental difference between enzymes and transporters is that the structure of the transition state determines the activation barrier for global conformational changes in transporters, whereas in enzymes, the barrier is imposed by substrate remodeling in the transition state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klingenberg, 2005</xref>). Here, we indeed observe that the energy barrier for conversion between states is clearly lowered by the coordination of <sc>D</sc>-fructose. It is worth mentioning, that we have focused on the role of the sugar coupling in influx rather than efflux, because the affinities for D-glucose are reported to be 10-fold lower on the inside in other GLUT transporters and homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cloherty et al., 1996</xref>) and salt-bridge formation between the two bundles was more difficult to model (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>By measuring GLUT1 kinetics at different temperatures, an activation barrier (Ea) of around 10 kcal/mol has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lowe and Walmsley, 1986</xref>). This relatively low activation barrier roughly corresponds to the breakage of a few salt bridges, which matches the expectation for the intracellular salt-bridge-rich GLUTs. The D-glucose-binding energies have been estimated to be around 9 kcal/mol for GLUT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liang et al., 2018</xref>), which is consistent with sugar binding required to generate the global transitions by inducing formation of the occluded state. Although the transition state represents the highest energetic barriers between opposite-facing conformations in MD simulation of GLUT5, the height of the activation barrier cannot be reliably calculated from our simulations for several different reasons. Firstly, the energy barriers are estimated along a path that describes structural transitions in the extra- and intracellular gates, rather than all conformational changes across the entire protein, that is, whilst the CVs allowed us to explore the entire transport pathway, different CVs that more accurately separate metastable states are required, which we have explored in an accompanying work using co-evolution analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mitrovic et al., 2022</xref>). Secondly, our models consider a membrane bilayer made from POPC lipids, whereas it is well established that transport by GLUT proteins requires the presence of anionic lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saudea et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hresko et al., 2016</xref>). The fact that the activation barrier for GLUT1 has been shown to increase from 10 to 16 kcal/mol in liposomes made from lipids with longer fatty acids highlights just how sensitive GLUT proteins are to the lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carruthers and Melchior, 1984</xref>). Here, we chose to use a neutral lipid composition to avoid complications related to the anticipated time scales needed to equilibrate a complex bilayer. Importantly, the coordination of <sc>D</sc>-fructose in the occluded state is consistent with previous biochemical analysis, the coordination of D-glucose, and the GLUT5-proteoliposome assays carried out here.</p><p>The asparagine residue located in the beginning of TM7b (N293) is conserved across the entire sugar porter superfamily, and is the only sugar-coordinating residue significantly changing its position during the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>). Our simulations show that N293 is recruited to coordinate <sc>D</sc>-fructose in a similar manner to D-glucose, and we propose that the TM7b asparagine N293 is a generic interaction required for coupling the binding of any transported monosaccharide sugar with the extracellular TM7b gate. Indeed, all TM residues in <italic>human</italic> GLUT1 has been substituted to cysteine in a cysteine-less GLUT1 variant, which has wildtype activity in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mueckler and Makepeace, 2009</xref>). The mutation of the TM7b asparagine in <italic>human</italic> GLUT1 to cysteine was one of just a few residues showing less than 10% wild-type (WT) activity. It is worth noting that in the proteoliposome setup the N293A mutant in GLUT5 is not completely inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and we are investigating whether the TM7b gate for this mutant can still (inefficiently) close under efflux conditions, that is the signal would therefore be accumulation from oppositely orientated GLUT5.</p><p>Once TM7b has been stabilized by a substrate sugar via N293, the closure of TM7b is influenced by residues along the length of TM7b. In the promiscuous sugar transporter <italic>Pf</italic>HT1, the strictly conserved TM7b gating tyrosine residues found in GLUT1–14, have been replaced by serine and asparagine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>). These more polar residues enable closing of the outside gate more easily and play a role in catalyzing transport of different sugars. In contrast, GLUT5 is a highly specific sugar transporter and has a finely tuned extracellular TM7b gate. More specifically, upon TM7b gate closure, the tyrosine residue Y296 preceding the ‘YY’ motif forms a unique pairing to a histidine residue peripheral to the sugar-binding site (H386). The histidine can interact both with the TM7b tyrosine as well as hydrogen bond to an asparagine residue interacting with <sc>D</sc>-fructose (N324). It is critical that we observe a connection between the sugar-binding site and the TM7b tyrosine residue, which is located at the region wherein the TM7b helix transitions from a bent to a broken helix in the occluded state. The importance of TM7b was also observed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> xylose symporter XylE. Whilst XylE binds D-glucose in the same manner and with the same affinity as in <italic>human</italic> GLUT3, the XylE protein is incapable of transporting the sugar, that is, D-glucose is a dead-end inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farwick et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mutation of the residue corresponding to the TM7b tyrosine in XylE (L297F) together with a sugar-binding site mutant (Q175L), enables XylE to transport D-glucose while retaining 75% of WT <sc>D</sc>-xylose transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Madej et al., 2014</xref>). Illustrating the importance of the TM7b gate, we have been able to reconstruct a GLUT5 sugar-binding site with individually ‘dead’ mutants that can recover <sc>D</sc>-fructose transport when combined with the mutagenesis of an TM7b gating residue. Taken together, our work strengthens the proposal that TM7b should be considered as an extension of the sugar-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that the molecular determinants for sugar transport are an intricate coupling between an extracellular gate, a sugar-binding site, and an intracellular salt-bridge network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Weakly binding sugars are able to induce large conformational changes in GLUT proteins by conformational stabilization of a transition state that can already be spontaneously populated. Rather than a substrate-binding site that achieves strict specificity by having a high affinity for the substrate, GLUT proteins have allosterically coupled sugar binding with an extracellular gate that forms the high-affinity transition-state instead. Presumably, this substrate-coupling pathway ensures that sugar binding does not become rate limiting, and so enables GLUT proteins to catalyse fast sugar flux at physiological relevant blood-glucose concentrations in the mM range. The recent type 2 diabetes drug empagliflozin in complex with the sodium-coupled glucose transporter SGLT2, demonstrates how selective inhibition was achieved by the aglycone of the glucoside inhibitor interacting with the mobile TM1a-b and TM6a-b half-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niu et al., 2022</xref>). In many aspects, while GLUT proteins are referred to as rocker-switch proteins, their asymmetric binding mode gives rise to gating elements closely resembling the structural transitions seen in rocking-bundle proteins, like SGLT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2021</xref>). Such an intricate coupling indicates that pharmacological control of GLUT proteins might best be accomplished by small molecules targeting gating regions extending from the sugar-binding site.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein modeling</title><p>Residue numbing for rGLUT5 is based on the UNIPROT entry of rGLUT5: P43427, all generated models begin at residue E7 and end at residue V480.

Attempts to generate an initial pathway for the strings included using adiabatic biased molecular dynamics simulations and steered molecular dynamics with several sets of CVs. These initial simulations yielded conformations that were not fully representative of their target state in dimensions other than the CVs. These resulted in FESs from string simulations that kept a clear memory of the starting configuration. For this reason, TMD was chosen as a protocol for generating an initial pathway. As this protocol uses a protein’s entire cartesian coordinates as a CV, it has the benefit of generating an initial string in which at least five points along the string were likely to be close to a local minimum along the transport pathway (as structures had been determined for GLUT5 or related sugar porters in these states).</p><p>TMD was performed in a stepwise fashion between states to ensure that the initial string would cover the determined sugar porter conformational space observed thus far. Four main TMD protocols were used: rGLUT5<sup>empty</sup> Outward open – Inward open, rGLUT5<sup>empty</sup> Inward open – Outward open, rGLUT5<sup>fructose</sup> Outward open – Inward open, and rGLUT5<sup>fructose</sup> Inward open – Outward open.</p><p>TMD was performed using GROMACS version 2019.5 patched with PLUMED version 2.5.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tribello et al., 2014</xref>). Each TMD condition was performed in a stepwise, iterative fashion. The first TMD run of each of the four conditions was performed biasing stepwise, either the outward-open structure or inward-open homology model toward the respective targets, the outward- or inward-occluded models. All structures and models used, be it as a starting point or as a target for the TMD, are from unequilibrated (not from the aforementioned MD) structures/models, to ensure that the TMD was not generated from a local minima distant from a desired state. The positions of all heavy atoms were biased in a geometric space with incrementally increasing harmonic restraints, initially starting at 0 kJ/mol/nm and increasing to 2500 kJ/mol/nm at step 5000. After 5000 steps, the force applied was squared every 150,000 steps until the heavy atom RMSD of the system was within about 0.05 nm of their target conformation. After this was achieved, the final frame of the TMD run was used to generate the next TMD run’s input model for each condition. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> details each TMD run length, starting and ending conformations for each condition, and the RMSD of the final TMD timepoint.</p><p>For rGLUT5<sup>fructose</sup> TMD runs, beta-D-fructofuranose was placed in the outward-open structure or inward-open model based on the positioning of glucose in hGLUT1 (4pyp)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2015</xref>) after structural alignment with the models in PyMol version 2.5.0.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Randy B Stockbridge as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Krishna D Reddy (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. To show that the differences between the free energy landscapes in Figures 2E and 2F are meaningful, the authors should report a statistical error analysis on the free energy landscapes, for example by calculating the latter with different subsets of the simulation data and evaluating the standard error.</p><p>2. Other than statistical errors, the reviewers are also concerned that there may be systematic errors due to slow protein motions and sidechains rearrangements that do not properly equilibrate during the simulation time scale (generating hysteresis). Hence, additional validation of the reliability of the calculated landscapes must be performed. If systematic errors are very high, the free energy landscape would reflect high energy (unphysical) conformations, which are typically present if the initial structures are generated with targeted molecular dynamics (TMD), as in this work. Therefore, the authors should show that conventional MD simulations are compatible with the free energy landscape. If systematic errors are indeed confirmed by the authors, unfortunately, this might entail redoing /redesigning the free energy landscape calculations. Conversely, if the controls show that systematic errors are not large, it would be sufficient that the authors discuss them, together with the potential pitfalls of using a small number of collective variables (just two were used, while in other applications by different authors, these were over ten).</p><p>The reviewers' specific concerns with regard to hysteresis/systematic errors include:</p><p>a) The fact that simulations convergence depends on the direction (outward-to-inward vs inward-to-outward; the authors describe limitations of inward open to outward open simulations in regards to salt bridge distances) indeed strongly suggests the presence of significant hysteresis/systematic errors. Namely, the lack of reversible formation and disruption of salt-bridges might have artificially over-stabilized outward-facing states (as landscapes are only for outward-to-inward direction).</p><p>b) If the free energy landscape in Figure 2E is correct, the reviewers would expect the green fuzzy area (inward open/inward occluded) should have at least overlapped with the blue area (fully occluded). This may indicate that either the MD simulation is too short, in which case the authors should elongate it until equilibration into the closest free energy minimum, or the free energy landscape is not correct.</p><p>c) The fact that the inward open X-ray structure is a high energy conformation in the free energy landscape in Figure 2E (bottom right triangle; X-ray structure is without substrate) is also concerning since one would expect it to be in the energetically feasible region (within 2-3 kcal mol from a main free energy minimum) unless the X-ray structure is not a functional state, which seems unlikely.</p><p>3. The authors should provide a more detailed description of the computational analysis and/or associated citations. In addition, the authors should provide further details on homology models and simulations based on the latter: number of models generated, criteria to select the final model, side chain refinement prior to simulation, quality scores, etc.</p><p>4. The authors should provide additional justification as to why the MD simulated outward-occluded state deviates so highly from the starting model. Are there AlphaFold models, or simulations from other groups, that agree with this inconsistency? Alternatively, is the 'crystallized' state stable in the presence of monoolein?</p><p>5. The D-fructose concentration tested in the assays was far below the Km (6uM compared to 10 mM), further complicated by unknown Km values of the mutants. This complicates the interpretation of the relative activities since the activity will be highly dependent on substrate concentration. The authors should consider this caveat in their discussion of the mutant activity.</p><p>6. The authors should provide additional discussion or clarification on several points related to the experimental results for the mutants.</p><p>a. While the 'quadruple' mutant result is impressive and informative, it is difficult to infer firm conclusions from the data and model presented. It might be expected that this mutation should convert GLUT5 into a glucose transporter – yet this mutant is unable to transport glucose.</p><p>b. Could the elevated rate for Y296F (and the quadruple mutant) simply be more efficient salt-bridge breaking?</p><p>c. If the authors have tested mutation of the YY motif to SN in GLUT5, it would be informative and interesting to know the result regardless of the outcome, in order to understand whether specificity is encoded by this motif alone, or by more complex global interactions.</p><p>d. The importance of N293 and its large conformational change was mentioned a few times. Could the authors include a supplementary figure showing how this residue in particular moves to engage with the substrate in the occluded state? Is there anything to the bimodal distribution of distances to the substrate seen in Figure 3D?</p><p>e. There is clearly some activity in the N293A mutation, suggesting that this residue (and thus the interaction with the sugar) is not 'required' for transport. In fact, the MD simulations would support this, as the broken helix state can be visited in the absence of substrate. Thus, the authors should rephrase this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I would like to see some additional justification as to why the MD simulated outward-occluded state deviates so highly from the starting model. Are there AlphaFold models, or simulations from other groups, that agree with this inconsistency? Alternatively, is the 'crystallized' state stable in the presence of monoolein?</p><p>2. The authors nicely demonstrate the coordination of the substrate binding site, and that a tightly conserved N residue in TM7b (that coordinates with the substrate sugar) appears to induce the broken helix conformation and thus the occluded state. Though these conclusions are generally supported by the experimental data, I have some concerns about the conclusions:</p><p>– There is clearly some activity in the N293A mutation, suggesting that this residue (and thus the interaction with the sugar) is not 'required' for transport. In fact, the MD simulations would support this, as the broken helix state can be visited in the absence of substrate. Thus, the authors should rephrase this point.</p><p>– The D-fructose concentration tested in the assays was far below the Km (6uM compared to 10 mM), further complicated by unknown Km values of the mutants. Thus, I do not think it is appropriate to overly interpret relative activities from initial rates and would suggest the authors use more careful language when referring to these results.</p><p>– While the 'quadruple' mutant result is impressive and informative, I find it difficult to infer firm conclusions from the data and model presented. It almost seems as if the objective was to convert GLUT5 into a glucose transporter – yet this mutant is unable to transport glucose. Furthermore, could the reason for elevated transport in Y296F (and the quadruple mutant) simply be more efficient salt-bridge breaking?</p><p>– I assume the authors have tested the mutation of the YY motif to SN in GLUT5. If this mutation was tested, it would be informative and interesting to know the result regardless of the outcome. Is specificity encoded by this motif alone, or are more complex global interactions required for promiscuity?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Currently reported simulation data do not conform to quality standards for publication. In particular, the authors should report an error analysis on the free energy landscapes, for example by calculating the latter with different subsets of the simulation data and evaluating the standard error. Provided the free energy landscapes are converged, free energy minima should correspond to locally stable conformations in conventional MD simulations, hence additional validation of the reliability of the calculated landscapes must be performed also using the latter technique. A good example that the authors could follow and cite, with appropriate quality standards, is Lev et al., PNAS 2017, E4158-E4167, which is also based on the string method with swarms of trajectories and in which the free energies were also obtained from the transition matrix.</p><p>The authors reported that they also obtained the free energy in a similar manner but they neither described in detail the methodology nor they cited any reference in this regard, therefore the results are currently not reproducible. A detailed description thereof and/or associated citations must be provided.</p><p>The authors should provide further details on homology models and simulations based on the latter: number of models generated, criteria to select the final model, side chain refinement prior to simulation, quality scores, etc.</p><p>The authors mentioned that to model efflux was more difficult because of salt bridge formation. A possibility to solve this issue is to increase the number of variables used in the string method, including for example a variable describing salt-bridges formation and disruption. In the previously mentioned reference for example the authors used tens of collective variables rather than just two as in this work. In this regard, the authors should at least discuss the potential issues of a low-dimensional representation.</p><p>Assuming the free energy landscapes are reasonably well converged, a suggestion to improve the impact of this work is to obtain the same landscapes with bound glucose, so as to assess how GLUT5 is less selective towards the latter than fructose. Namely, if the alternating access transition in the empty transporter is rate limiting, occlusion with glucose ought to be significantly destabilized with respect to fructose and in this manner, the authors could effectively demonstrate that substrate occlusion controls selectivity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Determinants of sugar-induced influx in the mammalian fructose transporter GLUT5&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Although these controls are summarized in the methods of the updated manuscript, it is also desirable that the manuscript text be expanded upon to include the following information, which is currently reported only in the response to the reviewers: (1) a description of the drifts observed during conventional MD simulations and (2) the justification described in the response to reviewers. (Namely, that those drifts may reflect the fact that the collective variables used for the free energy landscapes might be very sensitive to small structural fluctuations.)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript entails significant improvements over the previous version. Namely, statistical errors have now been calculated and reported in the manuscript.

One remaining issue is that the new controls reported do not rule out the presence of systematic errors in the free energy landscape. In particular, some of those show that unbiased simulations drift out from free energy minima, while ideally they should show equilibration in a local minima across all relevant collective variables.</p><p>This notwithstanding, I understand the complexity of modeling conformational transitions in membrane transporters and the stochastic nature of short conventional simulation (which the authors have clearly outlined).</p><p>Despite the possible presence of systematic errors, the controls and validations done by the authors seem to indicate that the difference between the free energy landscapes of empty versus bound transporter is meaningful, which together with the structural interpretation and biochemical experiments is the most important result of this work.

Other than statistical errors, the reviewers are also concerned that there may be systematic errors due to slow protein motions and sidechains rearrangements that do not properly equilibrate during the simulation time scale (generating hysteresis). Hence, additional validation of the reliability of the calculated landscapes must be performed. If systematic errors are very high, the free energy landscape would reflect high energy (unphysical) conformations, which are typically present if the initial structures are generated with targeted molecular dynamics (TMD), as in this work. Therefore, the authors should show that conventional MD simulations are compatible with the free energy landscape. If systematic errors are indeed confirmed by the authors, unfortunately, this might entail redoing /redesigning the free energy landscape calculations. Conversely, if the controls show that systematic errors are not large, it would be sufficient that the authors discuss them, together with the potential pitfalls of using a small number of collective variables (just two were used, while in other applications by different authors, these were over ten).</p></disp-quote><p>Ideally, one would run unbiased MD simulations. We initially tried to do this using the string method, but the protein would keep on getting stuck in local minima. After about 1.5 years into the project, we came to the conclusion that biased simulations were needed as the conformational changes required were just too large to sample the different states in the time scales of the unbiased simulations. We initially tried a machine learning-based approach to finding the right CVs to connect different states, unsuccessfully. In the end, we decided to base our CVs on the gating helices as both biochemical and structural data show they should be important. We then combined these targeted MD simulations with string simulations to obtain less biased trajectories.</p><p>The choice of CVs inherently represents a dimensionality reduction that means a loss of resolution or accuracy. In this project, we were more concerned that the CVs are good enough to model the conformational ensemble along the transport pathway to answer our question of interest, i.e. the coupling between sugar binding and transport. We are very excited by our results as well as that MD simulations were sensitive enough to study a transporter with a low substrate affinity of 10 mM. The outcome from our MD simulations has more than exceeded our expectations: we can see changes in the free energy landscape when D-fructose is included and we can even follow sugar binding and gating and it provides the first clear evidence that the occluded state is a high-affinity state that is equivalent to the transition state in enzymes. Moreover, it was very satisfying to see that Q287 was not contributing to hydrogen bonding of D-fructose, as this is the only position where the loss of an OH group in D-fructose is tolerated. That is, the only other sugar (in addition to D-fructose) that can compete for radioactive D-fructose uptake is 2,5-dihydromannitol, which is a sugar lacking an OH group in the C2 position<sup>1</sup>. More recently, we have now obtained the structure of PfHT1 in complex with the D-fructose analogue 2,5-dihydromannitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Although the PfHT1 sugar binding site is different from GLUT5, we indeed see a very similar binding pose of D-fructose coordination to GLUT5 to our MD simulations. We are in the process of writing up this structure in a separate paper, but also think our computational and biochemical approach is sufficient enough to support our conclusions without it.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of PfHT bound to 2,5 anhydro-D-mannitol.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84808-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In addition to these observations, which independently validate our methodological development, we complement our manuscript with the following technical sections that review the internal consistency of our method. Below we discuss our experience with hysteresis during the project, compatibility of the energy landscapes/ conformations generated from the enhanced sampling with conventional MD, and the use of our collective variables.</p><p>Conformation stability from enhanced sampling simulations</p><p>The states generated by the energy landscape are stable conformations representing conformations that GLUT5 visits during its transport cycle. To validate this, we took frames from each low energy well and measured state-defining features to assess each well. We expect that a state defining feature for a proper energy well will be distinguishable from other states’ wells, and that the distribution within these wells will be narrow. Figure 2 —figure supplement 7 depicts the probability distribution of such features for conformational ensembles extracted from free energy minima. The TM7b angle, TM10b RMSD, and average salt-bridge distance for well 3 correspond to those of the inward occluded or inward open homology models (dotted lines), and are distinguishable from the more outward-facing states. The distributions are also relatively narrow, indicating that the conformations spanning the free energy well are not degenerate.</p><p>Compatibility of energy surfaces with initial simulations</p><p>If we consider the original conventional MD simulations performed from the homology models (Figure 2B), projecting snapshots extracted from the final 100ns of each simulation (to account for system equilibration) on top of the rGLUT5<sup>empty</sup> free energy surface computed from the string of swarms simulations reveals that the simulations sample the energy landscape appropriately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). This is especially important to note for the inward-facing energy wells, as if hysteresis was present as a result of the TMD pushing from outward open to inward open, the free energy surface would likely deviate far from the original MD distribution in CV space. An exception to the compatibility of these simulations with the free energy surfaces is the inward-occluded simulations, which will be discussed in detail later in this response.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Overlay of initial simulations with the rGLUT5<sup>empty</sup> energy surface.</title><p>The last 100ns of each simulation is shown as a small colored dot, 1 dot per nanosecond, the initial conformation of the homology model in the larger colored dot.

One would expect that conventional MD simulations do not drift out of an energy well if the conformation is stable and if the collective variable is sufficient in describing energy minima. As Figure 2 —figure supplement 8B and C show, in the IC/EC gate space, the control simulations drift out of their respective energy wells. If this is due to the problem of hysteresis generating unfavorable or unrealistic inward facing conformations, given that the TMD simulation were initiated in the outward facing state, then this should be specific to the inward-facing states, while outward-facing states should stay stable in their wells. Therefore, three positive controls were launched for the outward-facing states (Figure 2 —figure supplement 8A) with the same protocol. Surprisingly, we also observed that the outwardfacing simulations did not remain in their energy wells. This leads us to believe that – as the reviewers suggested – using only two distances as collective variables has limitations; one being that they can be overly sensitive to miniscule conformational changes.</p><p>To confirm this and validate that our free energy landscapes are indeed converged, we reprojected the free energy landscapes onto several other CVs such as TM7b angle, TM10b RMSD, and salt bridge distance, introduced in the main text (calculations for each feature is as described in manuscript methods). The resulting free energy surfaces for both rGLUT5<sup>empty</sup> and rGLUT5<sup>fructose</sup> can be found in Figure 2 —figure supplement 9A and B. In the TM7b angle vs TM10b RMSD calculations for rGLUT5<sup>fructose</sup>, there were not enough transitions between the inward and outward facing states to properly calculate the MSM, resulting in a lack of information for the outward facing states (Figure 2 —figure supplement 9C). As we are interested in the behavior of the outward-facing states for the positive controls, we split the simulations into two and calculated MSMs for each group and thereby obtained disjointed free energy landscapes. We then gathered the results together into one graph so that the relative energy minima for the outward-facing or inward-facing states are visible together. We mention this detail to note that in Author response image 4C and later R6, the free energy difference between outward facing (green in Figure 2 —figure supplement 9C) and inward facing (red in Figure 2 —figure supplement 9C) free energy minima are not reliable.</p><p>Projecting the control simulation snapshots onto these energy surfaces in these new CV spaces showed that the controls stayed much more within their own well or that of a neighboring well (Figure 2 —figure supplement 10, 11).</p><p>From this, we conclude that the conformational ensembles are indeed converged and that the conformations generated during the string simulations are plausible, including those generated via TMD, namely inward-facing states.</p><p>Although the extracellular and intracellular gates distance provides a convenient means to visualize the separation between structural states and the progression of the transporter along its functional cycle, they are not optimal collective variables to define metastable states in an energy landscape. This is in part due to the fact that this CV comes from the measurement of a single distance between centers of mass, making them degenerate and highly sensitive to even small fluctuations in protein movement. Notably, these collective variables had been previously used in string simulations of sugar porters<sup>2</sup>, and we do indeed observe that they separate the 5 initial state models well. In our experience, the string simulations are less sensitive to CV choice than other methods, given that the starting path for the strings is close enough to the minimum free energy path. Thanks to MSM calculations, on the other hand, projection of the conformational ensemble onto a different set of CVs is easy and can be informative, as illustrated in Figure 2 —figure supplement 9. For other enhanced sampling methods, however, a set of CVs that more accurately separates metastable states is likely needed (see accompanying paper).</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the thorough comments about the validity of the energy landscapes. In the manuscript, we have addressed the limitations of using two collective variables compared to several, and our reasoning for using these in our work. We also elaborate that the targeted MD was specifically chosen to avoid hysteresis and expand on our experience with this, and provided all figures discussed in this section as new supplementary figures to Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers' specific concerns with regard to hysteresis/systematic errors include:</p><p>a) The fact that simulations convergence depends on the direction (outward-to-inward vs inward-to-outward; the authors describe limitations of inward open to outward open simulations in regards to salt bridge distances) indeed strongly suggests the presence of significant hysteresis/systematic errors. Namely, the lack of reversible formation and disruption of salt-bridges might have artificially over-stabilized outward-facing states (as landscapes are only for outward-to-inward direction).</p></disp-quote><p>The stabilization of the outward facing state is in agreement with the function and structure of GLUT transporters. Monitoring sugar efflux is expected to be complicated due to the challenges of modeling salt-bridge formation vs salt-bridge breakage. Furthermore, sugars are thought to bind with 10-lower affinity on the inside<sup>3</sup>, indicating that a large energetic barrier exists in the transition from inward to outward facing (likely due to the formation of these very salt bridges). We therefore do not believe that the challenges with modeling transport directionality has a connection to systematic errors. As discussed in the manuscript, the outward-facing states have been show to be the most populated in the absence of sugar<sup>4-7</sup>, since the salt-bridge network is asymmetric and only found on the cytoplasmic side.</p><p>Biological considerations aside, hysteresis was a concern of ours during the course of this project as mentioned above, and after trying many options for generating initial configurations to launch the swarms from, we found the use of our stepwise TMD protocol to be a suitable way to combat this. Earlier attempts to obtain an initial path for the string simulations included resorting to adiabatic MD (ABMD) as well as steered MD (SMD) on several different groups of collective variables performed in a stepwise manner (moving from one of the five major states to the adjacent one). ABMD was unsuccessful at generating an initial pathway, as the target CV was often not reached during the simulations. In the cases where the target was reached, the RMSD to the target state never decreased throughout the simulation. The SMD performed better in reaching target distributions and RMSD than ABMD, so string simulations initiated from the initial pathway generated by SMD were launched. However, these were discarded after observing a strong effect of hysteresis on the energy surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>) even after over 200 iterations of string simulations. From this, it became apparent that applying SMD led to not all degrees of freedom necessary to facilitate a proper conformational change being able to relax appropriately over the subsequent simulation timescales.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>The effect of hysteresis on two string simulations with starting paths generated by steered MD.</title><p>Both have a strong memory of their initial starting states which are predicted to be the most energetically favorable (red), moving only uphill in free energy.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84808-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We therefore elected targeted MD to generate an initial path for several reasons. Firstly, little is known about the precise conformation of GLUT5 during its transport cycle, but the five structures/ homology models should be a close approximation of the major states visited in this cycle. As it was clear that hysteresis was an issue when not all degrees of freedom were known and there was not much information available about the path that GLUT5 takes, targeted MD had the advantage that we could steer the simulations between five presumably reasonable template-based models. Furthermore, as string simulations are performed in equilibrium, they should be somewhat forgiving to imperfect starting configurations. Lastly, targeted MD also has the benefit that it operates on all degrees of freedom, which appeared advantageous for a system for which it was not clear which collective variable to use to properly bias the system. The force applied on the TMD was also performed stepwise so as to allow the protein to take the energetically favorable path to its target.</p><p>After applying the string of swarms method to configurations obtained using TMD, projecting free energy surfaces onto various CVs, as shown above in Figure 2 —figure supplement 9, shows that the outward-facing states are not over stabilized. In the free energy surface along the TM7b angle vs average salt-bridge distance (Figure 2 —figure supplement 9A) as well as along the TM7b angle vs the TM10b RMSD (Figure 2 —figure supplement 9B and C), when sugar is present, the inward facing states are more energetically favorable than the outward-facing ones. In turn, in absence of sugar, the outward facing states are shown to be more stable. This corroborates our discussion above where using collective variables describing gate opening may not be appropriate to define metastable states. In contrast, if our simulations truly suffered from hysteresis, the overstabilization of the outward facing states should appear consistently with all projection choices.</p><p>On the other hand, we agree with the reviewer that hysteresis is at play in some of our simulations, as the direction of pulling in TMD seems to affect the resulting free energy surface. As TMD pulling does not explicitly take into account all possible CVs , the salt bridge distances, for example, are affected by directionality. Author response image 4A and R4B show the energy surface for the rGLUT5<sup>empty</sup> and rGLUT5<sup>fructose</sup> string simulations we have obtained after TMD in the inward open → outward open direction. Though the hysteresis effect of overstabilization of initial states is not as obvious as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>, the final states of the path (outward facing) seem to not fully have undergone the proper rocker switch motions (note the improper closing of the intracellular gate in both conditions), likely because pulling in this direction does not result in proper closure of the salt-bridge network as reported in the manuscript. We therefore deemed these conformations unreliable and discarded these simulations from further analysis.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>(A) Free energy surfaces from the MSM for rGLUT5<sup>empty</sup> with a pathway generated from TMD in the direction opposite to the one reported in the manuscript (in open → out open).</title><p>Iterations 100 – 420 shown here.

For all three replicas, it is interesting to note that the simulations do not fall to an energy minima on the free energy landscape when using gate distances as a CV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5A</xref>).

In the TM7b angle/ salt bridge distance projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5B</xref>), which separates the inward-facing states particularly well, the simulations fall into an energy well which would be reasonable for an inward-occluded state (Figure 2 —figure supplement 9A), where the salt bridges are on the way to full breakage.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>(A) Movement of three replicas of the inward occluded state homology model on the gate CV space on top of the free energy surface of rGLUT5<sup>fructose</sup>.</title><p>A pink dot indicates the conformation for the starting model, and blue dots show the conformation for every 1ns.

It is also worth noting that the error of the energy surface (Figure 2 —figure supplement 4D) is rather high in this region (IC ~1.1, EC 0.8), making conclusions about this region rather uncertain.</p><p>As mentioned in the Discussion section in our manuscript, we generally view the inward-facing energy wells and conformations from this paper with skepticism due to the suboptimal lipid composition, which we know plays a crucial role in stabilizing the inward facing states. We anticipate that further work is needed to properly characterize the inward-facing states and subsequent sugar release into the cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The fact that the inward open X-ray structure is a high energy conformation in the free energy landscape in Figure 2E (bottom right triangle; X-ray structure is without substrate) is also concerning since one would expect it to be in the energetically feasible region (within 2-3 kcal mol from a main free energy minimum) unless the X-ray structure is not a functional state, which seems unlikely.</p></disp-quote><p>We expect the inward states to be highly dynamic as they need to spontaneously close, as the saltbridge network is unique to the GLUT family and ultimately defines them, ie., the sugar porter motif<sup>8</sup>. The x-ray structures represent a functional state, yet they are almost always stabilized by lipids or sugars binding to the gating regions. For example, in GLUT1 inward open structures, there are crystallization lipids (PDB: 6THA), or an endofacial inhibitor (PDB: 5EQI) bound to the inner gate, likewise for GLUT4 (PDB:7WSM/ 7WSN). The related bacterial homolog xylose symporter XylE has two known inward open structures (PDB 4JA4 and 4QIQ), both of which lack structural resolution in several intracellular helices. We expect that the right lipids might help to stabilize the inward open state, but it cannot be too stable either. Indeed, our extensive analysis of lipid preferences of GLUT5 has shown its activity is exquisitely sensitive to membrane fluidity<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>To provide further computation evidence, four additional replicas of the GLUT5 inward open model have been run, two of which contain a different lipid bilayer, as can be found on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref>. We see that the initial inward open state is not maintained throughout simulation, and tends to relax towards a slightly more closed intracellular gate. We attempted to stabilize the inward-facing state by using two other lipid compositions with a longer equilibration time, to give time for optimal lipid placement. For these simulations, at least on this time scale, we saw no change in tendency to relax the intracellular gate even with a different lipid bilayer. We conclude that there must be a certain lipid binding mode that is not known, or that the placement of the IC helices is not optimal for stabilizing the inward-open state of GLUT5. To characterize the lipid environment through the protein’s transport cycle, while of great interest to us, is not within the scope of this project as exhaustive sampling would be needed.</p><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>.</title><p>Movement of inward open simulations superimposed on the rGLUT5<sup>fructose</sup> free energy surface.

The D-fructose concentration tested in the assays was far below the Km (6uM compared to 10 mM), further complicated by unknown Km values of the mutants. This complicates the interpretation of the relative activities since the activity will be highly dependent on substrate concentration. The authors should consider this caveat in their discussion of the mutant activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We are measuring passive influx of sugars. The non-energized uptake of sugars into liposomes has proven very difficult to measure robustly. It has taken us close to four years to get GLUT transporter to work well in proteoliposomes and GLUT5 was particularly challenging as its very low affinity for fructose<sup>1</sup>. Unfortunately, we cannot obtain radioactive sugars at mM concentrations and if we dilute our hot sugar with cold sugar to increase the final concentration then we decrease our signal. With a Vmax at close to 20 mM it is difficult to obtain saturation in a time course experiment. For this reason, we measure uptake after 2 mins, rather than the 30s used for glucose (GLUT) transporters with a 10-fold lower Km. Using this approach on PfHT1 (that transports both glucose and fructose) we found that most mutations abolishing glucose uptake (with saturation) were similar to those monitoring fructose uptake (without saturation)<sup>9</sup>. Those mutations showing some activity need to be further assessed in a time-course assay and further with kinetics, wherever possible.</p><p>We have included some of this information in our discussion of the mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors should provide additional discussion or clarification on several points related to the experimental results for the mutants.</p><p>a. While the 'quadruple' mutant result is impressive and informative, it is difficult to infer firm conclusions from the data and model presented. It might be expected that this mutation should convert GLUT5 into a glucose transporter – yet this mutant is unable to transport glucose.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, as you might expect, the quadruple mutant was created to hopefully shift GLUT5 to transport D-glucose. We are, nonetheless, surprised that it can still work to transport D-fructose. As the transport is overall low in the quadruple mutant, and time course experiments indicate no saturation of fructose transport after 2 minutes incubation (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1), performing kinetic experiments on the quadruple mutant is not possible. Although the full effect of this recovered effect is not fully understood, it does highlight other coupling pathways are possible. We added text to clarify our conclusions from this mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Could the elevated rate for Y296F (and the quadruple mutant) simply be more efficient salt-bridge breaking?</p></disp-quote><p>That’s an interesting idea. It is possible that the Y296F mutant helps TM7b to close more easily and therefore increases uptake. It is also plausible that the Y296F mutant is better at resetting from an outward-occluded to an outward-open state, which is probably more likely since re-setting is the rate-limiting step in the transport cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. If the authors have tested mutation of the YY motif to SN in GLUT5, it would be informative and interesting to know the result regardless of the outcome, in order to understand whether specificity is encoded by this motif alone, or by more complex global interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion, indeed this was an idea we probed early on in our studies of PfHT1, which is more robust to monitor mutagenesis than GLUT5. We found that PfHT1 S315Y (figure 3D in (9)) and PfHT1 N316Y (not published) both had no transport abilities. We also have previously concluded that as rGLUT5 Y287 and Y298 are conserved for all mammalian GLUTs and XylE, which all transport substrate other than fructose, there must be other factors encoding specificity. To finally rule out this possibility, we have purified and tested rGLUT5 Y297S-Y298N in our functional assay.

There is clearly some activity in the N293A mutation, suggesting that this residue (and thus the interaction with the sugar) is not 'required' for transport. In fact, the MD simulations would support this, as the broken helix state can be visited in the absence of substrate. Thus, the authors should rephrase this point.</p></disp-quote><p>The Asn residue is strictly conserved in all GLUTs and related sugar porters. In papers spanning more than 10 years, almost every residue in GLUT1 was substituted to cystine in a cysteine-less GLUT1 variant showing WT activity. The TM7b asparagine (Asn288 in GLUT1) was found to one of 8 residues that are strictly essential for uptake of 2-deoxyglucose into oocytes<sup>10,11</sup>, i.e., was the most important residue in the sugar binding site. These mutational studies are consistent with both the structure and cold competition assays, since the TM7b Asn residue hydrogen bonds to the most critical C3-OH and C4-OH groups of D-glucose and likely D-fructose<sup>3,9</sup>. However, you are right that we do observe a higher signal than background in GLUT5 proteoliposomes. Our best guess is that the N293A mutant in TM7b might be able to still close during fructose efflux – albeit less effectively. We will explore this further, but we first need to be able to “silence” oppositely orientated GLUT5 in the proteoliposomes to do so. From a physiological context this mutant is nonetheless “dead” as the affinity for D-fructose is likely to be to very low.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Currently reported simulation data do not conform to quality standards for publication. In particular, the authors should report an error analysis on the free energy landscapes, for example by calculating the latter with different subsets of the simulation data and evaluating the standard error. Provided the free energy landscapes are converged, free energy minima should correspond to locally stable conformations in conventional MD simulations, hence additional validation of the reliability of the calculated landscapes must be performed also using the latter technique. A good example that the authors could follow and cite, with appropriate quality standards, is Lev et al., PNAS 2017, E4158-E4167, which is also based on the string method with swarms of trajectories and in which the free energies were also obtained from the transition matrix.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reference, we have now addressed this in the essential revisions above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors reported that they also obtained the free energy in a similar manner but they neither described in detail the methodology nor they cited any reference in this regard, therefore the results are currently not reproducible. A detailed description thereof and/or associated citations must be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now updated the methods and added Figure 2, figure supplement 3 and 4 for showing our methodology in the free energy calculations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should provide further details on homology models and simulations based on the latter: number of models generated, criteria to select the final model, side chain refinement prior to simulation, quality scores, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>The methods have been updated to incorporate this information. On the public repository linked in the Methods section, one can also find the relevant alignment files needed for the homology modeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors mentioned that to model efflux was more difficult because of salt bridge formation. A possibility to solve this issue is to increase the number of variables used in the string method, including for example a variable describing salt-bridges formation and disruption. In the previously mentioned reference for example the authors used tens of collective variables rather than just two as in this work. In this regard, the authors should at least discuss the potential issues of a low-dimensional representation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this concern in essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Assuming the free energy landscapes are reasonably well converged, a suggestion to improve the impact of this work is to obtain the same landscapes with bound glucose, so as to assess how GLUT5 is less selective towards the latter than fructose. Namely, if the alternating access transition in the empty transporter is rate limiting, occlusion with glucose ought to be significantly destabilized with respect to fructose and in this manner, the authors could effectively demonstrate that substrate occlusion controls selectivity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Since D-glucose doesn’t compete for the uptake of D-fructose then it’s unlikely this sugar binds to GLUT5 with any measurable affinity. Given the binding affinity for D-fructose is already very low (10mM), it is unlikely we will be able to obtain any meaningful data for MD simulations with sugar that does not bind. However, this is something we are very interested in for other transporters like PfHT1 that can recognize multiple sugars, but this is beyond the scope of our current work.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one minor remaining issue that needs to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The reply to the reviewers contains an important discussion of the observed deviations from free energy minima and a plausible justification of their possible meaning (page 4, under the heading &quot;Compatibility of free energy surfaces with control simulations&quot;). Although these controls are summarized in the methods of the updated manuscript, it is also desirable that the manuscript text be expanded upon to include the following information, which is currently reported only in the response to the reviewers: (1) a description of the drifts observed during conventional MD simulations and (2) the justification described in the response to reviewers. (Namely, that those drifts may reflect the fact that the collective variables used for the free energy landscapes might be very sensitive to small structural fluctuations.)</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included text in the results and later discussion describing the drift observed in the simulation and the justification for this drift as mentioned in the review response. We have also re-ordered the methods to follow the order of the manuscript with this inclusion, with some minor text rearrangements. We also re-ordered the figure 2 supplementary figures to accommodate this addition, with no change to the figures themselves.</p></body></sub-article></article>
