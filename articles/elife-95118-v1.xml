Pannexin 1 (PANX1) is a large-pore channel permeable to ATP and other cellular metabolites. Its tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation have been found to play critical roles in diverse cellular conditions, including neuronal cell death, acute inflammation, and smooth muscle contraction. Specifically, the non-receptor kinase Src has been reported to phosphorylate Tyr198 and Tyr308 of mouse PANX1 (equivalent to Tyr199 and Tyr309 of human PANX1), resulting in channel opening and ATP release. Although the Src-dependent PANX1 activation mechanism has been widely discussed in the literature, independent validation of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PANX1 has been lacking. Here, we show that commercially available antibodies against the two phosphorylation sites mentioned above—which were used to identify endogenous PANX1 phosphorylation at these two sites—are nonspecific and should not be used to interpret results related to PANX1 phosphorylation. We further provide evidence that neither tyrosine residue is a major phosphorylation site for Src kinase in heterologous expression systems. We call on the field to re-examine the existing paradigm of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent activation of the PANX1 channel.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pannexin 1</kwd><kwd>tyrosine phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>Y199</kwd><kwd>Y309</kwd><kwd>Src kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20POST35120556</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruan</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99NS128258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruan</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM138321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lü</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS111031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000872</institution-id><institution>McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001207</institution-id><institution>Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

The activation of PANX1 allows the release of ATP and other cellular metabolites to the extracellular space, serving as signaling molecules for neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Medina et al., 2020</xref>). While the functional relevance of PANX1 in human physiology and diseases has been investigated for nearly two decades since the PANX family was cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baranova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sandilos and Bayliss, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scemes and Velíšková, 2019</xref>), the detailed structural and biophysical properties of the channel were only beginning to be elucidated. In 2020, we and others determined structures of PANX1 by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), revealing the channel stoichiometry, domain architecture, ion permeation pathways, and inhibition mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michalski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>). These structures have in turn motivated small-molecule docking analysis and the development of the first PANX1-selective channel blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crocetti et al., 2021</xref>). Despite the remarkable progress made in the PANX1 field, the dynamic regulation of the channel opening and closing in various cellular contexts is not well understood. Which cellular stimuli PANX1 responds to and how they achieve channel activation, especially in a reversible manner, are unclear and largely under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mim et al., 2021</xref>). Deciphering the regulatory principle of the PANX1 is not only important to better characterize the function of the channel, but may also provide clues to the development of pharmaceutical agents to treat PANX1-associated diseases.</p><p>Post-translational modifications, such as protease cleavage, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and S-nitrosylation, have been shown to play important roles in PANX1 regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyce et al., 2018</xref>). For example, caspase-dependent cleavage of the regulatory C-terminal tail of PANX1 is critically implicated for apoptotic cell clearance by the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Medina et al., 2020</xref>). The glycosylation at the second extracellular loop of PANX1 sterically prevents the docking of two PANX1 heptamers into a gap-junction-like assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sosinsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dahl and Locovei, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2007</xref>). Our recent cryo-EM study on PANX1 directly visualized both mechanisms and corroborates with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>). While the caspase-dependent cleavage irreversibly activates PANX1, studies from several groups have converged on the concept that protein phosphorylation may be a novel mechanism to reversibly regulate PANX1 channel activity. In particular, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src seems to be a critical component during this process. For example, prolonged activation of P2X7 receptor leads to activation of PANX1 in many cell lines, opening of a large pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Locovei et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006</xref>). Through the use of a mimetic peptide and kinase inhibitors, Src was later found to be involved in mediating the initial steps of this signal transduction, but it does not directly phosphorylate PANX1 per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iglesias et al., 2008</xref>). In a more recent study, PANX1 was proposed to make functional crosstalk with α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) in neuroblastoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maldifassi et al., 2021</xref>). Src kinase is also involved in this process; however, it is unclear if PANX1 is a direct substrate of Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maldifassi et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, murine PANX1 has been reported to undergo serine phosphorylation at Ser205 and Ser206, although two studies have shown contradictory effects of the two serine phosphorylation sites on PANX1 channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poornima et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Medina et al., 2021</xref>). Likewise, the S394 of rat PANX1 could be phosphorylated by CaMKII upon an increase in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">López et al., 2021</xref>). However, this residue is not conserved in human PANX1 (hPANX1). More recently, T302 and S328 were reported to be phosphorylated by protein kinase A, which affects the mechanically induced chloride conductance of PANX1 through the lateral tunnels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">López et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Direct evidence of PANX1 phosphorylation by Src was provided by two groups using western blot analysis, with Tyr198 and Tyr308 of mouse/rat PANX1 (equivalent to Tyr199 and Tyr309 of hPANX1) being the target residues. Interestingly, the underlying signaling events of PANX1 phosphorylation are non-canonical. For example, the phosphorylation of Tyr308 by Src kinase depends on ligand binding to the metabotropic NMDA receptor (NMDAR) in CA1 pyramidal neurons, but does not require its pore opening and Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weilinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weilinger et al., 2016</xref>). As a result, it was suggested that NMDARs, Src kinase, and PANX1 could form a signaling complex, in which the NMDAR is the ligand-sensing module whereas the PANX1 is the pore-forming unit. Phosphorylation at Tyr308 is a key step for PANX1 activation in the NMDAR/Src/PANX1 signalosomes that eventually leads to the neuronal cell death during ischemia or stroke. Likewise, the phosphorylation of Tyr198 of mouse PANX1 (mPANX1) was found to be relevant in several different cellular contexts. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lohman et al., 2015</xref> showed that in vascular endothelial cells, Tyr198 phosphorylation—which depends on type-1 TNF receptor (TNFR1) and Src kinase—opens PANX1 channel, leading to ATP release and promoting leukocyte adhesion and emigration. Moreover, Tyr198 phosphorylation is linked to vasoconstriction and blood pressure regulation. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeLalio et al., 2019</xref> found that Tyr198 is constitutively phosphorylated by Src in vascular smooth muscle cells, possibly through an α1-adrenergic receptor (α1-AR)-based vasoconstriction mechanism. In a more recent study, Nouri-Nejad et al. identified Tyr150 of PANX1 as another phosphorylation site, presumably by Src, through electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, but only to a small degree (in 2 out of 11 LC-MS/MS spectra) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nouri-Nejad et al., 2021</xref>). The functional consequence of Tyr150 phosphorylation to PANX1 is unclear, as phosphor-ablating mutant Y150F does not alter the properties of PANX1 current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nouri-Nejad et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The initial aim of our study was to investigate how tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the channel activity of PANX1 through structural approaches. To this end, we first examined whether we could detect PANX1 phosphorylation using two commercially available antibodies claimed to be specific for phosphorylated PANX1 at the Y198 and Y308 sites, respectively. Surprisingly, neither antibody recognized PANX1 co-expressed with a constitutively active Src variant. This result raised concerns about the validity of the conclusion that Tyr198 and Tyr308 of PANX1 are phosphorylated, as identification of both sites relied on these antibodies. We further provided evidence that PANX1 is not phosphorylated at Tyr198 and Tyr308 by Src kinase, at least in heterologous expression systems. Therefore, the paradigm of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent activation of PANX1 channel by Src kinase needs to be reconsidered.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural location and conservation of putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites in PANX1</title><p>Studies reporting the Src-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr198 and Tyr308 in murine PANX1 occurred prior to the availability of PANX1 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michalski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weilinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeLalio et al., 2019</xref>). We first mapped the corresponding residues, Tyr199 and Tyr309, into the apo state structure of hPANX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, both residues are located in positions close to the side tunnel of PANX1, an anion-selective permeation pathway responsible for the PANX1 basal current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>). Tyr199 is part of the intersubunit interface of PANX1 and is partially buried, which may make it less accessible to Src kinase. Tyr309, on the other hand, is completely buried inside the protein. Therefore, phosphorylation of Tyr199 and Tyr309, if occurs, would require at least conformational changes or partial unfolding of the intracellular domain. Such structural alternations are unlikely to occur spontaneously without specific cellular conditions that favor this process. Accordingly, phosphorylation of either of these two residues is expected to cause major conformational changes of the intracellular domain due to the negative charges and the bulky size of the introduced phosphate group(s).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Location and sequence conservation of Tyr199 and Tyr309 in human Pannexin 1 (PANX1).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Tyr199 and Tyr309 of human PANX1 (hPANX1) are located close to the side tunnel.

Both Tyr199 and Tyr309, as well as several residues nearby, are conserved among different PANX1 orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that phosphotyrosine antibodies developed against one species are likely to cross-react with the others. Tyr199 is also conserved in PANX2 and PANX3, the other two members of the pannexin family. In contrast, Tyr309 is only conserved in PANX1 and PANX3, while PANX2 has a phenylalanine at this position and lacks a few residues preceding this residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Given the critical location of the two tyrosine residues, we decided to experimentally characterize their phosphorylation status in the presence of Src kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Commercial antibodies, anti-PANX1-pY198 and anti-PANX1-pY308, do not recognize phosphorylated human PANX1 in HEK293T cells</title><p>To investigate the phosphorylation of hPANX1 by Src, we used two commercially available phosphor-specific antibodies that were used in previous studies to identify Tyr198 and Tyr308 as phosphorylation sites of murine PANX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weilinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lohman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeLalio et al., 2019</xref>) and were later reported to react with hPANX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Metz and Elvers, 2022</xref>).

The K297M is catalytically incompetent as the mutation abolishes the ATP-binding capability of mSrc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roskoski, 2015</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) Human PANX1 (WT, Y199F, or Y309F) are co-expressed with mSrc (WT or Y529F) in HEK293T cells.

The positions of the signals detected by anti-PANX1-pY198 and anti-PANX1-pY308 antibodies do not match the position of the GFP fluorescence signal, indicating that the two antibodies are not specific for PANX1.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2sdata1"><label>Figure 2—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Uncropped immunoblots for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="elife-95118-fig2-data1-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2sdata2"><label>Figure 2—source data 2.</label><caption><title>Raw image for anti-PANX1-pY198 immunoblot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="elife-95118-fig2-data2-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2sdata3"><label>Figure 2—source data 3.</label><caption><title>Raw image for anti-PANX1-pY308 immunoblot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="elife-95118-fig2-data3-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2sdata4"><label>Figure 2—source data 4.</label><caption><title>Raw image for in-gel fluorescence (GFP and mCherry) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="elife-95118-fig2-data4-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95118-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>The human PANX1 (hPANX1) cannot be detected by anti-PANX1-pY198 and anti-PANX1-pY308 irrespective of C-terminal GFP tag.</title><p>Human PANX1 w- or w/o C-terminal GFP tag were co-expressed with mSrc-Y529F in HEK293T cells.

Similarly, from cells transfected with hPANX1 alone, including WT, Y199F, and Y309F, neither antibody produced any signal, despite the presence of clear GFP signals in the fluorescent gel indicating PANX1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 4–6). This is consistent with the notion that both antibodies do not recognize non-phosphorylated PANX1.</p><p>Unexpectedly, from another control sample of cells transfected with WT mSrc alone, anti-PANX1-pY198 yielded two prominent bands close to 75 kDa; anti-PANX1-pY308 also produced a band corresponding to the lower band of anti-PANX1-pY198, albeit much weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 2). While the lower band corresponded to the fluorescent signal of mSrc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 2), the upper band may represent endogenous proteins induced and/or phosphorylated by mSrc. The same signal pattern was detected with anti-PANX1-pY198 antibody from cells expressing the constitutively active mSrc-Y529F variant alone, although both bands were slightly upshifted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 3). This upward shift was also observed in the fluorescent signal of mSrc-Y529F, suggesting that it may be due to a more extensive phosphorylation of mSrc-Y529F itself (lower band) and other endogenous proteins (upper band) associated with mSrc-Y529F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 3). Interestingly, in addition to the band corresponding to the mSrc fluorescence signal, the anti-PANX1-pY308 antibody showed a major band at about 50 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 3), which may represent other sets of endogenous proteins induced and/or phosphorylated by mSrc. Taken together, our control experiments showed that both antibodies demonstrate promiscuous activity against mSrc and/or other unknown endogenous proteins, raising concerns as to whether these antibodies should be used to interpret the phosphorylation of PANX1.</p><p>Despite the caveats of the antibodies mentioned above, we proceeded to test whether the two antibodies could at least produce additional signals that may represent phosphorylated hPANX1 (when hPANX1 and mSrc are co-expressed). We designed several co-transfection experiments combining WT mSrc or its constitutively active variant (Y529F) with WT PANX1 or its phosphor-ablating mutants (Y199F and Y309F). All combinations yielded the same signal pattern as when mSrc was expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 7–9 vs 2, lanes 10–12 vs 3), although under some conditions the signals were weaker, which we attribute to the lower protein expression level indicated by the fluorescent signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 10). Even when the constitutively active mSrc was present, both antibodies failed to detect any signals corresponding to the GFP fluorescence signal of hPANX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 7–12). Furthermore, there was no difference in the signal pattern of WT hPANX1 and its two phosphor-ablating mutants, which is unexpected if these antibodies are indeed specific for phosphorylated PANX1.</p><p>Our hPANX1 construct contains a GFP tag at its very C-terminus, which is unlikely to affect PANX1 phosphorylation due to the flexibility of the C-terminus and its considerable distance from the proposed phosphorylation sites. Nevertheless, to thoroughly address this concern, we co-expressed a GFP-free version of hPANX1 with the constitutively active mSrc-Y529F, and performed western blot analysis. Our result showed that both anti-PANX1-pY198 and anti-PANX1-pY308 failed to detect hPANX1, regardless of the presence of the C-terminal GFP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, lanes 3–6).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Anti-PANX1-pY198 and anti-PANX1-pY308 antibodies do not recognize phosphorylated human PANX1 in vitro</title><p>We next tested whether anti-PANX1-pY198 and anti-PANX1-pY308 antibodies could detect PANX1 phosphorylation in vitro, as demonstrated in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeLalio et al., 2019</xref>), using purified hPANX1 produced in-house and purified human Src with a C-terminal GST tag (Src-GST) purchased from a commercial source.</p><p>We first wanted to know whether purified hPANX1 could be phosphorylated by Src in an in vitro context.

This led us to speculate that anti-PANX1-pY308 may recognize non-phosphorylated PANX1.

As a result, the Src signal appeared to dominate in the western blot using whole-cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we blotted whole-cell lysates from HEK293T cells expressing either the WT PANX1 or the Y308F variant.

To address this possibility, we purified hPANX1 protein expressed alone or co-expressed with the constitutively active mSrc-Y529F variant, and conducted liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis on the samples, which offers high sensitivity for detecting phosphorylated species. While we unambiguously identified MS/MS spectra covered both Tyr199 and Tyr309 sites, the tyrosine residues are not phosphorylated even when hPANX1 is co-expressed with mSrc-Y529F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>). Interestingly, we observed hPANX1 Ser385 phosphorylation when mSrc-Y529F is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). However, out of 67 MS/MS spectra, only five spectra contain the phosphorylated Ser385 (~7.5%). We note that phosphorylated peptides may display a very different fragmentation and ionization efficiency compared to the non-phosphorylated counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dephoure et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the ratio of the MS/MS spectra does not represent the true phosphorylation level of hPANX1 protein. Our Phos-tag gel analysis suggests that the Ser385 phosphorylation could be at a very low level as we did not observe other major bands in Phos-tag gel when hPANX1 is co-expressed with mSrc-Y529F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

For example, Cx43 phosphorylation by p34<sup>cdc2</sup> kinase is associated with channel internalization during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanemitsu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lampe et al., 1998</xref>). The volume-regulated anion channel was also recently found to be phosphorylated by MSK1 kinase, which in turn controls cellular chloride efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Serra et al., 2021</xref>). Not unexpectedly, PANX1 phosphorylation is also implicated in several physiological conditions. The common scheme of these processes is that PANX1 acts downstream of a membrane receptor, including P2X7, NMDARs, α7 nAChR, TNFR1, and α1-AR, which senses various extracellular signal and results in PANX1 activation via a yet uncharacterized intracellular signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Locovei et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maldifassi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weilinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weilinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lohman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeLalio et al., 2019</xref>). The Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase appears to be a key player during this process, as inhibiting Src activity by kinase inhibitors could quench PANX1 opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Locovei et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maldifassi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weilinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lohman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeLalio et al., 2019</xref>). Several evidence to support the notion that Src could directly phosphorylate PANX1 comes from western blot analysis, in which phosphor-tyrosine antibodies against Y198 and Y308 of murine PANX1 were used. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeLalio et al., 2019</xref>, attempts have been made to compare the effectiveness of pY198 antibody against WT mPANX1 and Y198F mutant in HEK293T cells. However, the signal by the pY198 antibody does not seem to match where the mPANX1 protein is expected to appear, although the blot is rather noisy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeLalio et al., 2019</xref>). In the study by Weilinger et al., pY308 signal is present even for Y308F mutant, suggesting that the antibody may not be specific for pY308 of rat PANX1 (see Figure 5b of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weilinger et al., 2016</xref>). Unfortunately, these antibodies are taken for granted and continued to be used for scientific research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Metz and Elvers, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Here, we combined multiple techniques, including Phos-tag gel, western blot, LC-MS/MS, and patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate Src-dependent PANX1 phosphorylation. Our results, in contrast to previous findings, indicate that Tyr199 and Tyr309 of hPANX1 are not effective substrates for Src kinase, at least in HEK293T and Neuro2A cells or in in vitro experiments using purified hPANX1. Nevertheless, it is still possible that these two tyrosine sites are phosphorylated by other tyrosine kinases in other cell lines. For example, recent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis on hPANX1 identified Tyr150 as a minor phosphorylation site in human triple-negative breast cancer Hs578T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nouri-Nejad et al., 2021</xref>). Our mass spectrometry data failed to detect any fragments corresponding to a phosphorylated Tyr150 even when an active mSrc kinase is coexpressed with hPANX1, suggesting that Tyr150 may not be effectively recognized by mSrc. Consistent with this, a number of other tyrosine kinases have been predicted as the candidates for Tyr150 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nouri-Nejad et al., 2021</xref>). Likewise, our study also does not rule out the possibility that Src may still be involved in the regulation of PANX1, given the fact that Src kinase inhibitors affect PANX1 channel opening under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Locovei et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maldifassi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weilinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lohman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeLalio et al., 2019</xref>). It’s possible that additional proteins are involved to relay the signaling output to PANX1. For example, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident stromal interaction molecules (STIM1/2) have recently been noted to mediate events between NMDAR and PANX1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patil et al., 2022</xref>). Future studies are required to fully decipher the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Given the fact that the commercially available antibodies against phospho-PANX1 are non-specific, we encourage the PANX1 research community to re-examine results derived from the Src-mediated PANX1 phosphorylation and the associated antibodies. The technological development in the production of phospho-specific antibodies represents a breakthrough in the field of protein kinase and phosphoprotein research, providing unprecedented detection precision and accuracy. While phospho-specific antibodies have been successfully developed for many protein targets, great caution still needs to be taken when analyzing novel phosphorylation sites, and control experiments (such as the use of phosphor-ablating mutants and pan-specific phosphorylation antibodies) should be conducted. Ideally, other complementary techniques such as mass spectrometry and Phos-tag gel analysis should be sought to independently verify the conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>Full-length human PANX1 in the pEGC Bacmam vector from our previous study was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>).

Neuro2A cells are purchased from ATCC (Catalogue Number: CCL-131). The cells are authenticated and are mycoplasma contamination tested negative by the vendor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Adherent HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection was conducted using lipofectamine-2000 by following the manufacturer’s protocol. Specifically, the cells were cultured in 60 mm Petri dishes until 80% confluency. Transfection solution was made by mixing 500 ng of plasmid DNA, 4 uL of lipofectamine-2000 reagent, and 100 uL Opti-MEM media. After 10 min incubation at room temperature, the DNA-lipid complexes were added to the cell culture and incubated at 37 °C. The next day, 10 mM sodium butyrate was added to the cells to boost protein expression. The cell culture was then grown at 30 °C for another day before harvesting. The cell pellet was flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. For co-transfection experiments, equal amounts of hPANX1 (250 ng) and mSrc (250 ng) plasmids were used in the transfection mixture. For Neuro2A cell culture, EMEM media is used instead of DMEM. All the other procedures described above are the same for expressing proteins in Neuro2A cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Western blot</title><p>For the western blot experiment, the cell pellet was lysed in TBS buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) with protease an inhibitor cocktail (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM pepstatin, 0.8 μM aprotinin and 2 μg/ml leupeptin), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and 1% glyco-diosgenin detergent for 30 min on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 rpm for 20 min and the soluble portions were mixed with 2 X SDS loading buffer supplemented with 5% 2-Mercaptoethanol. The samples were resolved in precast gradient Tris-Glycine gel (4–20%) or 7.5% PhosTag gel. A Chemidoc instrument was used to directly image the in-gel fluorescence signal after electrophoresis. Subsequently, the protein in the gel was transferred to the PVDF membrane using the semi-dry transfer buffer (48 mM Tris base, 39 mM glycine, 20% methanol). The membrane is blocked in the TBST buffer (20 mM Tris pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 80) with 4% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. Afterward, primary antibodies (1:2000 dilution) were incubated with the membrane overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the membrane was washed with TBST buffer for four times, 10 min each before goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG secondary antibodies were added (1:25000 dilution). After 1 hr, the secondary antibodies were discarded and the membrane was washed again with TBST for four times, 10 min each. The western blot signal was detected using ECL Pierce substrate and imaged using a Chemidoc instrument. A brightfield image was overlaid with the illuminance signal to visualize the position of protein markers in the membrane. The anti-PANX1 antibody is obtained from Abcam (Catalogue number: ab124131). The anti-Src (Catalogue number: 36D10) and anti-pY100 (Catalogue number: 9411) antibodies are obtained from Cell Signaling.

The samples were clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 rpm for 30 min. The de-glycosylation reaction was made by mixing 16 uL of the supernatant with 2 uL of PNGase F enzyme and 2 uL of GlycoBuffer 2 (10X). The control reaction replaced the PNGase F enzyme with water. The reaction was allowed to occur at room temperature overnight. The next day, the samples were mixed with 20 uL 2X SDS sample-loading buffer (BioRad) supplemented with 5% βME and resolved by SDS-PAGE.

Half of each digested sample was analyzed by nano LC-MS/MS with a Waters M-Class HPLC system interfaced with a Thermo Fisher Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. Peptides were loaded on a trapping column and eluted over a 75 µm analytical column at 350 nL/min; both columns were packed with Luna C18 resin (Phenomenex). The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, with the Orbitrap operating at 60,000 FWHM and 15,000 FWHM for MS and MS/MS, respectively. The instrument was run with a 3 s cycle for MS and MS/MS.</p><p>Data were searched using a local copy of Mascot (Matrix Science) with the following parameters.

The transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 hr before electrophysiological measurements. Whole-cell recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700B (Axon Instruments) and Clampex software, with pipettes of 3–5 MOhm resistance filled with an internal solution containing 145 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, 10 mM EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.4. The external bath solution contained 160 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, also adjusted to pH 7.4. During the recordings, voltage steps ranging from −100 mV to +140 mV were applied, each lasting 100ms with a 20 mV increment between steps, and membrane currents were digitally recorded at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. To precisely measure the PANX1 channel’s current, carbenoxolone disodium salt (CBX), a blocker of the channel, was added to the bath solution at a final concentration of 0.1 mM, and CBX-sensitive currents were subsequently calculated by comparing the difference in current amplitude in a cell with and without the presence of CBX.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-95118-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The LC-MS/MS data for WT human PANX1 with or without co-expressing Src-Y529F mutant is deposited in Dryad database under <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4tmpg4fh7">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4tmpg4fh7</ext-link>.

The human Pannexin 1 channel is regulated by phosphorylation at two residues by Src kinase.

The authors recapitulate prior experiments in the literature and also add a series of new, orthogonal experiments that all examine the claim of PANX-1 phosphorylation. The breadth of the reported experiments extends over multiple cell lines and protein constructs, in vitro purified proteins, mass spec, different phosphorylation detection reagents and antibodies, and functional electrophysiology assays that show that the addition of Src does not impact gating. The combined weight of all these data strongly suggests that the field should re-examine the claim that PANX-1 is regulated by phosphorylation at Y199 and Y309.</p><p>Another strength is that the authors go beyond simply showing that the antibodies do not recognize phosphorylated PANX-1. They also provide potential mechanisms for how the antibodies may be misleading. Both antibodies recognize phosphorylated Src-1. In the case of anti-PANX1-pY308, the authors provide solid mutagenesis evidence that the antibody also weakly recognizes a non-phosphorylated epitope of PANX1 in the same region as the tyrosine. This helps make a convincing case.</p><p>Such experiments, while not glamorous, have great practical importance for developing an accurate understanding of how Pannexin channels are regulated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95118.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The widely distributed pannexin 1 (PANX1) is an ATP-permeable channel that plays an important role in intercellular communication and has been implicated in various pathophysiological processes and diseases.

However, they do not show that the COOH-modified Panx1 folds properly. It may not, because functional data strongly suggest that the terminal cysteine dives deep into the pore. For example, the terminal cysteine, C426, can form a disulfide bond with an engineered cysteine at position F54 (Sandilos et al. 2012).</p><p>(4) The authors dismiss the additional arguments for tyrosine phosphorylation of Panx1 given by the various previous studies on Panx1 phosphorylation. These studies did not, as implied, solely rely on the commercial anti-phospho-Panx1 antibodies, but also presented a wealth of independent supporting data. Contrary to the authors' assertion, in the previous papers the pY198 and pY308 antibodies recognized two protein bands in the size range of glycosylated and partial glycosylated Panx1.</p><p>(5) A phosphorylation step triggering channel activity of Panx1 would be expected to occur exclusively on proteins embedded in the plasma membrane. The membrane-bound fraction is small in relation to the total protein, which is particularly true for exogenously expressed proteins. Thus, any phosphorylated protein may escape detection when total protein is analyzed. Furthermore, to be of functional consequence, only a small fraction of the channels present in the plasma membrane need to be in the open state. Consequently, only a fraction of the Panx1 protein in the plasma membrane may need to be phosphorylated. Even the high resolution of mass spectroscopy may not be sufficient to detect phosphorylated Panx1 in the absence of enrichment processes.</p><p>(6) In the electrophysiology experiments described in Figure 7, there is no evidence that the GFP-tagged Panx1 is in the plasma membrane. Instead, the image in Figure 7a shows prominent fluorescence in the cytoplasm. In addition, there is no evidence that the CBX-sensitive currents in 7b are mediated by Panx1-GFP and are not endogenous Panx1. Previous literature suggests that the hPanx1 protein needs to be cleaved (Chiu et al. 2014) or mutated at the amino terminus (Michalski et al 2018) to see voltage-activated currents, so it is not clear that the currents represent hPANX1 voltage-activated currents.</p><p>Note from the editors: The authors provided a rebuttal to the latest review, but no additional data, so we encourage readers to read the concerns and the author responses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95118.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ruan</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Van Andel Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grand Rapids</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Junuk</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Van Andel Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grand Rapids</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yangyang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Van Andel Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grand Rapids</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Van Andel Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grand Rapids</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lü</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Van Andel Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grand Rapids</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>It has been proposed in the literature, that the ATP release channel Panx1 can be activated in various ways, including by tyrosine phosphorylation of the Panx1 protein.

The major conclusion of our manuscript shall not be extended to the claim that “Panx1 is NOT phosphorylated”. This is by no means our conclusion. In fact, the LC-MS/MS data from both ours and others have shown that PANX1 is phosphorylated at both serine and tyrosine sites (1). However, we provided solid evidence that Tyr199 and Tyr309 of human PANX1 are not effective substrate of the Src kinase.</p><p>We did provide several positive controls for the antibodies in our study. We showed that the anti-PANX1 and anti-Src antibodies unambiguously recognized PANX1 and Src, respectively (Figure 3A), and that a pan-specific phosphotyrosine antibody (P-Tyr-100) unambiguously recognized phosphorylated Src (Figure 3A)—as expected—but did not recognize PANX1. In addition, we demonstrated that the two antibodies in question (anti-PANX1-pY198 and anti-PANX1-pY308) did produce signals in our western blot analysis, but we provided compelling evidence that the bands produced by these antibodies do not correspond to PANX1 (Figure 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors claim that exogenous SRC expression does not phosphorylate Y198.

These studies did not, as implied, solely rely on the commercial anti-phospho-Panx1 antibodies, but also presented a wealth of independent supporting data. Contrary to the authors' assertion, in the previous papers the pY198 and pY308 antibodies recognized two protein bands in the size range of glycosylated and partial glycosylated Panx1.</p></disp-quote><p>We didn’t dismiss additional arguments for the Src-dependent PANX1 regulation. In fact, in the discussion of our manuscript, we acknowledged the fact that Src may still be involved in PANX1 regulation, but probably through indirect mechanisms. In the two previous studies2,3, it’s unclear if the multimeric bands detected by pY198/pY308 antibodies correspond to glycosylated PANX1 or not, as the authors did not overlay the protein markers with their blots. In particular, the migration pattern of PANX1 changes across different western blot images from DeLalio et al2. It’s also worth noting that none of these “independent supporting data” in the two previous studies provided direct evidence that Src can phosphorylate pY198/pY308.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) A phosphorylation step triggering channel activity of Panx1 would be expected to occur exclusively on proteins embedded in the plasma membrane. The membrane-bound fraction is small in relation to the total protein, which is particularly true for exogenously expressed proteins. Thus, any phosphorylated protein may escape detection when total protein is analyzed. Furthermore, to be of functional consequence, only a small fraction of the channels present in the plasma membrane need to be in the open state. Consequently, only a fraction of the Panx1 protein in the plasma membrane may need to be phosphorylated. Even the high resolution of mass spectroscopy may not be sufficient to detect phosphorylated Panx1 in the absence of enrichment processes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that only plasma membrane-residing Panx1 phosphorylation is functionally relevant. Interestingly, however, previous studies actually analyzed total protein from cell lysate and concluded that PANX1 is phosphorylated at Y198 and Y308 (2,3). This has motivated our analysis, in which we found that the phosphorylation events cannot be detected when using whole cell lysate. Therefore, we have also conducted an electrophysiology experiment by comparing conditions with/without active Src kinase (Figure 7). Our result indicates that PANX1 current is not affected by the presence of Src. This result suggests that even if there might be minor Src kinase phosphorylation beyond detection limit of western blot or mass spectrometry, they may not be functionally significant as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In the electrophysiology experiments described in Figure 7, there is no evidence that the GFP-tagged Panx1 is in the plasma membrane. Instead, the image in Figure 7a shows prominent fluorescence in the cytoplasm. In addition, there is no evidence that the CBX-sensitive currents in 7b are mediated by Panx1-GFP and are not endogenous Panx1. Previous literature suggests that the hPanx1 protein needs to be cleaved (Chiu et al. 2014) or mutated at the amino terminus (Michalski et al 2018) to see voltage-activated currents, so it is not clear that the currents represent hPANX1 voltage-activated currents.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous analysis has already shown that endogenous current of non-transfected cells is not sensitive to CBX (4). Therefore, the CBX-sensitive current in cells overexpressed PANX1 is from PANX1-GFP. It should be noted that when protein is overexpressed, it tends to accumulate at different intracellular membranes during protein synthesis/maturation. However, this doesn’t affect a portion of the protein to be trafficked to the plasma membrane. In the paper from Michalski et al 2018, it was shown that WT human/mouse PANX1 displayed voltage-dependent activation (5). Although the current is relatively small, it is clearly distinguishable from non-transfected HEK and CHO cells. This voltage-dependent activation is also sensitive to CBX, consistent with our measurement (Figure 7) (4). When GS is introduced at the N-terminus, the voltage-dependent activation of human/mouse PANX1 is significantly boosted, likely due to the altered NTH conformation resulting from the N-terminal extension.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Literature quotes are still problematic.

The molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains complex. Therefore, simply relying on protein molecular standard could not unambiguously identify PANX1 protein band. This is an issue for identifying PANX1 band, especially in light of the fact that some antibodies may not be very specific (see Figure 6B). In our experiment, we have correlated the in-gel fluorescence and western blot signal which allowed us to determine the protein band corresponding to PANX1. It is worth noting that in Figure S3 of DeLalio 2019, the PANX1 is detected at 37 kDa (2). However, in many other panels of the paper, PANX1 is detected at close to 50 kDa (for example, Figure S2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6, supplement 1: why are there oligomers observed in the absence of crosslinking? Why is there no shift in the size of the &quot;oligomers&quot; in response to glycosidase F?</p></disp-quote><p>It is common to observe multimeric membrane proteins, including PANX1, forming oligomeric bands in SDS-PAGE gels, likely because they are not fully denatured or disassembled. PANX1 also contains several free cysteines, which may non-specifically crosslink subunits. There is actually a small shift for the 75 kDa band (dimer) in Figure 6, supplement 1. For higher molecular weight bands, this small shift may not be apparent due to the limited resolution of the gel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A positive control for the antibodies used is missing. The authors argue that such controls are not available, since these commercial antibodies are &quot;proprietary&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We did provide several positive controls for the antibodies in our study. We showed that the anti-PANX1 and anti-Src antibodies unambiguously recognized PANX1 and Src, respectively (Figure 3A), and that a pan-specific phosphotyrosine antibody (P-Tyr-100) unambiguously recognized phosphorylated Src (Figure 3A)—as expected—but did not recognize PANX1. In addition, we demonstrated that the two antibodies in question (anti-PANX1-pY198 and anti-PANX1-pY308) did produce signals in our western blot analysis, but we provided compelling evidence that the bands produced by these antibodies do not correspond to PANX1 (Figure 2B).</p><p>Unfortunately, the epitopes that Millipore Sigma used to generate anti-PANX1-pY198 and anti-PANX1-pY308 are not available.
