Each neuron consists of a cell body, which contains the nucleus, and various structures that stick out from the cell body. These include a large number of short protrusions called dendrites, and a long thin cable-like structure called the axon. The dendrites receive incoming signals from the environment or neighboring neurons and transmit these signals to the cell body, which then relays them along the axon and on to the dendrites of the next neuron.</p><p>As the brain develops, newly formed dendrites recognize and repel other dendrites belonging to the same neuron, thereby spreading themselves out to occupy a larger volume. This patterning process is called self-avoidance. At the same time, in order to repel each other, the dendrites must encounter each other in the first place, which means that they need to grow on a common substrate or surface.</p><p>Soba et al. have now identified one of the proteins responsible for the self-avoidance process by studying the growth of dendrites on neurons in living fruit fly larvae. When the gene for a protein called the Ret receptor was deleted or inhibited, the dendrites that grew were shrunken and disorganized.</p><p>High-resolution microscopy revealed that the dendrites were usually anchored to a scaffolding structure called the extracellular matrix, which ensured that they could only grow in two dimensions. However, when the gene for the Ret receptor did not work properly, the dendrites detached from this matrix and grew in three dimensions instead. Further experiments revealed that this detachment occurred because the Ret receptor was no longer interacting with a group of structural proteins called integrins.</p><p>The Ret receptor plays a role in human disease and has previously been implicated in axon growth, but this is the first evidence to suggest that it also has a role in the patterning of dendrites. Given that Ret is present in vertebrates and has changed little over time, it is likely that this protein also helps to shape communication within the extensive networks of neurons that support complex cognitive functions in mammals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05491.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05491.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>dendrite development</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>receptor</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>patterning</kwd><kwd>cell-matrix interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jan</surname><given-names>Lily Yeh</given-names></name><name><surname>Jan</surname><given-names>Yuh Nung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37NS040929</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jan</surname><given-names>Yuh Nung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cell surface receptor called Ret enables neurons to establish and maintain the organized arrays of dendrites that support communication between neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate functional connectivity and sensory perception require proper development of the neuronal dendritic field, which ultimately determines the (sensory) input a specific neuron can receive and detect. Thus, coordinated dendrite growth and patterning is important for establishing the often complex, but highly stereotyped organization of receptive fields. Two of the organizing principles in dendrite development are self-avoidance and tiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grueber and Sagasti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jan and Jan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zipursky and Sanes, 2010</xref>). While self-avoidance describes the phenomenon of recognition and repulsion of isoneuronal dendritic branches, tiling refers to the complete yet non-redundant coverage of a receptive field by neighboring neurons of the same type. Both phenomena have been described in different systems across species including the mouse, zebrafish, medicinal leech, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>Dendritic patterning by self-avoidance, tiling, and other mechanisms is thought to be mediated by cell surface receptors and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which play a pivotal role in integrating environmental and cellular cues into appropriate growth and adhesion responses. Many such receptors, prominently Robo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spitzweck et al., 2010</xref>) and Ephrin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egea and Klein, 2007</xref>), have well understood roles in axon guidance. Although some of these axonal cues including Robo/Slit play a role in dendrite development as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimitrova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>), dendritic surface receptors and their functions are not fully characterized to date. Recent efforts have yielded some progress in this area. <italic>Down's syndrome cell adhesion molecule</italic> (<italic>Dscam</italic>) has been shown to regulate dendrite self-avoidance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soba et al., 2007</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fuerst et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2009</xref>). More recently, studies on protocadherins have revealed that they play an important role in dendrite self-avoidance in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, sax-7/L1-CAM and menorin (mnr-1) form a defined pattern in the surrounding hypodermal tissue to guide PVD sensory neuron dendrite growth via the neuronal receptor dma-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>). However, given the complexity and stereotypy of dendritic arbors within individual neuronal subtypes, it is important to search for additional signals for directing dendrite growth.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> peripheral nervous system (PNS) has served as an excellent model which has helped to elucidate several molecular mechanisms regulating dendrite development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grueber and Sagasti, 2010</xref>). The larval PNS contains segmentally repeated dendritic arborization (da) neurons which have been classified as class I–IV according to their increasing dendritic complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grueber et al., 2002</xref>). All da neuron classes feature highly stereotyped sensory dendrite projections. Moreover, all da neurons exhibit self-avoidance behavior allowing them to develop their individual receptive fields without overlap. It has been demonstrated that all da neuron classes require <italic>Dscam</italic> for dendrite self-avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soba et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the atypical cadherin <italic>flamingo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsubara et al., 2011</xref>) and immunoglobulin super family (IgSF) member <italic>turtle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Long et al., 2009</xref>) might play a more restricted role in C4da neuron self-avoidance. <italic>Netrin</italic> and its receptor <italic>frazzled</italic> have also been shown to act in parallel to <italic>Dscam</italic> in class III da neurons ensuring their proper dendritic field size and location by providing an attractive growth cue which is counterbalanced by self-avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matthews and Grueber, 2011</xref>). For tiling, no surface receptor has been identified to date. However, the conserved <italic>hippo and tricornered</italic> kinases, and more recently the <italic>torc2</italic> complex, have been implicated in C4da neuron tiling, as the loss of function of these genes results in iso- and heteroneuronal crossing of dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emoto et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koike-Kumagai et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has further shown that dendrite substrate adhesion plays an essential role in patterning. Da neuron dendrites are normally confined to a 2D space through interaction with the epithelial cell layer and the extracellular matrix (ECM) on the basal side of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamamoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). 2D growth of da neuron dendrites requires integrins, as loss of the α-integrin <italic>mew</italic> (<italic>multiple edomatous wing</italic>) or ß-integrin <italic>mys</italic> (<italic>myospheroid</italic>) results in dendrites being freed from the 2D confinement due to detachment from the ECM. Thus, they can avoid dendrites by growing into the epidermis leading to 3D crossing of iso- and hetero-neuronal branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Integrins are therefore essential to ensure repulsion-mediated self-avoidance and tiling mechanisms, which restrict growth of dendrites competing for the same territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). How integrins are recruited to dendrite adhesion sites and whether they cooperate with other cell surface receptors is unknown.</p><p>To identify novel receptors required for generating complex, stereotypical dendritic fields, we performed an in vivo RNAi screen for cell surface molecules in C4da neurons. We identified the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of <italic>Ret</italic> (<italic><underline>re</underline>arranged during <underline>t</underline>ransfection</italic>) as a patterning receptor of C4da dendrites. Loss of <italic>Ret</italic> function in C4da neurons severely affects dendrite coverage, dynamics, growth, and adhesion. In particular, dendrite stability and 2D growth are impaired resulting in reduced dendritic field coverage and abnormal 3D dendrite crossing, respectively. These defects can be completely rescued by Ret expression in C4da neurons. We further show that Ret interaction with integrins is needed to mediate C4da dendrite-ECM adhesion, but not dendrite growth. Our data suggest that <italic>Ret</italic> together with integrins acts through the small GTPase <italic>rac1</italic>, which is required for dendrite adhesion and 2D growth of C4da neuron dendrites as well. We thus describe a novel role for the Ret receptor in dendrite development and adhesion by direct receptor crosstalk with integrins and its downstream signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression analysis and RNAi-mediated knockdown of Ret reveal its role in C4da neuron dendrite development</title><p>To identify cell surface receptors mediating dendrite development of C4da neurons we used an in vivo RNAi screening approach. We focused on functionally defined classes of proteins containing conserved extracellular domains, including IgSFs and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). To this end we expressed available RNAi transgenes specifically in the embryonic/larval PNS (<italic>21-7-Gal4</italic>) together with a C4da neuron specific reporter line (<italic>ppk</italic>-CD4-tdTomato, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2012</xref>). We also utilized a <italic>UAS-Dcr2</italic> transgene to enhance RNAi efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dietzl et al., 2007</xref>). Using this approach, we screened approximately 400 RNAi lines targeting IgSFs and RTKs and found that knockdown of Ret with two independent lines led to strong dendrite defects in C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Knockdown of Ret resulted in abnormal C4da dendrite patterning with crossing of dendritic branches and incomplete coverage of their receptive field. We did not observe defects in other classes of da neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and data not shown) suggesting that Ret plays a specific role in C4da neuron dendrite morphogenesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05491.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In vivo RNAi knockdown of <italic>Ret</italic> causes C4da neuron dendrite pattering defects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Ret</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup> transgenes together with <italic>Dcr2</italic> were driven by <italic>Gal4</italic><sup><italic>21–7</italic></sup> and C4da neuron morphology was visualized with a specific fluorescent reporter (<italic>ppk-CD4-tdTomato</italic>).

Interestingly, Ret was detected throughout the dendritic arbor showing almost continuous staining along major dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,C′</xref>) and a more granular pattern in terminal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,C′′</xref>). We detected granular Ret signal even in distal terminal dendrites suggesting that is localizing throughout the C4da dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, the strongest Ret puncta consistently localized to the basal side of dendrites facing the ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C′,C′′</xref>). In <italic>Ret</italic> mutant animals, only residual immunoreactivity could be detected in C4da neuron somata but not in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,E′,F</xref>) suggesting that the allelic combination used is hypomorphic.

We first performed immunohistochemical analysis of larval filet preparations co-expressing Ret together with Mys and Mew in C4da neurons, as integrins endogenous to C4da neurons are difficult to detect due to strong expression in the surrounding epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2012</xref>). To this end, we used a mCherry-tagged Ret transgene which showed a distribution in dendrites similar to endogenous Ret and did not cause obvious phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found partial colocalization of Ret and Mew or Mys in punctate structures in C4da neuron dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2 fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 2, 3</xref>). Colocalized punctae of Ret and integrins could readily be detected in both primary and high order dendritic branches of C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2 fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 2A′,A′′, 3A′,A′′</xref>). Consistently, transfected S2 cells also displayed colocalization of Ret and Mys, particularly in filopodia-like structures close to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) suggesting that Ret and integrins may form a molecular complex. We therefore performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments of Ret and Mys/Mew in S2 cells. Indeed, Ret showed strong and specific interaction with Mys, and additional co-expression of Mew robustly increased the Ret-integrin interaction indicating that Ret preferentially interacts with the mature integrin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To investigate if Ret can also localize to the surface of C4da dendrites and possibly interact with adhesion mediating integrin complexes, we used a tagged Ret transgene carrying an N-terminal pHluorin in addition to the C-terminal mCherry-tag. We performed cell surface immunostainings of Ret using an anti-GFP antibody recognizing the pHluorin-tag together with Mew immunostaining to assess its localization and co-distribution. Ret itself displayed pronounced surface labeling along the entire dendritic tree, strongly indicating that Ret is present at the cell surface of C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Overall, the pHluorin signal showed surface Ret labeling throughout the dendritic arbor, while the intracellular mCherry-tag revealed additional punctate structures likely reflecting intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Strikingly, Ret showed significant colocalization with Mew in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

We reasoned that Ret likely exerts additional functions independent of integrins/rac1. We thus investigated the specific effects of Ret on dendrite growth and turnover. To this end, we performed time lapse analysis during late larval development at 72 hr and 96 hr after egg laying (AEL). This allowed us to monitor dendrite dynamics within a 24 hr period. In wildtype C4da neurons, significant turnover of terminal dendrites could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parrish et al., 2007</xref>). Overall, we detected dendrite growth and terminal dynamics required to maintain overall field coverage and tiling during larval growth. In <italic>Ret</italic> mutant animals however, C4da neuron dendrites already showed defects at 48 hr AEL (not shown) and 72 hr AEL, as evident from incomplete coverage and abnormal dendrite patterning at that stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Increased dendrite crossing was also already apparent.

To investigate this possibility, we used LifeAct imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Riedl et al., 2008</xref>) to analyze F-actin distribution in dendrites in vivo. Wildtype C4da neurons displayed fairly even distribution of F-actin along major dendrites, while terminal branches typically featured hotspots of increased F-actin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>).

Ret signaling is activated by binding to glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands and their high affinity co-receptors, the GDNF family receptors (GFRα) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Runeberg-Roos and Saarma, 2007</xref>). Ret also plays an important role in human development and disease as loss of function mutations of Ret lead to Hirschprung's disease displaying colonic aganglionosis due to defective enteric nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amiel et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, Ret gain of function mutations are causal for autosomal dominant MEN2 (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2) type medullary thyroid carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lairmore et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almeida and Hoff, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Prior to this study, Ret has not been implicated in dendrite development. Here, we show that Ret is required specifically for 2D growth of C4da neurons by regulating integrin dependent dendrite-ECM adhesion. Normally, C4da neuron dendrites are virtually always in contact with the ECM and the basal surface of the epithelium lining the larval cuticle, and thus tightly sandwiched between the two compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamamoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). In both integrin and <italic>Ret</italic> mutants, dendrite-ECM adhesion is impaired. Ret and integrins can co-localize in dendrites and thus likely form a functional complex that could induce and maintain adhesion of dendrites to the ECM. Since <italic>Ret</italic> loss of function primarily leads to detached terminal dendrite branches, it is tempting to speculate that Ret might be required to recruit integrins to sites of growing dendrites to promote ECM interaction. This is supported by the colocalization of Ret and integrins on the dendrite surface. Their cooperative interaction could thus ensure proper adhesion of growing branches and, conversely, the fidelity of self-avoidance and tiling.</p><p>Our results also highlight the importance of integrating different guidance and adhesion cues to achieve precise neuronal patterning. This has so far only been studied in axon guidance in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dudanova and Klein, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, vertebrate <italic>Ret</italic> has been shown to cooperate with Ephrins to ensure high fidelity axon guidance in motor neurons by mediating attractive EphrinA reverse signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kramer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonanomi et al., 2012</xref>). Similar mechanisms may conceivably be employed for growing dendrites, which also encounter a multitude of attractive, repulsive, and adhesive cues that have to be properly integrated. Besides pathways acting independently or in a parallel fashion, an emerging view is that receptors exhibit direct crosstalk to integrate incoming signals. So far, only parallel receptor pathways like Dscam and Netrin-Frazzled signaling in class III da neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matthews and Grueber, 2011</xref>) or Dscam/integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2012</xref>) have been identified co-regulating dendrite morphogenesis. Our data from this study show that the Ret receptor and integrins integrate dendrite adhesion and growth by collaborative interaction of the two cell surface receptors. The molecular and genetic link between <italic>Ret</italic> and integrins suggests that in this case direct receptor crosstalk plays a major role in their function. How exactly these cell surface receptors cooperate and interact remains to be elucidated. Integrins have been shown to display extensive crosstalk with other signaling receptors, including RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivaska and Heino, 2011</xref>). Although integrins are involved in adhesion of virtually all cell types, the underlying signaling and recruitment of integrins to sites of adhesion in vivo is complex and not completely understood. It has been suggested that integrin and growth factor receptor crosstalk can occur by concomitant signaling, collaborative activation, or direct activation of associated signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivaska and Heino, 2011</xref>). For example, matrix-bound VEGF can induce complex formation between VEGFR2 and β1-integrin with concomitant targeting of β1-integrin to focal adhesions in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings of biochemical interaction and colocalization of Ret with the α/β-integrins <italic>mys</italic> and <italic>mew</italic> in C4da neuron dendrites argue in favor of direct receptor interaction and subsequent activation of a common signaling pathway.</p><p>Integrins and RTKs like Ret do share some of the same intracellular signaling components. These comprise, among others, the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, Pi3-Kinase (Pi3K), and Rho family GTPases including Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivaska and Heino, 2011</xref>). Previous studies provide evidence for Ret-integrin-Rac1 interplay in vitro showing that Ret can enhance integrin mediated adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cockburn et al., 2010</xref>) and induce Rac1 dependent lamellipodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukuda et al., 2002</xref>) in cell culture models. In primary chick motor neurons, Rac1 is involved in neurite outgrowth on the integrin substrates laminin and fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuhn et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, Rac1 has previously been shown to regulate dendrite branching in C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emoto et al., 2004</xref>), however a role in dendrite adhesion in vivo has not been described before. In our study, we show that Rac1 is required for dendrite-ECM adhesion similarly to what has been described for integrins and we genetically link Ret and integrin dependent adhesion with Rac1 function. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, MAPK, Src and PI3K can be activated by constitutively active Ret overexpression in the compound eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Read et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dar et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, novel inhibitors of Ret signaling targeting Raf, Src, and S6-Kinase (S6K) prevent lethality induced by Ret over-activation in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dar et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, S6K has been shown to be involved in dendrite growth but not tiling in C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koike-Kumagai et al., 2009</xref>). It remains to be shown if these pathways play a direct role in <italic>Ret</italic> function in dendrite adhesion and growth.</p><p>Notwithstanding important commonalities, <italic>Ret</italic> function in C4da neurons cannot be fully explained by crosstalk with integrins and <italic>rac1</italic>. Reduced dendritic field coverage, likely due to the observed increase in dendrite turnover, is only evident in <italic>Ret</italic> but not in integrin or <italic>rac1</italic> mutant C4da neurons. Moreover, increasing integrin expression in a <italic>Ret</italic> mutant background did not rescue dendrite coverage defects, albeit it prevented dendrite crossing. These findings indicate that Ret has additional functions in dendritic branch growth and stability that require as yet unknown extracellular and intracellular mediators. This is also supported by the aberrant F-actin localization in neurons lacking Ret. Here, Ret dependent intracellular effectors are likely important for F-actin assembly to support directed dendrite growth and stabilization, and their localization and activity might be deregulated in the absence of Ret.</p><p><italic>Drosophila Ret</italic> is a highly conserved molecule, its cognate vertebrate ligand GDNF, however is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Airaksinen et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ret can neither bind GDNF nor transduce GDNF signaling, although it has been shown to contain a functional tyrosine kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrescia et al., 2005</xref>). In mammals, the GFRα co-receptors are essential components of GDNF/Ret signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Runeberg-Roos and Saarma, 2007</xref>). A <italic>Drosophila</italic> GFR-like homolog (dGFRL) has recently been characterized and was found to function and interact with the NCAM homolog FasII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kallijärvi et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it appears that Ret's functional interaction partners in dendrite development differ significantly from the previously described co-factors in other systems. It is interesting to speculate that a yet undiscovered Ret ligand is involved in Ret mediated dendrite growth and branch stabilization, which might have implications for mammalian Ret function as well: due to its role in the maintenance of dopaminergic neurons and motor axon growth in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kramer et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2007</xref>), adhesion related signaling via integrins could well be important during these processes. Moreover, the formation of a dorsal root ganglia derived mechanosensory neurons and their afferent and efferent fiber growth and innervation depends on Ret expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourane et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luo et al., 2009</xref>).

The resulting antiserum was affinity purified against peptide 1 and used at a 1:1000 dilution. Peptide synthesis, antibody generation, and affinity purification were outsourced to Eurogentec.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry and antibodies</title><p>Larval filet preparation and staining was essentially performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2012</xref>). The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-phospho-Ret (1:50, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), mouse anti-GFP (1:100, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), mouse anti-mys (1:200, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, (DSHB), Iowa City, IO), mouse anti-mew (1:50, DSHB). Secondary DyLight or Alexa conjugated donkey antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Westgrove, PA) and were used at 1:400–1:1000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantitative immunohistochemistry of Ret</title><p>Larval filets of wildtype or <italic>Ret</italic> mutant animals carrying a C4da neuron specific marker (<italic>ppk-Gal4 &gt; CD4-tdGFP</italic>) were prepared and immunostained as described above with rabbit anti-phospho-Ret (1:50, Cell Signaling Technology) or guinea pig anti-Ret (1:1000) antibodies. We quantified the Ret antibody signal of C4da neuron somata in confocal image stacks and calculated signal over background ratios (ΔF/F) by subtracting averaged background signal flanking the C4da soma region (F). Statistical significance for the two genotypes was calculated using a two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell surface immunostaining of pHluorin-tagged Ret</title><p>For cell surface staining of pHluorin-Ret-mCherry, larval filets were prepared in Ringer solution and incubated with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:50 in Ringer solution, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 hr on ice. Filets were washed with Ringer solution (3 × 10 min at 4°C) and then fixed with 4% Formaldehyde/PBS for 15 min on ice. Subsequent steps including anti-mew and secondary antibody incubation were carried out in the presence of 0.3% Triton X-100 as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantitative Ret and integrin colocalization analysis</title><p>Third instar larval filet preparations immunostained for Ret and integrins were analyzed by confocal microscopy with high resolution using a high NA oil objective (Zeiss LSM700, 40×/NA1.3, z step size: 300 nm). Confocal stacks covering the soma and part of the dorsal field of ddaC neurons (xy dimension: 160 × 160 μm) were obtained and deconvoluted using a blind deconvolution algorithm with an adaptive PSF (AutoQuant, BitPlane AG, Zürich, Switzerland). Colocalization analysis was then performed on the deconvolved confocal stacks in 3D using the Imaris Coloc module (BitPlane AG). The GFP reporter signal (<italic>ppk-Gal4 &gt; UAS-CD8-GFP or UAS-CD4-tdGFP</italic>) was used to create a mask for the C4da neuron soma and dendrite signal to specifically analyze neuronal integrin and Ret signals. Ret and integrin signals were then automatically thresholded and colocalization was calculated (Pearson coefficients, n = 5 per genotype). Costes randomization was performed for all samples to ensure that the calculated colocalization coefficients between Ret and integrins are non-random (n = 100 iterations, p = 1 for all samples).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cell culture, immunocytochemistry and biochemistry</title><p>S2 cells were grown at 25°C in Schneider's <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium (Life Technologies) with 10%FBS and Glutamine/Pen/Strep. For experiments, cells were seeded in 6 well plates and transfected at 50% density in an adherent state using Transfectene (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). For S2 cell expression, UAS constructs were co-transfected with pActin-Gal4. The following constructs were used: pUAST-Ret-mCherry, pUAST-mys-3xflag-His, pUAST-mew.</p><p>For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were harvested 48 hr after transfection and lysed in 500 µl lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) for 20 min on ice. After 10 min/4°C/10.000×<italic>g</italic> centrifugation, supernatants were pre-incubated with mouse IgG Agarose (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min at 4°C, and then incubated with anti-flag M2 agarose beads (Sigma–Aldrich) for 4 hr at 4°C. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, the samples were denatured and analyzed on Tris-Acetate gels (Life Technologies) and Western blotting against Ret-mCherry (anti-DsRed, 1:1000, BD Clontech, Mountain Viev, CA) and mys (anti-flag M2, 1:10.000, Sigma).</p><p>For immunostaining, S2 cells were allowed to adhere to Concavalin A (Sigma–Aldrich) coated cover slips for 1 hr and subsequently fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde/PBS solution for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocked with 5% donkey serum/PBS. Primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-DsRed (1:500, BD Clontech), mouse anti-mew (1:100, DSHB), mouse anti-mys (1:100, DSHB). Primary antibodies were applied over night at 4°C in 5% donkey serum/PBS, while secondary donkey antibodies with conjugated DyLight fluorophores (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were subsequently incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were mounted and imaged by confocal microscopy (Leica SP5 and Olympus FV1000).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In vivo confocal microscopy and time lapse imaging</title><p>C4da neurons of third instar <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (72–100 hr AEL) were imaged alive by confocal microscopy (Leica SP5 or Olympus FV1000), using <italic>ppk-CD4-tdTomato</italic> or <italic>ppk-Gal4</italic>, <italic>UAS-CD4-tdGFP</italic> transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Vkg-GFP</italic> or <italic>trol-GFP</italic> trap lines labeling endogenous vkg or troll proteins with GFP were used to visualize the extracellular matrix. Confocal stacks were taken to image ddaC C4da neuron dendrite fields either with 20× (full ddaC field) or 40× oil objectives (dorsal ddaC field). For imaging dendrite-ECM interaction, two-color high resolution confocal stacks using a high NA oil objective (Leica or Olympus, 40×, NA 1.3) were taken with a step size of 300 nm.</p><p>For time lapse imaging of C4da neurons in wildtype and <italic>Ret</italic> mutant animals, <italic>ppk-Gal4</italic>, <italic>UAS-CD4-tdGFP</italic> embryos were collected on grape agar plates for 2 hr and allowed to develop at 25°C. Two C4da neurons per animal (abdominal segments a3 and a4) were imaged at 72 hr AEL, and the same neurons were imaged again 24 hr later (96 hr AEL). The imaged larvae were allowed to develop to adulthood to ensure that handling and imaging did not interfere with normal development.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of dendrite length, crossing, field coverage, and ECM interaction</title><p>Dendrites of C4da neurons were traced with the Imaris Filament Tracer module (BitPlane AG) using deconvoluted confocal stacks. Total dendritic length was calculated from the traces and Z-crossing points were counted and manually confirmed as non-contacting by visual inspection of the z-stack. The high resolution 3D reconstruction was done in Imaris. Dendritic field coverage was calculated essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parrish et al., 2009</xref>) by measuring the area covered by dendrites (polygon formed by connecting all dendritic terminals of the field) divided by the total segment area using Fiji/ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Statistical significance was calculated by comparison of all genotypes using a Mann–Whitney test (Origin Pro, Origin Lab, Northhampton, MA).</p><p>To quantify net dendrite growth/retraction, confocal Z-projections of the same neuron at 72 and 96 hr AEL were overlayed and adjusted for position and interstitial growth with bUnwarpJ (Fiji, ImageJ). Landmarks marking all major branch points were used to get accurate overlay images. Growing (branch is shorter at 72 hr than 96 hr AEL) and retracting (branch is longer at 72 hr than 96 hr AEL) portions of dendrites were traced and growth/retraction values were normalized to the total length of the unchanged portion of the dendritic tree at 96 hr AEL. Statistical significance was calculated using a Student's two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test.</p><p>Analysis of dendrite-ECM interaction was essentially performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, high resolution confocal stacks were deconvoluted using a blind deconvolution algorithm with an adaptive PSF (AutoQuant, BitPlane AG). Dendrites were traced semi-automatically using the Imaris Filament Tracer module (Bitplane) and thresholded colocalization of the ECM and dendrite signals was performed. Non-contacting and contacting portions of the dendritic tree were traced and verified manually. Percentages of detached dendrites were calculated by the ratios of detached vs total dendrite length. Statistical significance was calculated by comparison of all genotypes using a Mann–Whitney test (Origin Pro).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of LifeAct expression and distribution</title><p>The dorsal field of C4da ddaC neurons expressing LifeAct-mCherry with <italic>ppk-Gal4 &gt; CD4-tdGFP</italic> was imaged with confocal microscopy at the third instar larval stage (96–100 hr AEL). Acquired stacks were then processed with Fiji/ImageJ (NIH) to normalize the LifeAct signal to GFP expression using a previously described procedure with minor adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kardash et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, we used maximum projections of 2-color stacks and aligned the GFP and LifeAct channels using the TurboReg plugin (ImageJ). The LifeAct signal was thresholded automatically (ImageJ) and normalized to GFP levels using the RatioPlus plugin (ImageJ). For LifeAct quantification along major dendritic arbors, normalized intensity values were obtained by ROI tracing of 2 major branches per sample using the PlotProfile function (ImageJ, n = 5 per genotype). Statistical significance was then calculated by using an Allometric fitting function (y = a × x<sup>b</sup>, Origin Pro) for the intensity profiles of wildtype (average R<sup>2</sup> = 0.74) and Ret mutant (average R<sup>2</sup> = 0.79) samples and fit comparison of the two datasets (p &lt; 0.05, n = 5 per genotype, Origin Pro).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank: R Cagan for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ret cDNA, J Wildonger for generously sharing the <italic>UAS-LifeAct-mCherry</italic> transgene, and K Duncan for S2 cells; J Parrish, K Duncan, and F Calderon de Anda for comments on the manuscript, the Bloomington, Kyoto and VDRC stock centers for transgenic fly lines; the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB) and its contributors for the integrin antibodies.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript provides evidence that the Ret receptor is involved in controlling three aspects of dendrite growth: self-avoidance, ECM adhesion and field coverage. <italic>Ret</italic> is identified from an RNAi screen designed to search for receptors that regulate dendrite morphogenesis in cIVda neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <italic>Ret</italic> mutants exhibit increased dendritic crossovers, detachment from the ECM and reduced field coverage. <italic>Ret</italic> mutants also show increased growth dynamics and F-actin in dendrites. Evidence is presented to show that Ret associates with integrin and that <italic>rac1</italic> mediates downstream signalling. Integrin expression rescues the ECM detachment and the self-avoidance phenotypes but not the dendritic field coverage phenotype. The authors conclude that Ret is a novel receptor in the control of dendrite morphogenesis via integrin-dependent and -independent functions.</p><p>The reviewers found the finding that Ret is involved in multiple aspects of dendrite growth interesting and novel. The genetic evidence implicating Ret is very compelling, as is the genetic evidence linking Ret with integrin and <italic>rac1</italic> signaling. Some of the expression and colocalization data are less convincing (see specific comments below) and the reviewers called for some further quantitative analysis.</p><p>Specific comments: 1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the Ret mutant image appears to show positive granular labeling yet the text states that the Ret immunostaining is lost in the mutant. Although the signal appears to be in smaller granules than the WT, it is not entirely convincing that there is a significant difference between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>. It would be valuable to include a quantitative analysis of the signal in the WT and mutant.</p><p>2) In the subsection headed “Ret is a cell surface protein and interacts with integrins in dendrites”, the authors state that “we could not detect endogenous Ret in higher order dendrites due to limited antibody sensitivity and/or Ret expression levels”, so expression of a transgene, mCherry-Ret, was used to examine the cellular localization of Ret in dendrites and its colocalization with integrin. This is the weakest part of the manuscript. First, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the Ret-mCherry signal is abundant all along the entire dendrite and, therefore, it is bound to show some degree of 'colocalization' with any other molecule that is expressed in the dendrite at the level of resolution and analysis used. Second, the colocalization intensity plots appear to show only one small selected section of a single dendrite. This type of analysis is not very meaningful as it presents n=1 for each condition, is prone to bias (how was each particular section chosen?) and does not provide statistical data over many randomly chosen areas. A more rigorous level of quantitation that provides unbiased analysis over multiple sections of dendrites, giving the Pearson's coefficient values would strengthen the data.</p><p>3) The endogenous Ret staining seems fairly robust for the soma and proximal dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The authors could at least confirm Ret-integrin colocalization in the proximal dendrite/soma.</p><p>4) Related to the failure to detect endogenous Ret signal in higher order dendrites, can the authors exclude the possibility that Ret is not present here and that the dendritic phenotypes in the <italic>Ret</italic> mutant arise from loss of Ret function in the soma, rather than in the dendrites?</p><p>5) How do the authors explain the phenotype? It appears that only late developing, higher order branches are affected by mutations in Ret and its interactions with integrin subunits. Is there a temporal window of action that limits defects to these, or are there other aspects that need investigating?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05491.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref><italic>, the Ret mutant image appears to show positive granular labeling yet the text states that the Ret immunostaining is lost in the mutant.

We find that there is indeed a significant difference in anti-phospho-Ret signals between control and <italic>Ret</italic> mutant C4da neurons and have now included the quantitative analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). Due to the low signal to noise however we have not used this antibody for further studies. Instead, we generated a new Ret specific antibody with higher sensitivity. By using this new antibody, we have added immunostainings of control and <italic>Ret</italic> mutant animals showing specific anti-Ret signal in C4da neurons and quantified the intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-F</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) In the subsection headed</italic> “<italic>Ret is a cell surface protein and interacts with integrins in dendrites</italic>”<italic>, the authors state that</italic> “<italic>we could not detect endogenous Ret in higher order dendrites due to limited antibody sensitivity and/or Ret expression levels</italic>”<italic>, so expression of a transgene, mCherry-Ret, was used to examine the cellular localization of Ret in dendrites and its colocalization with integrin.

Using our new Ret antibody we could show that endogenous Ret is indeed present throughout the dendritic arbor of C4da neurons, even in high order branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Thus endogenous Ret and overexpressed Ret-mCherry have a similar distribution within dendrites (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Although, with the very broad distribution of overexpressed Ret, there is bound to be some degree of colocalization between Ret and any other protein in dendrites, the resolution of our images is not the limiting factor (156x156x300 nm voxels). We did address this issue by extensively quantifying the degree of colocalization between endogenous or overexpressed Ret and integrins in C4da showing a robust positive correlation between Ret and integrin localization (please see responses below).</p><p><italic>Second, the colocalization intensity plots appear to show only one small selected section of a single dendrite. This type of analysis is not very meaningful as it presents n=1 for each condition, is prone to bias (how was each particular section chosen?) and does not provide statistical data over many randomly chosen areas. A more rigorous level of quantitation that provides unbiased analysis over multiple sections of dendrites, giving the Pearson's coefficient values would strengthen the data</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate this helpful comment and suggestion. Our intention with the intensity plots was to illustrate the signal distribution of Ret and integrins in low and high order branches. We agree that this is not quantitatively meaningful and have thus included extensive colocalization analysis for the original data co-expressing Ret-mCherry and integrins in C4da neurons, (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2 fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 2 and 3</xref>). We analyzed colocalization in 3D in the soma region and all dendrites of C4da neurons in high resolution confocal image stacks (160x160 μm fields) that were deconvolved and controlled for signal intensities and bleed-through (please see new section in Material and methods for details). We now provide Pearson coefficient analysis of entire C4da neuron soma and dorsal dendrite fields. Our analysis revealed that there is indeed a positive correlation of Ret and integrin signals in C4da neurons based on Pearson coefficients suggesting that a meaningful subset of Ret and integrins are colocalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, F</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The endogenous Ret staining seems fairly robust for the soma and proximal dendrite (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref><italic>). The authors could at least confirm Ret-integrin colocalization in the proximal dendrite/soma</italic>.</p><p>We agree that endogenous colocalization is a more significant measure for protein proximity and interaction. We thus used our newly developed Ret antibody for colocalization analyses. Unfortunately, we could not circumvent integrin overexpression in C4da neurons, as the epithelial expression of <italic>mys</italic> and <italic>mew</italic> is significantly higher than in C4da neurons thus preventing us to visualize it directly, even in the soma region. Only upon integrin overexpression we could unambiguously discern the neuronal signal and used optimized conditions to analyze colocalization with endogenous Ret. The new data and analysis is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 (4C-F)</xref>. Similar to the Ret/integrin co-overexpression results, we did find significant colocalization of endogenous Ret and integrins in the C4da soma and in dendrites. We show representative results using colocalization channels, line scan Z stacks and line intensity plots for <italic>Ret/mys</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and <italic>Ret/mew</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition, quantitative assessment of Pearson coefficients (as described in #2) showed a consistently positive correlation of Ret and integrin colocalization in C4da neuron somata and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In addition, we found that endogenous Ret localizes preferentially to the basal side of dendrites which is in contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C’, C’’</xref>). Coincidentally, we also detect most of the colocalized Ret-integrin signal facing the ECM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D’, E’</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).</p><p>Taken together with our additional genetic and biochemical evidence, we believe that our data supports the view that a subset of Ret and integrins interacts in dendrites to regulate dendrite-ECM adhesion. However, we would like to stress that we do not think that Ret and integrins are constitutive interaction partners, but rather transiently interacting at specific sites to promote adhesion upon signaling. Although this is speculative there is precedence in the literature for transient integrin-RTK interaction and recruitment to adhesion sites (see paragraph 4 of our Discussion).</p><p><italic>4) Related to the failure to detect endogenous Ret signal in higher order dendrites, can the authors exclude the possibility that Ret is not present here and that the dendritic phenotypes in the</italic> Ret <italic>mutant arise from loss of Ret function in the soma, rather than in the dendrites</italic>?</p><p>The reviewers raised an interesting point here. We believe that our new data strongly argues in favor of Ret having a function in dendrites. Firstly, our endogenous Ret staining now shows specific presence of Ret in all dendrites of C4da neurons. Secondly, our <italic>Ret</italic> mutant still displayed some somatic Ret expression but dendritic Ret levels dropped below the detection limit. Nonetheless, striking dendrite phenotypes are seen in this background. Although we cannot and would not like to exclude that somatic Ret has an important function, we believe that these data argue in favor of Ret being required in dendrites to regulate adhesion and dendrite dynamics.</p><p><italic>5) How do the authors explain the phenotype? It appears that only late developing, higher order branches are affected by mutations in Ret and its interactions with integrin subunits. Is there a temporal window of action that limits defects to these, or are there other aspects that need investigating</italic>?</p><p>This is an interesting point. Indeed, the loss of Ret seems to mostly affect later developing terminal dendrites. However, dendrite crossing and growth defects are already evident at earlier stages (at least at 48h AEL). We observed numerous stretches of lower order dendrites that were detached from the ECM at the third instar stage. Whether Ret is actually required for maintaining dendrite-ECM attachment or whether these dendrites were already detached when they were originally growing remains to be investigated. Although technically challenging, this would be feasible and interesting to do in future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
