addressing key biological questions. Current modifications of this methodology to temporally induce transgene expression require temperature changes or exposure to exogenous compounds, both of which have been shown to have detrimental effects on physiological processes. The recently described auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES) utilizes the plant hormone auxin to induce transgene expression and is proposed to be the least toxic compound for genetic manipulation, with no obvious effects on <italic>Drosophila</italic> development and survival in one wild-type strain. Here, we show that auxin delays larval development in another widely used fly strain, and that short- and long-term auxin exposure in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> induces observable changes in physiology and feeding behavior. We further reveal a dosage response to adult survival upon auxin exposure, and that the recommended auxin concentration for AGES alters feeding activity. Furthermore, auxin-fed male and female flies exhibit a significant decrease in triglyceride levels and display altered transcription of fatty acid metabolism genes. Although fatty acid metabolism is disrupted, auxin does not significantly impact adult female fecundity or progeny survival, suggesting AGES may be an ideal methodology for studying limited biological processes. These results emphasize that experiments using temporal binary systems must be carefully designed and controlled to avoid confounding effects and misinterpretation of results.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>toxicology</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>triglyceride</kwd><kwd>oogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM150517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weaver</surname><given-names>Lesley N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 GM127605</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weaver</surname><given-names>Lesley N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM119557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tennessen</surname><given-names>Jason M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-153072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rideout</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> exposed to auxin at the recommended concentrations for the AGES transgene expression system display defects in feeding behavior, have altered metabolic transcripts, and have reduced triacylglyceride levels.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The intricate dissection of cell-type-specific processes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is largely dependent on the yeast-derived <italic>Gal4/UAS</italic> binary system, which allows manipulation of biological pathways in a spatial and temporal manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>). This methodology utilizes the Gal4 transcription factor that is under control of a tissue-specific promoter to induce transgene expression downstream of an <underline>U</underline>pstream <underline>A</underline>ctivating <underline>S</underline>equence (UAS). Conditional control of gene expression using changes in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>) or feeding of small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Potter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McClure et al., 2022</xref>) restricts Gal4 activity to specific developmental timepoints. For example, use of a temperature sensitive <italic>Gal80</italic> mutant transgene (<italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>, an inhibitor of Gal4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Douglas and Hawthorne, 1966</xref>) allows for temporal control of Gal4 activity with a simple shift to the <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> restrictive temperature (29Â°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, drug-inducible systems such as <italic>GeneSwitch</italic> and the <italic>Q-system</italic> control temporal and reversible transgene expression with administration of RU486 or quinic acid, respectively, without the need to rear flies at the <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> permissive temperature (18Â°C). These modifications to the <italic>Gal4/UAS</italic> system have improved the capability to characterize the roles of essential biological pathways in a tissue-specific manner while avoiding lethality at key developmental stages.</p><p>Despite these advancements, each methodology has caveats that must be considered. For example, rearing flies containing <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> at 18Â°C nearly doubles the developmental time from egg to adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Powsner, 1935</xref>). In addition, the relatively high restrictive temperature needed to inactivate Gal80<sup>ts</sup> has adverse effects on physiological processes including circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parisky et al., 2016</xref>), aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miquel et al., 1976</xref>), and progeny survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gandara and Drummond-Barbosa, 2022</xref>). Similarly, use of RU486 has been demonstrated to repress muscle-specific mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robles-Murguia et al., 2019</xref>) and lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2021</xref>), among other defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamada et al., 2017</xref>), making the <italic>GeneSwitch</italic> system non-ideal for certain experiments. Although designed to provide flexibility in experimental design and remove temperature-related defects, the alterations in physiology, behavior, and lifespan [some of which are not shared between the sexes; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landis et al., 2015</xref>)] due to RU486 feeding impose difficulties in data interpretation.</p><p>The <underline>a</underline>uxin-inducible <underline>g</underline>ene <underline>e</underline>xpression <underline>s</underline>ystem (AGES) was recently developed as an alternative method to induce transgene expression and is compatible with the breadth of <italic>Gal4</italic> transgenic lines available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McClure et al., 2022</xref>). In this system, <italic>Gal80</italic> is fused to auxin-inducible degron tags that target Gal80 for degradation, allowing for Gal4-mediated transgene induction upon auxin consumption. This system poses substantial advantages. For example, flies can be reared at the optimal temperature for development (25Â°C) and transgene expression is strictly induced with supplementation of auxin to the media. In addition, both control and experimental animals are genetically identical (similar to the <italic>GeneSwitch</italic> and <italic>Q-system</italic>), thus minimizing differences that may arise due to genetic variation.</p><p>However, there is emerging evidence that insects can synthesize auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yokoyama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tokuda et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that there may be important biological roles for this hormone in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. While exposure to 10 mM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (the widely employed synthetic hormone in the auxin family and hereafter referred to as âauxinâ) has been reported to have no effect on insect development, survival, or movement in a wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McClure et al., 2022</xref>), it remains unclear whether auxin exposure affects development in other commonly used <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic background strains. It is also unknown whether increased auxin exposure in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> results in subtle defects in physiological processes that may confound experimental interpretations. In this study, we sought to test whether auxin affects larval development in additional strains, and to determine whether auxin exposure in adults leads to defects in metabolism, the transcriptome, and oogenesis. We found that recommended concentrations of auxin for AGES disrupt feeding behavior, whereas increasing levels of auxin results in physiological changes and lethality. Additionally, we found that auxin exposure delays larval development, decreases triglyceride levels, and alters the transcriptomic profile of fatty acid metabolism genes in both sexes. Finally, despite the decrease in circulating lipids, auxin does not severely disrupt processes of oogenesis or progeny survival, suggesting AGES may be an appropriate method to use for some studies. Our results highlight changes in development and physiology that should be considered when using auxin to manipulate gene and protein expression in larval and adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as well as other factors researchers should account for in experimental design using temporal control of the <italic>Gal4/UAS</italic> system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> males have increased sensitivity to auxin compared to females</title><p>We sought to utilize the AGES expression system in our laboratory for controlling gene expression and began by determining whether we could recapitulate Gal4 expression at levels like that of <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>. We recombined the auxin-inducible degron line (<italic>AGES</italic>) with <italic>3.1Lsp2-Gal4</italic> (<italic>3.1Lsp2-Gal4<sup>AGES</sup></italic>) to drive the expression of <italic>UAS-nucGFP</italic> in adult female adipocytes compared to the previously described <italic>3.1Lsp2-Gal4</italic> recombined with <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> (<italic>3.1Lsp2Gal4<sup>ts</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>). Zero- to two-day-old females of each genotype were fed inactive yeast paste for 2 days (pre-treatment) prior to Gal4 induction. Gal4 expression was induced in females carrying the <italic>AGES</italic> transgene by feeding solid food supplemented with inactive wet yeast paste containing 0 mM to the recommended dose of 10 mM auxin (inactive yeast was used to prevent auxin metabolism by live yeast) for 2 days; whereas females carrying the <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> transgene were shifted from 18 to 29Â°C for 2 days and the relative expression of <italic>GFP</italic> transcripts were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). There was minimal âleakyâ Gal4 expression with <italic>3.1Lsp2-Gal4<sup>AGES</sup></italic> fed food without auxin (0 mM); whereas 5 and 10 mM auxin-induced <italic>nucGFP</italic> expression at levels similar to that of <italic>3.1Lsp2-Gal4<sup>ts</sup></italic>. Furthermore, we found that removal of auxin using <italic>3.1Lsp2-Gal4<sup>AGES</sup></italic> inactivated Gal4 activity at a faster rate than <italic>3.1Lsp2-Gal4<sup>ts</sup></italic> (shifted back to 18Â°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, Gal4 expression using AGES can be recapitulated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McClure et al., 2022</xref>) and is faster at repressing transgene activation compared to <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>.</p><p>Because the wild-type strain <italic>Canton-S</italic> was previously used to monitor development and survival in flies reared on auxin-containing food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McClure et al., 2022</xref>), we monitored larval development in flies from the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> genotype, a widely used genetic background strain in <italic>Drosophila</italic> biology. When we measured the time between egg laying and pupariation in a mixed-sex group of larvae reared on yeastâsugarâcornmeal food supplemented with (5 mM) or without (0 mM) auxin, we found that the time to pupariation was longer in auxin-fed larvae than in larvae raised without auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests that the recommended dose of auxin delays larval development in at least one widely used <italic>Drosophila</italic> strain, indicating that genetic background is an important consideration when using the AGES system for studies at the larval stage of development.</p><p>Given these larval phenotypes, we next wanted to determine whether auxin exposure induces physiological changes in adults. Because genetic variation can influence physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shorter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evangelou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damschroder et al., 2020</xref>), we used multiple strains to test the effects of auxin on physiology. We first compared the <italic>AGES</italic> line and the strain into which the <italic>AGES</italic> transgene was introduced (<italic>VK00040</italic>) in our experiments. We also used <italic>Oregon-R</italic> [the wild-type strain used for the ModENCODE project; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roy et al., 2010</xref>)] as an additional control. We incubated 4- to 6-day-old adult males and females of each genotype in vials supplemented with chromatography paper soaked with liquid food containing 0 to 350 mM auxin and measured lethality after 48 hr of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Compared to the 0 mM control, both males and females showed increased susceptibility to moderate concentrations of auxin (20â30 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, we observed sex differences in sensitivity to auxin exposure, with females able to tolerate higher concentrations relative to males. For example, the benchmark dose (BMD; the concentration that produces a change in the response) in males was lower than that of females in each genotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, both <italic>AGES</italic> males and females had a higher BMD upon auxin exposure relative to the <italic>VK00040</italic> injection and <italic>Oregon-R</italic> lines, suggesting that the <italic>AGES</italic> transgene may confer resistance to auxin toxicity. These results suggest that exposure to auxin in both males and females results in lethality, where males have a higher susceptibility to auxin exposure compared to females.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Increased auxin exposure in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> decreases survival and alters feeding behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon schematic of auxin exposure feeding protocol.

To determine whether feeding behavior could account for sex differences in the survival response to auxin, we analyzed the food consumption of adult male and female flies exposed to 0 or 10 mM auxin using the Fly Liquid-Food Interaction Counter (FLIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ro et al., 2014</xref>) over a 24-hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâG</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2BâE</xref>). In both feeding conditions, females exhibited more feeding events relative to males in all tested genotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

These results are consistent with previous reports that females eat more than males on normal food diets with yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong et al., 2009</xref>). However, our results also suggest that females exposed to auxin may have an increased survival due to fewer interactions with the food relative to adult males, resulting in differential auxin sensitivity.

We note that the lack of sex difference in lipid levels is likely due to exposing adults to auxin prior to the onset of maleâfemale differences in TAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wat et al., 2020</xref>). To determine whether auxin influences TAG in additional contexts, we transferred newly eclosed virgin <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> males and females to a yeastâsugarâcornmeal diet supplemented with either 0 mM or the recommended dose of 10 mM auxin and measured TAG levels after 5 days.

This suggests that auxin has a stronger effect on female TAG levels, in line with our data showing a female-biased reduction in food interactions on auxin-supplemented medium.</p><p>We next asked whether this effect on TAG levels was reversible. We exposed 0-day-old male and female flies to diets with 0 or 10 mM auxin for 5 days, and then measured TAG levels after shifting the flies to food supplemented with no auxin for five additional days. We found that females but not males showed a strong trend toward recovery of whole-body TAG levels after shifting the flies back to food with no auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2I</xref>), suggesting the effect of auxin feeding on body fat were reversible only in females.

Therefore, it is possible that in response to auxin, triglycerides are mobilized by an unknown mechanism resulting in upregulation of fatty acid metabolism and attenuation of lipid breakdown. It is also possible that decreased interactions or feeding time with auxin-containing food promotes fasting, resulting in decreased TAG and lipid synthesis. Collectively, these results suggest that auxin exposure in adults significantly alters the transcriptome to adjust to decreased fatty acid metabolism and lipid stores.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Lipid metabolism and detoxification transcripts are significantly altered in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> in response to auxin exposure.</title><p>Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes graphing the statistical significance [âlog<sub>10</sub>(p<sub>adj</sub>)] against the magnitude of differential expression (log<sub>2</sub> fold change) in females (<bold>A, B</bold>) or males (<bold>C, D</bold>) of the <italic>VK00040</italic> or <italic>AGES</italic> line.

Likewise, our findings herein indicate that current methods requiring auxin for temporal transgene induction or protein degradation may work well to study many biological processes, but may not be the ideal system for the study of lipogenesis or other metabolic processes dependent on lipid content.

Finally, researchers should ensure that non-specific transgene controls used in the same conditions as the experimental (e.g., 0 versus 10 mM auxin) do not have phenotypes for physiological outputs of interest and ensure that changes in physiology that could confound result interpretations are accounted for.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Oregon-R</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC:25211</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC:3605</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>w<sup>1118</sup>; tubP-TIR1-T2A-Gal80.AID</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC:92470</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>y<sup>1</sup> w<sup>1118</sup>; VK00040/TM6B</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC:9755</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>3.1Lsp2-Gal4<sup>ts</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>3.1Lsp2-Gal4<sup>AGES</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fly line maintained in L.

Samples were washed in PBST and incubated at room temperature for 2 hr with 1:200 Alexa Fluor 488- or 568-conjugated goat-species-specific secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) in blocking solution. Samples were then washed three times for 15 min and mounted in Vectashield containing 1.5 Âµg/ml 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories) and imaged using a Leica SP8 confocal.</p><p>Cap cells and GSCs were identified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weaver and Drummond-Barbosa, 2019</xref>), and two-way ANOVA with interaction (GraphPad Prism) was used to calculate the statistical significance of any differences among genotypes in the rate of cap cell or GSC loss from at least three independent experiments, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>). Progression through vitellogenesis was assessed using DAPI staining, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weaver and Drummond-Barbosa, 2019</xref>). Three independent experiments were performed and subjected to a Studentâs <italic>t-</italic>test for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>ApopTag assays</title><p>To detect dying germline cysts, the ApopTag Indirect In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore Sigma) was used according to the manufacturerâs instructions as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weaver and Drummond-Barbosa, 2019</xref>). Briefly, fixed and teased ovaries were rinsed in equilibration buffer twice for 5 min each at room temperature. Samples were incubated in 100 Âµl TdT solution at 37Â°C for 1 hr with mixing at 15-min intervals. Ovaries were washed three times in 1Ã PBS followed by incubation in anti-digoxigenin conjugate for 30 min at room temperature protected from light. Samples were washed four times in 1Ã PBS and processed for immunofluorescence as described above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Performed experiments and contributed to data analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Performed experiments, contributed to data analysis, provided writing for the original draft, and provided edits</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Performed experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Performed experiments and provided comments on the original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Performed experiments and provided comments on the original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Performed metabolomics analysis and provided comments on the original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervised and performed metabolomics analysis.

Overall, the experiments were well designed and carefully executed. The results were quantified with appropriate statistical analyses. The paper was also well written and the results were presented logically. Their findings demonstrate that auxin-fed flies have significantly lower triglyceride levels than the control flies using Ultra High-pressure Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-MS)-based metabolomics assays. Further transcriptome analyses using the whole flies show changes of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. However, female oogenesis and fecundity do not seem to be affected, at least using the current assays. These results indicate that auxin may not be used in experiments involving lipid-related metabolism, but could be appropriate to be applied for other biological processes. Researchers need to be careful when applying this strategy in their own experimental design and should perform proper controls.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91953.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fleck</surname><given-names>Sophie A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indiana University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bloomington</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Biswas</surname><given-names>Puja</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of British Columbia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Vancouver</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dewitt</surname><given-names>Emily D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indiana University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bloomington</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Knuteson</surname><given-names>Rebecca L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indiana University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bloomington</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Eisman</surname><given-names>Robert C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indiana University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bloomington</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nemkov</surname><given-names>Travis</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>D'Alessandro</surname><given-names>Angelo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tennessen</surname><given-names>Jason M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indiana University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bloomington</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rideout</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of British Columbia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Vancouver</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Weaver</surname><given-names>Lesley N</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indiana University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bloomington</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>REVIEWER 1:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 stated: âThe authors have provided strong evidence that high levels of auxin exposure perturb feeding behavior, survival rates, lipid metabolism, and gene expression patterns, providing a cautionary note for the field in using this technology. They also concluded that âoverall, the experiments were suitably designed with appropriate sample size and data analysis methods.â</p><p>Reviewer 1 provided the following recommendations for improvement, which are addressed below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 1: âAlthough authors showed that auxin causes gene expression changes including the possible alteration of Gal4 expression levels, no cell-type-specific data is provided. It would be informative to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> field if the authors could examine major Gal4 drivers in their expression levels, such as the ones used in studying metabolism and oogenesis.â</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that cell-type specific Gal4 expression should be thoroughly analyzed by scientists in the community wishing to use the current auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES) in their studies; however, those analyses are beyond the scope of our manuscript. There are many tissues and cell types that are used to study metabolism and oogenesis (e.g., muscle, adipocytes, oenocytes, multiple cell types in the gut, multiple cell types in the ovary), and Gal4 expression patterns could be different depending on age, sex, and diet. It is therefore impossible for us to pinpoint one or two key tissues important for regulating lipid levels and would be a significant investment of time. We believe that each researcher should thoroughly check the Gal4 expression pattern for their specific tissue of interest under their normal standard or altered food conditions. As this reviewer pointed out, our current study provides a cautionary note for the field in using this technology. Nevertheless, we have provided a reference to a recent micropub (Hawley et al; PMID: 37396791) which describes neuronal Gal4 expression patterns comparing the AGES and temporal and regional gene expression targeting (TARGET) systems and updated the text in lines 539-544 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2: âAlthough the authors briefly mentioned aging research, feeding behavior, and lipid metabolism, RNA-seq data are provided only for short-term treatment (2 days). The ovary phenotype was examined with long-term treatment (15 days). It would be informative if the authors could also show other long-term treatment data.â</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully point out to the reviewer that a 5-day auxin feeding assay was provided in Figure S4H, which reproduces the data provided for the 2-day auxin treatment. In addition, the original AGES paper (McClure et al, PMID: 35363137) provided adult survival data that extended to 80 days. In our updated manuscript, we have provided data for a 10-day auxin treatment that also addresses Point #4 below regarding whether the decrease in lipid levels upon auxin feeding is reversible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3: âThe auxin used in this work is a more water-soluble version and at a high concentration (10 mM). In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> system, researchers are using a much lower concentration of auxin typically at 1 mM. Therefore, the discussion of their results in terms of potential impacts on other experimental systems should be done carefully. It would be helpful to know what impacts might be observed at a lower concentration of auxin. The recommendation would be that the authors add the 1 mM auxin data point to key elements of their analysis.â</p></disp-quote><p>The concentration of 10 mM auxin used in our study is the recommended dose to use in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (see McClure et al) and has been used in at least one additional study (Hawley et al). We also would like to point out that other systems (e.g., <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mice) have many differences in physiology and therefore the concentration of auxin used to elicit a response are likely to be different (e.g., 71.4 mM final concentration is the recommended concentration used in mice; Macdonald et al; PMID: 35736539). We have merely suggested that researchers using auxin for protein degradation should carefully check whether lipid levels (or other physiological processes of interest) are altered upon auxin feeding (or soaking) alone compared to a 0 mM auxin control. The text in lines 467-470 has been altered to reflect this. In addition, the specific recommended dose for <italic>Drosophila</italic> is highlighted and referenced in multiple places (i.e., methods and results and discussion) throughout the updated text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 4: âAnother related question is whether these detected changes are reversible or not after exposure to auxin at different concentrations. This would be informative for researchers to better design their temporally controlled experiments.â</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have provided the data in Figure S4I. Briefly, we found that after a 5-day treatment of auxin, removal of auxin for an additional 5 days does not recover lipid levels to those of control animals never exposed to auxin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 5: âIt would also be helpful to know whether spermatogenesis is affected or not.â</p></disp-quote><p>Although this would be an interesting developmental process to determine if affected by auxin exposure, we believe that these analyses are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 6: âA few other points include changing the nomenclature and validating some of the key genes shown in Figure 3 using quantitative RT-PCR experiments with the tissues where the affected genes are known to be expressed and functional.â</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have provided qRT-PCR analysis using whole body samples and this data is now provided in the new Figure S8. We used whole-body samples for the qRT-PCR analysis because it would be impossible to pinpoint the specific tissue the differentially regulated genes are required for eliciting the response to auxin exposure. For example, according to Flybase (flybase.org) GstE3 transcripts are moderately to highly expressed in 15 of the 23 cell types annotated by the Fly Cell Atlas project (Li et al; PMID: 35239393).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>REVIEWER 2:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 stated: âThe authors provide evidence of several Auxin effects. Experiments are suitably designed with appropriate sample size and data analysis methods.â</p><p>This reviewer expressed the following concerns, which are addressed below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 1: âThe provided information is limited and not very helpful for many applications. For example, although authors briefly mentioned aging research, feeding behavior, and lipid data, RNA seq data are provided only for short-term (48 hours) treatment. Especially, since ovary phenotype was examined with long-term treatment (15 days), authors should also show other data for long-term treatment as well.â</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Point #2 of Reviewer 1 regarding long-term treatment experiments. Furthermore, although the ending timepoint for the ovarian analyses is 15 days, we also provide analysis at shorter time points (e.g., daily analysis for egg counts, 5 and 10 day timepoints for fixed sample analyses).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2: âAlthough the authors show that Auxin causes a change in gene expression patterns and suggests the possible alteration of Gal4 expression levels, no cell-type-specific data is provided. It would be informative if the authors could examine the expression level of major Gal4 drivers. Authors should discuss how severe these changes are by comparing them with other treatments or conditions, such as starvation or mutant data (ideally, comparing with reported data or their own data if any?).â</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Point #1 from Reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>REVIEWER 3:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 3 stated that they âfound the study to be carefully doneâ and âthis study will be of interest to researchers using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system, especially those focusing on fatty acid metabolism or physiology.â</p><p>Reviewer 3 also had the following minor points, which are addressed below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 1: âAuxin, actually 1-naphthaleneaceid acid here, which is a more water-soluble version of auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) is used at what I consider to be a high concentration-10 mM. The problem I have is that the authors are discussing their results in terms of potential impacts on other experimental systems. At least for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, I think this is not a reasonable extension of the current dataset. In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> system, researchers are using 1 mM auxin. The authors note that their RNA-seq results suggest a xenobiotic response. Could this apparent xenobiotic response be due to a metabolic byproduct following auxin administration at high concentrations? Figure S1A shows that there is quite a robust transcriptional response at 1 mM auxin. It would be helpful to know what impacts might be observed at this lower concentration in which the transcriptional induction could be used in the context of biologically meaningful experiments. The recommendation would be that the authors add the 1 mM auxin data point to key elements of their analysis.â</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the comparisons to other model organisms, we refer to our response to Point #3 from Reviewer 1. We also point out that although there is a robust response to 1 mM auxin using the 3.1Lsp2-Gal4 driver, 1 mM is not sufficient for a robust response using additional driver lines in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (see Hawley et al). It is possible that the xenobiotic response is due to using the recommended dose of auxin (McClure et al).</p><p>However, given the fact that researchers are currently using the 10 mM dose for experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we believe that the 10 mM transcription dataset is the most relevant. Nevertheless, we do agree that researchers who choose to use lower concentrations of auxin in the future should carefully look at whether any transcriptional induction alters physiological processes of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2: âThis reviewer was confused by the genetic nomenclature the authors use. The authors have chosen to use the designation 3.1Lsp2-Gal4 (3.1Lsp2-Gal4AID). I think this is potentially confusing because a reader might think that it is the Gal4 transcription factor that is the direct target of auxin- and TIR1-mediated protein degradation, as I initially did. Rather, it is the Gal80 repressor protein that is the direct target. The authors might consider a nomenclature that is more reflective of how this system works. It would also be helpful if the full genotypes of strains were included in each figure legend.â</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the nomenclature confusion in our original submission. We have changed our âAIDâ nomenclature throughout the manuscript to âAGES,â which is the nomenclature used in McClure et al. We respectfully note that the traditional nomenclature for using the temperature-sensitive Gal80 system is Gal80ts or adding the âtsâ superscript to the Gal4 line used (e.g., 3.1Lsp2ts).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3: âThe RNA-seq dataset does not appear to be validated by RT-PCR experiments. The authors should consider validating some of the key genes shown in Figure 3 using quantitative RT-PCR experiments, potentially adding a 1 mM auxin data point.â</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Point #6 to Reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>REVIEWER 4:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 4 stated: âOverall, the experiments were well-designed and carefully executed. The results were quantified with appropriate statistical analyses. The paper was also well-written and the results were presented logically.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE AUTHORS:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We have further addressed reviewer recommendations below. Thank you again, for your critique of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>REVIEWER 2:</bold></p><p>As I mentioned in my public review, long-term treatment data would be especially helpful.
