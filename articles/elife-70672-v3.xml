and transcriptional regulation. <italic>Tet1</italic> deficient mice display the defects of murine glucose metabolism. However, the role of TET1 in metabolic homeostasis keeps unknown. Here, our finding demonstrates that hepatic TET1 physically interacts with silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1) <italic>via</italic> its C-terminal and activates its deacetylase activity, further regulating the acetylation-dependent cellular translocalization of transcriptional factors PGC-1α and FOXO1, resulting in the activation of hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression that includes <italic>PPARGC1A</italic>, <italic>G6PC</italic>, and <italic>SLC2A4</italic>. Importantly, the hepatic gluconeogenic gene activation program induced by fasting is inhibited in <italic>Tet1</italic> heterozygous mice livers. The adenosine 5’-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators metformin or AICAR—two compounds that mimic fasting—elevate hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression dependent on in turn activation of the AMPK-TET1-SIRT1 axis. Collectively, our study identifies TET1 as a SIRT1 coactivator and demonstrates that the AMPK-TET1-SIRT1 axis represents a potential mechanism or therapeutic target for glucose metabolism or metabolic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TET1</kwd><kwd>SIRT1</kwd><kwd>acetylation modification</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>glucose metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81760160</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Jianing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Startup Fund for Scholars of Gannan Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QD201605</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Jianing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovative Team of Gannan Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TD201708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Jianing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Open Project of Key Laboratory of Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases, Ministry of Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XN201807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Jianing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JiangXi Provincial Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20202BAB206086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Jianing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JiangXi Provincial Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20171ACB21001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Chunbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JiangXi Provincial Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20171BCB23029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Chunbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82072302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Jianing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A series of experiments at the molecular level reveal the underlying mechanism of how a gene activates liver glucose production to regulate the blood glucose metabolism in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1), as a member of the Tet family, has the capacity to convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in a 2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent manner and is involved in DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koivunen and Laukka, 2018</xref>). Many studies suggest that <italic>Tet1</italic> heterozygous mice exhibit variable phenotypes, including placental, fetal, and postnatal growth defects, as well as early embryonic lethality, partly caused by imprinted gene dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). Tet2 has also recently been associated with the glucose-AMPK-TET2-5hmC axis signaling pathway, linking the level of extracellular glucose to the dynamic epigenetic regulation of 5hmC with implications in diabetes and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Although there are many studies on the DNA demethylation function of TET1, few studies have specifically evaluated the regulation and function of TET1 in glucose homeostasis.</p><p>Silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1) is an enzyme that mediates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylation of target substrates. Due to its ability to modify many transcriptional factors and co-factors involved in glucose homeostasis, hepatic SIRT1 is referred to as a key metabolic regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang and Guarente, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). In response to fasting or calorie restriction, hepatic SIRT1-mediated deacetylation and activation of PGC-1α improve glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rodgers et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, the protein PGC-1α together with FOXO1—a crucial regulatory transcriptional factor in various metabolic processes—play critical roles in the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asher and Schibler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Housley et al., 2009</xref>), supporting the notion that the hepatic SIRT1-PGC-1α/FOXO1 axis is part of the classic metabolic sensing network.</p><p>Mechanically, the deacetylation of PGC-1α or FOXO1 modulated by SIRT1 is tightly linked with enhanced transcriptional activation in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, resulting in increased hepatic glucose production and further contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rodgers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Puigserver et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feige and Auwerx, 2007</xref>). In response to fasting, adenosine 5’-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)—another metabolic sensor—can be activated by phosphorylation of its Ser/Thr 172 residue, and then phosphorylated AMPK can directly modulate SIRT1 activation regarding PGC-1α deacetylation and further activate the glucose metabolism pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cantó et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cantó and Auwerx, 2009</xref>). Recent insight from different in vivo transgenic models suggests that AMPK, SIRT1, and PGC-1α/FOXO1 act as an orchestrated network to improve metabolic fitness.</p><p>Here, we directly link TET1 activation to the induction of gene expression in glucose metabolism and downstream metabolic programs, thereby defining a critical regulatory axis among AMPK, SIRT1, and PGC-1α/FOXO1. Mechanically, TET1 has a critical effect in mice on glucose metabolism by directly interacting with SIRT1 and increasing the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 on PGC-1α/FOXO1. The SIRT1-mediated acetylation-dependent translocalization PGC-1α/FOXO1 enhances gene expression in gluconeogenesis signaling pathways, ultimately leading to regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism. Importantly, <italic>Tet1</italic> heterozygous mice exhibit the defects of blood glucose homeostasis in response to fasting or metformin injections. In conclusion, our work identifies Tet1 as an important metabolic regulator in liver cells and proposes a potential pathway that plays a critical role in regulating glucose homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tet1 deficiency disrupts murine glucose metabolism</title><p>Since <italic>Tet1</italic> homozygous mice (<italic>Tet1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) exhibit embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawlaty et al., 2011</xref>), we used <italic>Tet1</italic> heterozygous mice (<italic>Tet1</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) and verified its transcriptional expression of Tet1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). <italic>Tet1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and wild-type (WT) mice with Chow diet feeding showed no significant differences in body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).

It has been well established that the SIRT1-PGC-1α/FOXO1 axis is a core signaling pathway for transcriptional regulation in hepatic glucose metabolism. Fasting or caloric restriction can activate the SIRT1-PGC-1α/FOXO1 axis, in which SIRT1 triggers the next gluconeogenesis by deacetylating HIF-1α, PGC-1α, or FOXO1 to generate glucose output. Our data suggested that TET1 specifically regulates SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of PGC-1α and FOXO1, but not HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Recently, AMPK-mediated TET2 phosphorylation at Ser99 was shown to be a molecular switch that controls a pivotal step in the AMPK-TET2-5hmC axis signaling pathway to regulate glucose synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Although here it is not sure whether AMPK directly regulates phosphorylation of TET1, our findings suggest the notion that TET1 plays an important role in glucose metabolism through AMPK-dependent signaling by directly interacting with and activating SIRT1, supporting the notion that TET1 loss-of-function led to increased energy expenditure and protection from diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Damal Villivalam et al., 2020</xref>).

These data suggest that the regulation in the hydroxymethylation of these genes possibly does not affect their expression in Tet1 deficiency cells.</p><p>Previous studies show that TET1 can form a complex with transcriptional factors in several tissues or during different biological processes, such as the TET1/PRC1 complex in ESCs or the TET1/SIN3A/hMOF complex during DNA damage and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandru et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings identify the transcriptional regulation complex TET1/SIRT1 by verifying that the C-terminal of TET1 physically interacts with SIRT1 and that TET1 regulates SIRT1 deacetylase activity in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although previous studies demonstrate that SIRT2 and SIRT6 also contribute to deacetylation of PGC-1α and FOXO1, thus regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis, our results show that the C-terminal of TET1 specifically interacts with SIRT1 but not SIRT2 and SIRT6. Interestingly, studies also suggest that the region within the TET1 catalytic domain (TET1-CD) is responsible for binding to <italic>O</italic>-linked <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hrit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delatte, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vella et al., 2013</xref>), hMOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>), and HIF-2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). Rinf (i.e., CXXC5) also interacts with the C-terminal of both TET1 and TET2 to form a transcriptional regulatory complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ravichandran et al., 2019</xref>). These findings support the notion that TET1, especially the TET1-CD, functions as a coactivator to specifically interact with SIRT1 to regulate downstream events. Structural analysis of catalytic domains can provide more details about TET functionality.</p><p>Dynamic regulation of transcriptional factor PGC-1α/FOXO1 localization, which is dependent on acetylation, is an important manner in the transcriptional regulation of gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matsuzaki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Qiang et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings suggest that TET1 also regulates the translocalization of PGC-1α/FOXO1, which is dependent on SIRT1 acetylation but not HIF-1α. Collectively, these studies suggest that TET1 specifically activates these transcription factors through SIRT1 activity. Given the established relationship between TET1 and the translocalization of PGC-1α/FOXO1, it is likely that the effect of PGC-1α acetylation is because of inhibition of SIRT1. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that other sirtuins play a role in translocalization of PGC-1α/FOXO1 in TET1-depleted cells.</p><p>Additionally, TET1 did not significantly affect the protein levels and chromatin localization of AMPK and p-AMPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Glucagon activates AMPK activity to regulate glucose metabolism during fasting, and abnormal glucagon secretion is associated with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leclerc et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings reveal that TET1 is also required for the activation of transcriptional expression of <italic>G6PC</italic>, <italic>SLC2A4</italic>, and <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> induced by glucagon. These results suggest that the AMPK-TET1-SIRT1 axis is required for glucose metabolism induced by AMPK activation. Notably, AICAR and metformin activate the PGC-1α pathway and alter mitochondrial protein levels as well as cellular stress pathways in a strong cell-type- and dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). A previous study also showed that incubation of HepG2 cells with higher concentrations of AICAR (1 mM) increased fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis, while lower concentrations (0.05 and 0.1 mM) of AICAR decreased fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p><italic>Tet1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice exhibited a series of functional defects in glucose metabolism, such as significant decreases in blood glucose, increased glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity, suggesting that Tet1 functions as an activator in gluconeogenesis. Tet1 depletion blocks the decrease of blood glucose in cells or mice induced by metformin or RSV, suggesting that Tet1 plays an important role in AMPK-SIRT1-dependent glucose metabolism. Another contribution of this study was that we first determined the important role of Tet1 in glucose metabolism. TET1 also promotes fatty acid oxidation and inhibits NAFLD progression by hydroxymethylation of PPARα promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our study indicates that activation of the AMPK-TET1-SIRT1 axis leads to the translocalization of PGC-1α/FOXO1, which is dependent on the acetylation level and promotes gluconeogenic gene programs in the liver, which has a profound impact on glucose metabolism in fasting. Further studies are required to clarify the signaling axis effects and analyze the protein structure of TET1 targeting SIRT1, providing more precise targets for the clinical therapy to type 2 diabetes or metabolism-related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic> [<italic>human</italic>])</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>TET1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RC218608</td><td align="left" rowspan="3" valign="bottom">cDNA were purchased from Origene Corp.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic> [<italic>human</italic>])</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>SIRT1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NM_012238</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic> [<italic>human</italic>])</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>SIN3A</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NM_001145357</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic> [human])</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HepG2 cell line</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HB-8065</td><td align="left" rowspan="3" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic> [human])</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LO2 cell line</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cellosaurus</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CVCL_6926</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic> [human])</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T cell line</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-11268</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TET1 shRNA #1; shRNA #2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">lentivirus vector pLKO_SHC201</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# SHC201</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence: shRNA#1: CCCAGAAGATTT<break/>AGAATTGAT shRNA#2: CCTCCAGTCTT<break/>AATAAGGTTA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">siRNA to TET1(SMARTpool)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dharmacon/Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# D-014635</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">siRNA: non-target in control (GL2 Duplex)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dharmacon/Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1022070</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>G6PC</italic>.

Through the use of in vivo and in vitro studies the authors identified mechanistically an interaction between the DNA demethylase TET1 and the deacetylase SIRT1. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that this interaction is essential for the translocation of the transcription factors FOXO1 and PGC1a to induce the transcription of gluconeogenic genes. The major strengths of this manuscript include the detailed mechanistic nature of the experiments. The authors utilize both functional and mechanistic studies. The in vivo functional studies performed by Zhang et al. show in rodents TET1 deficiency improves glucose tolerance. Furthermore, the authors employed high fat diet in rodents as a model of glucose intolerance to show that TET1 deficiency improves glucose metabolism. in vitro, the authors employed classical biochemical assays showing a physical interaction between SIRT1 and TET1. Furthermore, through truncation mutant studies the authors identified the C-terminal region of TET1 as mediating this interaction. Moreover, through pharmacological studies the authors demonstrate a role for AMPK in the regulation of SIRT1/TET1 interaction. Overall, this is a well conducted study with potential for offering new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of glucose metabolic disorders.</p><p>This is a well conducted study by the authors. There are many strengths of this study (see public review). However, there are some issues that should be addressed. First, the authors tend to use drugs/compounds or call out protein names without any explanation to what the drug is used for or the rationale for assaying that pathway (e.g. SIN3a in line 178, EX527 in line 181 and GL2 in line 203).</p><p>A major concern are the authors conclusion that methylation is not the mechanism for their observed findings. TET1 is classically viewed as a DNA demethylase through the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC to eventually lead to the removal of methyl groups on DNA. The authors provide previously published data showing track browsers for DNA methylation of target genes in TET1 KO in mESC without any subsequent changes in 5mC. This is a premature claim by the authors. First, mESCs are not a good representation of a gluconeogenic cell line. Furthermore, the assessment of 5mC falls short. What happens to 5hmC at these loci? To claim a non-canonical role of TET1 in the regulation of gluconeogenic gene expression in the absence of assessing 5hmC at these loci is insufficient. A recommendation would be to assess 5hmC at select loci in either Tet1+/- livers or from Tet1 siRNA in hepG2 cells to functionally demonstrate whether methylation patterns are affecting gene expression profiles in this context.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript titled &quot;the hepatic AMPK-TET1-SIRT1 axis regulates glucose homeostasis&quot; provides comprehensive evidence suggesting that TET1 plays a pivotal role in regulating hepatic glucose metabolism by regulating SIRT1-mediated protein deacetylation. The tolerance tests data of WT vs heterozygous group are impressive though no body weight change, suggesting that TET1 is important for regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis. This is further supported by gene expression analysis data showing heterozygous mice had upregulated glycolysis genes while downregulated gluconeogenesis genes. Detailed biochemical and biophysical analysis suggests that TET1 binds to SIRT1 to increase its deacetylase activity, leading to nucleus translocation of PGC1-α and FOXO1. This is further strengthened by additional evidence showing TET1 functions downstream of AMPK though detailed mechanism remains open. Importantly, many of these interactions were further verified using agonists and antagonists to stimulate or rescue the signal transduction and functional outcomes.</p><p>Please see below my comments/suggestions to the authors.</p><p>1. Figure 1, it would be nice to show protein and/or gene expression changes of TET1 in WT vs heterozygous mice. I would assume that compared to WT, the heterozygous had a downregulated expression of TET1.</p><p>2. In Figure 2, the authors showed that heterozygous mice had downregulated expression of Glut4. The physiologic significance of this downregulation remains unclear to me, considering the fact that Glut4 is mainly expressed in the muscle and adipose tissues.</p><p>3. Figure 2B, the authors also provided IF data from KO mice. Is this from embryos? I ask this question because the authors mentioned in the first paragraph of the results part that homozygous KO led to embryonic lethality.</p><p>4. Figure 3F, the EX527 SIRT1 inhibitor was used at a high concentration. Potential off target effects of this tool compound cannot be ruled out.</p><p>5. Figures 2-6, HepG2 line was used as an in vitro model. Considering HepG2 is a cancer cell line in which glucose metabolism and signal transduction could be distinct from normal hepatocytes, these data could be strengthened by adding other lines or using primary cells for some key experiments.</p><p>6. Figure 5. RSV is not a selective agonist of SIRT1. GSK2245840/SRT2104 is a selective activator of SIRT1 currently in phase 2 trial.</p><p>7. Figure 6F, glucagon was used at superphysiological levels. The physiological range of glucagon is usually below 100 pmol/L, even under fasting conditions.</p><p>8. It would be nice if the authors could discuss little bit more about how to target TET1 for treating metabolic disorders.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>1. The study mainly demonstrated how TET1 regulates glucose metabolism, especially glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, while most of the mechanistic studies were performed in a hepatic cancer cell line, HepG2. Given huge metabolic differences between normal cells and cancer cells, the reviewer strongly recommends the authors to repeat the mechanistic studies in normal human and mouse hepatic cells, ideally using primary cells.</p><p>2. The authors only used single siRNA to knock down TET1. To avoid potential off-target effect, two independent siRNAs is required.</p><p>3. TET1 depletion does not affect AMPK activation, while the authors conclude that TET1 regulates genes like G6PC, PPARGC1A and GLUT4 expression through AMPK. Please clarify.</p><p>4. In Figure 3C, co-IP followed by western blot for SIN3A is needs. In Figure 3D, full length TET1 control is needed. In Figure 3G, full length TET1 and FL1+FL2 are needed for controls.</p><p>5. PPARGC1A, G6PC and GLUT4 are the key readout for findings, thus only RT-qPRC is not sufficient. Western blot is required to measure the expression levels of the genes, such as Figure 4F, 4G, 5I, 5J, 6C-6G.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70672.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The concerns over HepG2 cells, a cancer line, and their physiological relevance to hepatic metabolism was raised as a major concern.

Here, we further employed human normal liver cells (LO2 cell line) as a more physiologically relevant model system for addressing the question whether TET1 regulates the transcriptional expression of gluconeogenic genes. Therefore, we repeated some key experiments in LO2 cells to confirm the conclusion that Tet depletion can downregulate the transcriptional expression of PPARGC1A, G6PC and GLUT4 genes using Tet1 shRNA-knockdown cells. To keep the main text's integrity and consistency in this manuscript, we arrange these results as the supplementary data in figure 2-supplement 1. We revised the main text as the following:</p><p>“The results showed that TET1 knockdown can lead to the increase of the selected genes in glycolysis and decrease of the genes in gluconeogenesis. We further verified the transcriptional expression (figure 2-supplement 1A) and protein level (figure 2-supplement 1B) of PPARGC1A, G6PC, and GLUT4 genes in TET1 knockdown LO2 cells using two shRNA respectively, suggesting TET1 can play important roles in the expression regulation of PPARGC1A, G6PC, and GLUT4 genes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) 5hMC of target loci needs to be evaluated.

The level of 5hMC is relatively low in cancer cells. We also think Tet1 regulates the transcriptional expression of downstream genes via activating the SIRT1 activity, not excluding the possibility that the mechanism is independent of TET1’s demethylation activity. Here, we further adopted the hMeDIP-qPCR using 5hMC specific antibody to evaluate the target loci of 5hMC in LO2 cells (human normal liver cells), supporting the hypothesis that TET1 is acting through a non-canonical pathway independent of methylation patterns. And we revised the main text in the Discussion section as the following:</p><p>“The finding that there was no alteration in the methylation level of the identified gene promoters, such as Aldh1a3, Aldoa, Glu4, G6pc, Ppargc1a, and Ppargc1b, in TET1 knockout mESCs by analyzing the published data from Meelad M Dawlaty et al. <sup>(14)</sup> (figure 8-supplement 1A), and the 5hMC binding of the promoters of PPARGC1A, G6PC, and GLUT4 had also no change in TET1-depleted cells by hMeDIP-qPCR assays (figure 8-supplement 1B). These data suggest that the regulation in the hydroxymethylation of these genes does not possibly affect their expression in Tet1 deficiency cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Zhang et al., demonstrate a role of TET1 in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis.

The major strengths of this manuscript include the detailed mechanistic nature of the experiments. The authors utilize both functional and mechanistic studies. The in vivo functional studies performed by Zhang et al. show in rodents TET1 deficiency improves glucose tolerance. Furthermore, the authors employed high fat diet in rodents as a model of glucose intolerance to show that TET1 deficiency improves glucose metabolism. in vitro, the authors employed classical biochemical assays showing a physical interaction between SIRT1 and TET1. Furthermore, through truncation mutant studies the authors identified the C-terminal region of TET1 as mediating this interaction. Moreover, through pharmacological studies the authors demonstrate a role for AMPK in the regulation of SIRT1/TET1 interaction. Overall, this is a well conducted study with potential for offering new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of glucose metabolic disorders.</p><p>This is a well conducted study by the authors. There are many strengths of this study (see public review). However, there are some issues that should be addressed. First, the authors tend to use drugs/compounds or call out protein names without any explanation to what the drug is used for or the rationale for assaying that pathway (e.g. SIN3a in line 178, EX527 in line 181 and GL2 in line 203).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. According to your suggestion, we have revised the main text in manuscript via adding the explanation about drugs and protein names including SIN3a, EX527, GL2, and SRT2104 in the picture annotation and Materials section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A major concern are the authors conclusion that methylation is not the mechanism for their observed findings. TET1 is classically viewed as a DNA demethylase through the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC to eventually lead to the removal of methyl groups on DNA. The authors provide previously published data showing track browsers for DNA methylation of target genes in TET1 KO in mESC without any subsequent changes in 5mC. This is a premature claim by the authors. First, mESCs are not a good representation of a gluconeogenic cell line. Furthermore, the assessment of 5mC falls short. What happens to 5hmC at these loci? To claim a non-canonical role of TET1 in the regulation of gluconeogenic gene expression in the absence of assessing 5hmC at these loci is insufficient. A recommendation would be to assess 5hmC at select loci in either Tet1+/- livers or from Tet1 siRNA in hepG2 cells to functionally demonstrate whether methylation patterns are affecting gene expression profiles in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>It is a good point, and I agree with you. The level of 5hMC is relatively low in cancer cells. We also think Tet1 regulates the transcriptional expression of downstream genes via activating the SIRT1 activity, not excluding the possibility that the mechanism is independent of TET1’s demethylation activity. Here, we further adopted the hMeDIP-qPCR using 5hMC specific antibody to evaluate the target loci of 5hMC in LO2 cell lines, supporting the hypothesis that TET1 is acting through a non-canonical pathway independent of methylation patterns. And we modified the main text in Discussion section as the following:</p><p>“The finding that there was no alteration in the methylation level of the identified gene promoters, such as Aldh1a3, Aldoa, Glu4, G6pc, Ppargc1a, and Ppargc1b, in TET1 knockout mESCs by analyzing the published data from Meelad M Dawlaty et al. <sup>(14)</sup> (Figure 8-supplement 1A), and the 5hMC binding of the promoters of PPARGC1A, G6PC, and GLUT4 had also no change in TET1-depleted cells by hMeDIP-qPCR assays (Figure 8-supplement 1B). These data suggest that the regulation in the hydroxymethylation of these genes does not affect their expression in Tet1 deficiency cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript titled &quot;the hepatic AMPK-TET1-SIRT1 axis regulates glucose homeostasis&quot; provides comprehensive evidence suggesting that TET1 plays a pivotal role in regulating hepatic glucose metabolism by regulating SIRT1-mediated protein deacetylation. The tolerance tests data of WT vs heterozygous group are impressive though no body weight change, suggesting that TET1 is important for regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis. This is further supported by gene expression analysis data showing heterozygous mice had upregulated glycolysis genes while downregulated gluconeogenesis genes. Detailed biochemical and biophysical analysis suggests that TET1 binds to SIRT1 to increase its deacetylase activity, leading to nucleus translocation of PGC1-α and FOXO1. This is further strengthened by additional evidence showing TET1 functions downstream of AMPK though detailed mechanism remains open. Importantly, many of these interactions were further verified using agonists and antagonists to stimulate or rescue the signal transduction and functional outcomes.</p><p>Please see below my comments/suggestions to the authors.</p><p>1. Figure 1, it would be nice to show protein and/or gene expression changes of TET1 in WT vs heterozygous mice. I would assume that compared to WT, the heterozygous had a downregulated expression of TET1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. According to your suggestion, we further check the gene expression changes of TET1 in live tissue using RT-PCR. The results showed that the transcriptional expression of Tet1 in heterozygous mice is reduced by half compared to that in WT. We added the figure 1-supplement 1A and revised the main text as the following:</p><p>“Since Tet1 homozygous mice (Tet1<sup>-/-</sup>) exhibit embryonic lethality <sup>(13,14)</sup>, we used Tet1 heterozygous mice (Tet1<sup>+/-</sup>) and verified its transcriptional expression of Tet1 (Figure 1-supplement 1A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 2, the authors showed that heterozygous mice had downregulated expression of Glut4. The physiologic significance of this downregulation remains unclear to me, considering the fact that Glut4 is mainly expressed in the muscle and adipose tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>It is a good point and I agree with you. GLUT4 is mainly expressed in the muscle and adipose tissues, fasting and insulin cause reduced GLUT4 expression in both white and brown adipose tissues. We also observed the protein level of GLUT4 in different tissue in Tet1 heterozygous mice. It is reported that GLUT4 is an important downstream gene in dependent on the transcriptional factors, such as PGC1a and FOXO1. In our study, we verified the transcriptional expression of GLUT4 in fasting and insulin-induced mice models. Therefore, GLUT4, as a glucose transporter, is significantly downregulated via Tet1-dependent manner which could contribute to regulate glucose transport and metabolism in the fasting condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2B, the authors also provided IF data from KO mice. Is this from embryos? I ask this question because the authors mentioned in the first paragraph of the results part that homozygous KO led to embryonic lethality.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. We performed the IF assays using HepG2 cells, heterozygous or homozygous KO mice tissue. In previous studies, homozygous Tet1 KO mice led to embryonic lethality (Hao Wu et al., 2011; Shinpei Yamaguchi et al., 2012). We also confirmed this phenotype in our mice. However, we also found that a very small number of mice can survive, which exhibit defects in development and smaller body weight. This similar phenotype was also observed in previous publication. We think that there may be a compensatory effect in the TET family. Therefore, we chose and performed the most experiments in TET1 heterozygous mice to accurately reflect the regulatory role of TET in glucose metabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 3F, the EX527 SIRT1 inhibitor was used at a high concentration. Potential off target effects of this tool compound cannot be ruled out.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Potential off target effects of EX527 need to be considered. So far, EX527 is still the most effective selective inhibitor of SIRT1.EX 527 effectively inhibits the activity of SIRT1 deacetylase with IC50 of 38nM, which is concentration-dependent, while inhibiting SIRT2 and SIRT3, the effect is much lower, respectively. Considering this possibility, we performed the transcriptional expression of downstream genes in EX527 dose dependent manner. We treated with cells using EX527 reference concentration, which specifically inhibits SIRT1 activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figures 2-6, HepG2 line was used as an in vitro model. Considering HepG2 is a cancer cell line in which glucose metabolism and signal transduction could be distinct from normal hepatocytes, these data could be strengthened by adding other lines or using primary cells for some key experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Here, we further employed another hepatocyte cell line (LO2) as a relevant model for addressing the question whether TET1 regulates the transcriptional expression of gluconeogenic genes. We repeated some key experiments in LO2 cell line to confirm the conclusion that Tet depletion can downregulate the transcriptional expression of PPARGC1A, G6PC and GLUT4 genes using Tet1 shRNA knockdown. To keep the main text's integrity and consistency in this manuscript, we arrange these results as the supplementary data in Figure 2-supplement 1. We revised the main text as the following:</p><p>“The results showed that TET1 knockdown can lead to the increase of the selected genes in glycolysis and decrease of the genes in gluconeogenesis. We further verified the transcriptional expression (Figure 2-supplement 1A) and protein level (Figure 2-supplement 1B) of PPARGC1A, G6PC, and GLUT4 genes in TET1 knockdown LO2 cells using two shRNA respectively, suggesting TET1 can play important roles in the expression regulation of PPARGC1A, G6PC, and GLUT4 genes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 5. RSV is not a selective agonist of SIRT1. GSK2245840/SRT2104 is a selective activator of SIRT1 currently in phase 2 trial.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have performed the same experiment using SRT2104 instead of RSV to confirm the results. The results showed that SRT2104 can rescue the transcriptional expression in TET1 depleted cells. These data were arranged in Figure 5-supplement 1 and the main text was revised as the following:</p><p>“RSV and SIRT1 specific activator SRT2104 can increase the protein expression of G6PC, PPARGC1A, and GLUT4 in cells (Figure 5-supplement 1C). Interestingly, RSV or SRT2104 treatment rescued the decreased gluconeogenic transcriptional in TET1-depleted cells (Figure 5I, J). TET1 depletion blocked the increase of gluconeogenic gene expression—including G6PC, PPARGC1A, and GLUT4—in RSV-treated cells (Figure 5-supplement 1D) or SIRT2104-treated cells (Figure 5-supplement 1E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 6F, glucagon was used at superphysiological levels. The physiological range of glucagon is usually below 100 pmol/L, even under fasting conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. According to your suggestion, we further repeated these assays using a lower concentration of glucagon. The concentration of glucagon used in cell models often stimulates gene transcription at higher concentrations. This concentration is indeed relatively high for simulated physiology. In this experiment, we tried to prove the molecular mechanism that the transcriptional expression of glucagon activated cells depends on TET1, which has certain limitations. Accordingly, we have deleted figure 6F and repeated and modified figure 6G with 0.1nM glucagon. The data showed the similar results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. It would be nice if the authors could discuss little bit more about how to target TET1 for treating metabolic disorders.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We do not have enough evidence to support the idea how to target TET1 for treating metabolic disorders. We will pay more effort to address this question in future. In Discussion section, we added the sentence as the following:</p><p>“Further studies are required to clarify the signaling axis effects and analyze the protein structure of TET1 targeting SIRT1, providing more precise targets for the clinical therapy to type 2 diabetes or metabolism related diseases. ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1. The study mainly demonstrated how TET1 regulates glucose metabolism, especially glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, while most of the mechanistic studies were performed in a hepatic cancer cell line, HepG2. Given huge metabolic differences between normal cells and cancer cells, the reviewer strongly recommends the authors to repeat the mechanistic studies in normal human and mouse hepatic cells, ideally using primary cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We repeated the some key experiments in human normal liver cell (LO2) to confirm the conclusion that Tet depletion can downregulate the transcriptional expression and protein expression of PPARGC1A, G6PC and GLUT4 genes using two Tet1 shRNA knockdown. For keeping the integrity and consistency of the main text in this manuscript, we arrange these results in Figure 2-supplement 1 and revised the main text as the following:</p><p>“The results showed that TET1 knockdown can lead to the increase of the selected genes in glycolysis and decrease of the genes in gluconeogenesis.

The authors only used single siRNA to knock down TET1. To avoid potential off-target effect, two independent siRNAs is required.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We employed the siRNA pool purchased from Dharmacon which contains four siRNA. It was proved that this siRNA has a good inhibitory effect and high efficiency in our previous published article (Jianing Zhong et al., 2017). Here, we also designed two shRNA to repeat some important experiments in LO2 cell line. The results showed that TET1 depletion using shRNA could downregulate the transcriptional expression of PPARGC1A, G6PC and GLUT4 genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. TET1 depletion does not affect AMPK activation, while the authors conclude that TET1 regulates genes like G6PC, PPARGC1A and GLUT4 expression through AMPK. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a major role in regulating glucose metabolism as an early signal sensor. AMPK activity is stimulated by phosphorylation of threonine 172 (Thr 172) (Robin Willows et al., 2017). Metformin can regulate glucose metabolism in AMPK dependent manner. Our data showed that AMPK activated the downstream genes in cells and glucose metabolism in mice depending on TET1. Accordingly, the upstream and downstream relationship between AMPK and TET1 needs to be addressed. Our data indicated that TET1 regulated genes like G6PC, PPARGC1A, and GLUT4 expression through AMPK, but not affected AMPK activation, suggesting that AMPK is an upstream factor of TET1 as the earlier signal sensor to regulate these genes. Therefore, we conclude that TET1 regulates genes like G6PC, PPARGC1A, and GLUT4 expression through AMPK.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 3C, co-IP followed by western blot for SIN3A is needs. In Figure 3D, full length TET1 control is needed. In Figure 3G, full length TET1 and FL1+FL2 are needed for controls.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We consider the full length TET1 and FL1+FL2 fragment are important, and also construct the plasmid of FL1+FL2 (1-1590aa). Unfortunately, the full length and FL1+FL2 sequence is too long, resulting in a very small amount of expressed protein, which is not suitable for IP experiments and pull-down assays in our cellular system. In fact, we did the IP assay by endogenous protein using TET1 specific antibody to support the interaction between TET1 and SIRT1. The constructs of FL1, FL2 and FL3 were used in our published article (Jianing Zhong et al., 2017). The results showed that FL3 played important roles in interacting with several proteins, such as hMOF, SIN3A, and HIF. SIN3A as a cofactor of SIRT1 has proved to interact with TET1, which is a positive control. Accordingly, it is hard to add the full length and FL1+FL2 plasmids for IP and Pull down assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. PPARGC1A, G6PC and GLUT4 are the key readout for findings, thus only RT-qPRC is not sufficient. Western blot is required to measure the expression levels of the genes, such as Figure 4F, 4G, 5I, 5J, 6C-6G.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Our key point is that the transcriptional expression of these genes are downregulated in Tet1 deficiency. According to your suggestion, we have measured the protein expression of these genes in Tet1shRNA knockdown cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
