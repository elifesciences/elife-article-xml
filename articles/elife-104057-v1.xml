We generated a Halo-TDP-43 knock-in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line and performed a genome-wide CRISPR interference FACS-based screen to identify modifiers of TDP-43 levels in neurons. A meta-analysis of our screen and publicly available screens identified both specific hits and pathways present across multiple screens, the latter likely responsible for generic protein level maintenance. We identified BORC, a complex required for anterograde lysosome transport, as a specific modifier of TDP-43 protein, but not mRNA, levels in neurons. BORC loss led to longer half-life of TDP-43 and other proteins, suggesting lysosome location is required for proper protein turnover. As such, lysosome location and function are crucial for maintaining TDP-43 protein levels in neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>iNeuron</kwd><kwd>TDP-43</kwd><kwd>BORC</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>CRISPRi screen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fi2GM142475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>Veronica H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS121608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hao</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Michael Emmerson</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>Veronica H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Protein, but not mRNA, levels of neurodegenerative disease-associated protein TDP-43 are decreased upon knockdown of BORC, a complex that is required for the anterograde transport of lysosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mislocalization of transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a pathological hallmark of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD/ALS), two related neurodegenerative diseases, and is a co-pathology in up to 57% of Alzheimer’s disease cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meneses et al., 2021</xref>). Mislocalization of TDP-43 includes formation of aggregates in the cytosol and/or nucleus and nuclear clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tziortzouda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baughn et al., 2023</xref>). TDP-43 plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and is critical for mRNA splicing. Nuclear loss of TDP-43 leads to increased alternative splicing events, a hallmark of TDP-43 proteinopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Highley, 2014</xref>). TDP-43 also regulates its own expression at the mRNA levels by binding to its own 3’ UTR, but this autoregulation is insufficient to maintain normal nuclear expression in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mackenzie and Neumann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nana et al., 2019</xref>). Whether other factors also regulate TDP-43 expression in neurons has not been systematically studied. Identification of such factors could reveal upstream disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>The development of pooled CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens has allowed researchers to test the effect of thousands of genetic perturbations in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doench, 2018</xref>). CRISPRi screens are now possible in neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), enabling the evaluation of the effect of gene knockdowns on various phenotypes in these iPSC-derived neurons (iNeurons). Initial screens in iNeurons focused on survival-related phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tian et al., 2021</xref>). More recently, FACS-based screens in iNeurons have enabled identification of modifiers of oxidative stress and peroxidized lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tian et al., 2021</xref>). Historically, a practical challenge in the application of FACS-based screens to iNeurons has been that traditional genome-wide sgRNA libraries are large (&gt;100k sgRNAs), making it difficult to sort sufficient cells to identify phenotypes. Therefore, sub-library screens have often been used in the past, limiting the scope of genes assayed. Recently, compact dual-sgRNA CRISPRi libraries have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Replogle et al., 2022a</xref>), setting the stage for genome-wide FACS-based screens in iNeurons.</p><p>To uncover mechanisms leading to altered TDP-43 protein levels, we endogenously tagged the TARDBP gene with HaloTag in iPSCs, thereby generating a Halo-TDP-43 knock-in iPSC line to monitor TDP-43 expression in iNeurons. Using this line, we conducted a whole-genome CRISPRi FACS screen to identify modifiers of TDP-43 expression. Meta-analysis of this screen and other genome-wide CRISPRi FACS screens in iNeurons revealed common pathways shared across screens independent of the measured phenotype, enabling us to rank pathways specific for TDP-43 expression. All eight of the components of the BORC complex, which is necessary for axonal lysosome transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pu et al., 2015</xref>), were required to maintain neuronal TDP-43 expression. The genes encoding the eight subunits are BORCS1 (BLOC1S1), BORCS2 (BLOC1S2), BORCS3 (SNAPIN), BORCS4 (KXD1), BORCS5 (alias LOH1CR12), BORCS6 (alias C17orf59), BORCS7 (alias C10orf32), and BORCS8 (alias MEF2BNB). Knockdown of BORC reduced TDP-43 protein, but not RNA, levels. Surprisingly, metabolic labeling proteomics revealed that loss of BORC resulted in longer turnover time of TDP-43 protein. Notably, lysosome function and location also influenced Halo-TDP-43 levels in iNeurons. Our results identify BORC as a novel modifier of TDP-43 protein levels and point to a new mechanism by which TDP-43 levels are regulated in neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a Halo-TDP-43 knock-in iPSC line</title><p>The amount of TDP-43 expressed in neurons is tightly regulated, and TDP-43 undergoes autoregulation of its own transcript levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avendaño-Vázquez et al., 2012</xref>) to ensure levels are maintained at appropriate levels. To visualize and quantify the amount of TDP-43 in living cells, we used CRISPR technology to endogenously tag the N-terminus of TDP-43 with a HaloTag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We selected a clone with correct editing based on sequencing. In this clone, the knock-in of the HaloTag was heterozygous, leaving the second allele of TDP-43 intact and unedited. The lead clone displayed a normal karyotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), demonstrating that there were no major chromosomal abnormalities introduced during the gene editing or subsequent clonal expansion. Imaging of iNeurons differentiated from the knock-in iPSC line showed the majority of Halo signal in the nucleus, as is expected for TDP-43 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A western blot against TDP-43 shows a shift of approximately 35 kDa in the two TDP-43 positive bands, corresponding to the molecular weight of Halo (33 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Knocking down TDP-43 using CRISPRi reduced the amount of both tagged and untagged TDP-43 compared to a non-targeting (NT) sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Expression of Halo-TDP-43 was roughly 60% of endogenous TDP-43, indicating that the Halo-tagged protein is either not transcribed or translated as efficiently as untagged protein, or the protein is degraded more readily.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of an endogenously HaloTagged TDP-43 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of knock into the N-terminus of TDP-43.

We identified three FACS-based CRISPRi screens on iNeurons that identify modifiers of reactive oxygen species (CellRox) and lipid peroxidation (Liperfluo) using fluorescent indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tian et al., 2021</xref>) and tau aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Samelson et al., 2024</xref>). We performed an unbiased fixed effects meta-analysis of these screens with our Halo-TDP-43 screen to determine if there were any common hits across screens. These common hits across multiple screens may be real hits that simultaneously change TDP-43 and alter ROS levels, lipid peroxidation, or tau aggregation; however, they may also be ‘false-positives’ that are altering general proteostasis, general cellular stresses, or neuron differentiation, where phenotypes examined in these screens are a secondary or indirect effect of knockdown. Interestingly, comparison of z-scores between screens shows many genes that either positively or negatively regulate both our screen and the CRISPRBrain screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–F</xref>). With the increased power from the multiple screens, we were able to identify novel hits that were underpowered previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–F</xref>). Genes were considered ‘hits’ if they were novel with directionality (either up or down) compared to the total population (the average of the hits in the CRISPRBrain screens). For the Halo-TDP-43 screens, genes were filtered by an LFC of 1 or –1 compared to the total population. We performed GO analysis on common hits from the meta-analysis across screens and found enrichment in many interesting categories, including ubiquitination, neddylation, autophagy, protein targeting, cell division/differentiation, and cytoskeletal-related terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). On the other hand, some hits, like the BORC components, seem to be specific to our Halo-TDP-43 screen, so we chose to focus downstream analysis primarily on these hits that uniquely regulate TDP-43 biology. While this analysis provides a level of validation of our screen results, we picked genes from select categories to do a secondary, microscopy-based screen to further validate their effect on TDP-43 levels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Meta-analysis of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens identifies novel and common genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison between CellRox and Halo-TDP-43 meta-analysis z-scores with novel hits highlighted.

We used automated microscopy and analysis to visualize and quantify the Halo-TDP-43 signal in cells after each gene knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). 34 of 59 (58%) tested genes altered Halo-TDP-43 levels in the microscopy validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

Since we used a single sgRNA plasmid for validation and not the dual guide plasmid used in the screen, some of the genes that did not pass this stage of validation may not have had sufficient gene knockdown in the validation to elicit the effect observed in the screen. However, we were interested primarily in the genes whose knockdown had the strongest effect on Halo-TDP-43 levels. To determine if results from Halo-TDP-43 expression assays also applied to endogenous, untagged TDP-43 levels, we selected 22 genes from different groups in our list that passed Halo validation and performed immunofluorescence microscopy for endogenous (untagged) TDP-43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D–G</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

We posit that this Halo-untagged difference may be due to inherent destabilization of the HaloTagged TDP-43. KD of BORC subunit genes changed TDP-43 levels in the same direction for both Halo imaging and immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).

We did not observe an increase in expression of cryptic exons in genes that are commonly mis-spliced in iPSC-derived neurons after TDP-43 loss, including STMN2 and UNC13A. As such, BORCS6 KD does not reduce TDP-43 protein levels sufficiently to cause functional loss of splicing repression. As TDP-43 alternative polyadenylation (polyA) contributes to TDP-43 autoregulation and levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avendaño-Vázquez et al., 2012</xref>), we asked whether BORCS6 KD changed polyA site usage using REPAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Imada et al., 2023</xref>).

However, we did not observe any changes in TDP-43 polyA site usage upon BORCS6 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), so alternative polyA cannot explain the changes in TDP-43 protein levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>TDP-43, like the proteome, shows longer turnover time in BORC KD neurons</title><p>As loss of BORC prevents the transport of lysosomes to axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farías et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Pace et al., 2024a</xref>) and mRNAs can be transported on lysosomes to the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liao et al., 2019</xref>), we speculated that TDP-43 levels could be decreased in BORC KD iNeurons due to decreased axonal translation of TDP-43 mRNA. Using a TDP-43 mRNA N-terminally tagged with SunTag epitopes and with PP7 stem loops after the 3’ UTR, we used microscopy to quantify the co-localization of TDP-43 new protein synthesis (SunTag signal) with mRNA (PP7-coat protein signal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruijtenberg et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, we did not observe a change in TDP-43 translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As such, we hypothesized that loss of BORC might alter TDP-43 protein degradation rather than its synthesis. To test this hypothesis, we performed dynamic stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (dSILAC) to measure protein half-lives as well as whole neuron proteomics to measure protein abundances in BORCS6 KD and NT iNeurons. We found that TDP-43 total protein levels are decreased in BORCS6 KD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), further validating our earlier microscopy findings. We observed a similar trend for many proteins in the proteome, with more proteins showing decreased abundance than increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Interestingly, TDP-43 shows longer half-life in BORCS6 KD neurons compared to the NT guide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), suggesting that protein degradation is potentially decreased in BORC KD iNeurons. We observed similar results for the total proteome, with many proteins showing longer turnover at day 7 in BORCS6 KD neurons compared to NT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>). Longer half-lives were also observed in d15 neurons, although the changes in both abundance and half-life were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B-E</xref>), suggesting the neurons may be better able to compensate for the loss of BORC at later time points. In comparing the KEGG and REACTOME terms shown as enriched in our proteins with longer turnover times in BORCS6 KD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>) to the mRNAs whose localization is altered in BORC KO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Pace et al., 2024a</xref>), we observe many of the same categories are enriched, including ribosome and biosynthetic pathways. We further queried our data for posttranslational modifications (PTMs). We were able to identify 1333 phosphorylation sites. No PTMs were identified on TDP-43 at either time point, so PTM enrichment may be needed to query the role of PTMs in regulating the change in TDP-43 half-life with BORCS6 KD. We were able to detect 10 proteins with significantly changed phosphosites upon BORCS6 KD: KRI1 and RALY have phosphosites increased upon BORCS6 KD while OXSR1, ELAVL4, MAP4, ADD2, CSNK2B, FIP1L1, and RSF1 have phosphosites decreased upon BORCS6 KD at d7 (Figure S7G). At d15, only BASP1 showed a significantly decreased phosphosite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Interestingly, ADD2, CSNK2B, MAP4, OXSR1, and RALY are detected to have differential phosphorylation and increased half-life, suggesting these phosphosites may contribute to regulation of the turnover of these proteins. As TDP-43 and the proteome show similar effects of BORCS6 KD on protein half-life, iNeurons are likely in steady state and making as much new heavy protein as they are degrading the light protein. As such, protein translation or protein degradation could be reduced. Although we did not observe a change in TDP-43 translation in our SunTag experiment, it may not be accurately reflecting the translation levels of TDP-43 due to the experimental necessity of overexpressing tagged TDP-43. As such, BORC may be affecting TDP-43 protein levels through a complicated mechanism.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>BORC KD alters the abundance and half-lives of TDP-43 and other proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TDP-43 protein has decreased total abundance in day 7 BORCS6 neurons.

Here, we use a CRISPRi FACS screen to identify the lysosome transport complex, BORC, as a modifier of TDP-43 protein, but not RNA, levels. A screen in iPSCs confirms that BORC specifically acts on TDP-43 in iNeurons. Additionally, we made use of publicly available CRISPRi screen data to perform a meta-analysis. This meta-analysis identified common pathways across screens, enabling us to focus on TDP-43-specific hits. Common pathway hits across screens involve genes related to ubiquitination, neddylation, cell division/differentiation, and RNA modification. We think these pathways are related to protein level homeostasis in iNeurons, and our findings suggest a general utility of meta-analysis of novel screens in the context of published screens to prioritize hits for follow-up and identify phenotype-specific pathways.</p><p>KO of individual BORC subunits impairs lysosomal transport, leading to lysosomal depletion in axons and altered transport of transcripts that hitchhike on lysosomes to the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farías et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Pace et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Snouwaert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Pace et al., 2020</xref>). We initially hypothesized that loss of BORC would reduce neuritic translation of TDP-43. However, the lack of effect of BORC loss on TDP-43 mRNA or translation led us to focus on the role of lysosomes as a mechanism for how BORC affects TDP-43 protein levels. As KO of BORC subunits is known to alter lysosomal lipid metabolism, lysosomal content, size, and lead to decreased autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yordanov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Araujo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jia et al., 2017</xref>), we asked whether BORC loss altered TDP-43 half-life. We found that BORC loss leads to longer half-lives of TDP-43 and many other proteins. Although TDP-43 is degraded by autophagy, and thus lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ormeño et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leibiger et al., 2018</xref>), this change in TDP-43 half-life due to lysosomal positioning has not been previously observed. As lysosomes can be active in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farfel-Becker et al., 2019</xref>), this slower turnover of TDP-43 may imply that lysosomes degrade proteins in axons and are important for maintaining axonal homeostasis locally. Further work is needed to better understand this counterintuitive mechanism. TDP-43 protein levels are also decreased by lysosome-inhibiting drug treatments, further demonstrating the requirement of active and properly localized lysosomes for maintenance of TDP-43 levels. Interestingly, the decreased amount of TDP-43 in iNeurons upon BORC KD was insufficient to cause inclusion of cryptic exons which have been observed in models of TDP-43 loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avendaño-Vázquez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mehta et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gittings et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2022</xref>). It is possible that we did not observe cryptic exons simply because the levels of TDP-43 loss were insufficient to induce alternative splicing (in our hands, TDP-43 KD via CRISPRi results in ~20% of TDP-43 remaining, while BORC KD results in ~60% of TDP-43 remaining in iNeurons). Alternatively, the longer half-life of TDP-43 due to BORC KD affects cryptic exon inclusion; more work is needed to examine this possibility.</p><p>Defects in lysosome function and intracellular transport are associated with FTD/ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Root et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicolas et al., 2018</xref>). Our studies raise the possibility that lysosomal dysfunction is an upstream actor exacerbating TDP-43 loss-of-function phenotypes in disease. In this scenario, lysosomal mislocalization drives TDP-43 loss, which might further disrupt its autoregulation in disease. Interestingly, BORC KO in mice leads to neonatal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Snouwaert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Pace et al., 2020</xref>), and mutations in BORCS8 cause infantile neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Pace et al., 2024b</xref>). While these neurodegeneration-causing BORC mutations reduce anterograde lysosome transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Pace et al., 2024b</xref>), TDP-43 levels have not been studied in patients with this disorder. Thus, we speculate that patients have altered TDP-43 levels, which could be sufficient to contribute to the observed neurodegeneration. As we were unable to detect cryptic exon formation in our BORC KD neurons, this potential TDP-43 loss of function in BORC patients may not lead to cryptic exon pathology observed in FTD/ALS patient tissue, so further work would be needed to understand the role of this intermediate TDP-43 loss in patients.</p><p>As TDP-43 pathology is associated with both loss- and gain-of-function effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2011</xref>), understanding the pathways that lead to altered TDP-43 levels is crucial to identifying effective therapeutic targets for neurodegeneration. At the same time, the more specific these pathways are for TDP-43, the less likely treatments targeting these pathways will cause unwanted off-target effects. We demonstrate that CRISPRi screens are a powerful method to identify these specific pathways. While we did not identify genes that specifically affected TDP-43 localization in iNeurons, the identified genes and pathways that specifically alter TDP-43 levels, like BORC subunits, will enable us to interrogate ways to change TDP-43 protein levels as potential therapies. Additionally, as more screens are performed and can be added to meta-analyses, we will gain further insight into nonspecific pathways affecting protein levels and thus are unlikely to be effective therapeutic targets to specifically hit targets. In conclusion, these results provide important insight into the pathways affecting TDP-43 levels in neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">i11w-hT</td><td align="left" valign="top">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">iPSC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">i11w-mNC</td><td align="left" valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tian et al., 2019</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.07.014">10.1016/j.neuron.2019.07.014</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">iPSC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-TDP-43 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Proteintech</td><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="top">10782-2-AP, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:AB_615042">AB_615042</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1:1000 IF, 1:1000 WB</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-RPL24 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Proteintech</td><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="top">17082-1-AP, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:AB_2181728">AB_2181728</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1:1000 WB</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-Halo (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Promega</td><td align="left" valign="top">G921A</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Other</td><td align="left" valign="top">Janelia Fluor 646 HaloTag Ligand</td><td align="left" valign="top">Promega</td><td align="left" valign="top">HT1060</td><td align="left" valign="top">200 µg/mL</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="top">MK-EF1a-LAMP1-SBP-mApple (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Snyder et al., 2022</xref> <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.13915">10.1002/alz.13915</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top">I76</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="top">MK-Ef1a-mito-mEmerald-WPRE (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="top">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="top">M33</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="top">sgRNA (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tian et al., 2019</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.07.014">10.1016/j.neuron.2019.07.014</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top">Multiple</td><td align="left" valign="top">See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="top">CRISPR KO (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="top">This paper, adapted from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:addgene_52961">Addgene_52961</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="top">Dual guide sgRNA library (plasmid library)</td><td align="left" valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Replogle et al., 2022a</xref>; <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.81856">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.81856</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>iPSC culture and neuron differentiation</title><p>Procurement and use of WTC11 cells from the Coriell cell repository followed all policies of the NIH Intramural research program.

Briefly, iPSCs were grown in Essential 8 Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1517001) on tissue culture plates that had been coated with Matrigel (Corning, 354277). Medium was replaced daily or as needed. Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1110501) was used to dissociate cells for passaging as single cells. 50 nM Chroman-1 (MedChemExpress, HY-15392) was added to promote survival after thaw and accutase treatment, until cell colonies had expanded to at least 4–5 cells/colony. The iPSCs used here were previously engineered to express mouse neurogenin-2 (mNGN2) with a doxycycline-inducible promoter for neuronal differentiation (i11w-mN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).

Transfected cells were cultured in a 32°C incubator for 3 days before moving to 37°C incubator, and fresh medium was changed daily after transfection. One week after transfection, the iPSCs were live stained with Oregon Green (Promega #G2801) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Positive cells were sorted into 96-well Matrigel-coated plates at 1 cell/well with 100 µL/well StemFlex and 1x CloneR2 (Stem Cell Technologies). 10–12 days later, single-cell clones were picked and KI clones were confirmed by 5’-KI and 3’-KI junction genomic PCR (5KI-F: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">ATCGACTGGGACCTATCACG</named-content>, 5KI-R: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCGTACCCTCGATAAAAACG</named-content>; 3KI-F: 5’- <named-content content-type="sequence">GAGACCTTCCAGGCCTTCC</named-content>, 3KI-R: 5’- <named-content content-type="sequence">TCTACAATCCCCAGTTTCCA</named-content>).

The next day, the media was changed to E8 without Chroman 1. The next day, iPSCs were split onto new Matrigel-coated plates in E8 with chroman 1. The day following the split, iPSCs were treated with 8 µg/mL puromycin in E8 Chroman 1 to select for cells expressing an sgRNA. After selection, cells were split and differentiated into neurons following the standard protocol above. Some cells were maintained as iPSCs for the iPSC screen. On day 3 post dox induction, neurons were split onto final PLO-coated plates. On day 7 post dox induction, cells were split for FACS. Cells were stained with 200 µg/mL Halo Ligand 646 (Promega HT1060) for 15 min in appropriate media. Papain solution (Worthington LK003176) was prepared by adding 20 mL TrypLE without phenol red (Gibco 12604-013) to one vial of papain and placing it at 37°C for 10 min. Neurons were washed with PBS and then washed twice with PBS with 0.5 mM EDTA. Papain/TrypLE was added to cells for 1–2 min at 37°C. Papain was removed without disturbing the neuron sheet, and trituration solution (Neuron culture media, 10 µM ROCK inhibitor, and one vial of DNAse freshly dissolved) was added to cells before transferring them to a conical tube. Cells were pipetted 3–10 times in the conical tube until cell clumps were gone. PBS was added to cells, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 200×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Neurons were resuspended in 1 mL Papain Inhibitor Media (27 mL trituration media with 3 mL Papain inhibitor) and incubated for 5–10 min. Cells were again pelleted by centrifugation at 200×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min and resuspended in cell culture media before transferring cell suspension into a 5 mL collection 12×75 mm polypropylene FACS tube with 35–40 µm strainer cap. Cells were kept on ice until FACS was performed. Cells were sorted using the MoFlo Astrios cell sorter (Beckman Coulter), with Summit software (Beckman Coulter) to set up a sorting template. GFP-positive cells were detected using the 488 nm laser excitation and 520/30 nm filter for capturing signal emission. Halo was detected using 640 nm laser excitation and 675/30 nm filter for emission. The cells were first gated on GFP expression, which served as a highly expressing co-expression marker for sgRNA, and then gated on Halo expression, as follows. Four groups were collected from the FACS session: the bottom 25% of iPSCs expressing Halo-TDP-43, the top 25% of iPSCs expressing Halo-TDP-43, the bottom 25% of neurons expressing Halo-TDP-43, and the top 25% of neurons expressing Halo-TDP-43. Genomic DNA was collected from each fraction using the NucleoSpin Blood Kit (Macherey Nagel 740950.50) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in PBS containing proteinase K. Next, BQ1 was added to each tube and mixed by vortexing. Samples were incubated at 56°C for 15 min and cooled to room temperature for at least 30 min. 100% ethanol was added to the tube and mixed by vortexing before loading onto the column.

BQ2 step was repeated a total of two times. To elute genomic DNA, preheated BE was added to each column, incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and spun for 4 min at 4000×<italic>g</italic> in a new tube. Elution was repeated a second time. Next, sgRNA amplicons were enriched using primers containing indexing barcodes and Illumina adapters. 10 µg of genomic DNA was used per PCR reaction.

Cycling parameters were as follows: 98°C for 30 s, 22–24 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 66°C for 75 s, then a 5 min hold at 72°C after cycles and a hold at 4°C. PCR reactions were pooled and cleaned up with a PCR purification. A 0.5–0.65X SPRI cleanup was performed prior to sequencing. Half volume of SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter B23318) was added to the pooled PCR reaction and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Beads were removed with a magnet and supernatant collected. Next, a 0.65 volume of SPRI beads was added to cleared supernatant, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and tubes placed on a magnetic stand. Supernatant was removed and discarded. Beads were washed with fresh 80% ethanol twice and beads air-dried for 2–5 min. Sample was eluted in 30 µL EB buffer. The SRPI PCR cleanup was repeated in its entirety to remove excess primer contamination. PCR product yield, size, and quality were checked on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) with a High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent B23318). Enriched PCR product is 562 base pairs in length. Samples were sequenced on the MiSeq with 1% PhiX through paired-end 50 sequencing with custom primers (Read1: <named-content content-type="sequence">gtgtgttttgagactataagtatcccttggagaaccaccttgttgg</named-content>, Read2: <named-content content-type="sequence">tgctatgctgtttccagcttagctcttaaac</named-content>, i7 Indexing primer: <named-content content-type="sequence">aagagctaagctggaaacagcatagca</named-content>).

First, screen phenotype scores and log fold changes were aligned by converting effect estimates to standardized beta values represented by z-scores. Next, extreme p-values were stabilized by truncation to prevent distortions in the statistical tests due to outliers or very small probabilities, ensuring a robust meta-analysis, accommodating the floating point of the system and acknowledging that this truncation will cause results to be more conservative. Standard errors of the effect estimates were derived by dividing the beta estimate by the absolute value of the z-scores. Fixed effect meta-analyses were then carried out for all possible screen combinations (combining already published versus novel screens). These functions calculate pooled estimates of effect sizes, variance, and test for heterogeneity among screens. Novelty was assessed by filtering associations that were not significant after multiple test corrections in either of the constituent datasets but were significant after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment of the meta-analysis. Data was visualized using modified MAGeCKFlute pipelines to assess putative biological functions of significant genes using published enrichment functions including clusterProfiler, GOstats, enrich.HGT, and GSEA packages. TDP-43 expression hits were grouped into positive and negative modifiers using log2FC values, and statistical significance was assessed by gene ratio or FDR depending on the enrichment analysis.

RNA concentrations were measured with a DeNovix DS-11 FX+1 µL Spectrophotometer, and 855 ng of RNA was used as input for reverse transcription. Reverse transcription was performed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4368814). The qPCR reaction was performed with 2x TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4304437) on an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System. Probes were run singleplex. The Taqman probe for the target was TARDBP (FAM-MGB Hs00606522_m1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4453320). Two endogenous controls were used: PPIA (VIC-MGB-PL Hs04194521_s1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4448484) and PGK1, TaqMan ID: Hs00943178_g1, VIC-MGB-PL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4448484).

Briefly, the plasmid was digested with BsmBI-v2 (NEB R0739), the cut vector was dephosphorylated with NEB Quick CIP (NEB M0525), and digested and dephosphorylated vector was extracted from an agarose gel. Primers containing the sgRNA targeting sequences (Eurofins) were phosphorylated with T4 PNK (NEB M0201) and annealed before being ligated into the cut vector using 2x Ligation Master Mix (Takara 6023). After sequencing to confirm correct cloning, plasmids were transfected into Lenti-X HEK cells using standard protocols (see above). Virus was then transduced into i11w-mN iPSCs and selected with puromycin using standard protocols (see above). Selected iPSCs were differentiated using standard protocols (see above).

Neurospheres were imaged at d10 post dox induction on a Nikon Ti2 spinning disk confocal microscope at 60x with only neurites in the field of view. Exposure times were as follows: 300 ms for 640 nm, 200 ms for 561, 200 ms for 488, and 100 ms for 405. Laser power was at 50% for DAPI and 100% for all other channels.

Next, pedestalling using a value of 2 and log2 transformation was performed. Cyclic loess was used to normalize expression across samples followed by exploratory analysis to inspect for and remove outlier samples if present. If present, cyclic loess normalization is repeated. Data post cyclic loess normalization is then noise modeled (CV~mean) by experiment condition (NT v KD) and a noise threshold for the data defined. This noise threshold is then used to filter and remove noise-biased genes, with surviving genes then subject to differential testing using the appropriate test. After differential testing, all statistics are captured and exported along with confirmatory visual generation post differential gene selection. Pathway analysis was performed to identify enriched pathways and functions for each comparison performed as part of differential testing. Alternative polyadenylation was assessed using REPAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Imada et al., 2023</xref>). Results that had an absolute compositional fold change (cFC) ≥ 0.25 and an FDR-corrected p-value&lt;0.05 were considered polyA sites that had a significant shortening (negative cFC) or lengthening event (positive cFC) and were plotted using VolcaNoseR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goedhart and Luijsterburg, 2020</xref>).

Neurons were scraped into the buffer to aid with lysis. Proteins were alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A39271) at room temperature in the dark, then reduced by adding 2 µL of 500 mM DTT to the lysate and incubating at 25°C for 30 min in the light. A Thermo Fisher KingFisher Apex was used to perform the automated SP3 protein enrichment protocol. This protocol uses SP3 beads: GE SpeedBeads (GE45152105050250) and of GE SpeedBeads (GE65152105050250) combined in a 1:1 ratio. The SP3 beads are washed in LC-MS grade water (Pierce, 51140) and reconstituted in 50% EtOH at a concentration of 4 mg/mL.

After completion of the KingFisher SP3 protocol, samples were shaken overnight at 37°C. The KingFisher was used to perform a bead removal protocol twice. Solvents were removed in a speed vac. Samples were stored dry at –20°C until resuspension in 2% acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 51101), 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 85183), and 0.1% formic acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 28905).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>LC-MS analysis</title><p>Peptide concentration from each sample was measured on a DeNovix DS-11 FX+1 µL Spectrophotometer and normalized to 0.5 µg/µL.

A maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed. A maximum of three variable modifications was allowed for cysteine <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide, methionine oxidation, and protein N-terminus acetylation. Precursor and fragment tolerances were set to 25 ppm. Contaminant proteins and peptides were removed. Protein intensities from protein.txt output files were used for non-SILAC data analysis. dSILAC data was analyzed using a previously established workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasan et al., 2023</xref>). A standard multiplicity with two labels was enabled for SILAC data, and Lys8/Arg10 was selected as the heavy channel.

There are therefore a few other experiments that could have been performed to make this conclusion more compelling, maybe also performing RNAscope experiments to make sure that no change occurred in TDP-43 mRNA localisation in cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. To address this point, we performed an analysis of polyA sites on our RNA sequencing data using REPAC and did not find a change in TDP-43 poly adenylation after BORC KD (Figure S6C). Other transcripts do have altered polyA sites, which are summarized in Figure S6C. We also performed HCR FISH for TARDBP mRNA in TDP-43 and BORC KD neurons. While we did not see a difference in RNA localization (see A below, numbers on brackets indicate p-values), we also were not able to detect a significant difference in total TARDBP mRNA levels upon TDP-43 KD (see B below, numbers on brackets indicate p-values), suggesting that some of the signal detected is non-specific to TARDBP. Because of this, we cannot conclusively say that BORC KD does not alter TARDBP mRNA localization using the available tools.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-104057-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even assuming that the mRNA does not change, no explanation for the change in TDP-43 protein half life has been proposed by the authors.

The authors provide strong evidence indicating that BORC subunit knockouts impair lysosomal function, leading to slower protein turnover and implicating lysosomal activity in the regulation of TDP-43 levels. The authors then provided additional evidence of TDP-43 perturbations under lysosome-inhibiting drug conditions, underscoring a mechanistic link between lysosome mislocalization and TDP-43 dysregulation.

The impact of the work could be further discussed - it is an interesting disconnect between the fact BORC KD causes decreased IF of the Halo-tagged TDP-43 and lysosomal transport, however this reduction does not impact cryptic exon expression and also increases TDP-43 half life (and of other proteins).

Using the pLentiCRISPR system, which expresses the sgRNA of interest on the same plasmid as an active Cas916 we found that KO of BORCS7 using two different sgRNAs decreased TDP-43 levels by immunofluorescence (Figure 5C-D).&quot; Please provide clarification as to why BORCS7 was chosen out of all the BORCS? From the data presentation thus far (Figure 4B &amp; 5A), the reader might have anticipated testing BORCS6 for panels 5C-D.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We tried a couple of BORCs with the pLentiCRISPR system, but BORCS7 was the only one we were convinced we got functional knockout for based on lysosome localization. We think that either the guides were not ideal for the other BORC components we tried, or we did not get efficient gene editing across the population of cells tested. Because we had previously been working with knock down and CRISPRi guides are not the same as CRISPR knock out guides, we couldn’t use the existing guide sequences we know work well for BORC. Since loss of one BORC gene causes functional loss of the complex and restricts lysosomes to the soma, we did not feel it necessary to assay all 8 genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Relating to the statement &quot;We treated Halo-TDP-43 neurons with various drugs that disrupt distinct processes in the lysosome pathway and asked if Halo-TDP-43 levels changed. Chloroquine (decreases lysosomal acidity), CTSBI (inhibits cathepsin B protease), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, inhibits lysosome-phagosome fusion), and GPN (ruptures lysosomal membranes) all consistently decreased Halo-TDP-43 levels (Figure 6A-B, S5A-C)&quot; Please provide interpretations for Figures S5A and S5C in text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this oversight and have updated the text accordingly (lines 183-191).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Relating to figure 6E: please provide in legend what the different colors used correlate with (i.e. green/brown for BORCS7 KD)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. These colors were mistakenly left in the figure from a version looking to see if the observed effects were driven by a single replicate rather than a consistent change (each replicate has a slightly different color). As the colors are intermingled and not separated, we concluded the effect was not driven by a single replicate. The colors have been removed from the updated figure for simplicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Relating to the statement &quot;We observed a similar trend for many proteins in the proteome (Figure 8B)&quot; This statement can benefit from stating which trend the authors are referring to, it is currently unclear from the volcano plot shown for Figure 8B.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this and have updated the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Relating to the statement &quot;For almost every gene, we observed an increase or decrease in Halo-TDP-43 levels without a change in Halo-TDP-43 localization or compartment specific level changes (Figure 4B).&quot; Please provide: (1) the number of genes examined, (2) additional clarification of &quot;localization&quot; and &quot;compartment specific&quot; level changes, (3) some quantification and or additional supporting data of the imaging results. Figures 5A-B presents with the same concern relating to the comment &quot;To determine if results from Halo-TDP-43 expression assays also applied to endogenous, untagged TDP-43 levels, we selected 22 genes that passed Halo validation and performed immunofluorescence microscopy for endogenous (untagged) TDP-43 (Figure 4D-G,5A-B, S4E-F).&quot; please clarify further.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for requesting this clarification. This statement refers to all 59 genes tested by Halo imaging; only one (MFN2) showed any hints of aggregation or changes in localization, every other gene (58) showed what appeared to be global changes in Halo-TDP-43 levels. We were initially intrigued by the MFN2 phenotype; however, we were unable to replicate it on endogenous TDP-43 and thus concluded that this might be an effect specific to the tagged protein. The representative images shown in Figure 4B are representative of the changes we observed across all 59 genes tested (if changes were present). From the 59 genes that we observed a change in Halo-TDP-43 levels by microscopy, we selected a smaller number to move forward to immunofluorescence for TDP-43. We picked a subset of genes from each of the different categories we had identified (mitochondria, m6A, ubiquitination, and some miscellaneous) to validate by immunofluorescence, thinking that genes in the same pathway would act similarly. We have added a column to the supplemental table S1 indicating which genes were tested by immunofluorescence and what the result was. We have also attempted to clarify the results section to make the above clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Relating to the statement &quot;To determine if results from Halo-TDP-43 expression assays also applied to endogenous, untagged TDP-43 levels, we selected 22 genes that passed Halo validation and performed immunofluorescence microscopy for endogenous (untagged) TDP-43 (Figure 4D-G, 5A-B, S4E-F). Of these, 18 (82%) gene knockdowns showed changes in endogenous TDP-43 levels (Figure 4D-G, S4E-F).&quot; It is difficult to identify the 18 or 22 genes in the figures as described in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We added columns to the supplemental table S1 listing the genes and the result in each assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) Relating to figures S7A and 8A and the first part of the section &quot;TDP-43, like the proteome, shows longer turnover time in BORC KD neurons&quot; Can the authors provide clarification why the SunTag assay was performed with BORCS6 KD (S7A) but the follow-up experiment (8A) was performed with BORCS7 KD. Does BORCS6 KD show similar results as BORCS7 with the SunTag assay, and does TDP-43 protein abundance with BORCS7 KD show similar results as BORCS6?</p></disp-quote><p>Because loss of any of the 8 BORC genes causes functional loss of BORC and lysosomes to be restricted to the peri-nuclear space, we used BORC KDs interchangeably. Additionally, all BORC KDs had similar effects on Halo-TDP-43 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Adding more control experiments that TDP-43 mRNA is really not affected following BORC KD</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a FISH experiment to examine TARDBP mRNA localization upon BORC KD but were unable to conclusively say whether BORC KD changes TARDBP mRNA localization (see above). We also analyzed our RNA sequencing experiment for alternative polyadenylation sites upon BORC KD.
