Surprisingly, we find that Fascin regulates Myosin activity in the border cells to control nurse cell stiffness to promote migration. Thus, these data shift the paradigm from a substrate stiffness-centric model of regulating migration, to uncover that collectively migrating cells play a critical role in controlling the mechanical properties of their substrate in order to promote their own migration. This understudied means of mechanical regulation of migration is likely conserved across contexts and organisms, as Fascin and Myosin are common regulators of cell migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Fascin</kwd><kwd>collective cell migration</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>stiffness</kwd><kwd>border cells</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM116885</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamb</surname><given-names>Maureen C</given-names></name><name><surname>Mellentine</surname><given-names>Samuel Q</given-names></name><name><surname>Tootle</surname><given-names>Tina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Collectively migrating cells control their stiffness by Fascin-dependent control of Myosin activity, and this migratory cell stiffness regulates Myosin activity and stiffness within the cellular substrate to ultimately promote migration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell migration is an essential process driving both development and cancer metastasis. During these processes, cells often migrate as groups or collectives, rather than single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>). Collective cell migration requires that cell-cell adhesions be maintained amongst the cells to support cluster cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Pascalis and Etienne-Manneville, 2017</xref>). Additionally, many collective cell migrations occur in an invasive manner with the group of cells migrating between other cells or through basement membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2019</xref>). During invasive migration, the environment puts mechanical forces on the migrating cells, causing them to respond by changing their shape and stiffness, and by modifying properties of their environment, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gasparski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eble and Niland, 2019</xref>). Therefore, stiffness has emerged as a critical regulator of collective cell migration.</p><p>During invasive, collective cell migration the group or cluster of cells must generate force necessary to invade through the ECM or other cells. Stiffness of the substrate is considered the primary regulator of the migrating cell’s stiffness and ability to migrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>). For example, increased substrate stiffness contributes to cancer cell migration and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gasparski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oakes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eble and Niland, 2019</xref>). Indeed, hard matrices induce migration in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ren et al., 2021</xref>), and increased substrate stiffness promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nieto and Cano, 2012</xref>). While the role of substrate stiffness in promoting cell migration is well-established, most of these studies utilized in vitro culture systems. Therefore, it remains poorly understood how migrating cells are regulated in their native environments by the stiffness of their endogenous substrates.</p><p>A master regulator of cellular stiffness is Non-Muscle Myosin II (subsequently referred to as Myosin). Myosin is a force generating actin motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>). It is composed of two copies of three subunits: two heavy chains, two essential light chains, and two regulatory light chains (MRLC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>). Myosin activation is regulated through phosphorylation of its regulatory light chains. This phosphorylation occurs through a number of kinases, including Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and Rho-associated kinase (Rok), and dephosphorylation occurs through phosphatases, such as protein phosphatase 1 c (PP1c) and its catalytic subunit, Myosin binding subunit (Mbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>). Myosin generates cortical tension by associating with and acting upon cortical F-actin; this regulates cell stiffness which can influence cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butcher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, Myosin regulates stiffness in both cellular substrates and migrating cells during many different cell migrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, Myosin not only generates mechanical force within a cell but aids in sensing and responding to external forces applied to the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butcher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A recently discovered regulator of Myosin is Fascin. Fascin is an F-actin binding protein that bundles or cross-links actin filaments into fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jayo and Parsons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashimoto et al., 2011</xref>). However, recent studies demonstrate that there are many non-canonical roles for Fascin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lamb and Tootle, 2020</xref>). One of these non-canonical functions of Fascin is the regulation of Myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elkhatib et al., 2014</xref>). Increasing concentrations of Fascin in an in vitro system decreased Myosin ATP consumption and motor speed along actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elkhatib et al., 2014</xref>). These data suggest that Fascin limits Myosin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elkhatib et al., 2014</xref>). Whether Fascin limits Myosin activity to control substrate stiffness and thereby cell migration remains unknown. Notably, Fascin has well-established roles in promoting cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lamb and Tootle, 2020</xref>). Fascin aids in the formation of cell migratory structures like filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashimoto et al., 2011</xref>) and invadopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Fascin promotes many types of cell migrations in development and disease, including cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma and Machesky, 2015</xref>). Investigation of Fascin’s role in promoting cell migration has primarily focused on Fascin as an F-actin bundler and it is unknown if Fascin limits Myosin activity to regulate collective cell migration.</p><p>An ideal model to uncover the role of Fascin in regulating Myosin during collective cell migration in a native context is <italic>Drosophila</italic> border cell migration. Border cell migration occurs during Stage 9 (S9) of oogenesis. During S9, the follicle is composed of an oocyte and 15 germline-derived nurse cells that are surrounded by a layer of somatic epithelial cells called follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spradling, 1993</xref>). Surrounding the follicle cells is a layer of ECM that envelopes the follicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spradling, 1993</xref>). Inside the follicle, however, there is limited evidence of any ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Medioni and Noselli, 2005</xref>). At the beginning of S9, a group of 8–10 follicle cells are specified as border cells and delaminate from the epithelium to start their migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Montell, 2003</xref>). The border cells migrate invasively and collectively between the nurse cells until they reach the nurse cell-oocyte boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Montell, 2003</xref>). Border cell migration is a cell-on-cell migration in which the nurse cells are the substrate for the migration, there is only a small puncta of ECM on the border cell cluster as it migrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Medioni and Noselli, 2005</xref>) and border cell migration is largely independent of Integrin-based adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dinkins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Llense and Martín-Blanco, 2008</xref>). Importantly, similar to other types of migration, the stiffness of the nurse cell substrate regulates both the stiffness of the border cells and their migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aranjuez et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, border cell migration is a powerful model for studying invasive, collective cell migration as the cluster of migrating cells can be visualized in its native context using both fixed and live imaging. Additionally, the factors that regulate border cell migration play conserved roles in other invasive, collective cell migrations, including cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Montell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stuelten et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, both Fascin and Myosin play roles in promoting cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>) and on-time border cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edwards and Kiehart, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamb et al., 2020</xref>). We previously found that Fascin (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Singed, Sn) is required for both border cell delamination and proper protrusion localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamb et al., 2020</xref>). Both loss and activation of Myosin result in similar phenotypes of delayed delamination and mislocalized border cell cluster protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Majumder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aranjuez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>). These data suggest that the cycling of Myosin between active and inactive forms controls border cell migration. Thus, border cell migration is an ideal system to uncover the relationship of Fascin and Myosin during collective cell migration.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fascin is required for on-time border cell migration during Stage 9.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of a Stage 9 <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle. The nurse cells (blue) are the substrate for the migrating border cell cluster (orange); the direction of border cell migration is to the right. The follicle is surrounded by a layer of somatic epithelial cells which include the outer follicle cells (purple) and the stretch cells (gold). These cells are surrounded by a layer of basement membrane (grey). (<bold>B–C</bold>). Maximum projections of 2–4 confocal slices of Stage 9 follicles of the indicated genotypes.

In wild-type follicles, the border cells are in line with the position of the outer follicle cells (<bold>B</bold>), whereas in <italic>fascin</italic> mutant follicles the border cells are significantly behind the outer follicle cells, indicating that loss of Fascin results in delayed border cell migration during Stage 9 of oogenesis (<bold>C</bold>). All genotypes are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69836-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Fascin inhibits Myosin activity in vivo. Loss of Fascin significantly increases the level of active Myosin, reduces Myosin dynamics, and increases nurse cell (aka substrate) stiffness as quantified by atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation technique. Reducing Myosin in <italic>fascin</italic> mutant follicles rescues border cell migration delays, indicating that Fascin’s tight regulation of Myosin activity is critical for on-time migration. Further, a phosphomimetic form of Fascin that precludes F-actin bundling is unable to limit Myosin activation, supporting the prior model that Fascin limits Myosin activity by tightly bundling F-actin and preventing Myosin binding to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elkhatib et al., 2014</xref>). We used RNAi knockdown and rescue experiments to assess the cell-specific roles of Fascin in regulating Myosin activity and nurse cell stiffness. Based on the literature, we expected that Fascin would primarily function within the nurse cells to control both substrate stiffness and Myosin activity within both the nurse cells and border cells. Surprisingly, we find that knocking down Fascin in the border cells increases the level of active Myosin on both the border cells and the nurse cells, and increases the stiffness of the nurse cells. Similarly, re-expressing Fascin in only the border cells of <italic>fascin</italic> mutants restores normal Myosin activity levels and stiffness of the nurse cells. These unexpected findings suggest that migrating cells influence the mechanobiology of their substrate to promote their migration. Supporting this, increasing Rok activity in the border cells also results in increased nurse cell stiffness, indicating this migratory cell regulation of substrate stiffness is not a Fascin-specific phenomenom. Together these findings lead to the following model: Fascin acts primarily within the migrating border cells to limit Myosin activation which controls the stiffness of the both the border cells and their substrate, the nurse cells, to promote on-time migration. It is likely that this regulation of Myosin by Fascin and thereby, migrating cells controlling substrate stiffness, is a conserved means of promoting collective cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fascin inhibits Myosin activation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle</title><p>Previous data demonstrates that Fascin can inhibit the activity of Myosin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elkhatib et al., 2014</xref>). Fascin functions in both the nurse cells and the border cells to promote on-time border cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamb et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, during border cell migration Myosin generates forces in the nurse cells that push upon the border cells, causing the border cells to activate Myosin and stiffen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aranjuez et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the nurse cells control the stiffness of the border cell cluster. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that Fascin may regulate Myosin activity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle, specifically the nurse cells, to promote border cell migration.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we assessed if Fascin limits Myosin activity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle. Myosin is activated via phosphorylation on its regulatory light chain subunit (MRLC). To assess changes in Myosin activation in the follicle, we stained follicles using an antibody against phosphorylated MRLC (pMRLC); wild-type and <italic>fascin</italic>-null follicles were stained in the same tube to account for staining variability. We observe a striking increase in active MRLC along both the nurse cell and border cell membranes of <italic>fascin</italic>-null follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> compared to A, blue arrows and B’ compared to A’, orange arrows). We quantified levels of active MRLC by measuring the relative fluorescence intensity of pMRLC on the nurse cell and border cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>; for example quantifications see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Briefly, for the nurse cell quantifications, 3 line segments per follicle were drawn across nurse cell-nurse cell membranes and the fluorescence intensity peak for pMRLC was normalized to phalloidin intensity at the same point; phalloidin intensity is not affected by loss of Fascin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Concurrent border cell staining ensured we did not measure across a border cell cluster protrusion. The three values were then averaged for a single image (for example quantifications see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). For border cell intensity, the border cell cluster was traced using the phalloidin or border cell stain and the mean fluorescence intensity for pMRLC was measured and normalized to the mean fluorescence intensity of pMRLC of the same shape in the nurse cell cytoplasm (for example quantifications see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We used the nurse cell cytoplasm pMRLC stain as the background for the border cell measurement because there is no available antibody that works against MRLC. Importantly, nurse cell cytoplasmic pMRLC intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and Myosin heavy chain (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Zipper) protein levels are not significantly different between wild-type and <italic>fascin</italic>-null follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). For increased clarity, throughout the entire manuscript, all graphs quantifying MRLC activity on the nurse cell membranes are shown using blue circles and MRLC activity on the border cell cluster are shown using orange circles. We find that there is a significant increase in active MRLC intensity on the <italic>fascin</italic>-null nurse cell membranes compared to wild-type follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, p &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, active MRLC is also significantly increased on the border cell cluster when Fascin is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, p &lt; 0.0001). Further, we assessed the spatial distribution of active MRLC on the nurse cell membranes surrounding the border cell cluster. In both wild-type and <italic>fascin</italic> mutant follicles, we observe active Myosin enriched on nurse cell membranes in front, behind, and on the sides of the migrating cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). While the intensity of pMRLC staining is higher in the <italic>fascin</italic> mutants indicating higher Myosin activation, there does not seem to be a change in the spatial distribution of active Myosin on the border cell cluster.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fascin limits Myosin activity in the Stage 9 <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle.</title><p>(<bold>A-B’’</bold>) Maximum projections of 2–4 confocal slices of Stage 9 follicles of the indicated genotypes.

AFM is a standard method to directly measure mechanical properties of biological tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kreplak, 2016</xref>). AFM can be used to quantify the elastic modulus, which is a measurement of how easily an elastic material is deformed when a known amount of force is applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kreplak, 2016</xref>). A high elastic modulus value corresponds to a stiff tissue. We used AFM nanoindentation technique to quantify the stiffness of <italic>fascin</italic>-null and wild-type nurse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crest et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). The nurse cells are the substrate for the border cells and their stiffness regulates border cell migration and cluster stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aranjuez et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, during S9, the nurse cells are surrounded by a layer of stretch follicle cells and a basement membrane that envelopes the entire follicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Previous measurements on <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicles using AFM established that there is significant difference in stiffness between the basement membrane and the underlying nurse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crest et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). These different tissues stiffnesses can be separated by using different indentation ranges to indent the AFM probe into just the basement membrane or to indent deeper into the nurse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chlasta et al., 2017</xref>).

To address this hypothesis, we first used a pharmacological inhibitor of Myosin and assessed the effect on border cell migration. Follicles were incubated for 2 hr in either control media or 200 µM of Y-27632, a Rho inhibitor previously used to reduce Myosin activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">He et al., 2010</xref>). This inhibitor reduces activated Myosin levels on both the nurse cells and border cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We then employed our previously developed method to quantify delays in border cell migration during S9, which takes the ratio of the distance the border cells have migrated from the anterior end of the follicle to the distance of the outer follicle cells from the anterior end of the follicle (see schematic <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamb et al., 2020</xref>).

To test this idea, we expressed a constitutively active form of Rok (Rok-CAT) in the border cells (<italic>c306</italic> GAL4). Rok is one of the kinases that phosphorylates MRLC to activate Myosin. Thus, expressing constitutively active Rok will increase activation of Myosin, which, in turn, will increase cortical tension and therefore the stiffness of the border cells. We find that expression of constitutively active Rok in the border cells significantly increases active MRLC enrichment on both the nurse cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> compared to 1 A, blue arrows, and C, p &lt; 0.0001) and the border cell cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> compared to 1 A, orange arrows and D, p &lt; 0.001).

We find that loss of Fascin significantly increases activated Myosin, and this increase contributes to the border cell migration delays observed in <italic>fascin</italic> mutant follicles during S9. Our data suggest that Fascin’s bundling activity is required to limit Myosin activation, supporting the prior proposed model that Fascin tightly bundles F-actin and precludes Myosin from binding to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elkhatib et al., 2014</xref>). The increased Myosin activity in <italic>fascin</italic> mutants results in substrate stiffening. Using cell-specific knockdown and rescue experiments, we made the suprising finding that Fascin activity in the border cells is necessary and sufficient to regulate Myosin activity and stiffness of the nurse cells. Thus, Fascin activity within the border cells plays a critical role in controlling the balance of forces between the border cells and their substrate, the nurse cells. We also show that this force balance is not specific to Fascin, as directly altering Myosin activity within the border cells phenocopies knockdown of Fascin in these cells. Together our data uncover that in vivo, collectively migrating cells modulate the stiffness of their substrate to control their own migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence support the model that Fascin is a critical regulator of cellular and tissue stiffness. Specifically, loss of Fascin results in increased active pMRLC on both the border cell and nurse cell membranes, altered MRLC-GFP dynamics on the border cell cluster, and increased nurse cell stiffness as measured by AFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Interestingly, pMRLC staining and MRLC-GFP time-lapse imaging exhibit distinct patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In both wild-type and <italic>fascin</italic> mutant follicles, the MRLC-GFP regions are shorter in length than pMRLC puncta. We suspect this difference is due to the MRLC-GFP time-lapse imaging capturing a small period of just activated Myosin, whereas fixation and pMRLC staining captures a longer period of activity. For instance, when Fascin is lost the MRLC-GFP puncta have a longer lifetime, this longer period of Myosin activity may be captured as an increased number of shorter pMRLC puncta. The short and numerous pMRLC puncta may also suggest that Myosin activity in the border cells is not appropriately spatially regulated in <italic>fascin</italic> mutants. These data, in conjunction with our cell-specific RNAi and rescue analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), reveal that Fascin acts primarily within the border cells to control the stiffness of their substrate, the nurse cells.</p><p>Fascin-dependent inhibition of nurse cell Myosin activity and stiffness is essential for on-time border cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), raising the question of how Fascin regulates Myosin. Our data supports the previously proposed model that Fascin bundled F-actin prevents Myosin binding to F-actin and thereby, restricts Myosin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elkhatib et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, we find that expression of the phosphomimetic form of Fascin (S52E), which is unable to bundle F-actin, in <italic>fascin</italic> mutants fails to both inhibit Myosin activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or fully restore migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is important to note that phosphorylated Fascin, and likely phosphomimetic Fascin, also exhibits reduced F-actin binding by in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamakita et al., 1996</xref>), raising the possibility that Fascin binding to F-actin, without bundling filaments, is sufficient to inhibit Myosin activation. Further experiments are needed to fully elucidate how Fascin limits Myosin activity.</p><p>Our discovery that Fascin limits Myosin activity in vivo is unlikely to be restricted to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Indeed, both Fascin and Myosin play critical roles during cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma and Machesky, 2015</xref>).

Increased substrate stiffness promotes migration in a wide range of cancers, suggesting increased Myosin activity can lead to increased cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mierke, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ren et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, Fascin is highly expressed in many types of cancers, notably carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma and Machesky, 2015</xref>). High Fascin expression in these cancers is correlated with increased migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grothey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hashimoto et al., 2007</xref>), invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Minn et al., 2005</xref>), and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alburquerque-González et al., 2020</xref>). However, according to our model, increased Fascin would reduce Myosin activity. Our finding that Fascin-dependent bundling is required to limit Myosin activity and substrate stiffness suggests that phosphorylated Fascin may promote cancer metastasis by allowing high Myosin activation and potentially other bundling-independent functions. Supporting this idea, expression of a S39 phosphomimetic form of Fascin, which cannot bundle F-actin, promotes human colon carcinoma migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hashimoto et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting phosphorylated Fascin could promote cancer metastasis by allowing increased Myosin activation and cell stiffness.</p><p>Our finding that phosphomimetic Fascin only partially rescues the migration delay in <italic>fascin</italic> mutants suggests that non-bundling roles of Fascin also contribute to border cell migration. Indeed, Fascin has many functions besides F-actin bundling, such regulating microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Villari et al., 2015</xref>) and acting within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Groen et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, S52 phosphorylated Fascin functions as an adaptor for the Linker of the Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) Complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Groen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jayo et al., 2016</xref>). This LINC Complex role of Fascin is required for nuclear shape changes necessary for mammalian single-cell invasive migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jayo et al., 2016</xref>), raising the idea that Fascin may be similarly required for the invasion of the border cells between the nurse cells. Further experiments are needed to understand how the different functions of Fascin are coordinated to promote migration.</p><p>Our results suggest that increased stiffness in the border cell cluster affects the stiffness of its substrate, the nurse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). This non-autonomous function of the border cells in altering the stiffness of the nurse cells was unexpected, as previous data suggested the nurse cells exert force on the border cells and the border cells respond to this force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aranjuez et al., 2016</xref>). This balance of forces is necessary to promote the migration of the cluster through the tightly packed nurse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aranjuez et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, a previous study observed that overexpression of a Rho GEF in the nurse cells, which both increased Myosin activation and caused the nurse cells to change their shape and become more circular, ultimately impairs border cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aranjuez et al., 2016</xref>). As we do not observe any obvious changes in nurse cell shape when Fascin is lost or knocked down in the nurse cells, it may be that loss of Fascin does not cause a severe enough change in nurse cell Myosin activity and cell stiffness to cause the border cell cluster to respond. Instead, our data suggest that the border cells play a larger role in this balance of forces by exerting force on the nurse cells to control nurse cell stiffness. This interaction could potentially allow the border cell cluster to stiffen the nurse cells as the cluster migrates. Interestingly, in the context of cancer cell migration, a stiffer substrate often promotes cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parekh and Weaver, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oakes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ren et al., 2021</xref>). Further, there is growing evidence that one means of directing migration is a gradient of substrate stiffness, such that cells move from softer to stiffer substrates; this is termed durotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sunyer and Trepat, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shellard and Mayor, 2021</xref>). Indeed, durotaxis has emerged as a property of collectively migrating cells. Specifically, it has been suggested that clusters of migrating cells are better able to sense differences in stiffness and respond more effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martinez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sunyer et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the border cells exert force on the nurse cells to stiffen them to aid in migration.</p><p>A key remaining question is whether border cells regulates substrate stiffness in a spatial and/or temporal manner. Specifically, do the border cells push on the nurse cells as they are migrating, driving a wave of local Myosin activation and stiffening of the nurse cell substrate? In other systems, such local stiffening appears to be cell-type and context specific, and can occur at the front or back of the migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doyle et al., 2021</xref>). Based on both our fixed- and live-imaging of Myosin activity, we believe the stiffening of the nurse cell substrate occurs on all sides of the border cell cluster. This phenotype is consistent in wild-type and <italic>fascin</italic>-null follicles with <italic>fascin</italic>-null follicles displaying an overall increase in pMRLC. However, our current means of assessing Myosin activity and cellular stiffness lack the resolution necessary to determine how Myosin activation and changes in stiffness propagate through the nurse cells. Future studies using tools that allow Myosin activity in the border cells to be distinguished from that in its nurse cell substrate, in conjunction with higher resolution, rapid, non-photobleaching microscopy approaches, and cell-specific means of assessing individual nurse cell stiffness, such as laser ablation recoil velocity assessments, are need to uncover the detailed dynamics of how the balance of forces between the border cells and their substrate, the nurse cells, drives collective cell migration.</p><p>It remains unclear how Myosin activity at the cell cortex is connected to cellular adhesions in the border cells. Prior work indicates that the border cells migrate directly on the nurse cells, as there is little to no ECM present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Medioni and Noselli, 2005</xref>), and thus, Integrin-based ECM adhesions are not critical for border cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dinkins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Llense and Martín-Blanco, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Montell et al., 2012</xref>). Instead, border cells may utilize E-Cadherin based adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Niewiadomska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2014</xref>) or perhaps uncharacterized means to drive migration. Thus, additional work is needed to determine the cellular connections mediating Myosin-dependent force transmission between the border cells and the nurse cells.</p><p>While it is clear that the balance of forces between the border cells and the nurse cells is critical for border cell migration, the mechanisms by which force imbalances impair migration remain poorly understood. We speculate that the increased Myosin activity in <italic>fascin</italic> mutants delays migration by impacting delamination and protrusion dynamics. We previously found that Fascin is required for on-time delamination of the border cell cluster from the follicular epithelium and for restricting the number and location of protrusions to the leading edge of the border cell cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamb et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, both loss and constitutive activation of Myosin within the border cells delays delamination and causes excessive and misdirected protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Majumder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aranjuez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>). These data suggest that it is not only the level of Myosin activity but is ability to cycle between active and inactive states that contributes to these two aspects of border cell migration. Based on our data, we suspect altering Myosin activity in the border cells ultimately changes the stiffness of the nurse cells. Too little activation of Myosin would result in a soft substrate and too much would result in a stiff substrate. Such changes in substrate stiffness could alter the polarization of the cluster, resulting in mislocalized and increased protrusions which not only delay migration but impair delamination. Supporting this idea, Myosin regulates active Rac polarization within the border cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>). Rac activation is highest in the leading cell of the border cell cluster and is require to generate forward directed protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fulga and Rørth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>). Increased Myosin activation in the border cell cluster disrupts this polarization, resulting in mislocalized protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>). This loss of polarization could function cell-autonomously, but, based on our data, it may also increase nurse cell stiffness. Such increased substrate stiffness could impair delamination and cause mislocalized protrusions by physically altering the topography of the nurse cells, which has recently been shown to be critical for border cell migration and forward directed protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dai et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, increased substrate stiffness could disrupt durotactic signaling or alter the diffusion of the ligands directing migration. Thus, Fascin’s role in limiting Myosin activation likely contributes to the delayed delamination and aberrant mislocalized protrusions observed during border cell migration in <italic>fascin</italic>-null follicles.</p><p>The mechanical communication between migrating cells and their substrate is a growing area of research. The overarching premise in the field has been that substrate stiffness regulates the mechanical properties of the migrating cells and thereby, alters their ability to migrate. For example, in a model of breast cancer cell migration, high substrate stiffness promotes migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ren et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally during zebrafish development, the underlying mesoderm must stiffen to induce the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of the neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barriga et al., 2018</xref>). Together these studies highlight the current paradigm that substrate stiffness is the driving force that regulates the migrating cells to control their migration. However, the roles of the migrating cells in controlling their substrate stiffness are less understood. Numerous studies support that migrating cells can degrade surrounding ECM, creating paths for easier migration (for example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wolf et al., 2007</xref>); such changes likely decrease substrate stiffness in the local environment. Migrating cells also pull on their local environment, applying a strain on the environment and aligning ECM fibers, which ultimately causes a local increase in substrate stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van Helvert and Friedl, 2016</xref>). Notably, collectively migrating cells exert 4 x more force on their environment than single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van Helvert and Friedl, 2016</xref>). These studies indicate migrating cells can, at least locally, influence the stiffness of their substrate. This increase in substrate stiffness promotes cell migration, increasing migratory cell force generation in a process termed mechanoreciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Helvert et al., 2018</xref>). Whether migrating cells control substrate and underlying tissue stiffness in native, physiological contexts, and whether local stiffness changes are propagated through the tissue remain poorly understood. Supporting that this may occur, cancer cells drive stromal changes, including increased fibrosis which stiffens the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Helvert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chandler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Piersma et al., 2020</xref>). These changes have been proposed as potential mechanism by which cancer cells drive their own invasion and make environments supportive of metastatic colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cox and Erler, 2014</xref>). Our finding that Fascin activity in the migrating border cells controls substrate stiffness to promote migration positions <italic>Drosophila</italic> border cell migration as a robust system to uncover the mechanisms controlling this means of force balance.</p><p>Here, we propose that migrating cells modulate their own stiffness to regulate substrate stiffness. Our findings suggest that during collective cell migrations, such as those during development and cancer metastasis, the migrating cells apply force to induce the stiffening of their substrate, this results in a reciprocal mechanical communication between the migrating cells and their substrate which drives migration. Further, we demonstrate that Fascin, an F-actin bundling protein, limits the activity of Myosin in the migrating cells to regulate substrate stiffness. Overall, our findings expand our understanding of the mechanical relationship between migrating cells and their substrate, shifting the paradigm in the field from the substrate controlling migrating cell stiffness and thereby, migration, to the migrating cells playing a key role in altering their environment and substrate stiffness to promote their own migration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>y<sup>1</sup>w<sup>1</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC Cat # 1495 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC_1495">BDSC_1495</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>fascin<sup>sn28/sn28</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FBgn0003447</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">from J.

The rabbit anti-pMRLC (S19; Cell Signaling, Davers, MA) was diluted 1:100 in Triton antibody wash. Anti-Fascin (sn7c, 1:20) was sometimes added to the primary antibody solution to differentiate between wild-type and <italic>fascin</italic>-null follicles in the same sample or to confirm Fascin RNAi knockdown. In other cases, anti-Hts (1B1, 1:50) and anti-FasIII (7G10, 1:50) were added to the primary antibody solution to allow for visualization of the border cell cluster boundaries. After six washes in Triton antibody wash (10 min each), the secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in Triton antibody wash and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Alexa Fluor 647–phalloidin (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) was included with both primary and secondary antibodies at a concentration of 1:250; this allowed for visualization of the border cell cluster boundaries.

Concurrent Fascin or border cell staining (Hts and FasIII) was used to define the boundaries of the border cell cluster. For nurse cell intensity, three line segments per follicle were drawn across nurse cell-nurse cell membranes on maximum projections of 2–3 confocal slices of follicles stained for pMRLC and phalloidin. The fluorescent intensity peak for pMRLC was determined for each line and normalized to phalloidin intensity at the same point. These three values were then averaged for a single image. Averages were then normalized to the wild-type average for each experiment due to experimental variability (for example quantification see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For border cell intensity, the border cell cluster was traced using the phalloidin stain and the mean fluorescence intensity for pMRLC was measured for this shape and this was then normalized to the mean fluorescence intensity of pMRLC of the same shape in the nurse cell cytoplasm (for example quantification see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

S9 follicles were hand isolated and mounted on poly-D-lysine coated 35 mm round glass coverslips. Force spectroscopy data were collected using a molecular force probe 3D (Asylum research) AFM in a liquid cell. AFM force spectroscopy was performed in a buffered solution within 1–2 hr after submersion. A new silicon nitride AFM probe (Bruker, DNP-10) was used for every experiment with a nominal spring constant of 0.12 N/m and a half cone angle of 20 degrees. Actual spring constant was calibrated using the built-in thermal noise method prior to measurement collection in each experiment. S9 follicles were located using the top view video camera and AFM force versus indentation data were collected on the middle of the follicle. The force data were recorded with a 0.6–1.2 μm/s tip approach velocity and a maximum force ranging from 1 to 5 nN. For each genotype, two to three follicles were probed per experiment for three independent experiments; a total of six to nine follicles were probed per genotype. In each region, five to eight different positions with 2–10 μm separations were probed. For each position, 3–10 multiple repeated force curves were recorded. Two stiffness values of follicles were determined by fitting the approach data of two separate tip depth force-indentation curves to the rearranged form of the Hertzian elastic contact model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heinrich, 1882</xref>). These two force-indentation ranges were selected to measure the stiffness of the basement membrane (20–100 nm) and underlying nurse cells (310–550 nm) and are similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chlasta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crest et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).

Bands were quantified using densitometry analysis in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramoff et al., 2004</xref>). Zipper levels were assessed using four independent, biological samples per genotype, and statistical significance was determined using a two-sample t-test with unequal variance in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69836-transrepform1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript as Figure-specific source data files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Westside Fly Group and Dunnwald lab for helpful discussions, and the Tootle lab for helpful discussions and careful review of the manuscript.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> border cell migration, a model collective cell migration, Lamb, Tootle and colleagues found that the actin bundling protein fascin has an antagonistic relationship non-muscle myosin II. By eliminating fascin expression in border cells, non-muscle myosin II activity increased. However, altering border cell contractility resulted in changes in the stiffness of the surrounding substrate demonstrating that migrating cells are not simply responding to the stiffness of their environment in vivo, but are actively modulating it. This manuscript will be of interest to the actomyosin and cell migration field, and more broadly to developmental and cell biologists.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Fascin limits Myosin activity within <italic>Drosophila</italic> border cells to control substrate stiffness and promote migration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Derek Applewhite as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jordan Beach (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I would encourage the authors to limit assumptions of prior knowledge of fly development and border cell migration terminology. The authors make some efforts to guide the reader along at points (cartoon in figure 2A), but even these could use some additional information. I will note a few specific points, but I would recommend that for a journal with broad readership like this, a more guided tour of the research, especially the genetics, would be helpful:</p><p>– Figure 2A: border cells are not labeled. Follicle cells are not labeled. Why are follicle cells green and the data in Figure 2D also green? This is a little confusing. Related here: it took us a while to realize that &quot;for increased clarity, graphs quantifying stiffness are represented in green&quot; meant that throughout the paper, those graphs were in green. And this is true for other measurements as well. Perhaps the Y axis could also be colored to make this clear and &quot;throughout the manuscript&quot; could be added the first time this idea is conveyed? So &quot;Stiffness, kPa&quot; in green and &quot;Nurse cell pMRLC&quot; in blue? I'm not wed to the y-axis colorization, but some clarity on the coloring throughout the manuscript is advised because we both missed it the first couple times through.</p><p>– A cartoon guide to which cells are expected to lose fascin in germline, somatic, border cell knockdown (Figure 5) would be helpful. Perhaps a similar cartoon to figure 2A</p><p>2) The authors should more explicitly indicate how they measured p-MRLC levels in border cells versus nurse cells. How p-MRLC &quot;puncta&quot; are measured, and in particular what the authors mean by &quot;length&quot; of puncta, should be clarified. More notably, the p-MRLC staining looks quite different from the MRLC-GFP images shown.</p><p>3) The authors should clarify how many stage 9 follicles (egg chambers) they measured in each AFM experiment and for each genotype. In the Materials and methods, it says that 2-3 follicles were measured for each experiment. This seems like a low number, although it is a technically challenging method. A recent study from the Bilder lab (Chen et al., Nature Communications 2019) appeared to measure at least 8 follicles per genotype. This is particularly important, since the data points for the stiffness measurements are generally quite broad and overlap between controls and mutants, e.g., with ~5-15 kPa in control nurse cells and ~15-45 kPa in fascin null nurse cells (e.g., Figure 2D; but also Figure 5G).</p><p>4) Third, the non-autonomous control of nurse cell substrate stiffness, and levels of activated myosin in nurse cells, by loss of fascin in border cells (and by overexpression of activated Rho-kinase in border cells) is interesting and novel. The authors propose that the border cells regulate the stiffness of nurse cells to facilitate border cell migration. Further clarification of this phenotype would strengthen the manuscript. Specifically, do the authors find elevated p-MRLC in nurse cells that are in front of the border cells, or a more general elevation of p-MRLC levels (and presumably nurse cell stiffness)?</p><p>5) The authors use pharmacological inhibition of myosin and/or activation of myosin to rescue border cell migration (Figure 3 and Figure 3, figure supplement 1). The Y-27632 drug and MRLC-RNAi should be fine. However, <italic>Drosophila</italic> myosin has been reported to be insensitive to blebbistatin (Straight et al., Science 2003; Heissler et al., FASEB J. 2015). Therefore, caution should be taken in assessing the results with blebbistatin in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>6) In Figure 3, the authors state that they were unable to knock down sqh by RNAi in border cells. Mishra et al. (Mol Biol Cell 2019) drove sqh RNAi with c306-GAL4 along with temperature-sensitive GAL80 to bypass lethality. This may be a way to decrease myosin levels just in fascin mutant border cells. Alternatively, the authors could overexpress constitutively activated Mbs (myosin phosphatase; Mbs N300), which should similarly reduce myosin activation (Lee and Treisman, Mol Biol Cell 2004).</p><p>7) With respect to the influence of the border cells on nurse cell stiffness – Do fascin mutant border cells mainly increase stiffness in front of the cluster, behind the cluster, or everywhere? While it would be difficult to measure stiffness using AFM in this case, the authors can examine p-MRLC. What happens when only some border cells are mutant for fascin (and/or overexpress activated Rok)? In this case, does it change which nurse cells have elevated p-MRLC?</p><p>8) p-MRLC immunostaining is used throughout and normalized to phalloidin staining or &quot;background staining in the same follicle&quot;. We have a couple of concerns here. If you are down regulating a key actin bundling protein, should you be normalizing p-MRLC to actin? Couldn't F-actin be going down and p-MRLC stay the same, giving a relative increase in p-MRL:Actin ratio? Second, what is &quot;background staining&quot; in a follicle? Myosin is expressed in all of these cells and will be present in both the cortex and cytoplasm. Any &quot;background&quot; will be a combination of noise and real myosin signal. Where this background is taken is important. Traditionally, a phosphorylation event would be normalized to the same protein with that is being phosphorylated. Can the authors not normalize to MHC or MRLC? Similarly, are total levels of MHC/zipper and MRLC/sqh normal when manipulating fascin expression?</p><p>9) Can the authors further elaborate on how they think border cells influence nurse cell stiffness? Do the border cells &quot;tug&quot; on the nurse cells as they migrate, possibly through adhesion (and actomyosin) as border cells migrate upon the nurse cells? Possibly this may be clarified if the authors can analyze which nurse cells have elevated p-MRLC when border cells are mutant for fascin – in other words, is it only the nurse cell in front of the cluster with high p-MRLC, or is it all nurse cells?</p><p>10) Regarding novelty of cells controlling the stiffness of their substrate, I'm not convinced that this idea has not been entirely unexplored. The authors state 544- &quot;Together our data uncover the transformative finding that collectively migrating cells modulate the stiffness of their substrate (Figure 7)&quot;. I think the novelty is more complex, considering the substrate here is another cell type. I'd note at least two recent papers that demonstrate similar ideas with cell:ECM interactions (below). I would encourage the authors to reserve some of their novelty claims for cell:cell migration, or clarify if we are misunderstanding their conclusions relative to the previous models. Also is there ECM in between these border and nurse cells?</p><p>– van Helvert and Friedl, 2016 (cited).</p><p>– Doyle, Yamada and colleagues, Dev Cell 2021 (not cited).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69836.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I would encourage the authors to limit assumptions of prior knowledge of fly development and border cell migration terminology.

The crosses necessary to generate this stock are complex since the <italic>fascin</italic> gene and c306-GAL4 driver are both on the X chromosome (requiring a recombinant chromosome that likes to separate) and the <italic>fascin</italic>-null females are sterile. Thus far we have been unable to generate these flies.</p><p>As an alternative we have attempted to knockdown Rok by RNAi in the border cells (c306-GAL4) of <italic>fascin</italic> mutants. We were able to obtain adult flies of <italic>c306-GAL4, fascin<sup>sn28</sup>/fascin<sup>sn28</sup>;;UAS Rok RNAi</italic>. However, moving these flies to 29ºC to drive knockdown resulted in most of the flies dying. Our limited analysis of the few remaining flies reveals that even in the control – <italic>c306-GAL4; UAS Rok RNAi</italic> – Myosin activity levels are not significantly reduced, suggesting that Rok is not sufficiently knocked down.</p><p>We have also been attempting to generate the <italic>fascin<sup>sn28</sup>/FM7;; UAS Mbs-N300</italic> stock to attempt this experiment another way. To generate this stock, we first had to make double balanced stocks on each chromosome. This line is just now being established, and therefore, we have not yet been able to attempt this experiment. We did, however, generate <italic>c306 GAL4; UAS Mbs-N300</italic> adult females. Initial examination of pMRLC levels reveals that expression of Mbs-N300 is not sufficient to significantly reduce pMRLC levels compared to controls; this finding suggests the proposed experiment in the <italic>fascin</italic> mutant background is unlikely to yield interpretable results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) With respect to the influence of the border cells on nurse cell stiffness – Do fascin mutant border cells mainly increase stiffness in front of the cluster, behind the cluster, or everywhere? While it would be difficult to measure stiffness using AFM in this case, the authors can examine p-MRLC. What happens when only some border cells are mutant for fascin (and/or overexpress activated Rok)? In this case, does it change which nurse cells have elevated p-MRLC?</p></disp-quote><p>These are very interesting questions. In relation to the spatial regulation of stiffening, the pMRLC data suggests that it extends from the border cells in all directions. How that is occurring temporally remains to be determined. Such information requires the development of tools that differentially label Myosin activity on the border cells from that of the nurse cells, and rapid, non-photobleaching imaging. We are currently attempting to build such tools.</p><p>In relation to what happens if some cells are mutant for <italic>fascin</italic>, that is an interesting question. We speculate that our current tools do not provide the resolving power to address this, as we expect that altering Myosin activity in one cell of the cluster, will push/pull on the other cells, driving rapid changes in Myosin activity in the wild-type cells. This would be particularly concerning for the Rok-CAT expression. Further, we are concerned about whether the experimental approach would work well enough to generate interpretable data. Specifically, while the experiment could be done using RNAi knockdown in a clonal manner, we are concerned whether the data will be interpretable as Fascin knockdown can be variable due to the high level of expression in the border cells. Thus, we think it would be better to look at mutant clones, however, no allele of <italic>fascin</italic> is currently available on an FRT chromosome. In summary, these are interesting questions that we hope to address in the future when we have developed the tools and imaging methods to resolve Myosin activity temporally and spatially.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) p-MRLC immunostaining is used throughout and normalized to phalloidin staining or &quot;background staining in the same follicle&quot;.

First, we depict how the measurements and calculations were made. We also show that Actin levels on the nurse cell membranes in wild-type and <italic>fascin</italic> mutant follicles are not significantly different from each other. Further, we clarified in the Results and Methods that “background staining” refers to the cytoplasm of the nurse cell. We also show that the levels of background pMRLC staining in wild-type and <italic>fascin</italic> mutant follicles are not significantly different. We were unable to use unphosphorylated Myosin as a control because of the lack of antibodies to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myosin components, and the available antibodies for Myosin heavy chain (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Zipper) or MRLC (mammalian MRLCs) failed to work in our hands for immunofluorescence. We also now show that the protein level of Myosin heavy chain (Zipper) does not change between wild-type and <italic>fascin</italic>-null Stage 9 follicles by western blot (Figure 2 – supplemental figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Can the authors further elaborate on how they think border cells influence nurse cell stiffness?
