genes allows bacteria to adapt to constantly shifting environmental pressures, bestowing functional advantages to their bacterial hosts such as antibiotic resistance, metal resistance, virulence factors, and polysaccharide utilization. However, common molecular methods such as short- and long-read sequencing of microbiomes cannot associate extrachromosomal plasmids with the genome of the host bacterium. Alternative methods to link plasmids to host bacteria are either laborious, expensive, or prone to contamination. Here we present the One-step Isolation and Lysis PCR (OIL-PCR) method, which molecularly links plasmid-encoded genes with the bacterial 16S rRNA gene via fusion PCR performed within an emulsion. After validating this method, we apply it to identify the bacterial hosts of three clinically relevant beta-lactamases within the gut microbiomes of neutropenic patients, as they are particularly vulnerable multidrug-resistant infections. We successfully detect the known association of a multi-drug resistant plasmid with <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, as well as the novel associations of two low-abundance genera, <italic>Romboutsia</italic> and <italic>Agathobacter</italic>. Further investigation with OIL-PCR confirmed that our detection of <italic>Romboutsia</italic> is due to its physical association with <italic>Klebsiella</italic> as opposed to directly harboring the beta-lactamase genes. Here we put forth a robust, accessible, and high-throughput platform for sensitively surveying the bacterial hosts of mobile genes, as well as detecting physical bacterial associations such as those occurring within biofilms and complex microbial communities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antibiotic resistance genes</kwd><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>human microbiome</kwd><kwd>plasmid</kwd><kwd>fusion PCR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000030</institution-id><institution>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OADS BAA 2016-N-17812</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Satlin</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name><name><surname>Brito</surname><given-names>Ilana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1661338</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brito</surname><given-names>Ilana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1650122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brito</surname><given-names>Ilana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K23 AI114994</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Satlin</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2HL141007-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brito</surname><given-names>Ilana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brito</surname><given-names>Ilana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

The gut microbiome harbors a diverse repertoire of ARGs, and these genes have been proposed to serve as a reservoir for HGT with MDR pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sommer et al., 2009</xref>). ARGs are often carried on mobilizable plasmids that impose technical challenges to surveying the set of bacteria affiliated with these genes. Standard molecular tools such as PCR and next-generation sequencing often fail to associate mobile ARGs with their bacterial hosts because they cannot capture the cellular context of extrachromosomal genes. Novel untargeted sequencing methods, such as bacterial Hi-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kent et al., 2020</xref>) and methylation profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaulaurier et al., 2018</xref>), provide broad reconstruction of plasmidâhost relationships in metagenomes, as a trade-off for sensitivity. Alternatively, single-cell whole-genome sequencing offers an ideal solution to this problem, but may be lower throughput, more expensive and require specialized equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lan et al., 2017</xref>). Targeted methods, such as bacterial cell culture under antibiotic selection, require that the ARG is expressed, functional, and selective in all hosts. Culturing, applied broadly to capture the full diversity of the gut microbiome, is complicated by the need for wide-ranging media and growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poyet et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Several targeted methods using single-cell qPCR have been used to identify the hosts of specific genes; however, each uses specialized microfluidic devices, is limited in bacterial taxa they can capture, and most do not allow direct sequencing of the PCR products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ottesen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tadmor et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, epicPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spencer et al., 2015</xref>) uses fusion PCR and two emulsion steps to associate a taxonomic marker with a functional gene. Sequencing the fused PCR products provides accurate and sensitive associations between 16S sequence taxonomy and a given target gene. However, this method can be challenging to execute, difficult to scale up for multiple samples, and utilizes toxic and difficult-to-acquire reagents.</p><p>Here, we put forth One-step Isolation and Lysis PCR (OIL-PCR), a method that detects hostâARG associations from complex microbial communities through cellular emulsion and fusion PCR. Our streamlined method, based on the innovation of epicPCR, simplifies the procedure by combining the two emulsion steps of cell lysis and fusion PCR into a single emulsion PCR that can be performed in a 96-well format using robotic automation. Furthermore, OIL-PCR can be multiplexed to target at least three genes in the same reaction, uses non-toxic commercially available reagents, and can be performed without relying on microfluidics or specialized equipment. Validation experiments on three environmental bacterial communities reveal that OIL-PCR is highly accurate and specific. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in examining the bacterial hosts of three extended spectrum beta-lactamase genes in the gut of neutropenic patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of the OIL-PCR method</title><p>OIL-PCR applies established fusion PCR methods to fuse any gene of interest to the 16S rRNA gene using three primers: two primers hybridize to the target gene and a universal 16S reverse primer hybridizes to the V4 region. Amplification of the target gene appends a universal 16S forward primer sequence to the end of the target amplicon via a tailed reverse primer. The target gene amplicon then acts as a primer for amplification and hybridizes to the 16S rRNA gene as a forward primer, producing a fused gene product containing both the target gene and the 16S V4 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>OIL-PCR can specifically link plasmid-encoded genes with their hosts.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Depiction of the OIL-PCR method.Â (1) Nycodenz-purified cells are mixed with PCR master mix, lysozyme, and emulsion oil and shaken to create an emulsion.

Oil emulsions and microwells have long been used to isolate eukaryotic cells; however, it is difficult to lyse bacteria in this format, especially gram-positive bacteria due to their thick cell walls. Existing single-cell isolation methods for bacteria either do not address this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tadmor et al., 2011</xref>), rely on specialized microfluidics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), or use time-consuming methods to encapsulate bacteria within hydrogel beads before performing multi-step chemical and enzymatic lysis procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spencer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tamminen and Virta, 2015</xref>). To address this problem, OIL-PCR combines bacterial isolation, lysis, and fusion PCR into a single streamlined reaction.</p><p>We developed a protocol that allows for the incorporation of Ready-Lyse (RL) Lysozyme into the fusion PCR master mix. Whole bacterial cells are added directly to the master mix while on ice to inhibit lytic activity during sample preparation. Vigorous shaking of the mixture then encapsulates the individual cells in an emulsion. Warming the emulsion to 30Â°C activates the enzyme, lysing the cells. Next, a standard PCR thermocycler carries out the fusion PCR in the single-cell emulsions. Fused PCR products are purified from the emulsion and amplified further with a nested primer to filter out off-target PCR products and add Illumina adapters. Lastly, custom indexing primers are used to index the fused products before Illumina sequencing. Our experiments confirmed the compatibility of the RL Lysozyme with the fusion PCR, but required the addition of bovine serum albuminÂ (BSA), a globular protein known to reduce protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finn et al., 2012</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2a</xref>).

PCR emulsions were prepared with fluorinated oil as used in modern emulsion-based methods, such as Drop-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>) and digital qPCR (BioRad ddPCR). We combined the fusion PCR master mix with bacterial cells and emulsion oil in either a 1.5 ml tube or a 0.5 ml deep-well plate before emulsifying the mixture using a tabletop bead homogenizer. Unlike microfluidic-enabled emulsions, our protocol leverages equipment commonly found in most molecular biology laboratories. We stabilized the emulsion with detergent-free buffers and improved the efficiency of the PCR amplification within the emulsion by adding additional polymerase, BSA, dithiothreitol (DTT), and ammonium sulfate. We found that the addition of extra MgCl<sub>2</sub> mitigated the inhibitory effects of extremely high concentrations of cell debris within droplets after lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>OIL-PCR accurately associates plasmid genes with the host in a binary community</title><p>In any emulsion-based method, it is essential to optimize the concentration of input cells to prevent the encapsulation of two or more cells in the same droplet. When using a monodisperse emulsion such as those generated using microfluidics, the ideal concentration of input cells is chosen using a Poisson distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ottesen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tadmor et al., 2011</xref>). However, these calculations are not reliable in the case of a polydisperse emulsion, as employed here to avoid the need for microfluidic devices. We therefore developed a probe-based TaqMan qPCR assay to experimentally verify the optimal concentration of input cells that prevented non-specific gene fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3a</xref>). OIL-PCR was performed on a binary community consisting of <italic>E. coli</italic> carrying the chloramphenicol resistance gene <italic>cmR</italic> on a plasmid and WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. The two strains were mixed 1:1, and we performed OIL-PCR with a fusion primer set specific to <italic>cmR</italic> and universally targeting the 16S rRNA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spencer et al., 2015</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>). A gradient of cell input concentrations was used, and the final PCR products were recovered and purified. We then performed probe-based qPCR on the purified product using a nested primer for <italic>cmR</italic>, two blocking primers to inactivate any unfused amplicons, and two distinct fluorescent TaqMan probes (ThermoÂ Fisher 4316034) to specifically target the V4 region of either <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The fluorescent signal from each probe measured the relative ratio of specific to non-specific gene fusions present in the final amplicon pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3a</xref>). When the input concentration of cells was at or lower than 400 cells/Î¼l, or 40 k cells per reaction, non-specific gene fusion detection was reduced to undetectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3b</xref>). As well as confirming that bacterial cells were isolated within the emulsion, we further confirmed that droplets did not coalesce by performing the TaqMan assay on OIL-PCR products from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells combined after they were individually emulsified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3b</xref>).

Additionally, concerned that cell-free DNA can stick to the membranes and cell walls of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vorkapic et al., 2016</xref>), thus introducing noisy associations in the data, we treated cells with heat-liable double-strand-specific DNase (dsDNase). This enzyme only digests unprotected double stranded genomic DNA present in the samples without degrading single-strand primers. By controlling the enzyme concentration, temperature, and speed at which cells were processed, we were able to digest extra-cellular DNA without impacting PCR efficiency of cellular contents. Using our Taqman assay, we demonstrated that including dsDNase treatment has the potential to increase the total cell input per reaction tenfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3c</xref>).</p><p>To test the accuracy of our method on environmental samples, we spiked <italic>Escherichia coli MG1655</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blattner et al., 1997</xref>) containing plasmid pBAD33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 1995</xref>) harboring the <italic>cmR</italic> gene into two human and one chicken stool samples that lacked the gene according to PCR screening.

We performed standard 16S sequencing on human and chicken stool communities using OIL-PCR, testing three variables: the effect of lysozyme, dsDNase, and heat inactivation of dsDNase on total bacterial recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). All eight combinations of the three variables were tested in duplicate for two stool samples using robotic automation. For our analysis, we chose to focus on the total number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) captured in our data rather than relative abundance metrics, as this better reflects our goal of detecting species, rather than recapitulating the starting community structure.</p><p>First, we assayed how each of the three variables (RL, dsDNase, and heat inactivation) affected OTU recovery. Based on rarefaction curves, we found dsDNase and heat inactivation had no significant effect on OTU recovery in human and chicken stool, while RL lysozyme significantly increases OTU recovery in chicken stool based on Welchâs t-test with BenjaminiâHochberg FDR correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). RL was the only variable that significantly changed OTU recovery, and therefore, it was the only variable considered for further analysis.</p><p>Next, we looked to see which taxonomic groups were being enriched or depleted with the addition of lysozyme. Technical replicate OTU tables were combined for analysis to allow for deeper sampling depth. Rarefaction curves were generated for both lysozyme treatments at each taxonomic level containing 10 or more OTUs from Phylum to Genus. Results show that no taxonomic group was significantly depleted in either human or chicken stool samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref>). Chicken rarefaction curves trended higher with lysozyme for every taxonomic group tested, with significant improvements for the phyla <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, and <italic>Cyanobacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref>). Overall, 14 taxonomic groups were significantly enriched in chicken stool, mostly from <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>.</p><p>The effect of lysozyme on human stool was not as pronounced as for chicken stool, but it did significantly enrich for the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phylum as well as the <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> family. The only group that trended worse with lysozyme was the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> (p-val 0.45), with the family <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> accounting for most of the effect. Interestingly, the closely related and biologically important family <italic>Prevotellaceae</italic> was enriched with a p-val of 0.07 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6b</xref>). While we cannot fully explain why lysozyme generally improves capture of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> in chicken but not human stool, the overall benefit of lysozyme is apparent, especially for capturing the breadth of diversity within the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phylum. We noticed that the total number of OTUs recovered from OIL-PCR was significantly lower than 16S sequencing of the input community at the same sampling depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>). We hypothesized the reason for this reduction in OTUs was due to subsampling bias introduced through low cell input and variable amplification efficiency in OIL-PCR. To test our hypothesis, we combined OTU tables from two, four, and eight technical replicates and found a consistent up-shift for each rarefaction curve as we combined more tables. This up-shift was not observed when combining the input Nycodenz sequencing, indicating that the reduced OTU counts were due in part to subsampling bias and not an inherent failure to capture bacterial taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>). We therefore recommend OIL-PCR to be performed in replicates to increase the total number of cells being sampled.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Increased throughput through automation and multiplexing</title><p>To further improve the efficiency and throughput of OIL-PCR, we sought to transition the method from 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes to a 96-well plate format using the Eppendorf epMotion liquid handling robot.

We identify improvements in performing single-cell analysis on stool, namely the use of a Nycodenz purification step and the incorporation of lysozyme plus heat-induced lysis. Additionally, we increased throughput at least threefold through primer multiplexing and developed an automated protocol to process at least 48 samples concurrently, allowing a total of 144 gene-sample association tests per batch.</p><p>Additional improvements to OIL-PCR could be explored to further increase throughput and sensitivity. Although we tested multiplexing three genes per reaction, this number could likely be increased as we have found no sign of false positives due to multiplexing as demonstrated by associating a novel <italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM</sub> variant with only <italic>Escherichia</italic> in time point T2 of patient B335 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). Furthermore, we show that the OIL-PCR master mix facilitates permissive annealing of primers, allowing a mismatch one base from the primerâs 3â end as demonstrated when <italic>bla</italic><sub>OXY</sub> was detected in sample B324-2 with <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> primers. These results could allow for the development of highly degenerate primers to target a broad range of gene variants. Non-specific priming during OIL-PCR is not of concern because the nested PCR specifically filters out undesired fusion products. Because OIL-PCR uses three primers for each target gene, primers designed for OIL can easily be adapted for probe-based qPCR pre-screening of samples instead of using metagenomic sequencing as was done in this study.</p><p>While the startup cost of using OIL-PCR is low compared to other methods, currently it uses large amounts of Phusion polymerase and magnetic beads for DNA purification which inflates the cost (~$15/100 Âµl reaction). The amount of Phusion needed could be reduced with further optimization of the PCR master mix, and the number of purification steps can be cut by using enzymatic exonuclease I treatment of PCR instead of purification. Lastly, the method described currently allows 40,000 cells total per reaction; however, our probe-based qPCR assays suggest that the input concentration could be increased 10-fold by pretreating cells with dsDNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3c</xref>). Combined with our result showing that OIL-PCR is more accurate when detecting low-abundant taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), we feel confident that cell input can be increased to improve sensitivity without sacrificing accuracy.</p><p>OIL-PCR is a highly versatile platform that could be applied across fields to address a multitude of questions. While we were interested in plasmid-born ARGs in the gut, the method could be used to target any gene of interest that is difficult to associate with a host using metagenomics. As mobile genetic elements are notoriously difficult to assemble due to their promiscuity which complicates de Bruijn graph assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antipov et al., 2019</xref>), this method could be applied to find the hosts of integrated and non-integrated mobile elements. Similarly, as metavirome sequencing has revealed a massive number of viral genomes with unknown hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shkoporov and Hill, 2019</xref>), OIL-PCR may be particularly useful in addressing this gap in understanding. Additionally, viral and plasmid host-range is an important determinant for understanding and modeling bacterial ecology of predation and HGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores et al., 2011</xref>). As we have shown here, OIL-PCR can detect direct physical associations of bacteria. Such interactions are important for understanding biofilm composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shi et al., 2020</xref>), identifying endosymbionts, or detecting cross-feeding bacteria which require the direct exchange of nutrients to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Souza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goyal et al., 2021</xref>), information which could allow for culturing of these often unculturable species. In cases when physical associations are not of interest, samples may be filtered to remove clumped bacteria. Furthermore, targeting functional metabolic genes detected in metagenomes, but present at low abundance in bacterial communities, could identify novel bacteria involved in nutrient cycling which has remained a persistent challenge in the field of bacterial ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Preheim et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, when combined with microfluidics, direct lysis of bacteria in an emulsion, as shown here, could be used to develop or simplify single-cell genome sequencing or single-cell RNA-seq for bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Optimizing OIL-PCR buffer for phusion and RL lysozyme compatibility</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>SYBR-Based qPCR assay for phusion polymerase activity with lysozyme</title><p>SYBR-based qPCR were set up in duplicate as follows: 25 Î¼l reactions with 20 U/ml Phusion Hot Start Flex DNA polymerase (NEB M0535L), 1Ã HF Buffer, 200 Î¼M dNTP mix (NEB N0447L), 400 nM of 519F and 786R, 1Ã SYBR Green (Thermo Fisher S7563), 1Ã ROX reference dye (Thermo Fisher 12223012), 0.5 mg/ml of BSA (NEB B9000S) when included, 0.01% Triton-X 100, and 1 Î¼l of template DNA.

DNA was isolated from samples destined for metagenomic sequencing using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen) with additional proteinase K treatment and freeze/thaw cycles recommended by the manufacturer for difficult-to-lyse cells. Extractions were further purified using 1.8 volumes of Agencourt AMPure XP bead solution (Beckman Coulter). DNA was diluted to 0.2 ng/Î¼l in nuclease-free water and processed for sequencing using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Design and validation of OIL-PCR fusion primers</title><p>ARG variants for the three <italic>bla</italic> genes were downloaded from the CARD database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcock et al., 2020</xref>) and aligned in Snapgene using default MUSCLE parameters.

This is an improvement of the previously published epicPCR and relies on cellular emulsion and fusion PCR in one step. Tracking horizontal gene transfer of mobile resistance genes is exceptionally important in the context of AMR and its burden on public health. In addition, the method can be applied to other studies on complex microbial communities beyond antibiotic resistance.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Linking plasmid-based beta-lactamases to their bacterial hosts using single-cell fusion PCR&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

At the reviewersâ suggestion, we designed OIL-PCR fusion primers targeting two <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> housekeeping genes (<italic>rpoB</italic> and <italic>glmS</italic>) and two <italic>Romboutsia timonensis</italic> genes (<italic>rpoB</italic> and <italic>nusA</italic>). While these genes are universally present, they are divergent enough between strains that primers can be designed specifically at the species level. Using these primer sets, along with CTX-M primers as a control, we ran OIL-PCR to see if we found <italic>Klebsiella</italic> marker genes fused to <italic>Romboutsia</italic> 16S sequences or vice versa. <italic>Klebsiella</italic> primers were multiplexed with CTX-M and the <italic>Romboutsia</italic> primers were assayed in separate reactions to rule out the possibility of PCR chimeras during library preparation.</p><p>The results showed that <italic>Romboutsia</italic> 16S sequences were indeed fused to both <italic>Klebsiella</italic> marker genes, mirroring the same pattern as was seen for the ARGs and transposase genes assayed. The CTX-M control also presented the same pattern as previously demonstrated. Although the <italic>nusA</italic> primers failed to amplify, the <italic>RomboutsiarpoB</italic> sequences were correctly fused to <italic>Romboutsia</italic> 16S. <italic>Klebsiella</italic> 16S was also found fused to <italic>RomboutsiarpoB</italic>, however, the finding was only observed in two out of the 9 total replicates across the three samples, and did not perfectly mirror results from all other OIL-PCR experiments.</p><p>We feel that these results, taken with our previous OIL-PCR experiments, present compelling evidence that the observations can best be explained as a novel physical association between <italic>Klebsiella</italic> pneumoniae and <italic>Romboutsia timonensis</italic>. We have adjusted our manuscript to reflect these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide an additional figure with the global computational pipeline used so that readers better understand how the results were obtained.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. This figure was included as supplemental figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide a detailed protocol with a list of reagents and equipment.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, thank you for the suggestion. We have added the lab protocol to our submission and we hope that this facilitates adoption of our method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please provide a clearer comparison of your results with the HiC linkage obtained in Kent et al., rather than just the metagenomic data as it would strengthen the claims and results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we have a unique ability to leverage our Hi-C results from experiments performed on the same samples. We have updated the manuscript to include discussion of the Hi-C results and how they compare to the OIL-PCR results.</p><p>We are happy to report that OIL-PCR confirms our previous Hi-C results. The Hi-C data and our OIL-PCR results both accurately associate the large <italic>Klebsiella</italic> plasmid with <italic>Klebsiella</italic>. Hi-C does not capture the <italic>Romboutsia</italic> association, but this is to be expected since we conclude that <italic>Romboutsia</italic> is physically associated with <italic>Klebsiella</italic> and does not have the genes. The Hi-C results also detect the putative transfer of the plasmid from <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> to <italic>Citrobacter braakii</italic>. Our initial OIL-PCR results did not include this association because the two species only have a 1 SNP difference between them and were therefore clustered into the same OTU; however, when we look at SNP level differences, it does appear that <italic>Citrobacter</italic> is associating with all three ARGs at time points 2 and 3 only, confirming our previous Hi-C result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) you compare the results of sequencing with a custom database of expected sequences but what are the results if compared to the NCBI database?</p></disp-quote><p>In our pipeline, we use BLAST against a small database of expected target genes as a simple confirmation of our PCR product. Since the method is PCR based, with three primers for each target gene, nearly 100% of our sequences align to our small database of expected target genes. Therefore, it is not necessary to align to the NCBI database. This said, we do obtain a small novel or unexpected sequences in our PCR that do not perfectly hit our expected sequences, and are apparent as a lower identity hit. For these, as the reviewers suggest, we have used the NCBI database to determine whether the particular variant has been observed. An example of this is that we observed an OXY gene in B314, even though this was not an expected target and not included in the database.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The analysis of the effect of lysozyme on improving capture of gram positive bacteria is restrained to phylum. A more in-depth analysis (at the class level for instance) would be useful. For instance, it exists a clear difference between chicken and human stool samples with or without lysozyme. Why? Is it linked to some specific phylum?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. We constrained our analysis to only show any phylum with a statistically significant difference between the two treatments; however, by restricting the results in this way, we failed to highlight global, albeit less significant, trends in the data that provide greater insight into the effects of lysozyme.</p><p>To provide a better picture of the results, we generated rarefaction curves for every taxonomic level from phylum to genus that had at least 10 OTUs (Supplemental Figure 6). We then built a phylogeny with rarefaction curves for each taxonomic level containing more than 20 OTUs as well as less abundant branches containing significant or interesting results.</p><p>We were excited to find that Lysozyme improved OTU recovery for chicken stool at every level of taxonomy observed. We also were able to show that the reduced recovery in Human stool was almost exclusively due to poor amplification of <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> which makes up the majority of human stool diversity and thus has an outsized effect on the results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
