Molecularly, the Hippo pathway is composed of a kinase cascade that catalyzes a series of phosphorylation events at the plasma membrane. The core pathway includes Ste20-like kinase 1 (MST1) and MST2, which phosphorylate and activate large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) and LATS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 1995</xref>). LATS1/2 phosphorylation results in the phosphorylation of downstream effector Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP), leading to its cytoplasmic retention and inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). Several other proteins work together to regulate the core kinase cascade, such as Salvador homolog 1 (SAV1) and MOB kinase activator 1 A and 1B (MOB1A/B), binders of MST1/2 and LATS1/2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Udan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lai et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the Hippo pathway, YAP is also regulated by protein-protein interactions, such as with the angiomotin family of proteins (AMOT, AMOTL1, and AMOTL2), which directly bind to and cause the localization of YAP at tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Adherens junctions and tight junctions are important sites of Hippo pathway regulation that link to the core kinases of the Hippo pathway through the AMOT proteins. When the Hippo pathway is inactivated, YAP translocates to the nucleus, acting as a transcriptional co-activator of TEA domain transcription factors (TEADs), which increases the transcription of genes involved in cellular proliferation and survival.</p><p>Regulation of the Hippo pathway by cell-cell contacts, metabolic changes, and diverse extrinsic inputs results in decreased activity of YAP, which prevents organ overgrowth and abnormal cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>). On the other hand, YAP activity is also critical in healing injury by augmenting cellular proliferation and survival. While many multicellular organisms can repair wounded or damaged organs, mammalian regeneration is more limited, as many adult tissues lack the capacity to regenerate. Genetic activation of YAP, either by genetic inactivation of upstream Hippo pathway proteins or by forced overexpression of YAP, has been shown to enhance endogenous repair in wounded tissues. For example, hepatic knockdown of MST1/2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the mouse after partial hepatectomy augments regeneration of the liver via YAP-dependent hepatocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loforese et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, in the skin, YAP is essential for regenerative wound repair, as siRNA-mediated knockdown of YAP markedly delays wound closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, conditional hyperactivation of YAP enhances the proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes, thickening the epidermal layer of neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Lastly, in the heart, an organ previously considered to have no regenerative potential post-development, conditional SAV deletion promotes the proliferation of cardiomyocytes and reverses deficits in ejection fraction volume post-myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Leach et al., 2017</xref>). Collectively, these studies suggest that small molecule activators of YAP may, therefore, display therapeutic utility in treating diseases etiologically defined by an insufficient proliferative response.</p><p>We recently reported the identification of PY-60, a small molecule that activates YAP by binding to a membrane-binding scaffolding protein, annexin A2 (ANXA2), which we defined as a central component of the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shalhout et al., 2021</xref>). This study suggested to us that likely many other druggable mechanisms exist for activating YAP including those associated with previously drugged cellular proteins. Here, to explore the hypothesis that known drugs might activate YAP-driven transcriptional activity, we performed a reporter-based screen of the comprehensive drug repurposing library ReFRAME. We found that SM04690, a small molecule kinase inhibitor in clinical trials for the treatment of osteoarthritis, activates YAP with nanomolar potency in cells. Mechanistic studies revealed the relevant target kinase of SM04690 to be CDC-like Kinase 2 (CLK2), inhibition of which induces alternative splicing of Hippo signaling component AMOTL2 that can no longer localize YAP to the plasma membrane, in effect activating YAP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screening of the ReFRAME library</title><p>To identify small molecule activators of YAP, we screened the Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) small molecule library using a HEK293A cell line with a stably integrated cassette of eight copies of the TEAD-binding element upstream of luciferase (293A-TEAD-LUC). This library contains ~13,000 small molecules that have undergone substantial preclinical evaluation and clinical development are FDA-approved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Janes et al., 2018</xref>). The screen was conducted using a previously validated assay in 1,536-well format at three compound concentrations (200 nM, 2 µM, and 10 µM) to maximize the potential number of mechanisms surveyed. Hit compounds were defined if they displayed increases in TEAD-LUC signal of more than five robust Z scores above the mean plate signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Identified hits could be grouped into several classes of inhibitors including known nonspecific modulators of transcription (e.g. bromodomain inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors), ion channel modulators, and kinase inhibitors, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Of these, we identified 15 kinase inhibitors that did not have any associated YAP augmenting activity and are not characterized inhibitors of MST1/2 and LATS1/2. Evaluating these 15 hits in dose response using the original screening assay with library material, we confirmed nine displayed reproducible YAP activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Of these, three were inhibitors of non-receptor tyrosine kinases including Cerdulatinib (inhibitor of SYK and JAK paralogs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Coffey et al., 2014</xref>; TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub>=0.31 µM), Peficitinib (a pan JAK inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nakada and Oda, 2015</xref>; TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub>=2.4 µM), and KX02 (an inhibitor of SRC family kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tu et al., 2012</xref>; TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub>=3.7 µM). Also identified as efficacious YAP activators were XL-999 (a pan RTK inhibitor, TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub>=1.5 µM) and CEP-1347 (a JNK family inhibitor; TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub>=2.5 µM). Two inhibitors of the AGC family of kinases were also identified, namely GSK690693 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rhodes et al., 2008</xref>) (TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub> &gt;20 µM) and AT13148 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yap et al., 2012</xref>) (TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub> &gt;20 µM). Lastly, we identified two inhibitors of CLK and DYRK family kinases including SM04690 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deshmukh et al., 2018</xref>) (TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub>=5.7 µM) and SM04646 (TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub>=2.1 µM), which had been initially described as agents which inhibit canonical Wnt signaling and induce differentiation of chondrocytes. Among these, we chose to further characterize SM04690, which is in clinical trials for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, as no association of its target kinases had previously been reported as related to Hippo pathway signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deshmukh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yazici et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A screen of Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) identifies pharmacological mechanisms for activating yes-associated protein (YAP).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting screening workflow, which resulted in the identification of nine kinase inhibitor-based YAP activating small molecules.

Likewise, SM04690 treatment markedly decreased phosphorylation of YAP, as SM04690 was found to decrease immunopositivity dose-dependently to anti-phospho-YAP in Western blotting experiments following 24 hr compound treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

We additionally observed by immunofluorescent imaging that YAP localized to the nucleus in MDCK cells treated with SM04690 (1 µM, 24 hr), suggesting that compound treatment promotes nuclear translocation and activation of YAP. This is in comparison to diffuse plasma membrane and cytoplasm YAP localization in DMSO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Lastly, since pharmacological YAP activators have been shown to promote the expansion of cells, we tested 0.2 nM SM04690 treatment in immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) over 7 days and found treatment promoted clonal expansion, as seen with rhodamine B staining and increased nuclei counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).

Following work defined SM04690 as an inhibitor of several subfamilies of related CMGC family protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deshmukh et al., 2019</xref>), including Dual Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation Regulated Kinase (DYRK) and CDC Like Kinase (CLK) subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Specifically, SM04690 has been shown to inhibit CLK2, CLK3, DYRK1A and B, Homeodomain Interacting Protein Kinase 1 (HIPK1), and HIPK2 with over 90% inhibition at 500 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deshmukh et al., 2019</xref>). As such, we hypothesized that inhibiting one of these targets was likely responsible for modulating YAP activity. Previously published transcript expression data from our lab indicated that among the targets of SM04690 only CLK2, DYRK1B, HIPK1, and HIPK2 are expressed in HEK293A cells, helping to narrow our search (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shalhout et al., 2021</xref>). We then treated 293A-TEAD-LUC cells with structurally distinct small molecule inhibitors of these putative targets to see if other treatments of cells with inhibitors to the potential target might recapitulate the YAP activating effect of SM04690. We found that only inhibitors targeting CLK2 (CC671, CLK-in-T3, and T025) elicited a dose-dependent increase in YAP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, inhibitors targeting DYRKs (Harmine, INDY, and Leucettine L41) and CLK4 (ML167, TG003) showed no activity at concentrations over multiple orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

The phosphorylation states of SR proteins dictate their subcellular localization and interactions with pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">da Silva et al., 2015</xref>). When CLK2 is inhibited, SR proteins are not phosphorylated, leading to alternative splicing that is most often exon skipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Salvador and Gomis, 2018</xref>). Previous work using pharmacological CLK2 inhibitors revealed that inhibiting SR phosphorylation had a marked transcriptome-wide effect on altering alternative splicing. Interestingly, the third most skipped exon of the transcriptome in response to CLK2 inhibition corresponded to exon 5 of Angiomotin-like 2 (AMOTL2), as nearly 3,000 new junction reads between non-neighboring exons were observed in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Exon 9 of AMOTL2 was also skipped but to a lesser extent with around 700 new junction reads. AMOTL2 is part of the AMOT family of proteins and is crucial to the tight junction localization of YAP through direct interaction with YAP’s WW domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, the knockdown of AMOTL2 decreases the content of tight junction-localized YAP, instead promoting YAP translocation to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). Given the central role that AMOTL2 plays in regulating YAP as well as the observation that no other canonical Hippo pathway member displayed alternative splicing in response to CLK2 inhibition, we hypothesized that SM04690 most likely increased YAP activity through modulating AMOTL2 splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SM04690 induces alternative splicing of AMOTL2</title><p>We first confirmed that SM04690 treatment results in alternative splicing of AMOTL2. Consistent with reported literature, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed that 24 hr SM04690 treatment at 1 µM induces exon skipping for exon 5 by 629-fold and exon 9 by 80-fold when compared to untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

Using semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR, in which primers are designed directly flanking an exon, we could visualize the presence of each splice isoform using gel electrophoresis. Exon 5, which is 93 base pairs long, has a PCR amplicon length of 132 base pairs when primer sequences are added on both ends (39 base pairs for both) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Indeed, in the untreated samples, the amplicon ran through the gel to just over 100 base pairs. However, in the sample treated with 100 nM of SM04690, there are two PCR amplicons, one which ran the same distance as the untreated sample and a second band that ran well under 100 base pairs, as only the sequences of the primers were amplified, indicating skipping of exon 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Exon 9 is 180 base pairs long with a PCR amplicon length of 218 base pairs with the primer sequences, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>) which we see in the untreated sample. Like exon 5, in the 100 nM SM04690 treated sample, a second PCR amplicon unique to the treated sample ran under 100 base pairs, indicating the skipping of exon 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>). This experiment thus confirmed that SM04690 treatment of HEK293A cells created exon skipping of exons as indicated by shorter PCR amplicons in treated samples differing from the untreated samples by exactly the length of the missing exon. The presence of exon skipped spliceoforms at the protein level was confirmed by anti-AMOTL2 Western blot using an antibody that can detect each possible spliceoform of AMOTL2. We found that with increasing SM04690 treatment in HEK293A cells for 24 hr, there was the appearance of broad lower molecular weight bands, consistent with the buildup of multiple forms of exon skipped AMOTL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). It is important to note that both the RT-qPCR and Western blot not only indicate the increase in alternative splicing but also an increase in the total AMOTL2 present with SM04690 treatment, as the relative transcript level of total AMOTL2 in SM04690 treated cells increased 2.3-fold in the RT-qPCR analysis and the Western blot showed increase bandwidth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Exon-skipped AMOTL2 activates YAP through a dominant mechanism</title><p>AMOTL2 interacts directly with YAP, helping to localize it to the plasma membrane.

AMOTL2 was originally discovered as an interactor of the membrane-associated protein Membrane Associated Guanylate Kinase, WW, and PDZ Domain Containing 1 (MAGI1), and it has also been shown to interact with tight junction-associated proteins such as Protein Associated with LIN7, MAGUK p55 Family Member (PALS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Patrie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ernkvist et al., 2009</xref>). Through these interactions, AMOTL2 localizes YAP to tight junctions, where YAP is inactivated by phosphorylation. We hypothesized that AMOTL2 spliceoforms created after SM04690 treatment can likely no longer interact with these membrane-associated proteins, acting to sequester YAP away from inhibitory Hippo signaling. Indeed, co-immunofluorescent studies in MDCK cells plated at high density indicated that 1 µM SM04690 treatment for 24 hr decreases co-localization of AMOTL2 with PALS1 and MAGI1 by approximately twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). While cloning of these large membrane-associated proteins proved difficult, we were able to clone the WW domain regions of MAGI1, which are responsible for its interaction with AMOTL2. From co-immunoprecipitation with the FLAG-tagged AMOTL2 spliceoforms in HEK293T cells, we found that AMOTL2 ∆9 and AMOTL2 ∆5∆9 lost their ability to interact with the WW domain regions of MAGI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that alternative splicing of AMOTL2 culminates in gene products less capable of plasma membrane localization, which results in decreased YAP phosphorylation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we set out to identify repurposed drugs that might activate YAP, an effort we hypothesized would yield new druggable mechanisms for inactivating the Hippo pathway. From a high-throughput screen of the ReFRAME library, we have identified several kinase inhibitors that activate YAP. We specifically examined SM04690 as a novel YAP activator and have demonstrated a connection between CLK2 inhibition and YAP activity. Specifically, CLK2 inhibition induces exon skipping of exons 5 and 9 of AMOTL2, a protein integral to Hippo pathway activity. We propose a working model in which the alternative splicing of AMOTL2 impedes its ability to interact with proteins at the plasma membrane, such as PALS1 and MAGI-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The exon-skipped AMOTL2 gene product is, therefore, unable to shepherd YAP to tight junctions at the plasma membrane where it receives inhibitory phosphorylation. Consequently, unphosphorylated YAP is capable of translocating to the nucleus, where it interacts with TEADs to promote transcription of genes related to proliferation and survival. While we focused our efforts on understanding the role of SM04690, we identified several other kinase inhibitors as efficacious activators of YAP. Several of the reported targets of these identified inhibitors corresponded to related kinase families, including JAK kinases and AGC kinases. Future investigation into these and other protein kinase-based mechanisms will likely reveal several other druggable kinases that regulate Hippo pathway activity.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Alternative splicing of Angiomotin-like 2 (AMOTL2) modulates Hippo pathway activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A mechanistic model depicting that in the unperturbed system, AMOTL2 localizes at the membranes with proteins associated at tight junctions, bringing yes-associated protein (YAP) in contact with the core kinase cascade of the Hippo pathway resulting in its phosphorylation and retention in the cytoplasm.

Specifically, AMOTL2 has been shown to inhibit YAP, restraining it to the plasma membrane while concurrently stimulating the enzymatic activity of LATS1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paramasivam et al., 2011</xref>). These functions are possible due to AMOTL2’s activity as a scaffolding protein, bringing LATS1/2 in close proximity to MST1/2 at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mana-Capelli and McCollum, 2018</xref>). While most research indicates AMOTL2 plays a role in negatively regulating YAP activity, there remains some debate in the field as to whether AMOTL2, and more broadly the AMOT family of proteins, might also exert YAP stimulating activities in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lv et al., 2017</xref>). The work presented here adds to the mounting evidence that AMOTL2 acts as a negative regulator of YAP, most prominently displayed through an attenuation of transcription of YAP-controlled genes when wild-type AMOTL2 is overexpressed in the context of the YAP-activating compound SM04690 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). A lack of scaffolding functionality by AMOTL2 spliceoforms lacking exons 5 and/or 9 may also help to explain how this alternative splicing is able to activate YAP. It has been shown that the AMOTL2-related protein AMOT regulates Hippo pathway activity through the formation of biomolecular condensates, in contrast to traditional scaffolding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). AMOT-laden condensates have been shown to concentrate core Hippo pathway kinases, acting to potentially sequester YAP in the cytoplasm. Since there is considerable redundancy between AMOT and AMOTL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mana-Capelli and McCollum, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hirate and Sasaki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Leung and Zernicka-Goetz, 2013</xref>), it is conceivable that AMOTL2 may also regulate YAP through biomolecular condensates. The exon skipped AMOTL2 spliceoforms identified here could have impaired ability to phase separate into condensates or fail to incorporate core Hippo pathway kinases into these condensates. Future studies examining the capacity of AMOTL2 to phase separate and interact with Hippo pathway proteins could reveal exactly how the lack of tight junction localization of the AMOTL2:YAP complex leads to increased YAP activity. More generally, this study highlights the existing need to precisely define the specific roles for each AMOT family member (i.e. AMOT, AMOTL1, and AMOTL2), delineating which functions are redundant and which are unique to each family member.</p><p>Others have also shown that alternative splicing influences YAP activity. Indeed, several core Hippo pathway proteins have alternatively spliced isoforms. For example, tissue-specific alternative splicing of YAP itself can lead to eight different isoforms and has been shown to regulate its activity by altering the efficiency with which it interacts with LATS1/2 and TEADs, leading to cell-type specific effects on cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gaffney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Iglesias-Bexiga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vrbský et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, LATS1 and LATS2 exist as 7 and 2 spliceoforms in the cell, respectively, affecting their interactions with Hippo pathway scaffolding proteins Neurofibromin 2 (NF2) and MOB1 and modulating their catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Porazinski and Ladomery, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kulaberoglu et al., 2017</xref>). While the exon skipping observed in this study is derived from pharmacological perturbation, it is possible that similar processes exist endogenously, particularly in cell types or physiological scenarios with lower CLK2 activity. For example, several breast cancer cell lines have been found to display highly variable levels of CLK2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yoshida et al., 2015</xref>). As YAP hyperactivity has been characterized as essential in several human tumor types, including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanconato et al., 2016</xref>), it follows that cancer cell lines with lower CLK2 activity may display increased aggressiveness by activating YAP through the splicing-based mechanism presented here.</p><p>One final consideration raised in this study concerns the use of alternative splicing modulators in the treatment of disease. SM04690 was initially reported in the literature as an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, displaying an EC<sub>50</sub> of 19.5 nM in reporter-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deshmukh et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we have shown that SM04690 activates YAP with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 1.2 nM in TEAD-LUC assays, suggesting that several transcriptional programs including YAP might be modulated by this compound at therapeutic doses. Indeed, while SM04690 has been used in a localized fashion to treat osteoarthritis of the knee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yazici et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tambiah et al., 2021</xref>), our work suggests that the use of broad-acting modulators of alternative splicing should be met with caution, as inhibition of the CLK family of kinases induces alternative splicing in many transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araki et al., 2015</xref>), which may lead to undesired off-target effects. Nevertheless, this work has identified that CLK2 inhibitors are novel pharmacological tools to study the processes governing the regulation of the Hippo pathway and it further underscores the utility of performing unbiased screens for identifying important cellular biological mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Reporter cells (293A-TEAD-LUC (HEK-293A-8xGTII-Luc)) were a gift from the laboratory of Xu Wu (Mass General).

They found that SM04690, an inhibitor of the WNT signaling pathway, could efficiently activate YAP through CLK2 kinase which has been shown to phosphorylate SR proteins to alter gene alternative splicing. They further demonstrated that SM04690 mediated alternative splicing of AMOTL2 and rendered it unlocalized on the membrane. Alternatively spliced AMOTL2 prevented YAP from anchoring to the cell membrane which results in decreased YAP phosphorylation and activated YAP. Previous findings showed that WNT signaling more or less activates YAP. The authors revealed that an inhibitor of WNT signaling could activate YAP.

How to exclude other factors such as EEF1A1 and HSPA5, do they affect YAP activation? Angiomotin-related AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 were identified as negative regulators of YAP and TAZ by preventing their nuclear translocation. It has been reported that high cell density promoted assembly of the Crumbs complex, which recruited AMOTL2 to tight junctions. Ubiquitination of AMOTL2 K347 and K408 served as a docking site for LATS2, which phosphorylated YAP to promote its cytoplasmic retention and degradation.

The author proposed that AMOTL2 splicing isoform formed biomolecular condensates,.However, there was no relevant experimental data to support this conclusion. AMOTL2 is located not only on the cell membrane but also on the circulating endosome of the cell, and the puncta formed after AMOTL2 dissociation from the membrane is likely to be the localization of the circulating endosome.

The localization of YAP in cells is regulated by cell density, and YAP usually translocates to the nucleus at low cell density. In Figure 2E, the cell densities of DMSO and SM04690-treated groups are inconsistent.

We have fully addressed each comment below in a point-by-point fashion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several noteworthy points when assessing the results. In Figure S1C, 100nM drug was toxic to cells at 72 hours and 1nM drug suppressed cell proliferation by 60%. Yet such concentrations were used in Figure 1B and C to argue CLK2 inhibition liberates YAP activity (which one would assume will increase cellular proliferation). In Figure 1C it appears that 1nM drug treatment led to some kind of cellular stress, as cells are visibly enlarged. In Figure 1D, 1nM drug, which would have suppressed cell growth by 60%, did not affect YAP phosphorylation. Taken together, it appears even though CLK2 inhibitor (at high concentrations) liberates YAP activity, its toxicity may override the potential use of this drug as a YAP-activator to salve tissue regenerative repair, which was one of the goals hinted in the background section.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not claim that CLK2 inhibition is useful as a YAP activator, either as a precise pharmacological tool or as a therapeutic mechanism for inducing regenerative repair. Instead, the key finding of this work is to describe a novel, unanticipated cellular mechanism for activating YAP, one that should be considered when optimizing pharmacological candidates that modulate alternative splicing for diseases where potential proliferation is undesirable.</p><p>However, to address this point, we have included additional experimentation. Specifically, we show that cytotoxicity with compound treatment at 24 hours, a timepoint at which we perform most evaluation of alternative splicing induced by compound, is considerably less than that observed at 72 hours. Now included as Figure S1C, this panel shows while the compound displays some cytotoxicity at ~1 nM at 72 hours, the half maximal inhibitory potency at 24 hours is ~300 nM. As such, we believe there is not incongruity between YAP activity, cellular proliferation, and SM04690-induced cytotoxicity. It is simply such that higher concentrations of compound, and thus increased engagement of CLK2 and other targets of the inhibitor, result in a cumulative cytotoxic effect over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2D, at 100nM concentration, the drug did not appear to affect AMOTL2 splicing. Even though at higher concentrations it did, this potentially put into question whether YAP activity liberated by this drug at 1nM (Fig 2A), 10-50nM (Fig 2C) concentrations is caused by altered AMOTL2 splicing. Discussions should be provided on the difference in drug concentrations in these experiments. Does the drug decay very fast, and is that why later studies required higher dose?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this comment is in reference to Fig. 3D, and we argue that, while faint, there is the presence of AMOTL2 splicing at 100 nM SM04690 treatment as seen by a faint lower molecular weight band. However, to further understand the extent to which AMOTL2 is alternatively spliced in response to compound treatment, we performed RT-qPCR analysis of AMOTL2 splicing with an expanded concentration response. These results indicate that high magnitude exon skipping of AMOTL2 occurs starting at 10 nM with 24-hour treatment of compound (now in the manuscript as Fig. S4A). This result matches with our data in Fig. 2C, wherein YAP phosphorylation begins decreasing at 10 nM SM04690 treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likely impact of the work on the field: this study presented a high throughput screen method for YAP activators and showed that such an approach works. The hit compound found from ReFRAME library, a CLK2 inhibitor, may not be actually useful as a YAP activator, given its clear toxicity. Applying this screen method on other large compound libraries may help find a YAP activator that helps regenerative repair. The finding that CLK2 inhibition could alter AMOTL2 splicing to affect HIPPO pathway could bring a new angle to understanding the regulation of HIPPO pathway.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors have screened the ReFRAME library and identified candidate small molecules that can activate YAP.

No other targets relevant to the Hippo pathway were identified.</p><p>We have shown that overexpression of exon skipped AMOTL2 (Fig. 3F) recapitulates the effect of compound, indicating that splicing per se is what drives the YAP activation phenotype. While AMOTL2 is ubiquitinated, these established sites of ubiquitination do not lie within exons 5 or 9. Thus, we anticipate that ubiquitination is less likely a driving factor in the observed phenotype. The manuscript is written as not to exclude this as a possibility, but it is downstream of what we describe, and we believe out of scope to explore this further in this preliminary report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

We respond below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The inconsistent inhibitor concentrations and varying results reported in the paper can be distracting. For instance, the response of endogenous targets to 100 nM concentration is described as a &gt;5-fold increase in Figure 2B, whereas it is reported as a 1-1.5-fold response to 1000 nM in Figure 2D. This inconsistency should be addressed and clarified to provide a more accurate and reliable representation of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2D, we have transduced cells with lentivirus, which most likely suppresses their responsiveness to compound treatment. We have addressed the issue of varying inhibitor concentrations in response to Reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the absence of a strong inhibitor induced YAP target gene expression (Figure 2D), it is difficult to conclude the dependency on YAP expression, as investigated by siRNA mediated knockdown. In a similar experiment, the dependency of the inhibitor on CLK2 expression could be confirmed</p></disp-quote><p>While the sample with Scramble virus does not respond to the same extent that WT HEK293A cells do (e.g., Fig. 2B), there is still responsiveness to compound. Likewise, YAP knockdown cells display statistically significant decreases in YAP-controlled transcripts. This decrease of transcript is therefore sufficient evidence that SM04690 requires YAP for its activity. We have shown that multiple CLK2 inhibitors recapitulate the effect of SM04690, abrogating the need to show dependency of CLK2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. To further support the conclusion that CLK2 is the direct target of SM04690, it would be informative to investigate the effects of CLK1/4 inhibition on AMOTL2 exons (for example within RNA-seq data). If CLK1/4 inhibitors do not induce changes in AMOTL2 exons, it would strengthen the evidence for CLK2's role as the direct target. Including the results in the discussion would enhance the comprehensiveness of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We showed that CLK1/4 inhibition with small molecules ML167 and TG003 does not affect YAP activity in our luciferase reporter assay (Fig. S2D), which we believe is sufficient evidence that CLK1/4 is neither the direct target of SM04690 nor relevant to the splicing mechanism we describe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It would be important to determine the specific dose of SM04690 required to induce changes in AMOTL2 splicing. The authors observe that AMOTL2 protein levels appear unaffected at doses below 50 nM in Figure 3D, while YAP target genes are already affected at 20 nM in Figure 3G. Although Western blotting may not be the most sensitive method to detect minor changes in splicing, performing PCR experiments at lower doses could provide more insight into the splicing changes. Therefore, it is suggested that the authors include PCR experiments at lower doses to determine if changes in splicing are visible and to better establish the relationship between splicing and gene expression changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that this experiment is essential to better understand splicing changes with SM04690 treatment. Accordingly, we have added RT-qPCR-based analysis of AMOTL2 exon inclusion at lower concentrations between 10 nM and 100 nM (Fig. S4A). We included a similar discussion in response to a point from Reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>As stated in the public review section, it will be helpful to discuss the differences in drug concentration. Although no one should require or expect a perfect drug dose match throughout any study, in this study the drug dose clearly demarcated when CLK2 inhibitor help/hurt proliferation, when CLK2 inhibitor was able to affect YAP phosphorylation, and when CLK2 inhibitor was able to affect AMOTL2 splicing. This is not to challenge the major conclusions of the paper, but it is hard to ignore if no discussion is provided.</p><p>Several suggestions on data presentation:</p><p>1. Scale bar information is missing in Fig. 2E, 4A and 4B.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this mistake in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

It's better to label Figure2D as sh YAP-1, sh YAP-2; Figure 3A as sh CLK2-1, sh CLK2-2 etc. Currently they are all labeled shRNA-1, shRNA-2, which can be confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered the labeling for clarity as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. The use of asterisks in Figure 2D is unclear, especially their placement on the &quot;Scramble&quot; sample.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the asterisks and have also added more detail to the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. When designing primers for splicing-sensitive PCR, it is recommended that the skipping isoform is larger than 100 bp. This will help to avoid quantitative issues with ethidium bromide staining. In the results part, the text reads as if only the skipping isoform is present after SM04690 treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment was performed to confirm the presence of exon skipping in the treated samples. Accordingly, we did not optimize the ethidium bromide staining of the lower bp bands. We will take the size of the isoform into consideration in any future experiments.
