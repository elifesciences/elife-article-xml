that coordinates eukaryotic metabolism. In mammals, TOR specifically promotes translation of ribosomal protein (RP) mRNAs when amino acids are available to support protein synthesis. The mechanisms controlling translation downstream from TOR remain contested, however, and are largely unexplored in plants. To define these mechanisms in plants, we globally profiled the plant TOR-regulated transcriptome, translatome, proteome, and phosphoproteome. We found that TOR regulates ribosome biogenesis in plants at multiple levels, but through mechanisms that do not directly depend on 5′ oligopyrimidine tract motifs (5′TOPs) found in mammalian RP mRNAs. We then show that the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling axis is conserved in plants and regulates expression of a core set of eukaryotic 5′TOP mRNAs, as well as new, plant-specific 5′TOP mRNAs. Our study illuminates ancestral roles of the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP metabolic regulatory network and provides evolutionary context for ongoing debates about the molecular function of LARP1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN</kwd><kwd>LARP1</kwd><kwd>mtor</kwd><kwd>mRNA translation</kwd><kwd>5'TOP mRNAs</kwd><kwd>RAPTOR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5-OD023072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunkard</surname><given-names>Jacob Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1612268</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leiboff</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Plants and humans use a shared mechanism, the eukaryotic metabolic sensor TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN protein kinase and its substrate, an RNA-binding protein called LARP1, to coordinate post-transcriptional gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved eukaryotic serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates metabolism by promoting anabolic processes when nutrients are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). In the most well-studied pathway, mammalian TOR is stimulated by amino acids to promote translation, acting as a rheostat to couple free amino acid availability with rates of amino acid incorporation into proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Valvezan and Manning, 2019</xref>). TOR is under intense biomedical investigation because dysregulation of the TOR network causes or contributes to a wide range of human diseases, prominently including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). Therefore, many details of the TOR signaling pathway have been elucidated in mammals and yeast; less is known, however, about the TOR network in other eukaryotic lineages. In the plant model for genetics and molecular biology, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, TOR is essential for the earliest stages of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Menand et al., 2002</xref>), and inhibiting TOR strongly represses growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Deprost et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Xiong and Sheen, 2012</xref>). Plant TOR activity is controlled by a number of upstream signals, such as glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>), light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Chen et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li et al., 2017b</xref>), nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Busche et al., 2020</xref>), and phytohormones including auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Schepetilnikov et al., 2017</xref>), brassinosteroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), and abscisic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). When plant TOR is active, it promotes the transcription of genes involved in cell-cycle progression, ribosome biogenesis, and various other metabolic processes, depending on developmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). As in other eukaryotes, plant TOR associates with at least two additional proteins, RAPTOR (Regulatory-associated protein of TOR) and LST8 (Lethal with SEC13 8), to form an active complex called TORC1 (TOR COMPLEX 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Deprost et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Mahfouz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Moreau et al., 2012</xref>); it is not known whether TOR acts in any RAPTOR- or LST8-independent complexes in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Van Leene et al., 2019</xref>). Very little is understood about the signal transduction networks downstream from TOR in plants; elucidating these signaling pathways is a major goal to understand how TOR signaling evolved in eukaryotes and how TOR signaling networks could be manipulated to promote agricultural yields while reducing reliance on expensive and environmentally-harmful fertilizer inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Busche et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Rapamycin, an inhibitor of TORC1 first isolated from <italic>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</italic> cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Vézina et al., 1975</xref>), represses growth largely by inhibiting mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Thomas and Hall, 1997</xref>), which has led to extensive studies of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of mRNA translation by TOR. As a simplified model, in mammals, TOR specifically promotes the translation of mRNAs that encode ribosomal proteins (RPs) and a handful of other components of the translation apparatus; in turn, these additional ribosomes increase global rates of mRNA translation. Vertebrate RP mRNAs have evolved a regulatory motif, called a 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5′TOP), which begins with a cytosine at the 5′ cap and is followed by several uracils and/or cytosines, but no (or very few) adenines or guanines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Meyuhas et al., 1996</xref>). Approximately 100 mammalian transcripts are classically considered 5′TOP mRNAs, including all ~80 cytosolic RP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Philippe et al., 2020</xref>). The 5′TOP motif is crucial for the TOR-mediated regulation of RP mRNA translation initiation in vertebrates: when TOR is inactive, 5′TOP motifs are sufficient to strongly repress translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015</xref>). Multiple TOR substrates have been proposed to mediate TOR-5′TOP mRNA translation regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Berman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Philippe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Thoreen et al., 2012</xref>), including eS6 kinases (S6Ks), eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), eIF4G initiation factors, and La-related protein 1 (LARP1), among others. The precise mechanisms remain contested, however, and only S6K, eIF4G, and LARP1 are conserved across eukaryotes.</p><p>LARP1’s role in translation was first discovered in a screen for proteins that differentially associate with the 5′ cap in response to TOR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Tcherkezian et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequent mechanistic studies have alternatively proposed that LARP1 promotes translation of 5′TOP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Tcherkezian et al., 2014</xref>), represses translation of 5′TOP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Philippe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Philippe et al., 2018</xref>), has dual and opposing roles in controlling translation of 5′TOP mRNAs depending on its phosphorylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hong et al., 2017</xref>), or has no role in regulating translation, but instead stabilizes 5′TOP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gentilella et al., 2017</xref>). At a molecular level, LARP1 can bind directly to the 7-methylguanosine (m<sup>7</sup>G) and 5′TOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cassidy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lahr et al., 2017</xref>), but may also associate with pyrimidine-enriched sequences elsewhere in a transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hong et al., 2017</xref>), and is often found in complex with the polyA tail via protein-protein interactions with polyA binding proteins (PABPs) and/or direct interaction with the polyA RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Ashtal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>). These apparently conflicting models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Berman et al., 2020</xref>) may reflect differences in the physiological status or genetics of the cell types used, multiple protein- and RNA-binding sites on the LARP1 protein with distinct affinities, or confounding effects of different techniques to identify LARP1 binding partners with distinct inherent biases. LARP1 is under increasing scrutiny because of its clinical significance: in addition to contributions to the progression of some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Mura et al., 2015</xref>) and a possible link to Zika virus pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Scaturro et al., 2018</xref>), LARP1 was recently found to physically associate with the RNA-binding nucleocapsid of the recently-emerged zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, in light of evidence that inhibiting TOR limits replication of a closely related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Kindrachuk et al., 2015</xref>) and the availability of FDA-approved TOR inhibitors (especially rapamycin and related, rapamycin-like compounds) and several additional TOR inhibitors in clinical trials, ablating TOR-LARP1 signaling has been proposed as a possible pharmacological target to treat severe coronavirus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Most strikingly, although LARP1 is deeply conserved in eukaryotes, the ubiquitous 5′TOP motif in the 5′ leader of cytosolic RP mRNAs only recently evolved in animals, suggesting that LARP1 did not co-evolve with its proposed current primary function in humans, the direct regulation of cytosolic RP mRNA translation. In plants, LARP1 has been reported to associate with the cytosolic exoribonuclease, XRN4, and recruit XRN4 to specific transcripts during heat shock to promote their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Merret et al., 2013</xref>), but it is not known whether LARP1 regulates mRNA stability and/or translation under standard physiological conditions. Pioneering efforts to identify the mechanisms regulating translation of 5′TOP mRNAs, however, did show that wheat germ extracts contain a repressor that specifically limits translation of 5′TOP mRNAs in cell-free translation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Biberman and Meyuhas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Shama and Meyuhas, 1996</xref>), suggesting that plants also discriminately regulate translation of 5′TOP mRNAs. Here, we show that the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling axis regulates translation in Arabidopsis, impacting expression of a set of deeply conserved 5′TOP genes, including translation elongation factors, polyA-binding proteins, karyopherins/importins, and the translationally-controlled tumor protein. Moreover, we identify new, plant-specific genes regulated by TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling, including several genes involved in auxin signaling, developmental patterning, and chromatin modifications. Significantly, many of the 5′TOP mRNAs do encode proteins that contribute to ribosome biogenesis, although only a handful of cytosolic RP mRNAs themselves have 5′TOP motifs. We propose that TOR-LARP1-5′TOP mRNA signaling arose early during eukaryotic evolution to coordinate translation and cell division with cellular metabolic status and nutrient availability, and we argue that TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling has since evolved new, plant-specific targets that regulate plant physiology, growth, and development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To identify novel downstream components of the plant TOR signaling network, we took orthogonal global approaches to quantify how deactivating TOR impacts the plant transcriptome (RNA-Seq), translatome (Ribo-Seq), proteome, and phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Seedlings were grown to quiescence in half-strength MS media for 3 days under photosynthesis-limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>) with a 12 hr light/12 hr dark diurnal cycle. Media were then replaced with half-strength MS media plus 15 mM glucose to activate TOR. 24 hr later, media were replaced again with half-strength MS media plus 15 mM glucose (to maintain TOR activity) or half-strength MS media plus 15 mM glucose and 5.0 μM Torin2 (to attenuate TOR activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Montané and Menand, 2013</xref>). Seedlings were collected 2 hr after these treatments. At least 600 seedlings were pooled for each treatment and considered one sample, and the entire experiment was replicated three times. After collection, portions of each sample were divided for different analyses. Total RNA was extracted from one set of samples in polysome buffer with cycloheximide; an aliquot of this RNA was used to build RNA-Seq libraries after protease treatment and depletion of rRNA, and the rest of the RNA was used for ribosome footprint profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hsu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>). Total protein was extracted from a parallel set of samples and digested with trypsin; an aliquot of this digested protein was TMT-labeled and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the rest was enriched for phosphopeptides and then TMT-labeled and analyzed by LC/MS-MS. In summary, we quantified transcripts from 19,087 genes, ribosome footprints from 14,010 genes, peptides from 2814 proteins, and phosphopeptides from 657 phosphoproteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Parallel global profiling experiments demonstrate that TOR regulates ribosome biogenesis and photosynthesis at multiple levels in Arabidopsis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seeds were germinated and grown to quiescence under photosynthesis-limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>) for three days and then supplemented with 15 mM glucose to stimulate TOR and growth for 24 hr. Seedlings were next treated with either 15 mM glucose + 5.0 μM Torin2 to attenuate TOR activity or only 15 mM glucose to promote TOR activity for 2 hr. Seedlings were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA or protein was extracted as described in the methods for global, unbiased profiling of the seedling Torin2-sensitive transcriptome, translatome, proteome, and phosphoproteome. (<bold>B</bold>) Inhibiting the TOR pathway affected the accumulation of transcripts in multiple categories, as determined by MapMan analysis. One of the most broadly affected categories was protein biosynthesis, including significantly lower levels of mRNAs that encode cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomes after Torin2 treatment.

TOR is a member of the atypical phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinases (PIKKs) that evolved from lipid kinases (PI3Ks) and were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brunkard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Keith and Schreiber, 1995</xref>). PIKKs are a small family of only five kinases involved in metabolic regulation (TOR), nonsense-mediated decay (SMG1), and the DNA damage response (ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs). Although all of these were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor, they are not conserved in all extant eukaryotic lineages; the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome, for example, only encodes TOR, ATM, and ATR. ATP-competitive TOR inhibitors, which have been developed for pharmacological treatment of TOR-associated human diseases, show a range of selectivity for TOR, with some exhibiting low selectivity (e.g. PP242) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) or extremely high selectivity (e.g. AZD8055, which is ~1,000-fold selective for TOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Chresta et al., 2010</xref>). In between these extremes, Torin2 is at least 100-fold more selective for TOR than other PIKKs in in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). In cell types that have strongly induced the DNA damage response, however, such as some breast cancers, Torin2 can have synergistic cellular effects by inhibiting both TOR and another PIKK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Chopra et al., 2020</xref>). For example, a recent report argues that Torin2 causes cytotoxicity in some triple-negative breast cancer cell lines with highly elevated ATR activity by inhibiting TOR and attenuating ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Chopra et al., 2020</xref>). AZD8055 can also cause cytotoxicity, but only at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Chopra et al., 2020</xref>). Since ATR and ATM are not induced under our growing conditions, we expect that Torin2 specifically inhibits TOR in our assays. We also chose a near-minimal concentration of Torin2 to attenuate, rather than completely abolish, TOR activity, which also reduces the likelihood of non-specific activity. Nonetheless, it is possible that Torin2 could have minor off-target effects, which should be considered throughout our analyses below.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>TOR transcriptionally and translationally coordinates gene expression in plants</title><p>The RNA-Seq experiment revealed significant, global repression of mRNAs that encode RPs in response to TOR inhibition. Plant cytosolic ribosomes are composed of 80 different proteins that are encoded by 240 annotated genes in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Hummel et al., 2015</xref>), including at least two paralogs encoding each subunit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). 217 of those genes were transcribed at detectable levels in our RNA-Seq data, of which 197 (91%) accumulated to significantly lower levels 2 hr after treatment with Torin2 than in mock-treated seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Strikingly, mRNAs encoding every subunit of the cytosolic ribosome significantly decreased in the Torin2-treated plants. In plants, both mitochondria and chloroplasts assemble their own ribosomes to translate genes encoded by their respective genomes. Most of the mitochondrial and chloroplast RPs are encoded by the nucleus. Many of the mitochondrial RP mRNAs are also significantly downregulated in Torin2-treated seedlings (34/91 transcripts, or 37%), and none are upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In stark contrast, only one chloroplast RP mRNA is differentially expressed in Torin2-treated seedlings (<italic>bL27c</italic> is 1.3-fold repressed; this is 1/63 transcripts, or 1.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To summarize, within 2 hr of treatment with Torin2, TOR inactivation widely suppresses the expression of cytosolic and mitochondrial RP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The DEGs identified in Torin2-treated seedling transcriptome impact diverse additional processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), mostly in line with previously reported results using different experimental systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to RP mRNAs, many other mRNAs involved in protein synthesis accumulated to significantly lower levels in Torin2-treated seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), including mRNAs that encode translation initiation factors, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, and small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) subunits. mRNAs that promote protein catabolism were coordinately induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), including many mRNAs that participate in proteasomal degradation, such as ubiquitin E3 ligases, and several mRNAs that encode components of the autophagosome. Mitochondrial biogenesis is broadly suppressed, including not only mitochondrial RP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), but also transcripts encoding OXPHOS electron chain subunits and proteins that participate in translocation of proteins into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Inhibiting TOR decreased levels of mRNAs that encode cell wall proteins that contribute to growth, including arabinogalactan proteins, extensins, and expansins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Transcriptional programs associated with abiotic and biotic stress were widely induced after TOR inhibition, including accumulation of mRNAs that encode Nod-like receptors, receptor-like kinases, WRKY transcription factors, NAC transcription factors, and enzymes that contribute to secondary metabolic stress responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Lastly, TOR inhibition significantly decreased levels of mRNAs that encode components of the nuclear pore complex and the family of importin/karyopherin β nuclear transport receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, we used ribosome footprinting to identify transcripts that are differentially translated in response to Torin2. Putative ribosome footprint sequences were aligned to the TAIR10 genome and scanned for periodicity using RiboTaper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Calviello et al., 2016</xref>). Ribo-Seq FPKM were divided by RNA-Seq FPKM to calculate the relative translation efficiency (TE) of every transcript identified in both datasets. We observed twofold or greater change in TE for 265 transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). By far, the most significantly-affected category after Torin2 treatment was broad translational repression of RP mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This result is in strong agreement with the conserved role of TOR in promoting RP mRNA translation in other eukaryotic model systems. We also observed significant translational repression of many photosynthesis-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In particular, the relative translational efficiency of 24 mRNAs encoded by the chloroplast significantly decreased after treatment with Torin2, indicating that TOR promotes translation within the chloroplast.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The seedling TOR-regulated proteome and phosphoproteome</title><p>We conducted quantitative global proteomics to define changes in protein abundance 2 hr after inactivating TOR with Torin2. Of 2814 proteins quantified in our analysis, 331 showed significant differences in abundance between Torin2- and mock-treated seedlings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We observed only small differences in protein abundance between treatments (~1.2-fold changes, on average, for the significantly impact proteins), but this is likely because protein half-lives (~hours to days) are typically an order of magnitude longer than mRNA half-lives (~minutes to hours) in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Li et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Toyama and Hetzer, 2013</xref>).

About half of these were abundant enough that they were also quantified in the global proteome (44 proteins), of which eight showed significant differences in total protein levels after Torin2 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). mRNAs encoding all of these significantly-impacted phosphoproteins were detected by RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), except for DF1, a seed-specific transcription factor that we speculate may persist as a stable protein for some time after germination, but is no longer transcriptionally expressed. Levels of 25 of these mRNAs showed significant differences after Torin2 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Although the transcripts and/or total protein levels of several of the phosphoproteins changed, these differences could not readily explain the magnitude of difference in protein phosphorylation we detected. Moreover, phosphorylation often impacts protein stability, and this global experiment cannot distinguish whether changes in protein level are caused by differential phosphorylation or if changes in phosphoprotein levels reflect unrelated changes in protein stability. Thus, while we include these parallel data, we proceeded to analyze all 85 putative TOR-sensitive phosphoproteins identified in these experiments as presumptive substrates or downstream targets of TOR.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TOR regulates the phosphorylation of critical proteins involved in translation, cellular dynamics, and signal transduction in Arabidopsis seedlings.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phosphoprotein levels decreased for the majority (80%) of the 85 proteins that were significantly differentially phosphorylated after Torin2 treatment.

The strongest effect was on eS6b, a canonical phosphorylation target of the TOR-S6K signaling axis; phosphorylated eS6b was readily detected in mock-treated controls but was undetectable in Torin2-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Ser240, which is near the C-terminus of eS6b, became dephosphorylated upon Torin2 treatment, which is in agreement with previous reports that eS6b-Ser240 phosphorylation is dependent on TOR-S6K activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This clear result served as robust internal validation for our Torin2-treated phosphoproteome.</p><p>We next compared the Torin2-sensitive seedling phosphoproteome to the TOR-regulated cell suspension culture phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Van Leene et al., 2019</xref>). Eight targets overlapped between our datasets: in both experiments, inhibiting TOR decreased phosphorylation of eS6b, LARP1, eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4B1, the plant-specific CONSERVED BINDING OF EIF4E one protein (CBE1), and a plant ubiquitin regulatory X domain-containing protein (PUX5), whereas inhibiting TOR increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4G, the universal stress protein PHOS32, and a plant-specific DUF1421 protein of unknown function (At4g28300). Of the remaining 77 phosphoproteins that we found were sensitive to Torin2, 58 were detected in the cell suspension culture phosphoproteomes, and in many cases their phosphorylation was similarly impacted by TOR inhibition, but not at statistically-significant levels in those experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Van Leene et al., 2019</xref>). These corroborating results further confirmed that our experimental approach identified <italic>bona fide</italic> phosphorylation targets of the TOR signaling network. To confirm that Torin2 did not inhibit ATM or ATR activity under our experimental conditions, we compared the Torin2-sensitive seedling phosphoproteome to the Arabidopsis ATM and ATR-dependent phosphoproteome, a set of 108 phosphoproteins that were differentially phosphorylated in <italic>atm;atr</italic> double mutants compared to wild-type in response to irradiation, that is ATM/ATR-activating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Roitinger et al., 2015</xref>). Only 9 of those phosphoproteins were detected with the same phosphosites in any of our phosphoproteome experiments, and none of these phosphosites were significantly inhibited by Torin2. These results support our hypothesis that Torin2 selectively acts only to inhibit TOR in Arabidopsis seedlings grown under our physiological conditions.</p><p>The Torin2-sensitive seedling phosphoproteome is strongly enriched for proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, including RP subunits (PANTHER GO cellular component cytosolic RPs were 8.6-fold overrepresented, p&lt;0.01, Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni correction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Enrichment analysis was performed with PANTHER gene ontologies, as described in detail in the methods section. In addition to eS6b, phosphorylation of the large ribosomal subunit uL18a decreased in Torin2-treated seedlings, as did phosphorylation of the acidic stalk proteins uL10b, P2b, and P3a, and the uL10/acidic stalk-like RPD1/Mrt4 protein involved in nuclear ribosome assembly. Oppositely, uL30a phosphorylation somewhat increased, despite a significant decrease in <italic>uL30a</italic> transcripts. uL18a is a component of the 5S ribonucleoprotein particle, along with uL5 and the 5S rRNA, that is assembled as a subcomplex prior to incorporation into the large subunit. Recessive alleles of <italic>uL18a</italic>, including <italic>piggyback 3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Pinon et al., 2008</xref>) and <italic>oligocellula 5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Yao et al., 2008</xref>), impact Arabidopsis leaf development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Fujikura et al., 2009</xref>) and enhance phenotypes of <italic>asymmetric leaves 1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Pinon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Yao et al., 2008</xref>) and <italic>angustifolia three</italic> mutants that drastically disrupt leaf patterning. The differentially phosphorylated residue in uL18a, Ser131, is not conserved in humans but is deeply conserved in the plant lineage. Beyond RPs per se, several proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, such as the nucleolar proteins GAR2-Like and nucleolin, were significantly less phosphorylated in Torin2-treated seedlings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Multiple RNA-binding proteins are differentially phosphorylated in the Torin2-sensitive seedling phosphoproteome (PANTHER GO molecular function RNA-binding proteins were 5.3-fold overrepresented, p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>, Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni correction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Several of these have been assigned functions in mRNA splicing or maturation (PANTHER GO-Slim biological process RNA splicing were 9.5-fold overrepresented, p&lt;0.05, Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni correction), including RNA-binding protein 25 (RBM25), serrate (SE), arginine/serine-rich splicing factor 40 and 41 (RS40 and RS41), binding to TOMV RNA 1L (BTR1L, orthologous to human NOVA), defectively organised tributaries 2 (DOT2, orthologous to human SART-1), and FIP1, which are all significantly dephosphorylated upon TOR inactivation by Torin2, and splicing factor SC35 (SC35), which is slightly more phosphorylated in Torin2-treated seedlings. Proteins that are known or predicted to regulate translation initiation are also enriched in the Torin2-sensitive seedling phosphoproteome, including eIF5B1, eIF4B1, CBE1, and LARP1a, which are dephosphorylated in Torin2-treated seedlings, and eIF4G, which is hyperphosphorylated in Torin2-treated seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and E</xref>). These results suggest that TOR plays a major role in the regulation of transcript processing and translation, and that TOR influences mRNA expression through multiple, distinct signaling axes.</p><p>Beyond these general trends, we noticed a Torin2-sensitive change in the phosphorylation status of two critical proteins involved in signal transduction: RAPTOR1 and TOPLESS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). RAPTOR1 is an essential protein that complexes with TOR and LST8 to form TORC1. In Arabidopsis and humans, RAPTOR is post-translationally modified to modulate TORC1 activity in response to various cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Carrière et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Dunlop et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Foster et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Gwinn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We found that phosphorylation of RAPTOR1 Thr912 and Ser916, residues between the conserved RAPTOR HEAT repeats and WD40 repeats, significantly decreased in response to Torin2 treatment. These residues are conserved in most land plant RAPTOR sequences, including <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> and <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> RAPTOR orthologues, but are not found in other eukaryotic lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Torin2-sensitive phosphorylation of RAPTOR1 residues suggests that TORC1 could regulate its own activity, although further studies will be needed to determine whether RAPTOR1 is a direct substrate of TORC1 and how phosphorylation of these residues affects TORC1 activity.</p><p>TOPLESS is a transcriptional regulator that mediates multiple phytohormone pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Long et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Pauwels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Szemenyei et al., 2008</xref>); several studies have proposed that TOR signaling participates in phytohormone signaling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Schepetilnikov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), although most have focused on whether TOR activity is sensitive to phytohormones as upstream cues, rather than whether TOR modulates downstream phytohormone responses. We found that TOPLESS Thr286 and Ser214 phosphorylation decreased after Torin2 treatment in wild-type seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). TOPLESS is a member of the Groucho/Tup1 family of co-repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cavallo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Keleher et al., 1992</xref>), which are recruited to promoters by diverse transcription factors where they repress transcription. TOPLESS is most famous in plants for its interactions with phytohormone-regulated transcription factors, including direct interaction with auxin-responsive Aux/IAA-ARF complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Szemenyei et al., 2008</xref>), jasmonate-responsive NINJA-JAZ complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Pauwels et al., 2010</xref>), and brassinosteroid-responsive BZR1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Oh et al., 2014</xref>). TOPLESS-Ser286 is deeply conserved in land plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and TOPLESS-Ser214 is broadly conserved in angiosperms, including <italic>Amborella trichocarpa</italic>, monocots, and dicots, but is not found in non-flowering plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Future studies of the functional impact of these phosphorylation events could illuminate a role for TOR-TOPLESS regulation of the complex crosstalk among metabolic, developmental, and stress-response signaling networks.</p><p>The seedling Torin2-sensitive phosphoproteome also revealed that the phosphorylation of two actin-binding VILLIN proteins, VILLIN 2 (VLN2) and VLN3, is regulated by TOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In mammals and yeast, the RAPTOR-independent TORC2 complex regulates actin filamentation through multiple pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Loewith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Rispal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Sarbassov and Kim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Schmidt et al., 1996</xref>). Recently, a forward genetic screen in Arabidopsis found that a recessive allele of <italic>isopropylmalate synthase 1</italic> (<italic>IPMS1</italic>) promotes actin filamentation in a TOR-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). IPMS1 is the first committed step of leucine biosynthesis; accordingly, <italic>ipms1</italic> mutants exhibit broad defects in free amino acid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). While the exact cause remains undefined, the disruption of amino acid metabolism in <italic>ipms1</italic> mutants apparently increases cellular TOR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Schaufelberger et al., 2019</xref>). Reducing TOR activity by treating <italic>ipms1</italic> mutants with ATP-competitive TOR inhibitors rescues the <italic>ipms1</italic> actin organization phenotype, which suggests that TOR regulates actin filamentation in plants. We found that Torin2 decreases phosphorylation of VLN2 and VLN3, closely related VILLINs, at the same sites near the C-terminus in both proteins. VLN2 and VLN3 are required for normal plant development and actin bundling in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Qu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">van der Honing et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), but their post-translational regulation remains underexplored in plants. Functional studies of TOR-promoted VLN2/VLN3 phosphorylation could reveal new links between TOR and the cytoskeleton in plants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>LARP1 promotes growth, chloroplast biogenesis, and TOR signaling in plants</title><p>We chose to focus further studies on LARP1 for several reasons.

We began by investigating the role of LARP1 in normal plant development and physiology. In some eukaryotes, such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, LARP1 is essential for early stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Burrows et al., 2010</xref>).

LARP1 contributes to heat stress recovery in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Merret et al., 2013</xref>), but its role in development under standard growing conditions has not been thoroughly characterized. To address this, we grew <italic>larp1</italic> and wild-type plants for 15 days on half-strength MS media plus 0.8% agar, and then measured root growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We next assayed shoot growth in soil-grown plants four weeks post-germination.

Using stringent parameters to ensure high-quality results, we calculated TOPscores for transcripts encoded by 9143 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The median TOPscore in this dataset is 1.3, with 90% of TOPscores between 0.38 and 4.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We next used MapMan to conduct Wilcoxon rank-sum analyses to determine if gene TOPscores broadly correlate with any biological functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We found that genes involved in RNA biosynthesis, especially transcription factors in the Zn finger C2C2 superfamily, have higher TOPscores. Genes encoding proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, including importin/karyopherins, nucleoporins, and Ran GTPases, also have significantly higher TOPscores. Genes involved in cell wall remodeling and biochemistry, however, have significantly lower TOPscores. Glycosyltransferase genes, including UDP-glucosyl transferase (UGT) and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/transferase (XTH) genes, have remarkably low TOPscores, as do genes involved in lignin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested whether TOPscores correlate with changes in TE in response to TOR inhibition.

Thus, in aggregate, LARP1 is required to repress 5′TOP mRNA translation in response to TOR inhibition in plants.

We used three criteria to define high-confidence 5′TOP mRNAs: (i) TOPscores in the top 20<sup>th</sup> percentile, (ii) decreased TE in response to Torin2 treatment, (iii) little or no effect of Torin2 on TE in <italic>larp1</italic> mutants. Using these criteria, we identified several Arabidopsis 5′TOP mRNAs are homologous to 5′TOP mRNAs in mammals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). These include mRNAs that encode proteins involved in translation, such as polyA binding proteins (PABPs) and eukaryotic elongation factors eEF1 β/δ and ɣ subunits. Additionally, mRNAs that encode importins/karyopherins, the translationally-controlled tumor protein (TCTP1), and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are all 5′TOP mRNAs in both humans and Arabidopsis. Finally, some mRNAs that encode cytosolic RPs, such as RACK1, uS8, eS10, uS17, eS25, and uL30, are also 5′TOP mRNAs in both humans and Arabidopsis.</p><p>In the core set of human 5′TOP mRNAs recently defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Philippe et al., 2020</xref>, there are 70 cytosolic RP mRNAs and 35 other 5′TOP mRNAs; excluding the RP mRNAs, over one-third of these (12/35) are conserved 5′TOP mRNAs in Arabidopsis. Strikingly, the importance of regulating the expression of these non-ribosomal genes by TOR remains largely unstudied. For example, we found that importin/karyopherin mRNAs are translationally regulated by the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP motif signaling axis in plants and humans. Importins/karyopherins selectively traffic proteins with importin recognition motifs (nuclear localization signals) from the cytosol to the nucleus; in humans, IPO5 and IPO7 are core 5′TOP mRNAs, and in Arabidopsis, IMB1 is a high-confidence 5′TOP mRNA (TOPscore: 3.02; ΔTE<sub>(WT + T2 / WT)</sub>=−1.7 fold, ΔTE<sub>(<italic>larp1</italic> + T2 / <italic>larp1</italic>)</sub> = +1.2-fold) and the median TOPscore for all importins/karyopherins is 2.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that others may also be subject to translational regulation by TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling. In humans, both IPO5 and IPO7 are responsible for importing RPs to the nucleus; ribosome subunits are translated in the cytosol, but then must be transported to the nucleolus for assembly before ribosome large and small subunits are exported to the cytosol. In Arabidopsis, the importin IMB3 (also known as Karyopherin enabling the transport of the cytoplasmic HYL1 or KETCH1) similarly promotes ribosome biogenesis by carrying RP subunits to the nucleus. The <italic>IMB3</italic> transcript has a TOPscore of 2.9 and was slightly translationally repressed by Torin2 treatment in wild-type (ΔTE = −1.1 fold) but not in <italic>larp1</italic>. An attractive hypothesis, therefore, is that TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling coordinates translation of importins to support ribosome biogenesis by driving cytosolic RP translocation to the nucleus for assembly.</p><p>We then considered whether comparative analysis of 5′TOP mRNAs could identify previously uncharacterized 5′TOP mRNAs in humans.

This finding leads us to speculate that TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling regulated ribosome biogenesis in the last eukaryotic ancestor of animals and plants, and that the direct control of RP translation by 5′TOP motifs to coordinate ribosome biogenesis evolved later in an ancestor of vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Alternative TSSs may modulate TOR-LARP1-5′TOP regulation</title><p>TSSs can vary with developmental or physiological context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Benyajati et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Kurihara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Rojas-Duran and Gilbert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Young et al., 1981</xref>).

Currently, there are not sufficient publicly-available TSS-Seq data in plants to determine whether alternative TSSs fine-tune TOR-LARP1-5′TOP regulation genome-wide, but upon close analysis of the core 5′TOP mRNAs defined here, we did find that several genes that encode 5′TOP mRNAs have two, apparently distinct TSSs. <italic>PIN1</italic>, for example, has two distinct TSS peaks, although both the longer and shorter predicted 5′ leaders have high TOPscores (7.8 and 10.5, respectively). <italic>PABP8</italic> has two strong TSS peaks with approximately equal coverage in the Arabidopsis root TSS-Seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>): the longer predicted 5′ leader has a high TOPscore (3.4), but the shorter predicted 5′ leader has a near-median TOPscore (1.3).

Analysis of these results revealed that TOR-LARP1 signaling controls the translation of a specific set of mRNAs that begin with a 5′TOP motif, demonstrating that TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling is an ancestral function of the TOR signaling network in eukaryotes.</p><p>The precise mechanisms of TOR-LARP1 signaling have been the subject of considerable recent controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Berman et al., 2020</xref>), which we sought to partially address by providing an evolutionary perspective.

Within mammalian model systems, investigations of LARP1 have focused primarily on the role of LARP1 in regulating cytosolic RP mRNA translation and/or stability, because virtually all vertebrate and many invertebrate cytosolic RP mRNAs begin with a 5′TOP motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Meyuhas et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Parry et al., 2010</xref>). Plant and fungal cytosolic RP mRNAs do not all start with a 5′TOP motif, but LARP1 is broadly conserved in these lineages, suggesting that the ancestral function of LARP1 might be entirely different from its current role in human cells. Our study revealed, however, that LARP1 does control the translation of 5′TOP mRNAs in plants, and we discovered that humans and plants share a core set of deeply conserved eukaryotic 5′TOP mRNAs. Moreover, while only a handful of RP mRNAs begin with 5′TOP motifs in Arabidopsis, several other steps of ribosome biogenesis, including rDNA transcription, rRNA processing, and ribosome complex assembly, are controlled by the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling axis. Therefore, we speculate that the animal lineage adapted TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling to directly coordinate expression of RP mRNAs, a fine-tuning of this preexisting ribosome biogenesis regulatory mechanism that helps to ensure that RP synthesis is exquisitely synchronized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brunkard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015</xref>). The evidence we present here further suggests that the broader role of TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling in coordinating nutrient availability with ribosome biogenesis was already present in the ancestors of plants and animals.</p><p>The core eukaryotic 5′TOP mRNAs identified by our analysis encode eukaryotic elongation factor 1B subunits, poly(A)-binding proteins, cytosolic RPs, cyclins, importins, and a transmembrane protein of poorly-defined molecular function called ERGIC3. Our discovery that these transcripts have likely been consistent effectors of the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling axis suggests that their coordinated expression with metabolic status sensed by TOR is adaptively important for eukaryotic cell biology. The significance of TOR in controlling mRNA translation, and thus a putative function for TOR in regulating expression of eEF1B subunits, PABPs, and RPs, has been understood for some time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hara et al., 1998</xref>): TOR is stimulated by amino acid levels and in turn promotes amino acid consumption in protein biosynthesis. Similarly, across eukaryotes, TOR acts as a gatekeeper for cell-cycle progression, only permitting the G1/S phase transition when sufficient nutrients are available to support cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brown et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Kunz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Xiong and Sheen, 2013</xref>), and thus providing a good hypothesis for the regulation of cyclin expression by TOR.</p><p>It is less immediately clear why TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling coordinates translation of importins and ERGIC3. Several studies in plants and animals have shown that reducing importin levels can restrict ribosome biogenesis by limiting the transport of newly-translated RPs from the cytosol to the nucleolus for ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Chou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Golomb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Jäkel and Görlich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Xiong et al., 2020</xref>). The importins encoded by 5′TOP mRNAs, IPO5 and IPO7, are both specifically responsible for nuclear import of several RP subunits and are implicated as key contributors to cancer cell proliferation, tumorigenicity, and regulation of the p53 oncogenic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Çağatay and Chook, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Golomb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that importins are translationally regulated by TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling as an additional regulatory step to promote post-translational ribosome assembly specifically when cells can metabolically sustain translation. Like importins, ERGIC3 is also strongly implicated in several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), but its molecular function has not been thoroughly investigated. In mammalian cells, ERGIC3 cycles between the ER and golgi membranes, where it contributes to anterograde and/or retrograde secretory transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Breuza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Orci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Yoo et al., 2019</xref>). ERGIC3 is orthologous to yeast Erv46, which forms a retrograde receptor complex that is required for efficient localization of ER resident proteins that do not have the canonical C-terminal HDEL sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Shibuya et al., 2015</xref>). To our knowledge, ERGIC3 has not been directly studied in plants to date. Deeper understanding of the molecular function of ERGIC3 may reveal why it is subject to metabolic regulation by TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling.</p><p>Recently, we proposed that the TOR metabolic signaling network evolves through exaptation by coopting existing pathways to serve new functions relevant to specific lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brunkard, 2020</xref>). For example, TOR gained new functions when eukaryotic lineages evolved multicellularity, such as coordinating plasmodesmatal (intercellular) transport in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Brunkard et al., 2020</xref>) or regulating cellular differentiation and cell type-specific metabolisms in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brunkard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kosillo et al., 2019</xref>), as examples. Similarly, here, we provide evidence that plants exapted the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling axis to regulate translation of proteins involved in developmental patterning and auxin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), pathways that did not exist in the unicellular ancestor of plants and animals that first evolved TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling. In contrast, we argue that the universal 5′TOP motif found in all vertebrate cytosolic RP mRNAs is an example of adaptation. TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling evolved before the divergence of plants and animals to coordinate multiple processes, including ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). LARP1 was subsequently lost in some lineages, such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the vertebrate lineage, TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling adapted to directly control the expression of all RP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), rather than only indirectly influence translation of ribosome biogenesis-related proteins. Many, but not all, invertebrate RP mRNAs begin with 5′TOP motifs, perhaps reflecting an intermediate ‘evolutionary transition’.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling regulates ribosome biogenesis through both conserved and evolving mechanisms in eukaryotes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Across eukaryotic lineages, TORC1 coordinates metabolism with ribosome biogenesis.

In agreement with the glucose-TOR activation transcriptome, however, our experiments also show that briefly inactivating TOR does not impact the expression of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes. Separate studies have demonstrated that prolonged inhibition of TOR activity can strongly repress expression of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes (PhANGs). The coordinated expression of the nuclear and chloroplast genomes has been a major research focus for several decades, with the strong consensus that defective translation of the chloroplast transcriptome triggers retrograde signals that suppress PhANG expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brunkard and Burch-Smith, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Koussevitzky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Susek et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Woodson and Chory, 2008</xref>). We speculate, therefore, that inactivating TOR first represses translation in the chloroplast, and that this secondarily leads to repression of PhANG expression via retrograde signaling, a hypothesis that we are currently pursuing. A previous study of ribosome protein abundance in plants with prolonged, mildly attenuated <italic>TOR</italic> expression in stable <italic>TOR</italic> RNAi lines found reduced levels of chloroplast ribosome subunits, and argued that this could be due to translational control via pyrimidine-rich elements in the 5′ leader of some cytosolic mRNAs that encode chloroplast RPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Dobrenel et al., 2016</xref>). We did not observe any clear effects of Torin2 treatment on the TE of nuclear-encoded chloroplast RP mRNAs, however, indicating that TOR can control chloroplast genome expression through other mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Metabolic control of cytoskeletal dynamics by TOR: possible molecular mechanisms</title><p>Early studies of TORC2 in yeast and mammalian cells showed that TORC2 can control actin filamentation and cytoskeletal dynamics. Several mechanisms have been proposed to link TORC2 to actin filamentation, but this remains a relatively poorly studied area in the field. Recent studies in plants revealed that genetically disrupting amino acid metabolism can increase TOR activity and increase actin bundling, leading to diverse morphological defects. Here, we found that TOR controls the phosphorylation of critical actin-associated proteins, VLN2 and VLN3. In humans, elevated TOR activity promotes transcription of gelsolin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Nie et al., 2015</xref>), which are orthologous to Arabidopsis <italic>VILLIN</italic> genes. Gelsolin hyperaccumulation and eS6 hyperphosphorylation are, in fact, specific clinical markers of tuberous sclerosis tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Onda et al., 1999</xref>), which are the result of TOR hyperactivation.

The CCT complex promotes assembly of many proteins, including RAPTOR and LST8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Cuéllar et al., 2019</xref>), but is most famously associated with assembly of actin and tubulin subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balchin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Dekker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Yam et al., 2008</xref>). In mammals, TOR regulates CCT complex function by promoting phosphorylation of the CCT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that metabolic regulation of CCT complex activity by TOR may occur through multiple signal transduction pathways in different eukaryotic lineages. ACTIN DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR 11 (ADF11), part of the cofilin family of actin destabilizing proteins, is also encoded by a 5′TOP mRNA, providing another possible connection between TOR and actin filamentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bernstein and Bamburg, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Multilayered regulation of plant cell-cycle progression by TOR</title><p>In a ground-breaking study of plant TOR dynamics, Xiong et al. found that the E2Fa transcription factor, which promotes the G1/S cell-cycle transition, is likely a direct substrate of TOR in Arabidopsis and is required for full activation of the root meristem in response to glucose-TOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>).

In this canonical pathway, D-type cyclins bind to and activate cyclin-dependent kinases that phosphorylate and thus inactivate Retinoblastoma-related RBR1, de-repressing E2F transcription factors that drive the transcriptional program of the G1/S phase cell-cycle transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ach et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Choi and Anders, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ebel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Huntley et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Serrano et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Xie et al., 1996</xref>).

A reference pooled sample which is composed of equal amount of material from all samples was also generated to link both TMT plexes. All individual and pooled samples were labeled according to the TMT 10plex reagent kit instructions with the labeling scheme in the end of the report. Briefly, TMT regents were brought to room temperature and dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile. Peptides were labeled by the addition of each label to its respective digested sample. Labeling reactions were incubated with shaking for 1 hr at room temperature. Reactions were terminated with the addition of hydroxylamine. Subsequent labeled digests were combined into a new 2 mL microfuge tube, acidified with formic acid, subjected to Sep-Pak C18 solid phase extraction and dried down. The dried peptide mixture was dissolved in 110 μL of mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium formate, pH 9.0). 100 μL of the sample was injected onto a 2.1 × 150 mm XSelect CSH C18 column (Waters) equilibrated with 3% mobile phase B (10 mM ammonium formate, 90% ACN). Peptides were separated using a similar gradient to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Batth et al., 2014</xref> with the following gradient parameters at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. 60 peptide fractions were collected corresponding to 1 min each. 10 pooled samples were generated by concatenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Yang et al., 2012</xref>) in which every 10 th fraction (i.e., 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51; six fractions total) was combined. The 10 pooled samples were acidified, dried down and resuspended with 200 µL 40% ACN, 0.1% FA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Phosphoproteomic analysis</title><p>Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed using the MagReSyn Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) functional magnetic microparticles (ReSyn Biosciences) following vendor’s protocol. Briefly, dried peptides were reconstituted in 100 μL of loading buffer (1M glycolic acid in 80% CAN and 5% TFA) and applied to the TiO two beads that was previously equilibrated and washed with loading buffer. After reapplying sample once, the beads were washed with (1) 100 μL of loading buffer (2) 100 μL of wash buffer (80%ACN in 1% TFA), and (3) with 100 μL of LC-MS grade water. Bound peptides were eluted three times with 50 μL of elution buffer (1% NH 4 OH). Eluates containing the enriched phosphopeptides were acidified with 1% FA then cleaned up with C18 tip before TMT labeling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>LC-MS analysis</title><p>For the global samples, each aliquot was reconstituted with 10 μL of 5% ACN/0.1% FA. The phosphopeptide samples were each dissolved in 12 μL of 5% ACN/0.1% FA. Samples were transferred to autosampler vials for LC-MS analysis. 5 μL was analyzed by LC-MS (HCD for MS/MS) with a Dionex RSLCnano HPLC coupled to a Q-Exactive (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer using a 2 hr gradient. Peptides were resolved using 75 μm x 50 cm PepMap C18 column (Thermo Scientific).</p><p>All MS/MS samples were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Scientific). The Sequest HT search engine in the Proteome Discover was set to search human database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://uniprot.org">Uniprot.org</ext-link>). The digestion enzyme was set as trypsin. The HCD MS/MS spectra were searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.02 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 10 ppm. Oxidation of methionine and acetylation of N-terminal of protein (phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine were added when analyzing phosphoproteome data) were specified as a variable modification, while carbamidomethyl of cysteine and TMT labeling was designated at lysine residues or peptide N-termini were specified in Proteome Discoverer as static modifications. MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications and quantification results was initially generated in Proteome Discover 2.1 and later uploaded to Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.8.2 Proteome Software Inc, Portland, OR) for final TMT quantification and data visualization. Normalized and scaled protein/peptide abundance ratios were calculated against the abundance value of the ‘reference’ (which is the pooled sample).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Amino acid quantification</title><p>At least 600 seedlings were pooled per sample and a total of four samples per genotype was analyzed. Approximately 50 mg to 100 mg fresh weight of each sample was weighed into an Eppendorf tube and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 10 μL of 2.5 mM <sup>13</sup>C- and <sup>15</sup>N-labeled amino acid internal standard was then added to each tube, followed by 600 μL extraction solution (3:5:12 water:chloroform:methanol) and two steel balls. These samples were then put onto a tissulizer to lyse cells and extract free amino acids. Samples were centrifuged to pellet tissue and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube. This extraction procedure was then repeated and combined with the first extraction to ensure thorough extraction of all amino acids. After the second extraction, 300 μL chloroform and 450 μL water were added to each tube, which were then mixed vigorously. Debris was separated by centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and dried with a Speedvac, and then the pellet was resuspended in 1.0 mL 80% methanol. The methanol-dissolved samples were transferred to a vial for analysis by LC/MS/MS with a Velos ion trap, and separation was accomplished using a HILIC column combined with a Waters UPLC instrument.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Chlorophyll quantification method</title><p>At least 120 quiescent seedlings per sample were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

The major conclusion of this paper is that the TOP-LARP1-TOR axis is evolutionarily conserved, although pathways additional to that responsible for ribosome biogenesis have coopted this method of translation regulation in plants. The authors performed a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome, ribosome footprint, and phosphoproteome levels in seedlings in the presence and absence of TOR inhibition and in larp1 deletion mutants. This study is of high enough quality and interest to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, as it will be of interest to a broad range of scientists and provides nice evolutionary perspective using a different model system than that typically used to assess TOR signaling. Furthermore, it bridges molecular studies with organismal studies, providing a nice perspective of the biological readout of the variables they choose to test. Finally, it annotates TOPs in plants and defines core TOPs.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript reads very well. The introduction is very nicely written, clearly outlining the progress of the field, the importance of the study, and how the work moves the field forward. The authors do a nice job of acknowledging the caveats of their observations. There are two major issues with this paper that should be addressed:</p><p>1) The breadth of the study is both a major strength and a weakness. While it is important to document and discuss the non-RP TOPs and how they are regulated, the amount of information provided makes reading these parts of the Results section tedious, yet is not enough to make these sections feel complete (each section is enough for one or two additional papers!). It reads as reporting on something first, rather than providing a sophisticated discussion of the biological underpinnings of their findings; nearly all of these sections conclude with a statement like &quot;future investigations…&quot; etc.</p><p>2) Figure 5B; the presentation of the data is not intuitive. It looks like CYDCD3;2, RACK1, el15b, PABP8, PIN1, and IAA26 might not be canonical TOPs. Could tracks be shown (like in Philippe, 2020) so that the predominant TSS for each TOP is apparent? Additionally, can the authors provide an example TOPscore calculation for CYCD3;2? By eye, it looks like +1G followed by a long stretch of pyrimidines. There are also examples that look like they are interrupted by purines, but their TOPscores do not seem to match.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript of Scarpin and colleagues summarizes a very comprehensive attempt to establish the landscape of the downstream effectors of TOR and the respective affected processes in Arabidopsis. They conducted high throughput analyses in order to monitor the consequences of inhibiting TOR at global RNA (by RNA-seq) and protein (by proteomics) levels, as well as translation efficiency (by Ribo-seq) and protein phosphorylation (by phosphoproteomic). These experiments have yielded a broad, fundamental and timely picture of the engagement of TOR in a variety of processes common to a wide range of multicellular organisms, as well as ones unique to plant physiology.</p><p>Being aware of mTOR's positive role in the translational control of mammalian TOP mRNAs via LARP1 repression (as proposed by several reports), the authors set out to examine whether a similar mechanism is also applicable to plant cells. Surprisingly, their findings indeed support, at least partially, such an evolutionary conservation, as exemplified by the following observations: (a) the plant TOR appeared to control the translation of mRNAs, for some of which the vertebrate orthologues are bona fide TOP mRNAs; (b) LARP1 is a downstream target of TOR; (c) LARP1 deficiency prevented the repressive effect of TOR inhibition on a subset of mRNAs; and (d) some of these mRNAs are also equipped with a 5'TOP motif. These observations seem to expand the landscape of TOP mRNAs beyond the animal kingdom and shed some light on their evolutionary development. In addition, they lay the ground for future studies on the evolution of the structural attributes of TOP mRNAs and the mechanism underlying their translational control. Nevertheless, this manuscript still requires several clarifications and changes, as detailed below:</p><p>1) Introduction: &quot; only a handful of cytosolic RP mRNAs themselves have 5.TOP motifs.&quot; What might be the explanation for the lack of a 5'TOP motif in the majority of rp mRNAs? How is the coordinated synthesis of all rps achieved in Arabidopsis if only a handful of them are subjected to translational control via the mTOR-LARP1 axis? What might be the other mechanism(s) that ensure, if at all, the stoichiometric accumulation of all rps?</p><p>2) Subsection “TOPscore analysis reveals conserved TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling axis”: the definition of TOPscore is quite permissive relative to that characterized the 5'TOP element in vertebrate or even in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Namely, it may start with any pyrimidine, rather than the mandatory C residue at position +1 in TOP mRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates. Moreover, the term 5'TOP motif, as used by the authors in the Arabidopsis context, seems somewhat elusive. Thus, how come the TSSs of IAA26 and of PIN1 (TSS1) mRNAs start with an A residue (Figure 5B), yet they have significantly higher TOPscore (5.5 and 7.8, respectively) than that of PABA8 (5.5) or TCTP1, that have a TSS at a C residue followed by 5 or 4 consecutive pyrimidines. These observations raise a question mark over the inclusion of the two former mRNAs as bona fide TOP mRNAs, especially when compared with the stringent definition of 5'TOP sequence that does not allow a purine at the cap site.</p><p>Readers that are familiar with definition of vertebrate 5'TOP motif are likely to be misled by the data as presented here. Hence, the authors should present a table in the Results that will replace Figure 5B, and will include all mRNAs that conform with the structural attributes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate 5'TOP motifs. This table should include all three columns of Figure 5B, as well as the second and third columns of Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>It should be pointed out, however, that the term ∆TE, as appears in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, is not well defined, at least not in the figure legend. Thus, it is not clear whether the value of -1.02 (is it on a log2 scale?) assigned for eEF1Bbeta1 in WT plants is considered as repression, nor what the value of -0.34 for the LARP1 plant mutant means. Does it represent an elimination of repression? In other words, this is not a 'user friendly' way to provide the reader with a clear picture of whether a given mRNA is subject to translational repression upon Torin 2 treatment and whether this repression is prevented in a LARP1 deficient mutant. The authors should consider the presentation of the data by a fold change in a non-logarithmic scale, which might make it easier for the reader to perceive, at a glance, the magnitude of the effects.</p><p>3) Subsection “Newly identified 5′TOP mRNAs in plants”: The authors suggest that &quot;the direct control of RP translation 5′TOP motifs to coordinate ribosome biogenesis evolved later in an ancestor of vertebrates.&quot; Hence, they have to provide a reasonable explanation as to why, therefore, the 5'TOP motif evolved at all in some of the plant rps?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>TThe mTOR signaling pathway controls cell growth and is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Many mTOR effectors control the translation of mRNAs, but their functions have mostly been studied in yeast and mammalian cells. This manuscript from Scarpin et al., extends this analysis to plants. Through a combination of proteomic and transcriptomic methodologies, they identify key features of this system that are conserved in Arabidopsis, and others that are plant-specific. In particular, they show that AtTOR controls the translation of a class of mRNAs that contain 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs through an RNA-binding protein called LARP1, as it does in vertebrates. This is surprising because, although LARP1 is conserved in plants, many of the classical TOP mRNAs (e.g. RP mRNAs) appear to lack TOP motifs. The authors conduct an unbiased analysis of plant 5' sequence data to show that some classical non-RP TOP mRNAs are unexpectedly conserved, and further identify other plant-specific TOP mRNAs.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of AtTOR regulation of mRNA translation in plants and offers new insights into the evolution of this system. My primary concern is that the manuscript is often unfocused and without sufficient validation of claims. The strongest conclusion is that an ancestral version of TOR regulation of TOP mRNA translation via LARP1 is conserved in plants. However, many of the results and discussion are tangential to these findings. In particular, the phosphoproteomic analysis identifies some potentially new substrates, but these are not validated and the one that is most relevant to this study, AtLARP1, was already identified in a previous screen (Van Leene et al., 2019). Nonetheless, with suitable revisions, this manuscript would significantly contribute to our understanding of the conservation and function of TOR signaling across eukaryotes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Torin 2 has significant off-target effects on other major kinases, including ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK (Liu, 2013). Some of the results presented here may therefore reflect the activity of other kinases. This is especially problematic for the phosphoproteomic analysis but might also affect transcription and translation results. The authors need to acknowledge this in the text, and, more importantly, validate the relevant findings using either a genetic approach or other inhibitors with a better – or at least different – selectivity profile (e.g. rapamycin, AZD8055) to repress TOR signaling. Are cytosolic and mitochondrial mRNA levels still repressed? Is the translation of plastidial RP mRNAs still repressed? Is the phosphorylation of proteins without obvious mTOR-regulate mammalian homologues (e.g. TOPLESS) still affected?</p><p>2) Many of the results and discussion related to the phosphoproteomic screen seem tangential to the main point of this manuscript, which focuses on LARP1. This is particularly true given that a recent phosphoproteomic study from Van Leene et al., (2019) also identified LARP1 as an mTOR target in plants. Other targets are interesting, but it's hard to assess their significance given the selectivity concerns described above. I recommend that this section be substantially reduced, or to focus more on translation targets.</p><p>3) The authors need to confirm that AtLARP1-target mRNAs are recognized through their 5' TOP sequence. This reviewer is not a plant biologist, but experiments would ideally involve introducing reporter mRNAs that contain or lack TOP motifs and testing TOR regulation of their translation.</p><p>4) Does LARP1 also control the stability of TOP mRNAs in plants? This is an important function in mammalian systems, although its stability function in plants may be more complex (see Merret et al., 2013). The authors should at least test whether steady-state levels of putative TOP mRNAs are decreased in AtLARP1-deficient plants, as this data has already been generated. This simple analysis would reveal whether this major function of AtLARP1 is also conserved.</p><p>5) Results from Figure 3 indicate that LARP deletion retards growth. This is paradoxical given that LARP1 functions as a translation repressor. How do the authors explain this? One possibility is that under the growth-promoting conditions used here, LARP1's translation functions are largely inactive. LARP1 may instead be acting primarily as an mRNA stabilizer, as mentioned above. The authors need to address this in the text based on results from comment #3.</p><p>6) The authors make the interesting observation that the translation of RP mRNAs is TOR-regulated, but through a LARP1-independent mechanism. Are there other features of At RP mRNAs that might account for this regulation? There seems to be an opportunity to identify new mechanistic signatures. Conversely, the authors show that LARP1 is not required for TOR-control of cytosolic RP mRNA translation, but what about plastidial ribosome mRNAs? These were shown to be TOR-regulated in Figure 1D.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58795.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>summary:</p><p>The paper describes experiments that show that TOR controls translation of 5′TOP mRNAs in Arabidopsis, via LARP1.

Broadly, our observation that LARP1 is required to maintain TOR activity (as has been reported in other systems), highlighted especially in Figure 4F and 4G, suggests that LARP1 may act in some sort of feedback/homeostatic regulatory network with TOR. We will be interested in determining whether some environmental condition or genetic change can restore TOR activity in the larp1 background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Does LARP1 control the stability of TOP mRNAs in plants like in mammals? You need to determine whether steady-state levels of putative TOP mRNAs are decreased in AtLARP1-deficient plants.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included this analysis in Figure 5F. Briefly, we see a minor but statistically significant effect of LARP1 on steady-state levels of mRNAs with high TOPscores (or, to put it another way, mRNAs that accumulate to significantly lower levels in the larp1 background have higher TOPscores).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Since only a handful of cytosolic RP mRNAs have 5' TOP motifs, how is the coordinated synthesis of all rps achieved in plants? What could be the other mechanism(s) that ensure, if at all, the stoichiometric accumulation of all rps?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great evolutionary question. To help address it, we have added a model figure to the end of our report (Figure 6). Animal genomes evolved this adaptation to directly control RP synthesis via TOR-LARP1 signaling, but we propose that the ancestral state was indirect control by regulating synthesis of diverse ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) proteins. More evolutionary studies will be needed to directly test this preliminary proposal supported by our evidence. Within Arabidopsis, we are currently pursuing whether other putative TOR substrates identified in our phosphoproteomic screen might impact translation of cytosolic rps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Scarpin et al., reports the TOR-associated LARP1-dependent translation regulation of transcripts encoded by terminal oligopyrimidine mRNAs in Arabidopsis. The major conclusion of this paper is that the TOP-LARP1-TOR axis is evolutionarily conserved, although pathways additional to that responsible for ribosome biogenesis have coopted this method of translation regulation in plants. The authors performed a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome, ribosome footprint, and phosphoproteome levels in seedlings in the presence and absence of TOR inhibition and in larp1 deletion mutants. This study is of high enough quality and interest to warrant publication in eLife, as it will be of interest to a broad range of scientists and provides nice evolutionary perspective using a different model system than that typically used to assess TOR signaling. Furthermore, it bridges molecular studies with organismal studies, providing a nice perspective of the biological readout of the variables they choose to test. Finally, it annotates TOPs in plants and defines core TOPs.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript reads very well. The introduction is very nicely written, clearly outlining the progress of the field, the importance of the study, and how the work moves the field forward. The authors do a nice job of acknowledging the caveats of their observations. There are two major issues with this paper that should be addressed:</p><p>1) The breadth of the study is both a major strength and a weakness. While it is important to document and discuss the non-RP TOPs and how they are regulated, the amount of information provided makes reading these parts of the Results section tedious, yet is not enough to make these sections feel complete (each section is enough for one or two additional papers!). It reads as reporting on something first, rather than providing a sophisticated discussion of the biological underpinnings of their findings; nearly all of these sections conclude with a statement like &quot;future investigations…&quot; etc.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer notes, we tried to find a balance between elucidating interesting results from our global profiling experiments and excessive speculation. Our intent is to illuminate pathways that might be of interest for our readers to stimulate future research. We agree that we did not always succeed in this balance, however, so we have gone back through the manuscript and removed several statements and even paragraphs to improve focus and reduce unsubstantiated or insufficiently explained proposals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 5B; the presentation of the data is not intuitive. It looks like CYDCD3;2, RACK1, el15b, PABP8, PIN1, and IAA26 might not be canonical TOPs. Could tracks be shown (like in Philippe, 2020) so that the predominant TSS for each TOP is apparent? Additionally, can the authors provide an example TOPscore calculation for CYCD3;2? By eye, it looks like +1G followed by a long stretch of pyrimidines. There are also examples that look like they are interrupted by purines, but their TOPscores do not seem to match.</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially revised this figure for clarity, and validated these results with 5′RACE to ensure that we are presenting only the highest-quality data in this panel. Thank you for the thorough critique, which was very helpful for guiding us to better present these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript of Scarpin and colleagues summarizes a very comprehensive attempt to establish the landscape of the downstream effectors of TOR and the respective affected processes in Arabidopsis. They conducted high throughput analyses in order to monitor the consequences of inhibiting TOR at global RNA (by RNA-seq) and protein (by proteomics) levels, as well as translation efficiency (by Ribo-seq) and protein phosphorylation (by phosphoproteomic). These experiments have yielded a broad, fundamental and timely picture of the engagement of TOR in a variety of processes common to a wide range of multicellular organisms, as well as ones unique to plant physiology.</p><p>Being aware of mTOR's positive role in the translational control of mammalian TOP mRNAs via LARP1 repression (as proposed by several reports), the authors set out to examine whether a similar mechanism is also applicable to plant cells. Surprisingly, their findings indeed support, at least partially, such an evolutionary conservation, as exemplified by the following observations: (a) the plant TOR appeared to control the translation of mRNAs, for some of which the vertebrate orthologues are bona fide TOP mRNAs; (b) LARP1 is a downstream target of TOR; (c) LARP1 deficiency prevented the repressive effect of TOR inhibition on a subset of mRNAs; and (d) some of these mRNAs are also equipped with a 5'TOP motif. These observations seem to expand the landscape of TOP mRNAs beyond the animal kingdom and shed some light on their evolutionary development. In addition, they lay the ground for future studies on the evolution of the structural attributes of TOP mRNAs and the mechanism underlying their translational control. Nevertheless, this manuscript still requires several clarifications and changes, as detailed below:</p><p>1) Introduction: &quot;only a handful of cytosolic RP mRNAs themselves have 5.TOP motifs.&quot; What might be the explanation for the lack of a 5'TOP motif in the majority of rp mRNAs? How is the coordinated synthesis of all rps achieved in Arabidopsis if only a handful of them are subjected to translational control via the mTOR-LARP1 axis? What might be the other mechanism(s) that ensure, if at all, the stoichiometric accumulation of all rps?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional discussion of the evolution of 5′TOP signaling. Briefly, we would argue that the evidence suggests that this universal control of RP mRNA translation by 5′TOP only recently arose in one lineage of animals, and that this was not the ancestral function of TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling. We agree that understanding how RP stoichiometries are maintained in plants is worthy of additional study, especially given that all plant RPs are encoded by at least two functional paralogous genes, and often by several genes. Our results suggest that this is probably achieved through multilayered mechanisms in plants that remain to be clearly defined (but we certainly intend to work on it!).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Subsection “TOPscore analysis reveals conserved TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling axis”: the definition of TOPscore is quite permissive relative to that characterized the 5'TOP element in vertebrate or even in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Namely, it may start with any pyrimidine, rather than the mandatory C residue at position +1 in TOP mRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates. Moreover, the term 5'TOP motif, as used by the authors in the Arabidopsis context, seems somewhat elusive. Thus, how come the TSSs of IAA26 and of PIN1 (TSS1) mRNAs start with an A residue (Figure 5B), yet they have significantly higher TOPscore (5.5 and 7.8, respectively) than that of PABA8 (5.5) or TCTP1, that have a TSS at a C residue followed by 5 or 4 consecutive pyrimidines. These observations raise a question mark over the inclusion of the two former mRNAs as bona fide TOP mRNAs, especially when compared with the stringent definition of 5'TOP sequence that does not allow a purine at the cap site.</p><p>Readers that are familiar with definition of vertebrate 5'TOP motif are likely to be misled by the data as presented here. Hence, the authors should present a table in the Results that will replace Figure 5B, and will include all mRNAs that conform with the structural attributes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate 5'TOP motifs. This table should include all three columns of Figure 5B, as well as the second and third columns of Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>It should be pointed out, however, that the term ∆TE, as appears in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, is not well defined, at least not in the figure legend. Thus, it is not clear whether the value of -1.02 (is it on a log2 scale?) assigned for eEF1Bbeta1 in WT plants is considered as repression, nor what the value of -0.34 for the LARP1 plant mutant means. Does it represent an elimination of repression? In other words, this is not a 'user friendly' way to provide the reader with a clear picture of whether a given mRNA is subject to translational repression upon Torin 2 treatment and whether this repression is prevented in a LARP1 deficient mutant. The authors should consider the presentation of the data by a fold change in a non-logarithmic scale, which might make it easier for the reader to perceive, at a glance, the magnitude of the effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified this figure substantially to address the issues raised. We deeply appreciate the detailed critique, which greatly helped us to better present our data. We have also conducted 5′RACE to directly corroborate the results shown in Figure 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Newly identified 5′TOP mRNAs in plants”: The authors suggest that &quot;the direct control of RP translation 5′TOP motifs to coordinate ribosome biogenesis evolved later in an ancestor of vertebrates.&quot; Hence, they have to provide a reasonable explanation as to why, therefore, the 5'TOP motif evolved at all in some of the plant rps?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a stimulating question. We might rephrase or invert the question to ask, “Why did vertebrates evolve universal 5′TOP motifs for all of their RP mRNAs, whereas other eukaryotes do not require this universal and direct level of control to maintain cellular homeostasis?” As we expand our knowledge of TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling beyond animals, this may eventually become more clear; right now, we do not have a strong hypothesis. In particular, future studies to test whether disrupting the 5′TOP motif in plant cytosolic RPs has any phenotypic consequences (and if so, how) could address this comment. Broadly, we suspect that the overall tendency of plant genes to duplicate (especially by regular and repeated polyploidization) and the abundance of RP paralogues might put different evolutionary pressures on TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling than the pressures placed on vertebrate genomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>TThe mTOR signaling pathway controls cell growth and is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Many mTOR effectors control the translation of mRNAs, but their functions have mostly been studied in yeast and mammalian cells. This manuscript from Scarpin et al., extends this analysis to plants. Through a combination of proteomic and transcriptomic methodologies, they identify key features of this system that are conserved in Arabidopsis, and others that are plant-specific. In particular, they show that AtTOR controls the translation of a class of mRNAs that contain 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs through an RNA-binding protein called LARP1, as it does in vertebrates. This is surprising because, although LARP1 is conserved in plants, many of the classical TOP mRNAs (e.g. RP mRNAs) appear to lack TOP motifs. The authors conduct an unbiased analysis of plant 5' sequence data to show that some classical non-RP TOP mRNAs are unexpectedly conserved, and further identify other plant-specific TOP mRNAs.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of AtTOR regulation of mRNA translation in plants and offers new insights into the evolution of this system. My primary concern is that the manuscript is often unfocused and without sufficient validation of claims. The strongest conclusion is that an ancestral version of TOR regulation of TOP mRNA translation via LARP1 is conserved in plants. However, many of the results and discussion are tangential to these findings. In particular, the phosphoproteomic analysis identifies some potentially new substrates, but these are not validated and the one that is most relevant to this study, AtLARP1, was already identified in a previous screen (Van Leene et al., 2019). Nonetheless, with suitable revisions, this manuscript would significantly contribute to our understanding of the conservation and function of TOR signaling across eukaryotes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Torin 2 has significant off-target effects on other major kinases, including ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK (Liu, 2013). Some of the results presented here may therefore reflect the activity of other kinases. This is especially problematic for the phosphoproteomic analysis but might also affect transcription and translation results. The authors need to acknowledge this in the text, and, more importantly, validate the relevant findings using either a genetic approach or other inhibitors with a better – or at least different – selectivity profile (e.g. rapamycin, AZD8055) to repress TOR signaling. Are cytosolic and mitochondrial mRNA levels still repressed? Is the translation of plastidial RP mRNAs still repressed? Is the phosphorylation of proteins without obvious mTOR-regulate mammalian homologues (e.g. TOPLESS) still affected?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added extensive discussion of the strengths and pitfalls of using Torin2 upfront in the Results section, followed by new caveats throughout the manuscript. Briefly, we do not expect that Torin2 has any off-target effects in our assays, because (1) Arabidopsis does not encode all of the PIKKs (it only has ATM, ATR, and TOR) and ATM and ATR are induced by the DNA damage response, which is not activated in our assays, and (2) we used a near-minimal concentration of Torin2 to only partially attenuate TOR activity and minimize any off-target effects. In fact, even in humans, current evidence suggests that Torin2 is highly selective for TOR except in cell types that have strongly elevated ATM or ATR activity; e.g., cancer cell types that often have knockout mutations in ATM and replication stress upregulate ATR to compensate, and in these cells, Torin2 at standard pharmacological concentrations can synergistically cause cytotoxicity by ablating TOR activity and partially inhibiting ATR.</p><p>In addition, we have added several additional analyses showing that our results are in line with experimental results using other methods to inhibit TOR (rapamycin, AZD8055, and RNAi) without any unexpected findings; for example, the DEGs found by RNA-Seq are extremely similar to the DEGs found when TOR is inhibited by RNAi or AZD8055 in young Arabidopsis seedlings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Many of the results and discussion related to the phosphoproteomic screen seem tangential to the main point of this manuscript, which focuses on LARP1. This is particularly true given that a recent phosphoproteomic study from Van Leene et al., (2019) also identified LARP1 as an mTOR target in plants. Other targets are interesting, but it's hard to assess their significance given the selectivity concerns described above. I recommend that this section be substantially reduced, or to focus more on translation targets.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we did struggle to find a good balance in presenting these data. Our goal with these sections is to illustrate pathways that might be of interest to biologists who aren’t directly interested in TOR-LARP1 signaling. Moreover, likely because we used seedlings rather than cell suspension cultures, we uncovered a number of new potential phosphorylation targets of TOR that were either not expressed in Van Leene et al.’s data, or were nearly but not quite below significance thresholds (many of our targets had, e.g., p = 0.07 or p = 0.10 in the Van Leene et al., study, but p &lt;&lt; 0.05 here).</p><p>More broadly, we hope that our analysis demonstrates clearly that we consistently detect signs that TOR controls ribosome biogenesis at nearly every level and through complex signaling networks: transcriptional, translational, and post-translational. This may help to address some of the questions raised by other reviewers about how plants are coordinating ribosome assembly with so many paralogous RP genes and no universal 5′TOP motif.</p><p>Lastly, although we are very confident and have added directly analysis supporting that</p><p>Torin2 is not inhibiting any other PIKKs in our experimental system, we have checked and edited where necessary to be sure that we consistently state that this is the Torin2sensitive phosphoproteome, rather than directly call this the TOR phosphoproteome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to confirm that AtLARP1-target mRNAs are recognized through their 5' TOP sequence. This reviewer is not a plant biologist, but experiments would ideally involve introducing reporter mRNAs that contain or lack TOP motifs and testing TOR regulation of their translation.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, due to research restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and time constraints associated with generating the transgenic reporters necessary for this experiment, this is beyond the scope of the current report. We will certainly begin to prepare the genetic material for these experiments so that this can be demonstrated in a future report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Does LARP1 also control the stability of TOP mRNAs in plants? This is an important function in mammalian systems, although its stability function in plants may be more complex (see Merret et al., 2013). The authors should at least test whether steady-state levels of putative TOP mRNAs are decreased in AtLARP1-deficient plants, as this data has already been generated. This simple analysis would reveal whether this major function of AtLARP1 is also conserved.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this analysis, which shows that LARP1 might be impacting stability of 5′TOP mRNAs, although the effect on translation is much more readily apparent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Results from Figure 3 indicate that LARP deletion retards growth. This is paradoxical given that LARP1 functions as a translation repressor. How do the authors explain this? One possibility is that under the growth-promoting conditions used here, LARP1's translation functions are largely inactive. LARP1 may instead be acting primarily as an mRNA stabilizer, as mentioned above. The authors need to address this in the text based on results from comment #3.</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent questions for us to think about. Briefly, we suspect that the effects on growth are more likely the result of the global dysregulation / attenuation of TOR activity in the larp1 background. The next question, then, would be why TOR is less active in larp1 mutants, which suggests some sort of homeostatic or regulatory feedback loop (although there are other hypotheses). Our global profiling experiments may provide some hints, although there is no immediately obvious target, and we intend to pursue this going forward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors make the interesting observation that the translation of RP mRNAs is TOR-regulated, but through a LARP1-independent mechanism. Are there other features of At RP mRNAs that might account for this regulation? There seems to be an opportunity to identify new mechanistic signatures. Conversely, the authors show that LARP1 is not required for TOR-control of cytosolic RP mRNA translation, but what about plastidial ribosome mRNAs? These were shown to be TOR-regulated in Figure 1D.</p></disp-quote><p>We are actively pursuing this question. As mentioned above, we have some strong candidate mechanisms revealed in our global profiling experiments that might help to explain these phenomena, and we look forward to testing these hypotheses and letting you know soon!</p></body></sub-article></article>
