critical for mammalian cellular processes. Numerous mechanisms contribute to its origins, yet the mechanisms behind large fluctuations that are induced by single transcriptional activators remain elusive. Here, we probed putative mechanisms by studying the dynamic regulation of transcriptional activator binding, histone regulator inhibitors, chromatin accessibility, and levels of mRNAs and proteins in single cells. Using a light-induced expression system, we showed that the transcriptional activator could form an interplay with dual functional co-activator/histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300. This interplay resulted in substantial heterogeneity in H3K27ac, chromatin accessibility, and transcription. Simultaneous attenuation of CBP/p300 and HDAC4/5 reduced heterogeneity in the expression of endogenous genes, suggesting that this mechanism is universal. We further found that the noise was reduced by pulse-wide modulation of transcriptional activator binding possibly as a result of alternating the epigenetic states. Our findings suggest a mechanism for the modulation of noise in synthetic and endogenous gene expression systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetic bistability</kwd><kwd>gene expression noise</kwd><kwd>histone modification</kwd><kwd>transcriptional activator</kwd><kwd>synthetic circuit</kwd><kwd>oscillation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key R&amp;D plan project of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0906002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31971181</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770928</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012245</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016A050503010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shenzhen Peacock Plan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KQTD2016053117035204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010877</institution-id><institution>Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZDSYS20200811144002008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ubiquitous transcriptional factor-CBP/p300 interaction induces epigenetic and transcriptional bimodality, which can be utilized to tune mean gene expression and noise independently.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Isogenic cells in a homogenous environment can exhibit significant variations in gene expression. A single cell also shows similar fluctuations in gene expression over time. This phenomenon, often called gene expression noise, was initially demonstrated by computational modeling of stochastic biochemical reactions with finite biomolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McAdams and Arkin, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref> first designed experiments to investigate and characterize gene expression noise. Many general mechanisms that contribute to gene expression noise in mammalian cells have been identified, including partition at cell division, transcriptional bursting, epigenetic modifications, and 3D chromosome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huh and Paulsson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nicolas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suter et al., 2011</xref>). These studies often involved gene expression systems that are regulated by multiple transcriptional activators and complex interactions. Substantial noise is also observed in synthetic inducible gene expression systems involving just one transcriptional activator, often causing such systems to exhibit more noise than endogenous systems in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kyba et al., 2002</xref>). However, the mechanistic origin remains to be identified experimentally. Various biological processes, such as cell fate control in proliferation, differentiation, and cell death, rely on precise control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balázsi et al., 2011</xref>). There are many examples in which cells and animals benefit from either suppressing or elevating noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sosnik et al., 2016</xref>). Synthetic inducible gene expression systems, including Tet-Off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gossen and Bujard, 1992</xref>), Tet-On (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gossen et al., 1995</xref>), chemical systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khalil et al., 2012</xref>), light-induced systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), and CRISPR-derived systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nihongaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shao et al., 2018</xref>) have been developed to perform perturbations of biological processes in cells and animals. With many toolboxes already developed in synthetic biology, we can now seek a better understanding of the complex biological processes that underlie fluctuations in gene expression by studying the quantitative and dynamic modulation of critical gene products in mammals. Synthetic inducible gene expression also enables mechanistic studies of the essential functions of transcriptional regulation by allowing dynamic and quantitative modulations, which are not possible in endogenous gene regulation systems.</p><p>An inducible expression system usually consists of an engineered transcriptional activator and an engineered promoter that includes a TATA box and multiple binding sites for the transcriptional activator. The transcriptional activator is usually constructed to include a DNA binding domain and the activation domain of an endogenous transcriptional activator, such as the p65 subunit (p65AD) of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF κ-B) or VP16 (VP16AD) from herpes simplex virus type I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gossen and Bujard, 1992</xref>). Upon binding to the promoter, the transcriptional activator recruits coactivators, the mediator complex, and the transcriptional preinitiation complex (PIC) to initiate transcription. Such simple gene expression systems are often associated with large noise, although the mechanisms behind this noise are unclear. This limits the potential applications of inducible expression systems in situations that require the regulation of gene expression heterogeneity, such as studies of cell fate control. Several engineering approaches have been reported to suppress noise in doxycycline- (dox-) and light-induced expression systems in mammalian cells. Two engineered circuits were constructed with a dox-induced tetR-based negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nevozhay et al., 2013</xref>) or a light-induced tetR-LOV negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guinn and Balázsi, 2019</xref>). The potential applications of those circuits are limited because they have fixed noise levels and use the cell-type-sensitive CMV promoter.</p><p>In this study, we sought to use a LightOn inducible gene expression system to identify potential mechanisms behind the generation of large amounts of noise by a single transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), and to develop strategies to control noise and mean expression independently. We generated stably transfected human ovarian cancer (HeLa) and mouse embryonal carcinoma (F9) cell clones with this LightOn expression system, using p65AD and dynamic and quantitative light inductions. We used flow cytometry to discover that pulse-width modulation (PWM) of the illumination with a period of 400 min or longer reduces gene expression noise. We identified histone acetylation as being key to the large fluctuations (noise) in amplitude modulation (AM) illumination.</p><p>We hypothesize that the light-activated transcriptional activator binds to the promoter in the open chromatin region in a stochastic manner and recruits the CBP/p300 coactivator. CBP/p300 not only facilitates the recruitment of PIC and initiates transcription but also acetylates histones in the vicinity, keeping the chromatin in an active/open state. This interplay could generate bimodality in histone acetylation and transcriptional activity under intermediate amplitude modulation (AM) illumination. We propose that illumination with PWM reduces noise by alternating the cell between ‘high’ and ‘low’ states with smaller heterogeneity. We used single-cell data to demonstrate the stability of these ‘high’ and ‘low’ states. We utilized A485, a specific inhibitor of CBP/p300 HAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lasko et al., 2017</xref>), a p65AD mutant that impairs p65AD-CBP/p300 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mukherjee et al., 2013</xref>), H3K27ac ChIP-seq analysis, single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), and live-cell single mRNA imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tutucci et al., 2018</xref>) to validate the hypothesis. Furthermore, we combined the CBP/p300 inhibitor (A485) and the HDAC4 inhibitor (LMK-235) to disrupt the interplay between epigenetic regulation and transcriptional regulation involving CBP/p300 in mouse embryonic stem (mES), HeLa, and F9 cells, and observed reduced heterogeneity of endogenous gene expression for genes with high noise. These observations suggest that a noise modulation mechanism involving CBP/p300 could occur widely.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Constant induction of a mammalian light-inducible system result in bimodality and large noise in gene expression</title><p>To facilitate studying the dynamic induction of gene expression, we stably integrated the LightOn expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) into HeLa cells using the PiggyBac transposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu and Huang, 2014</xref>). The LightOn system consists of a synthetic transcriptional activator GAVPO and the mRuby3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajar et al., 2016</xref>) reporter driven by a synthetic 5xUAS promoter consisting of five GAL4 binding elements and a TATA box (plasmid B1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To assess the contribution of variation in GAVPO expression to the mRuby noise, the expression of GAVPO is driven by a noise reduction circuit of pCMV-tetO2-tetR-GFP-T2A-GAVPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nevozhay et al., 2013</xref>), where GFP provides an indirect measurement of GAVPO expression in individual cells (plasmid A1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This approach also facilitates the regulation of mean GAVPO expression. The engineered HeLa cell clone is referred to as HeLa-AB1. In the following experiments, a doxycycline concentration of 1 μg/mL was chosen to ensure the cells were responsive to moderate light intensities. We measured expression of the fluorescent proteins by flow cytometry. At a constant light illumination (AM, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) with intensities between 0 and 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>, the average level of mRuby expression in the population increased with increasing light intensity above 1 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> (blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The gene expression noise was quantified by the coefficients of variation (CV). The cell population exhibited a bell-shaped noise profile across both the range of light intensities (blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and the range of mean mRuby expression levels (blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The highest noise level (CV ~2.5) was induced at intermediate light intensities (~10 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The single-cell expression distributions showed a bimodal pattern, and an increasing number of cells transited from the ‘low’ to the ‘high’ state when the light intensity increased from 10 to 45 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> (solid lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

This noise can be modeled as a combination of a deterministic single-valued propagation function and an added phenomenological noise contribution, described as <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> in the Materials and methods section. The detailed calculations are described in the Materials and methods section and in Appendix 2. For AM induction at 25 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), the GFP signal exhibited a unimodal distribution with a CV of 0.47, shown in the lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>. Assuming GAVPO exhibits noise similar to that seen for GFP, a hypothetical sigmoid GAVPO-mRuby response curve with high cooperativity (black dashed line in the main panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) could lead to high variability and a bimodal distribution in mRuby (shown as the black dashed line in the right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). To assess the contributions of GAVPO noise to mRuby distribution dispersion, we split the flow cytometry data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) into 20 bins based on the GFP signal. We then plotted a dose–response curve of the mean mRuby versus mean GFP-GAVPO expression for these 20 subpopulations (red circles) and fit these data to an empirical function (red dashed line in the main plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Using this shallow curve as the deterministic propagation function, Benzinger and Khammash’s hypothesis would predict a unimodal distribution of mRuby with a relatively low CV value of 0.9, shown as the red dashed line in the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>. Therefore, the shape of the bimodal distribution and the high noise level (CV = 1.73) of actual mRuby expression in HeLa-AB1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) cannot be explained by Benzinger and Khammash's hypothesis for <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, at least if the assumption of similar noise for GFP and GAVPO in our system is correct. We further looked at the mRuby distributions of the 20 subpopulations, assessing both the experimental and the predicted data. The CVs for experimentally measured mRuby expressions exhibited a bell-shaped function and ranged between 1.0 and 1.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The distributions for subpopulations transitioned from unimodal to bimodal and back to unimodal as mean GFP increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). On the other hand, Benzinger and Khammash's model predictions with two single-valued propagation functions can only exhibit unimodal distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–I</xref>), which cannot explain our observations. This analysis suggested that, given a narrowly defined GFP-GAVPO level, the 5xUAS promoter could exhibit distinct ‘high’ and ‘low’ transcription states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Modulation of gene expression noise with periodic induction</title><p>‘Low’ and ‘high’ noise levels might be related to epigenetic states at the 5xUAS promoter. The concept of epigenetic bistability was theorized by Sneppen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sneppen and Ringrose, 2019</xref>). Still, experimental studies have mainly been concerned with long-term epigenetic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hathaway et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singer et al., 2014</xref>) instead of fast gene expression fluctuations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bintu et al., 2016</xref> demonstrated that the kinetics of different histone modifiers vary from hours to days in CHO cells. We hypothesized that by modulating the binding of the transcriptional activator periodically, with time scales similar to those of histone modification dynamics, the transcription dynamics might be ‘resonated’ with histone modification dynamics. In dynamic system theory, this type of resonance might reduce stochasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1994</xref>). To explore this possibility, we use a pulse-width modulation (PWM, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) regiment with light switching off and on (between 0 and 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>), and the mean light intensity controlled by the fraction of ‘on’ time (duty cycle) with a fixed period. The period of 400 min results in minimal changes in mean gene expression (purple line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), but produces a significant reduction in gene expression noise across the intermediate mean light intensities and intermediate mean gene expression levels (purple lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). For the intermediate mean light intensities, distribution spreading is reduced by ‘eliminating’ the ‘low’ and ‘high’ states, resulting in the generation of an intermediate peak, which increases with mean light intensity (dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). When the period of PWM is shortened, the noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-E</xref>) and distributions gradually revert towards the AM scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–F</xref>). Therefore, we were able to modulate gene expression level and noise independently by altering the mean light intensity and the period of PWM within the range sandwiched between the blue and purple lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-E</xref>. A preliminary lookup table is computed by fitting expression level and distribution spreading (quantified as the ratio of mRuby intensities at 90th and 10th percentiles) to mean light intensity and period of PWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3H,I</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the discovery, we stably transfected HeLa and F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells with a LightOn-GFP circuit (plasmids A2, B2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to obtain HeLa-AB2 and F9-AB2 clones. We observed similar phenomena of high noise with AM and reduced noise with PWM with HeLa-AB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>) and F9-AB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D–F</xref>) cells, suggesting that the modulation of LightOn gene expression noise by PWM could be common in mammalian cells. Mean light intensity and period of PWM do not act as orthogonal parameters to control gene expression mean and noise. In F9 cells especially, expression level is often lower with PWM than with AM of the same mean intensity. To maintain the mean expression while adjusting noise, we needed to simultaneously adjust both mean light intensity and period of PWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3H</xref>).</p><p>We further generated multiple clones of HeLa-A1B1B3 cells from Hela-AB1, each with similar GAVPO expression but different copy numbers of 5xUAS-mCardinal insertion sites (ranging in number from 3 to 11); these clones exhibited similar distribution dispersions with AM light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A B</xref>). This observation suggested that bimodality is a robust phenomenon. To validate whether similar phenomena occur with chemical-induced p65 transactivator binding, we replaced the VP16 domain of rtTA on the classic tetON system with p65AD. We found that this system exhibited phenomena similar to those in LightOn systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>). We further reduced the tetO number from seven to one. However, this decreased the dynamic range of expression by ~200 to ~six fold, to levels too low to allow a clear definition of the existence of bimodality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>). As singe-cell analysis of histone modifications is able to provide greater sensitivity than protein analysis, further developments in single-cell ChIP-seq assays could help to resolve this technical problem.</p><p>To characterize the dynamic noise reductions with PWM, we illuminated the HeLa-AB1 cell with AM at 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> or 25 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>, or with PWM with a period of 400 min, and performed flow cytometry analysis over time. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, the mean expression level of mRuby started to increase at 2–300 min and reached a plateau at around 2000 min for PWM and 2800 min for both AM intensities. The delayed onset of mRuby fluorescence is partially due to its maturation time of approximately 150 min. The noise levels remain relatively constant from 1000 min onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Interestingly, for AM with 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>, the noise level spiked initially before settling to a low level. These observations suggest that PWM with a long period is needed to maintain a low level of noise.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Histone acetylation and transcription-epigenetic bimodality</title><p>Previous studies of histone modification kinetics in CHO cells suggested that histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) could be involved in our observed reduction in gene expression noise , as its rate constants are closer to the 400 min of PWM than those of other histone modifying enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bintu et al., 2016</xref>). To identify histone modifications that contributed to the noise in gene expression levels, we tested the effects of LMK-235, a selective inhibitor for HDAC4/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marek et al., 2013</xref>). We also tested Vorinostat, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finnin et al., 1999</xref>), and PF-06726304, a selective inhibitor of a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 component and of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kung et al., 2016</xref>). We added these inhibitors to the HeLa-AB1 cell and performed light inductions for two days with AM at 25 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> before flow cytometry analysis. Only LMK-235 significantly increased the expression of mRuby (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). To compare levels of mRuby expression at the same GAVPO levels, we calculated the population average mRuby versus GFP-GAVPO response curves for cells treated with these inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The mRuby versus GFP-GAVPO curve for LMK-235 treated cells (red) is significantly steeper than that of the control cells (blue). Furthermore, this curve also demonstrated that LMK-235 explicitly increases the mRuby expression of cells with the same GAVPO level. When comparing the effects on AM and PWM with a 400 min period, we found that LMK-235 increased mRuby expression but had only a minor impact on noise reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–F</xref>). LMK-235 also increased gene expression levels for F9-AB2 cells and HeLa-Tet-on cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Model of light-induced gene expression and epigenetic bistability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) mRuby expression distribution of HeLa-AB1 cells under AM with 25 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> and treated with inhibitors of various epigenetic regulators.

The dual-functional proteins CBP/p300 serve both as coactivators to recruit components of the mediator and transcriptional preinitiation complex (PIC) and as a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerritsen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ogryzko et al., 1996</xref>). A recent CBP/p300 acetylome study revealed their rapid acetylation kinetics at many loci in the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weinert et al., 2018</xref>). Putting this information together, we propose a mechanistic model for transcription-histone acetylation coupling of the light-inducible expression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) in which: (a) chromatin stochastically switches between silent and active states; (b) light induces GAVPO dimerization and enable its binding to UAS elements of the 5xUAS promoter in the active chromatin; (c) bound GAVPO recruits CBP/p300; (d) CBP/p300 acetylates nearby histones, and recruits PIC and mediator complex to facilitate transcription initiation; and (e) a locus with high histone acetylation would tend to stay in the active state and have an increased chance of binding of GAVPO dimer. In summary, the DNA-GAVPO-HAT complex increases the probability of chromatin accessibility and GAVPO binding to DNA by increasing histone acetylation.</p><p>This hypothetical positive feedback loop could generate bistability, probably with intermediate GAVPO dimer concentration (or light intensity) (between the dashed cyan lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). HDACs deacetylate histones and contribute to setting the boundaries between bistability and monostability. For some cells, the local promoter-GAVPO dimer interaction is sufficiently high as to initiate the positive feedback loop and to elevate local histone acetylation and induce high gene expression (red line). Other cells fail to start the positive feedback loop, which leads to low histone acetylation and transcription (blue line). Under this condition, the isogenic cells in a homogenous environment would exhibit large noise due to the history-dependent occupation of each state and stochastic switches between the two states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isaacs et al., 2003</xref>). This could explain the wide distributions of mRuby expression with narrow GFP-GAVPO inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The mechanism for PWM-induced noise reduction could be that the cell is switching between a high unimodal expression state (red) at 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> and a low unimodal expression state (blue) in the dark. In each state, the noise is low, and cells pass through the bimodal region rather quickly. For PWM with a shorter period, a cell doesn't have enough time to settle at either of two unimodal states, which leads to high noise.</p><p>We assessed the existence of high and low mRuby states by tracking the single-cell mRuby expression dynamics of HeLa-AB1 cells in 25 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> blue light induction using live-cell fluorescent microscopy. As both GFP and mRuby were tagged with three repeats of the SV40 nuclear localization signal, the GFP-GAVPO channel is used to segment and track cell nuclei over time. Single-cell expressions of GFP-GVPO and mRuby were integrated over the segmented nucleus. A representative time-lapse image series of the overlayed GFP and mRuby signals is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. The dashed and dotted circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> indicate that two cells remained in a low mRuby state through cell divisions, whereas two other cells had an elevated mRuby state which was maintained through cell division. The solid circle indicates that two offspring cells of one cell had different mRuby states after cell division. The mRuby expression states were designated as low (&lt;0.1) or high (&gt;0.6) after around 24 hr. The single-cell mRuby trajectories for 100 cells each from low (blue) and high states (red), normalized by cell-cycle stage, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>. The normalization process is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>. Most of the cells at low mRuby expression state at 24 hr remain low through 40 hr, with the mRuby levels of a few cells being elevated toward the high state. Most of the cells at high mRuby state at 24 hr were elevated before 12 hr and remained in the high state through 40 hr. A small fraction of these cells show a drop in mRuby expression, moving them towards the low state. The GFP-GAVPO expression levels were within a factor of two and indistinguishable between the low-state and high-state cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). These data indicate that the cells mostly maintain their mRuby expression states, with only a small fraction of them stochastically switching mRuby expression states. These single-cell dynamics are consistent with the bistability hypothesis, which assumes a low probability of random transitions. To validate bistability, longer live-cell imaging is required to observe sufficient occurrences of transition between the two states, partially because of the long half-life of the mRuby protein. At present, it is a challenge to maintain longer cell tracking without interruptions for periodic replacements of the culture medium.</p><p>To further assess the possibility of bistability, we examined its main characteristic, history-dependence. A cell in a bistable regime remains in the high or low state in a deterministic system, which is dependent only on the previous state of that cell. Stochastic fluctuations induce random transitions between the two states. When compared to ‘naïve’ cells that have not been exposed to blue light before the experiment, ‘primed’ cells that were exposed to 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> blue light immediately before the experiment would exhibit tilted distribution toward ‘high’ states under intermediate AM light induction. However, this priming would produce mRuby expression that partially remains after 48 hr. We constructed another plasmid B3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) containing destabilized mCardinal (mCardinal-PEST, shorter half-life) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 1998</xref>) under the control of the 5xUAS promoter to increase its temporal response, and stably transfected this plasmid into HeLa-AB1 cell to generate HeLa-A1B1B4 clones. When compared to ‘naïve’ cells, the cells primed with 8 hr of 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> blue light exhibited visible but minor distribution shifts toward the high state after 48 hr of further AM blue light inductions at 10 to 25 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> before mRuby (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) and mCardinal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) measurements. The relatively short time scale of CBP/p300 H3K27 acetylation increases stochastic transitions between the postulated ‘low’ and ‘high’ states and prevents observation of a more significant shift toward the high state as a result of priming.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Disruption of epigenetic bimodality by inhibiting HATs and dynamic alternating chromatin accessibility</title><p>We propose that a high level of noise in gene expression is the consequence of epigenetic bimodality induced by the interplay among promoter-bound GAVPO, HATs, and histone acetylation. Consequently, a reduction in the occurrence of bimodality could be realized by weakening CBP/p300 HAT activities and breaking the postulated positive feedback. We validated this prediction by utilizing A-485, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of the HAT activities of CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lasko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weinert et al., 2018</xref>), to disrupt the dynamic regulation of these proteins without changing their transcriptional initiation function. When A-485 was added to HeLa-AB1 cells under AM light induction for 48 hr, the CV values for mRuby expression were significantly reduced, especially at intermediate light intensities and mean mRuby expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). It seems that A-485 eliminates the ‘low’ and ‘high’ expression states and generates an intermediate state that has a narrower dispersion of mRuby expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This experiment also indirectly confirms that CBP/p300 are the prominent coactivators involved in transcription and histone modifications. The mean levels of mRuby expression were also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), possible because HDACs now tilt the balance towards lower histone acetylation, leading to lower chromatin accessibility and less transcription. To validate this explanation, we added both A-485 and LMK-235 to cells under AM light induction for 48 hr. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C, and F</xref>, the addition of the HDAC4/5 inhibitor increased the expression level of these cells back to those seen in the light induction control, while the reduction in noise was retained. Hence, simultaneous inhibition of CBP/p300 HAT activity and HDAC4/5 could be used to reduce noise without changing mean gene expression. However, their effect on either synthetic or endogenous gene expression has never been examined.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Validation of the epigenetic bistability of HeLa-AB1 cells in CBP/p300 inhibitor, H3K27ac, and ATAC-seq analyses.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Dose-response curve of mean mRuby expression versus light intensity (<bold>A</bold>), CV of mRuby expression versus light intensity (<bold>B</bold>) or versus mean mRuby expression(<bold>C</bold>).

We then constructed a plasmid A3 (PB5-CAG-GAVPO-mutant-PB3), and generated a HeLa-A3B2 cell line. With an intermediate level of AM light induction for 48 hr, the disruption of the direct interaction between GAVPO and CBP/p300 also eliminated the ‘low’ and ‘high’ expression states. Instead, this treatment resulted in an intermediate state with narrow GFP expression dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Further inhibition of HDAC4/5 using LMK-235 increases GFP expression and its sensitivity to light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). These two experiments suggested that p65-CBP/p300 interaction and CBP/p300 activity in the proximity of the 5xUAS promoter are necessary for transcriptional bimodality. An additional mutation (F542A) in the TA1 section of the p65 activation domain disrupts the interaction of this domain with the Kix domain of CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lecoq et al., 2017</xref>). However, this mutation also disrupts interactions with other critical transcriptional factor complexes, such as TFIIH, which might explain our inability to isolate HeLa cells with the p65AD mutants L449A/F473A/F542A.</p><p>To assess the existence of epigenetic bimodality directly, we exposed HeLa-AB1 cells to AM light of 25 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>for one day to induce large expression dispersion. We then sorted the mRuby-low and mRuby-high populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). We used the two cell populations and dark control cells to perform ChIP-seq assays for H3K27ac and mapped the reads to the whole genome sequence assembly of this HeLa-AB1 clone containing LightOn expression cassettes at nine loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). The reads from these loci were combined using the TSS as the reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We observe a H3K27ac peak spanning from the 5xUAS promoter (−200 bp) to the N-terminus of the mRuby gene. The signals for the mRuby-low and the dark control populations are essentially the same, whereas the signal for the mRuby-high population is about four times higher. These signals demonstrate that the mRuby-high population from intermediate light induction is in a more epigenetically active state than the mRuby-low and dark control populations. We also performed an ATAC-seq assay on the same cell populations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>, chromatin accessibility is higher in close vicinity to the TSS (approximately from −200 to +200 bp). The hierarchy of chromatin accessibility is mRuby-high, mRuby-low, and dark control, with less separation between the high and low populations than H3K27ac and a clear difference between mRuby-low and dark control. Hence H3K27ac is correlated with the LightOn gene expression state, consistent with a critical role of CBP/p300.</p><p>To observe the effect of PWM induction on chromatin accessibility, we performed a single-cell ATAC-seq analysis of the dynamic process of PWM-induced noise reduction. Specifically, we set up a PWM regimen with 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> maximum light, 600 min period, and 25% duty cycle (150 min ‘on’ time). We collected cells at six timepoints corresponding to different light cycle stages (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and sorted 384 tagged nuclei of each population for sequencing and analysis. The mean number of reads spanning −200 to +200 bp exhibited a gradual increase over each light induction cycle, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The single-cell reads for the six populations are plotted as heatmap images <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">in Figure 4C</xref>. As the opening and closing of chromatin is a dynamic process, we only observed approximately 30% of cells with reads at most. As expected, the fraction of cells with open chromatin was lowest for the dark control. Each cycle of ‘on’ light (150, 750, 1350 min) leads to more cells with detected reads. At the end of each ‘on-off’ cycle (600, 1200 min), the fraction of cells with detected reads did not go all the way down to the level of the dark control. To obtain quantitative measurements, we took the mean reads over 400 bp for each cell and calculated the means and CVs for all populations, which are plotted against time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>. The mean number of reads started at around 0.7, increased after each ‘on’ phase, and decreased to a lesser extent after each 'off' phase. The CV for the mean reads was initially at a high level of 3.8 (high noise of chromatin openness) but fell drastically to 2.6 following just 150 min of illumination. The CV increased after each further ‘off’ phase and decreased after each additional ‘on’ phase to a lesser extent. These data indicated that the basal (dark) chromatin openness is very heterogeneous and that exposure of cells to a short period (150 min) of 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> light initiated transcription and reduced the heterogeneity of chromatin openness. Further increases in the chromatin openness and reduction in heterogeneity occurred after each consequent ‘on’ phase. The cells also maintained part of their epigenetic ‘memory’ during each 'off' period. Therefore, PWM induced an incremental reduction in the variability and an increase in the mean level of chromatin accessibility in each cycle of ‘on’ and ‘off’ phases. The periodic fluctuations in chromatin accessibility did not directly translate into single-cell protein mRuby dynamics, which did not exhibit such periodic fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The protein dynamics data indicated that the mean expression level reached a plateau at around 2000 min for PWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l)</xref>. We postulate that chromatin openness will also eventually reach a plateau for both the ‘on’ and ‘off’ phases.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Single-cell ATAC-seq analysis of dynamic noise reductions for HeLa-AB1 cells with PWM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A dynamic PWM induction program was used to generate cells for single-cell ATAC-seq.

HeLa-AB2 cells, which exhibit PWM-induced noise reduction at 400 and 200 min period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B–C</xref>), were further stably transfected with the LightOn mRNA imaging circuit (plasmid C2, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to obtain HeLa-ABC2 cells. We used live-cell spinning disk confocal microscopy to image the single mRNAs. When multiple MCP-tdTomato molecules are bound to an mRNA containing 24 MS2 hairpins, they form a punctum with a diameter of around 500 nm above the background fluorescence (illustrated as single mRNA puncta in the two nuclei in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We plotted the single-cell mRNA counts for all the tracked cells against time as heatmap images for AM (100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>), PWM (100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 200 min, 25% duty cycle), and AM (25 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>, respectively. For quantitative analysis, the means (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and CVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) for single-nuclear mRNA numbers were plotted against time. For the AM with 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> (blue circles and line), the cells exhibited high variation at the beginning of the light-induction period that reduced over time, while the mean nuclear mRNA counts gradually increased and seemed to reach a high plateau after 1000 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, E–﻿F</xref>). For the AM with 25 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> (yellow circles and line), the cells exhibited more variation in mRNA numbers over time and a mean that approached a lower plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). These observations are consistent with the time course of flow cytometry analysis of mRuby protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I-J</xref>). For the PWM treatment, there is a clear pulsatile nuclear mRNA count with a period of 200 min, but the mean mRNA count appeared with a time delay of about 40 min after each ‘on’ time point, and as a population, these cells maintained a high mRNA count for the next 100 min or so before dropping down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,E</xref>). The variation in mRNA count was maintained at a more or less constant level that was intermediate between the levels for 25 and 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> AM light inductions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). There are also fewer cells without nuclear mRNA with PWM. Although sporadic nuclear mRNA counts might overshadow the periodicity of mRNA accumulation in the PWM case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), we observed oscillatory nuclear mRNA dynamics within the majority of cells by averaging over subpopulations of these cells with different mean RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

We did not observe periodic oscillation for the single-cell mRuby protein dynamics under PWM with 400 min duty cycle, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, probably due in part to the longer half-life of protein.</p><p>Technical challenges that limited this type of long-term statistical analysis of single-cell mRNA dynamics remain. When compared to spinning disk confocal microscopy, light-sheet microscopy could increase the signal-to-noise ratio of these images, improve the fidelity of single mRNA detection, and ensure that an adequate number of repeating images are captured before significant photobleaching. Cell motility prevents the tracking of a sufficient number of cells over a long period, as most of the cells moved out of the imaging field at some time points. Further development of light-sheet microscopy technology is needed to provide the capability to image a large number of large optical fields while maintaining sufficient optical and temporal resolutions over a long period.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Evidence of CBP/p300-induced heterogeneity in the regulation of endogenous genes</title><p>CBP/p300 is prominently implicated in regulating enhancer-dependent cell-type-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ogryzko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weinert et al., 2018</xref>). Compiled analysis of vast public ChIP-seq data from both human and mouse cell experiments suggests that there are more than 10,000 potential CBP/p300 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oki et al., 2018</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chip-atlas.org">https://chip-atlas.org</ext-link>). Most of the target genes have complex mechanisms for gene regulation that overshadow the effects of the potential positive feedback loop formed by the transcriptional and histone acetylation functions of CBP/p300. Nevertheless, dual-functional CBP/p300 could increase heterogeneity in the expression of a subset of endogenous genes. To test whether CBP/p300 could upregulate heterogeneity in endogenous gene expression, we used A-485 and LMK-235 to inhibit CBP/p300 and HDAC4/5 and to disrupt the potential for positive feedback. In mES cells, the master transcriptional factors Nanog, Oct4 (<italic>Pou5f1</italic>), and Sox2 recruit CBP/p300 to facilitate ES cell-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). mES cells that are cultured with LIF (but not with 2i cocktail) exhibit subpopulations with high and low expression levels of Rex1 (<italic>Zfp42</italic>) and Nanog, and with dynamic transitions between the two states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Toyooka et al., 2008</xref>). To test whether CBP/p300 could contribute to bistability in mES cells, we constructed a Rex1-GFP/Oct4-mCherry knock-in cell line of mES D3 cells. This line exhibited bimodal Rex1-GFP expression, with 97% high and 3% low subpopulations, and unimodal Oct4-mCherry expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). After treatment with LMK-235 and A-485 for two days, the expression of Rex1-GFP converged to an expression pattern centered between the high and low states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), similar to 5xUAS-mRuby expression in HeLa-AB1 cells treated with similar concentration of these inhibitors and AM light induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). Although the global inhibition of CBP/p300 may also indirectly affect Rex1 expression, these results suggest that CBP/p300 may contribute to gene regulation in mES cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Simultaneous inhibition of CBP/p300 and HDAC4/5 reduces heterogeneity in endogenous gene expression in mES D3 and HeLa cells.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) The density plots of Oct4-mCherry versus Rex1-GFP for a mouse ES D3 double knock-in cell line in regular mESC medium (<bold>A</bold>) or with the addition of 0.5 μM LMK-235 and 1 μM A-485 for two days (<bold>B</bold>).

HeLa-AB1 cells were treated with either LMK-235 or A-485 and blue light for two days (A + L) or with light only (control). The library construction, sequencing, and data acquisition processes are described in detail in the Materials and methods section. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, when the CV was plotted versus mean expression, most of the genes concentrated on a narrow band which could be fitted by a power function with an exponent of −0.48 (solid magenta line), similar to the predicted exponent of −0.5 of a Poisson distribution. Outlier genes that significantly deviated from this band (blue dots above the dashed red line) were further selected to assess the effects of A-485 and LMK-235. For the filtered gene set with lower CV values (less than two in control samples), there is a slight but statistically significant increase in mean CV from 1.30 to 1.45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> (magenta Pentastar) and E). On the other hand, for the filtered gene set with higher CV, there are many more genes for which large reductions in CV result from the inhibition of both CBP/p300 and HDAC4/5 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> (red triangles)). For these genes, the mean CV exhibits a large (3.49 to 2.55) and significant reduction in cells treated with the inhibitors. Within this set, genes that are targeted by CBP/p300 or by p65 show similar mean CV reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). There is much less deviation between the two biological repeats of control samples, especially for the high CV gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and F</xref>). The reduction in CV resulting from inhibition of both CBP/p300 and HDAC4/5 can be visualized with narrower plots and computed from unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts, without or with the SAVER denoising process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luecken and Theis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Similar phenomena were observed with F9-AB2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results provide the first indirect evidence that CBP/p300 positively contributes to noise in global gene expression, especially for genes in human and mouse cells that show highly heterogenous expression. It could also contribute to the heterogeneous expression states in embryonic stem cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Synthetic inducible gene expression systems have been developed to study the function of genes in various cellular and physiological processes. The widely used systems allow researchers to induce signals such as by doxycycline or light, and have a high dynamic range of expression. They are essentially based on the simplest form of gene regulation involving one transcriptional activator. Nevertheless, they often exhibit huge noise in gene expression, especially in mammalian cells (CV as high as 5–10, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The primary molecular mechanism that contributes to such a high level of noise has not been identified. In this study, we performed a quantitative characterization of gene expression noise in a light-induced expression circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) in human and mouse cells under AM and PWM light-induction regimes. We found that PWM light controls noise in a period-dependent manner, enabling a phenomenological approach for independent modulation of expression level and gene expression dispersion by manipulation of mean light intensity and PWM period. This approach would support more precise design of cell fate control studies. Hardwired negative feedback circuits could reduce gene expression noise in mammalian cells but cannot independently modulate noise and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guinn and Balázsi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nevozhay et al., 2013</xref>). A recent study involved a more complex synthetic circuit with two orthogonal inducible systems arranged in series. These two inducible systems had unmatched noise properties, and were able to control the mean expression and noise independently by using different concentration combinations of two inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonny et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The time scales of PWM noise reduction and epigenetic regulation by HDAC4 and CBP/p300 overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bintu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weinert et al., 2018</xref>), prompting us to propose a working model of the interplay between transcription and histone regulation. Our experimental system consists of a light-induced GAVPO dimer binding to a 5xUAS promoter in transiently open chromatin. The p65 activation domain of GAVPO recruits CBP/p300 to facilitate transcription initiation and histone acetylation. We propsose that the acetylated histones increase local chromatin accessibility and GAVPO binding. This postulated positive feedback loop is predicted to generate bimodal expression of genes under intermediate light induction. This mechanism was experimentally validated by disruption of expression bimodality using the selective inhibitor A485 to disrupt CBP/p300 HAT activity, specific disruption of GAVPO-CBP/p300 interaction by double point mutations in p65AD, and identification of low and high states of H3K27ac and of chromatin accessibility in the low and high expression cell populations. We further used single-cell ATAC-seq analysis and live-cell single mRNA imaging to illustrate the dynamic process of PWM noise reduction. scATAC-seq revealed that chromatin accessibility is highly variable in dark control conditions and was reduced after each cycle of light induction. Nevertheless, there was temporal fluctuation of the chromatin accessibility within each period. The noise level of single-cell nuclear mRNA counts for PWM remains lower than that for AM with intermediate light. Similar phenomena were observed at the protein level. In summary, PWM noise reduction by switching between the low and high states is established at the epigenetic level. The pulsatile chromatin accessibility and nuclear mRNA levels measured under PWM light induction were not detectable at the protein level, probably because the half-life of proteins are longer than those of mRNAs. Slow protein degradation might serve as a low-pass filter for mRNA oscillation and noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism that helps reduce temporal fluctuations might also limit the direct validation of bistability. Single-cell mRuby dynamics show that cells with similar GFP-GAVPO levels could reside in relatively stable high and low expression states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). The direct quantification of transitions between the high and low states is hindered by the long half-life and slow maturation time of mRuby proteins, and the limitation of the dynamic tracking length. We observed only minor hysteresis effects, probably for similar reasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,J</xref>). Future experiments with bright fluorescent proteins or luciferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suter et al., 2011</xref>) that have significantly shorter half-lives could provide better direct assessments of the dynamic properties of bistability. It is also possible that additional epigenetic modifiers and transcription-related factors might contribute to more complex dynamic properties.</p><p>In nonlinear dynamics, chaotic oscillations can be stabilized at their unstable steady states using either the OGY feedback control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ott et al., 1990</xref>) or periodical perturbations with specific frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1994</xref>). Recently, feedback and periodic control of aTc and IPTG were used to stabilize the unstable steady state in a genetic toggle switch in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lugagne et al., 2017</xref>). This particular scenario would lead to a decrease in mean gene expression with an increase in mean light intensity, illustrated as the black dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, a phenomenon never observed in our experiments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benzinger and Khammash, 2018</xref> have demonstrated noise reduction using PWM modulation of an EL222-based light-inducible gene expression system in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. They found that noise reduction is achieved by the PWM light working at the plateau regions of a single-valued sigmoidal active transcription factor to transcription response curve. In this scenario, transcriptional noise is mainly transferred from input noises, with bimodal expression being observed only with artificially inflated transcription factor heterogeneity in a non-isogenic cell population. Our PWM noise reduction mechanism is different. We found no sigmoidal GAVPO–mRuby response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>), and the noise level under AM induction was too high to be explained by Benzinger and Khammash's hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–H</xref>). In addition, a narrow GFP-GAVPO input (CV &lt;&lt;0.05) could still generate bimodal mRuby expression and large noise (CV ~1.7), indicating that variation in the concentration of a single transcriptional factor led to multiple transcriptional states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The T2A peptide linker ensured that tetR-GFP and GAVPO go through transcription and translation together but they may have separate post-translational processes. This might lead to different levels of noise. A recent study found that the intrinsic variations between two 2A peptide-linked fluorescent proteins are minimal in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quarton et al., 2020</xref>). A GFP–GAVPO fusion protein could provide direct quantitative analysis of the relation between GAVPO and mRuby, but it would reduce the activity of GAVPO and thus prevent sufficient mRuby expression for this study.</p><p>Our model suggests that the 5xUAS-mRuby at each locus has high and low expression states, and that the states at each locus are independent of each other. There are nine genomic insertion sites in HeLa-AB1 cells. The predicted nine high expression peaks are probably compounded into a broad ‘high’ peak, which is well separated from the ‘low’ peak, giving rise to an apparent overall bimodal distribution. Assuming that the nine sites have identical expression means and distributions at their ‘high’ and ‘low’ states, we emulated the combined mRuby expression distribution with increasing light intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The nine ‘high’ peaks formed an expanded peak and cannot be distinguished from each other due to the basal heterogeneity. The ‘high’ peaks are well-separated from the ‘low’ peak as the ratio of mRuby expression levels at the ‘high’ and ‘low’ states is sufficiently large. These emulated distributions are not so different from those of the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The sizes of the inserted segments are too long (&gt;2000 bp) to distinguish the epigenetic reads for each genomic insert in the current study. Further studies with newly developed single-cell epigenetic measurement techniques could help to assess this issue directly.</p><p>CBP/p300 proteins are reported to target large sets of genes and to regulate primarily enhancer-dependent cell-type-specific gene expression. We tested the consequences of potential disruption of this interaction on endogenous gene expression using both A485 and LMK-235. In a mES-D3 Rex1-GFP reporter cell line treated with both inhibitors, we found that the Rex1-high and Rex1-low subpopulations disappeared, resulting in the formation of a single population with intermediate Rex1 expression. In HeLa-AB1 cells, and to a lesser extent in F9-AB2 cells, scRNA-seq analysis suggested that the two inhibitors preferentially reduced the expression heterogeneity of high noise genes. These preliminary results indicate that the transcription-epigenetic interplay involving CBP/p300 could contribute to the highly heterogeneous expression of endogenous genes in mammalian cells.</p><p>In summary, we identified a transcription-epigenetic interplay involving p65AD and CBP/p300 that could lead to bimodal gene expression with high levels of noise. p65AD and VP16, which are used in most synthetic gene expression systems and in the regulation of many endogenous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gossen and Bujard, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gossen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khalil et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), are both reported to interact with CBP/p300 and other HATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerritsen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodman and Smolik, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). Abolishing this interaction could provide a general mechanism for the modulation of noise in gene expression in mammalian cells. CBP/p300 could also contribute to noise in the expression of some endogenous genes. We found that pulsed light induction with an extended period could reduce noise, presumably because it helps the cell to avoid staying in the bimodal regime. A picture of the dynamic process underlying this noise modulation, from chromatin accessibility to mRNA and protein levels, has been established using single-cell analysis. The noise reduction exhibits a dose-response to the period of PWM, which will enable independent modulation of mean gene expression and noise in future quantitative studies of cell-fate control.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p>Every version of the LightOn system is constructed with two plasmids: (1) an activator plasmid A coding for promoter-driven expression of the synthetic light-sensing transcriptional activator GAVPO, a fusion protein of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, an engineered light-sensing VVD domain and the p65AD activation domain; and (2) a response plasmid B containing the LightOn promoter (5xUAS)-driven reporter genes encoding fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Thus, single-cell tetR-GFP expression is a close approximation of GAVPO expression as these two genes are linked with a T2A peptide in HeLa-AB1 cells. At a specific AM light induction, the activated GAVPO concentration is estimated to be proportional to total GAVPO concentration in single cells and limited by the expression level of GAVPO. Therefore, single-cell tetR-GFP expression is a reasonable surrogate for single-cell active GAVPO concentration at a specific AM light condition. To estimate the empirical propagation function of GAVPO to mRuby, we extracted single-cell GFP and mRuby expression and sorted the cell population by rising GFP expression. The total population of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) was divided into 20 subpopulations with incremental mean GFP values and narrow ranges. An empirical function (red dashed line in the center panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) was fitted to the mean mRuby values vs. mean GFP values for the subpopulations (red circles in the center panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). A hypothetical propagation function with high cooperativity was formulated with a Hill function with a Hill coefficient of 8 (black dashed line in the center panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

Immediately before imaging, the medium was supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and the dish was placed on an Andor CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal microscope with a Hamamatsu Orca-Fusion sCMOS camera, Nikon 60X NA1.49 TIRF objective, and Metamorph software. The blue-light illumination was set up by inserting an Arduino-controlled shutter (Daheng Optics GCI-7103) and a blue band pass filter (Omega 465/40DF) in the light path of the bright field illumination. The bright field illumination was adjusted to a blue light spot of 7 mm diameter centered at the bottom of the 35 mm dish, with light intensities of 25 or 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Multiple XY positions within a 3 mm region were chosen, so that every cell in the optical field was always within the 7 mm blue illumination circle and the positions were separated enough to avoid overlapping in excitation and photobleaching. At each XY-position, 20 z-slices with a spacing of 0.5 μm were recorded with 200 ms exposure per slice. A Prior piezo-z stage was used to ensure z precision. Each XY position was imaged every 10 min for 1000 min at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. A 561 nm laser was chosen for excitation to ensure the detection of single mRNA punctae while minimizing photobleaching over 100 3-D imaging loops. A 617/73 emission filter was used to collect tdTomato fluorescence. The AM light of 100 or 25 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> or PWM with 200 min period, 25% on duty, and 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> max intensity was set up and started immediately before the start of the live-cell confocal imaging. The period of 200 min was chosen over 400 min to enable multiple cycles of light induction without significant photobleaching. This periodicity also significantly reduces noise over the AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B–C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Processing of single mRNA imaging</title><p>MCP-tdTomato-nuc fluorescence is mostly localized inside the nucleus, which enabled us to segment and track individual nuclei, and to detect mRNA in a single channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Each optical field was captured in a 4D XYZT image with 1300 pixels × 1900 pixels × 20 slices × 100 timepoints. With a camera pixel size of 6.5 μm, a 60X NA1.49 TIRF objective, thickness of 0.5 μm per z-slice, and 10 min imaging frequency, with each 4D image recorded 140 × 205 × 9.5 μm<sup>3</sup> over 1000 min. The cells moved significantly during this 1000 min period, and most of the nuclei moved outside of the imaging boundary at one time or another. To find all nuclei that stayed entirely inside the boundary, we performed nuclear segmentation and tracking before using Imaris 9.4 to identify and count mRNAs. The first step in this process is the generation of a z-axis maximum projection. A medium filter (window size = 5) and Laplacian of Gaussian filter (sigma = 40) were applied sequentially to projected XYT images, and a threshold was chosen to binarize the images and identify the centroids of the nuclei. Connected components were searched in these binary images over time to track the nuclei that remained inside the imaging boundary. In addition, for each z-projection image, using the identified nuclei centroids as seeds, a watershed algorithm was applied to find the ‘basin’ occupied by each cell at every time point. For all the tracked nuclei, the entire cell region was cropped from the original XYZT images based on its ‘basin’ at each time point, and re-centered to generate a 512 × 512 × 20 × 100 box. The nucleus was finally segmented using Otsu's algorithm in the cropped image. These XYZT images were normalized to the mean nuclear fluorescent intensity to compensate for MCP-tdTomato-nuc expression heterogeneity and possible photobleaching, as Imaris doesn't incorporate adaptive thresholding. The single mRNAs were identified using Imaris's spot model with an estimated x-y diameter of 0.54 μm and z diameter of 1.5 μm.

The cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a customized environmental chamber with blue-light illumination from the top. GFP (filter set: excitation FF01-485/20, emission FF01-525/30, dichroic Di01-R405/488/561/635; Semrock) and mRuby (filter set: excitation FF01-560/25, emission FF01-590/20, dichroic Di01-R405/488/561/635; Semrock) channels were imaged every 90 min using Nikon NIS software. The illumination nonuniformity was corrected by normalization against images of a well with media only. The nuclei of cells were segmented and binarized using the GFP images by searching for and filtering local maxima in the Gaussian blurred image as seeds, then applying the watershed algorithm to split individual cells. Each nucleus was extracted by thresholding with Otsu's algorithm in each split region. The tracking was carried out in a reverse time sequence. In any pair of temporally adjacent images, connected cells were identified by closest proximity within a minimal search range of 20 μm. The entire track for each cell was validated with the criteria of continuity in GFP expression (less than 30% relative change, except for cell division events) and manually inspected. For quantification, the local background signal (median signal of nearby 400 × 400 pixels that don't contain any nucleus) was subtracted from the signal of a segmented nucleus and the resulting signal was integrated. To represent continuous expression dynamics, we normalized single-cell expression dynamics with the cell-cycle state for that cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>).

One set was sequenced on the HiseqX system at HaploX Biotech, whereas the other was sequenced on the MGI2000 platform at BGI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Analysis of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data</title><p>Reads were preprocessed using the fastp 0.20.0 software, with the default setting and correct low-quality mismatched base pairs in overlapping regions of paired-end reads. The preprocessed reads were mapped to the single cloned cell line reference genome (HeLa-AB1) using bowite2 2.3.5.1. The alignments were preprocessed with samtools 1.9 and then deduplicated using the MarkDuplicates function of Picard 2.22.2. The deduplicated alignments were filtered using samtools 1.9 with SAM flag (-F 1804 f 2) to select reads mapped in the proper pair. These reads were filtered using custom bash code to remove the reads that were mapped to mitochondria. For population sequencing data, all sample filtered reads were processed using the multiBamSummary function of deeptools 3.4.2 to calculate the scale factor for each sample. The scale factor and filtered reads for each sample were processed using the bamCoverage function of deeptools 3.4.2 to calculate the normalized coverage track. For single-cell sequencing data, the filtered reads were processed using the bamCoverage function of deeptools 3.4.2 to calculate the coverage track. The coverage tracks were processed using custom python3 scripts to calculate the coverage around the TSS sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>scRNA-seq data analysis</title><p>The human and mouse mixed reference file was from the 10x genomics website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cf.10xgenomics.com">https://cf.10xgenomics.com</ext-link>/supp/cell-exp/refdata-cellranger-hg19-and-mm10-3.0.0.tar.gz). The coding region of vector CEG was added to the reference file, and a new reference was made using the mkref function of cellranger 3.1.0. The human and mouse mixed reads were processed by cellranger 3.1.0 to obtain the UMI count matrix. The matrix files were processed by R package scater 1.16.2 using the function quickPerCellQC with the default set to filter low-quality cells. The cells were identified as human cells if the total UMI counts mapped to the mouse genome were less than 0.01 times the total UMI counts mapped to the human genome. The cells were identified as mouse cells if the total UMI counts mapped to the human genome were less than 0.018 times the total UMI counts mapped to the mouse genome. The UMI counts were normalized by the library size. All of the following computations in this section were performed using MATLAB R2018b and associated toolboxes. Genes with mean counts under 1 CPM (counts per million) in any sample were neglected. Coefficients of variance (CV) and means for the remaining genes were computed for all three samples. The CV versus mean dot scatter plot was fitted to a power function (‘power1’) using the fit function. A cutoff line for identifying genes with CV outliers was defined as three σ above the fitted curve. The σ for each mean level was computed as the standard deviation of the CVs for the genes with a similar mean. The genes above this cutoff line (mean &gt;5 CPM and CV &gt;1.0), in any of the three samples, were filtered out for further analysis. The normalized count matrices from two control samples were pooled together as the control. If the CV of a gene was smaller than two in the control samples, it was grouped in the ‘low CV’ group. Otherwise, it was grouped in the ‘high CV’ group. Transcription factors (p300, CBP, and p65) for the target gene sets were identified from the ChIP-Atlas potential target genes with the option of ±1 kb distance from TSS. Genome assembly mm10 was selected as mouse reference in ChIP-Atlas. Genome assembly hg19 was chosen as a human reference in ChIP-Atlas. The UMI counts of filtered genes were processed by the R package saver 1.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2018</xref>) to obtain a smooth distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are described by the sample mean and standard deviation (SD).

sec-type="appendix"><title>Construction of a 24-well quantitative blue-light illumination device</title><p>To enable dynamic and quantitative modulation of blue-light induction with minimized cross-sample interference, we constructed a 24-channel blue LED illumination apparatus for the black-wall transparent bottom 24-well plate (24-well μ-Plate: Catalog no. 82406; ibidi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). The 1-watt blue CREE LED (465 nm) and matching acrylic lens were from Zhongshan Jieneng LED lighting (Zhongshan, China). The current-intensity curve for each LED was calibrated with a SANWA laser power meter LP1, then fitted with a smoothing spline curve function (caps) using the curve-fitting toolbox in MATLAB 2018b, and saved as a lookup curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). The metal frame was computer numerical control (CNC)-machined from aluminum alloy, sandblasted, and darkened. It was assembled with screws and springs to allow tight fitting to the μ-Plate, which prevents cross-contamination of light between wells and easy assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). A water-cooling system was used to maintain cell culture temperature at 37°C, independent of light intensity. A computer programmable 24-channel constant currents source (0–10 mA in 4096 steps) provided precise and independent control of currents for each LED. The control code was written in Python3 and modulated the currents at 1 Hz or slower. The light intensities at ‘dark’ were adjusted at the electric board to maintain them within 0.2 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>The design and construction of a 24-channel light illumination apparatus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The assembly includes (a) a 24-channel blue LED board with lens and top water-cooling plate, (b) a matching 24-channel light guide plate to prevent cross-interferences between wells, (c) the ibidi 24-well μ-plate, and (d) a bottom water-cooling plate.

This expands this general strategy from yeast to mammalian cells and provides a tool to study the functional consequences of expression variability in mammalian cells. The paper also reports an impressive amount of single-cell data on gene expression and chromatin state which suggest that variations in histone acetylation state contribute to the expression variability.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Quantitative Control of Noise in Mammalian Gene Expression by Dynamic Histone Regulations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper offers two main results:</p><p>(1) proposed model of bistability via CBP/p300 positive feedback</p><p>(2) reducing bimodality via PWM of light.</p><p>Result #2 is new for the mammalian system but has previously been shown in yeast. Result #1 requires additional data to be shown conclusively.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The proposed model has weaknesses that need to be addressed: (i) the model is conceptually not clear enough, (ii) the corresponding mathematical model is not calibrated with experimental data, (iii) some of the existing data seem to contradict the model, (iv) the model needs to be more thoroughly tested.</p><p>(i) Conceptual consistency and clarity should be improved: in a deterministic setting, bistability in positive feedback loops is well-defined, but the effect of PWM would be a stabilization of an unstable steady-state, as in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01498-0. In the stochastic setting, stochastic promoter switching would be sufficient, and bistability is ill-defined, as demonstrated in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05882-2#Sec25. Positive feedback via histone modifications could be consistent with either scenario, and depends on the experimental evidence for alternate, deterministically stable steady states. The experimental data in Figures 1D and 3D only weakly support the notion of 'low' and 'high' alternate states (especially because protein abundances are bounded from below and potentially also from above due to general expression capacity or simply applied input ranges), compared to the simulated data in Figure 2F. More direct evidence for bistability would be given by experiments that demonstrate hysteresis, which should be considered-see (iv).</p><p>(ii) The ODE model presented is not calibrated with experimental data and therefore of limited value for data interpretation. The authors should either (1) de-emphasize the mathematical model, acknowledging its limitations, or (2) include a calibrated mathematical model-for example, using a stochastic model as in Benzinger and Khammash. The inclusion of multiple reporters (see iii) would be a benefit. The authors could fit to their flow/genomic data to obtain further insights into how/why PWM of light suppresses noise. The current model represents cell-to-cell variability by cell-specific parametrization, and hence only contains extrinsic noise components.</p><p>(iii) Multiple copies of GAVPO-mRuby reporter in HeLa-AB1 strain and the measured bimodal response suggest that the current model is wrong. According to the authors' proposed model, each integrated GAVPO reporter gene (mRuby) should be independently bistable because local GAVPO binding and chromatin modifications regulate mRuby expression in cis. Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows that there are 9 copies of GAVPO-mRuby plasmid B1 integrated at different locations in HeLa-AB1 strain. Thus, at intermediate AM light intensity, the mRuby gene expression should be deca-modal (10 modes), not bimodal (as shown in Figures 1 – 2). Something seems inconsistent between the local chromatin positive feedback model and the observed data.</p><p>The mathematical model used to validate the observations does not model the total expression from 9 independent promoters, which is a critical omission given the cis-nature of the positive feedback loop. The fact that these 9 promoters generate 2 peaks at intermediate light intensity suggests that the GAVPO bistability likely originates from a trans-effect, i.e., either all 9 promoters are OFF or all 9 promoters are ON, not a cis-effect.</p><p>In addition, from Figure 1—figure supplement 2G, it appears that when cells are exposed to light, it is mostly the cells containing a higher amount of GFP-GAVPO that switch into the mRuby ON state. Is it possible that the bistability simply comes from the dimerization event caused by light?</p><p>(iv) A bimodal response is consistent with bistability, but it does not prove bistability. To unambiguously show bistability, the authors should (1) measure and show dynamic signatures of bistability (e.g., hysteresis and/or following single cell dynamics to prove signature of two stable basins of attraction with transitions at some threshold GAVPO concentration) and (2) test their proposed model with precise, mechanistic mutations. The most compelling evidence in favor of their model is the use of the A-485 inhibitor of HAT activity of p300/CBP (i.e., prevent positive feedback loop) to convert the bimodal profile into a unimodal and graded profile. However, this is a crude perturbation because A-485 likely affects the expression of many genes, including any cis- and trans-factors that affect mRuby gene expression. Mutations specific to GAVPO and mRuby promoter that destroy positive feedback would be the cleanest perturbation.</p><p>Suggestions:</p><p>1. Replace the p65A activation domain with mutants that activate transcription by recruiting RNA Pol II but which cannot recruit CBP/p300 and modify histones, e.g. &quot;Minimal activators that bind to the KIX domain of p300/CBP identified by phage display screening&quot;, Frangioni et al., Nature Biotechnology (2000). If such p65A mutants don't exist, there are VP16 activation domains that can separate p300/CBP-recruiting versus TFII-recruiting functions, e.g. &quot;The H1 and H2 regions of the activation domain of herpes simplex virion protein 16 stimulate transcription through distinct molecular mechanisms, Ikeda et al., Genes to Cells (2002). Prediction: If p300/CBP recruitment is essential for positive feedback, then you will no longer see a bistable response. If you see bistability, then an alternative should be considered more seriously.</p><p>2. Use a monomeric transcription factor regulated by a chemical (e.g. Zinc-finger-ER-p65) and engineer a mRuby promoter with a single binding site. Prediction: This system should exhibit bistable mRuby response at intermediate hormone concentrations, if your model is correct. NOTE: The authors already use an rtTA doxycycline-inducible system in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, which has VP16 activation domain, and exhibits a bimodal distribution at intermediate doxycycline concentrations. The authors could modify VP16 to abolish p300/CBP recruitment of the rtTA construct.</p><p>2) In its current form, Figure 5 does not convincingly show that PWM reduces noise:</p><p>(i) In Panel E, at time 0 (no light induction), AM 100 uW, 25 uW and PWM start at different CV values. It is unclear why this is the case especially since this is not observed in the mRuby CV. This needs to be addressed.</p><p>(ii) The authors should add a panel to Figure 5 showing the mean mRNA levels for the three respective cases, AM 100 uW, 25 uW and PWM 200m.</p><p>(iii) A discussion should be included about the large number of cells showing almost no mRNA for AM 25 uW and PWM 200m, does this means that there are cells trapped in the off state, and how do these cells impact the CV calculations?</p><p>(iv) Since the pulsatile behavior appears in ~15% of the cells (Figure 5C), how does the CV time course behave if CV is only calculated for these cells exhibiting pulsatile behavior.</p><p>3) Figure 1E/F and around line 120: The argument of 'limited noise of GFP-GAVPO' requires more details, namely a quantitative analysis of this noise and the effects of noise propagation – the current analysis focuses on relations between means and it is not clear what the effect of GAVPO expression noise on mRuby noise is. In addition, TetR-GFP-nuc may not accurately reflect GAVPO noise if the stabilities of the two proteins are different.</p><p>4) TetR-noise reducing circuit (or Plasmid A1). The design or purpose of this plasmid is a little confusing. The TetR-GFP-nuc synthetic transcription factor binds to its CMV promoter to repress its own transcription (negative feedback loop). This should repress mean gene expression and &quot;squeeze&quot; the expression variance about the mean (ref: Becskei et al., Nature 2000), i.e. noise reducing. However, the authors added doxycycline one day before the start of light induction and then maintained it throughout the experiment. This would destroy the negative feedback loop and, thus, increase the TetR and GAVPO mean and variance back to unrepressed CMV promoter levels. Are the authors using this circuit to keep TetR and GAVPO low until the start of the experiment (conditional expression) or are the authors using this circuit to reduce variance in TetR and GAVPO levels (noise-reduction)? Please clarify how and why you are using this circuit.</p><p>5) Although not essential in a revised manuscript, testing systems beyond light-regulated GAVPO would strengthen the generality of the authors' conclusions. The good news is that their rtTA system (which has a VP16 trans-activation domain that recruits both p300/CBP and RNA Poll II) exhibits bimodal distribution at intermediate concentrations of doxycycline (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), so they have a different system, strains, and preliminary results to test the generality of their model.</p><p>Presentation:</p><p>6) The text requires thorough language editing throughout. Widespread grammatical mistakes-in particular on verb tense and singular/plural-make it difficult to follow the arguments.</p><p>7) If the authors decide to include a calibrated mathematical model, the model should be more clearly described in the main text (not only in the Supplementary Material).</p><p>8) A brief description of how the light inducible GAVPO system works would be helpful either in the introduction or the beginning of the Results section. Perhaps adding Figure 1—figure supplement 1 to Figure 1.</p><p>9) Please add a schematic in Figure 1 or the supplement that clearly illustrates how the light is pulsed (i.e., duration of on time and off time), the light intensity used per pulse, and the mean light intensity. Something similar to Figure 4 D-E, yet for all period lengths.</p><p>10) Please explain and/or motivate the use of different PWM regimes to provide evidence for different aspects of the work, e.g., line 137 400min period, line 261 600min, line 296, 200min).</p><p>11) Figure 2—figure supplement 1 is a confusing figure because it makes two different points. The first half (A-F) shows that LMK-235 has a minor impact on noise reduction. The second half (G-L) shows that a different strain F9-AB2 shows identical signatures to the HeLa-AB1 strain, i.e. bimodality at intermediate levels of AM light, which is reduced to unimodal by FM light. Perhaps split these data into separate supplementary figures? In lines 205 – 207, these data are referred to as &quot;figure supplement 2&quot;.</p><p>12) In mouse embryonic stem cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), there is only a clear noise reduction effect with 200 and 400 minutes, yet for these there is also a decrease in mean GFP levels. Therefore, the ability to modulate noise independent of mean seems not to hold in mouse embryonic stem cells. Please state this more clearly (text lines 149-154).</p><p>13) Please provide more detailed explanations of the somewhat puzzling chromatin state dynamics in Figure 4 where a longer-term drift (denoted as epigenetic 'memory') is apparent. How do these dynamics relate to the data presented in Figure 1 (the Methods seem to suggest a measurement time at 48h, but this is not specified in the captions).</p><p>14) The title 'RNA dynamics flattens PWM-induced pulsatile chromatin opening' implies an influence of RNA dynamics on chromatin state, which is not plausible given the construction of the synthetic system (the mRNA does not encode a protein that could modify chromatin state) and the postulated model (positive feedback is established via TF binding, not mRNA expression). mRNA dynamics will impact protein dynamics, and the title and text should reflect this aspect.</p><p>15) Figure 2B and Line 943: If there are only 4 data points from 4 independent experiments, why not show them rather than summarize their statistics with a box-whisker plot?</p><p>16) Line 303/Figure 5C: The export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which is mentioned in the text, is not shown in the figure that is cited.</p><p>17) Line 248: cite Figure 3H in addition to Figure 3—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>18) Please write out &quot;min&quot; instead of &quot;m&quot; for the pulse periods in the figure legends.</p><p>19) Prior work on the use of PWM and available explanations for its noise-reducing effect should be mentioned and discussed more explicitly.</p><p>20) A publication that came out recently and also describes independent control of mean expression and variability could be cited: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20467-8.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Quantitative Control of Noise in Mammalian Gene Expression by Dynamic Histone Regulations&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Details on methods are missing (and should be provided), but clearly the mRuby monomodal distribution for the empirical transfer function does not match (approximately) the distribution for AM, 20\muW/cm<sup>2</sup> in Figure 1F and it is unclear if it does so for the mRuby marginal in Figure 1G (the raw data for this panel is not available), as would be expected. Furthermore, it is unclear, how the predicted mRuby marginal for high cooperativity was obtained. Very approximate simulations for both scenarios (Matlab code below) rather indicate the opposite of the authors' conclusions when compared to data in Figure 1F,G.</p><p>Matlab code on point (1):</p><p>%% cooperativity simulations (x: GAVPO, y: mRuby)</p><p>ns = 1e4;</p><p>d0 = table2array(readtable('88763_1_data_set_2024261_qtg66v.xlsx','sheet','Fig1H-3','range','a2:b122'));</p><p>cdf = cumsum(d0(:,2));</p><p>[~,idx] = unique(cdf);</p><p>x = interp1(cdf(idx),d0(idx,1),rand(ns,1));</p><p>% loop: cooperativity</p><p>hill = {@(x,k,n) 3 + 1*(x-4.5);.…</p><p>@(x,k,n) 3 + 2*x.^n./(k.^n+x.^n)};</p><p>n = 70;</p><p>k = 5.7;</p><p>figure();</p><p>for z = 1:length(hill)</p><p>subplot(3,2,z)</p><p>xi = linspace(4.5,6.5,100);</p><p>plot(xi,hill{z}(xi,k,n));</p><p>subplot(3,2,z+2)</p><p>y = hill{z}(x,k,n) +.25*randn(size(x));</p><p>ksdensity([x,y]);</p><p>view(2);</p><p>axis([4.5 6.5 2 6])</p><p>subplot(3,2,z+4);</p><p>histogram(y,'Normalization','pdf');</p><p>hold on;</p><p>histogram(x,'Normalization','pdf');</p><p>end</p><p>(2) Figure 2 aims to demonstrate bistability and hysteresis as proposed by the ODE model via single-cell time lapse microscopy (2F-H) and FACS (2I,J). The single-cell trajectories in Figure 2G, however, do not represent the population distribution. They were selected according to 'low' or 'high' mRuby signal at 24h; the data only demonstrates the dynamics for reaching the target state, and not bistability. For experiments demonstrating hysteresis, in the regime of bistability, one would expect distinct (bimodal under noise) distributions close to the 'low' or 'high' starting state. This is clearly not the case given the data in Figure 2I,J. The slight shift to higher mRuby in the intermediary regime (10-25 light intensity) used as an argument for hysteresis in the manuscript can be easily explained by the population not being in steady-state because the distribution for the predicted monostable 0 light input case is right-shifted by prior stimulation as well.</p><p>In brief, the single-cell experiments (Figure 2F-H) show a bimodal induction response. The OFF cells stay OFF and the ON cells stay ON. It would have been more convincing to see an induced ON cell stochastically cross a threshold and then return to the OFF state. Or the authors could have started with a fully induced population (100% ON with 100 uW/cm<sup>2</sup> induction) then put at intermediate light and filmed single cells. The expectation would be that a fraction of the cells crosses the threshold and goes to the stable OFF state. Alternatively, the authors could have sorted ON and OFF cells, and then measured the time evolution of mRuby/mCardinal distribution of the OFF population and ON population.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65654.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper offers two main results:</p><p>(1) proposed model of bistability via CBP/p300 positive feedback</p><p>(2) reducing bimodality via PWM of light.</p><p>Result #2 is new for the mammalian system but has previously been shown in yeast.

In the stochastic setting, stochastic promoter switching would be sufficient, and bistability is ill-defined, as demonstrated in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05882-2#Sec25. Positive feedback via histone modifications could be consistent with either scenario, and depends on the experimental evidence for alternate, deterministically stable steady states. The experimental data in Figures 1D and 3D only weakly support the notion of 'low' and 'high' alternate states (especially because protein abundances are bounded from below and potentially also from above due to general expression capacity or simply applied input ranges), compared to the simulated data in Figure 2F. More direct evidence for bistability would be given by experiments that demonstrate hysteresis, which should be considered-see (iv).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the insights. We need to make a more explicit description of the concept of our model (Figure 2D). In addition to adding a separate paragraph in the Discussion section (Line 517-538 in the revised manuscript), we also performed additional experiments suggested in point (iv) to direct validate the properties of bistability, which we will describe later in this letter. The concept of stabilized unstable steady states was explicitly developed in control chaos in physical systems, exemplified with the famous OGY theory <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.64.1196">https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.64.1196</ext-link>. Their motivation was to feedback control chaos with small perturbation in the systems. Non-feedback control with small periodic perturbation has also been shown to control chaos by stabilizing unstable steady state, as in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.72.96">https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.72.96</ext-link>. The periodic control work in <italic>E. coli</italic> to stabilize an unstable steady state could be considered as an extension of these concepts in complex biological systems. In addition, the location of unstable steady state in a bistable system would decrease with increasing light intensity, as shown in the black dashed line in Figure 2E, inconsistent with our result that the mean mRuby is monotonically correlated with the mean light intensity (Figure 1C).</p><p>It is correct that the hypothesis proposed by Benzinger and Khammash in the yeast paper that the cooperative TF-gene expression curve is sufficient to generate bimodal distribution with high variable TF distribution, shown in Figure 1G. But it is not the case in our study. In our experiment, GAVPO and mRuby expression do not exhibit clear cooperativity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) The ODE model presented is not calibrated with experimental data and therefore of limited value for data interpretation. The authors should either (1) de-emphasize the mathematical model, acknowledging its limitations, or (2) include a calibrated mathematical model-for example, using a stochastic model as in Benzinger and Khammash. The inclusion of multiple reporters (see iii) would be a benefit. The authors could fit to their flow/genomic data to obtain further insights into how/why PWM of light suppresses noise. The current model represents cell-to-cell variability by cell-specific parametrization, and hence only contains extrinsic noise components.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for point out the limitations of our deterministic ODE model, including not able to simulate the accurate heterogeneous distributions with intrinsic noise. We also could simulate the nine insertions of 5xUAS-mRuby independently. Our main intention is to use it to find out if inhibition of HAT could reduce noise. It is validated with experiments. We have built a stochastic model containing all the processes in our ODE model, and have written the code to simulate using a stochastic simulation algorithm similar to the yeast paper, and performed a good deal of optimization. Unfortunately, it would be computationally prohibitive expensive for us to carry it out with current resources. To compare with the AM and 400 min PWM data, including the distributions and noises, we need to simulate 1000 cells for 48 hours. For one set of parameters, it took 100 CPU seconds to simulate the AM and 400 min PWM conditions. To ensure finding the “global minimum” in fitting to experimental data, using the parallel tempering Monte-Carlo method (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19810318/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19810318/</ext-link>), it would take in the vicinity of hundreds of thousands of node-hours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iii) Multiple copies of GAVPO-mRuby reporter in HeLa-AB1 strain and the measured bimodal response suggest that the current model is wrong. According to the authors' proposed model, each integrated GAVPO reporter gene (mRuby) should be independently bistable because local GAVPO binding and chromatin modifications regulate mRuby expression in cis. Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows that there are 9 copies of GAVPO-mRuby plasmid B1 integrated at different locations in HeLa-AB1 strain. Thus, at intermediate AM light intensity, the mRuby gene expression should be deca-modal (10 modes), not bimodal (as shown in Figures 1 – 2). Something seems inconsistent between the local chromatin positive feedback model and the observed data.</p><p>The mathematical model used to validate the observations does not model the total expression from 9 independent promoters, which is a critical omission given the cis-nature of the positive feedback loop. The fact that these 9 promoters generate 2 peaks at intermediate light intensity suggests that the GAVPO bistability likely originates from a trans-effect, i.e., either all 9 promoters are OFF or all 9 promoters are ON, not a cis-effect.</p><p>In addition, from Figure —figure supplement 2G, it appears that when cells are exposed to light, it is mostly the cells containing a higher amount of GFP-GAVPO that switch into the mRuby ON state. Is it possible that the bistability simply comes from the dimerization event caused by light?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for point out this critical insight. According to our model, for the HeLa-AB1 cell with nine insertions of 5xUAS-mRuby, theoretically, we should expect 9 ”on “ peaks and 1 “low” peak in the mRuby distribution. We suspect that multiple “high” peaks were convoluted into a large expanded peak due to variable expression of the “high” state at each site. This convoluted “high” peak exhibit a gradual shift to the right with increasing light intensity, visible in Figure 1F, Figure 2I-J, and Figure 1—figure supplement 4A. We use a simple emulation to illustrate the effect, shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, assuming the expression levels and variability (CV=0.47) of each site are identical at the “high” states and ignore the stochastic transition between on and off states. If the CVs for each site were reduced to 0.35, we could start to observe multiple “high” peaks, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. In this entire study, the lowest CV with any reporter fluorescent protein is about 0.4. In addition, we generate three clones with ~3, ~5, and ~11 copies of 5xUAS-mCardinal insertions using the HeLa-AB1 cell line. They also exhibit similar mCardinal distributions under increase AM light inductions (Figure 1—figure supplement 4), which is consistent with our model. We add a separate paragraph in the discussion session to clear up this puzzle (Line 539-551 in the revised manuscript).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Emulation of combinations of ‘high’ states at multiple sites.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65654-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We calculated the mean GFP-mRuby response curves, there are fitted well to power functions with approximately mRuby~GFP<sup>1.8</sup> and don't look like a sigmoid curve that reaches a plateau (i.e., shown in Figure 1G and Figure 2C). The log-log flow cytometry plots are misleading because they suppressed the difference in mRuby, make them look like they plateaued at low and high ends of GFP. The light intensities are apparently not close to inducing saturated dimerization in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iv) A bimodal response is consistent with bistability, but it does not prove bistability. To unambiguously show bistability, the authors should (1) measure and show dynamic signatures of bistability (e.g., hysteresis and/or following single cell dynamics to prove signature of two stable basins of attraction with transitions at some threshold GAVPO concentration) and (2) test their proposed model with precise, mechanistic mutations. The most compelling evidence in favor of their model is the use of the A-485 inhibitor of HAT activity of p300/CBP (i.e., prevent positive feedback loop) to convert the bimodal profile into a unimodal and graded profile. However, this is a crude perturbation because A-485 likely affects the expression of many genes, including any cis- and trans-factors that affect mRuby gene expression. Mutations specific to GAVPO and mRuby promoter that destroy positive feedback would be the cleanest perturbation.</p><p>Suggestions:</p><p>1. Replace the p65A activation domain with mutants that activate transcription by recruiting RNA Pol II but which cannot recruit CBP/p300 and modify histones, e.g. &quot;Minimal activators that bind to the KIX domain of p300/CBP identified by phage display screening&quot;, Frangioni et al., Nature Biotechnology (2000). If such p65A mutants don't exist, there are VP16 activation domains that can separate p300/CBP-recruiting versus TFII-recruiting functions, e.g. &quot;The H1 and H2 regions of the activation domain of herpes simplex virion protein 16 stimulate transcription through distinct molecular mechanisms, Ikeda et al., Genes to Cells (2002). Prediction: If p300/CBP recruitment is essential for positive feedback, then you will no longer see a bistable response. If you see bistability, then an alternative should be considered more seriously.</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate the constructive suggestions on this and the following specific experiments. We performed single-cell mRuby dynamics experiments. The results (Figure 2F-G) validate the biostability model with relative stable “high” and “low” mRuby expression states and low probabilities of stochastic transition between the states. We chose the cells within a narrow range (all cells within 2-folds of GFP-GAVPO) and indistinguishable between the “high” and “low” cells (Figure 2H). We further validate the hysteresis by adding another 5xUAS-mCardinal-PEST reporter to HeLa-AB1 cells to increase its temporal sensitivity with a destabilized mCardinal. The cells were either treat with 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> for 8 hours to tilt the 5xUAS local histone acetylation toward &quot;open&quot; states before the 48-hour AM light induction experiment. The control experiment would be kept the cells in the dark before the 48-hour experiments. As predicted with hysteresis, both the mRuby and mCardinal distributions for intermediate light intensities were tilted toward the &quot;open&quot; peak with the prior 100 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> AM light treatment (Figure 2I-J).</p><p>The GAVPO only contains the activation domains of the p65 (a.k.a. relA). There are two papers that provide direct biophysical measurements of the effects of point mutations on p65AD on interactions with CBP. We generate two point-mutations, L449A/F473A, in the TA2 section on GAVPO according to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001647">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001647</ext-link>. Bimodal distribution disappeared with a new HeLa cell line constructed with this GAVPO mutant (Figure 3G-H), as predicted with GAVPO-CBP/p300 positive feedback loop. Additional mutation F542A on the TA1 section also disrupts its binding to other critical transcriptional factor complexes such as TFIIH, according to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/9/5564/3057346">https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/9/5564/3057346</ext-link>. This might explain the inability to isolate HeLa cell clones with triple mutation L449A/F473A/F542A in GAVPO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Use a monomeric transcription factor regulated by a chemical (e.g. Zinc-finger-ER-p65) and engineer a mRuby promoter with a single binding site. Prediction: This system should exhibit bistable mRuby response at intermediate hormone concentrations, if your model is correct. NOTE: The authors already use an rtTA doxycycline-inducible system in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, which has VP16 activation domain, and exhibits a bimodal distribution at intermediate doxycycline concentrations. The authors could modify VP16 to abolish p300/CBP recruitment of the rtTA construct.</p></disp-quote><p>To compare with vast data in the paper, instead of test mutation with VP16, we decided to replace the VP16 in the rtTA transactivator of the tetON system with p65AD. It also exhibits distribution with increasing doxycycline concentrations (Figure 1—figure supplement 4C), similar to LightOn cells with increase light inductions. When we reduce the tetO number from seven to one, we really appreciate the constructive suggestions on this and following specific experiments. The folds of induction (dynamic range) were reduced from 200 to 6, too low to define the existence of bistability clearly. Further studies with new developments in single-cell ChIP-seq with better coverage could help directly assess this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In its current form, Figure 5 does not convincingly show that PWM reduces noise:</p><p>(i) In Panel E, at time 0 (no light induction), AM 100 uW, 25 uW and PWM start at different CV values. It is unclear why this is the case especially since this is not observed in the mRuby CV. This needs to be addressed.</p><p>(ii) The authors should add a panel to Figure 5 showing the mean mRNA levels for the three respective cases, AM 100 uW, 25 uW and PWM 200m.</p><p>(iii) A discussion should be included about the large number of cells showing almost no mRNA for AM 25 uW and PWM 200m, does this means that there are cells trapped in the off state, and how do these cells impact the CV calculations?</p><p>(iv) Since the pulsatile behavior appears in ~15% of the cells (Figure 5C), how does the CV time course behave if CV is only calculated for these cells exhibiting pulsatile behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion. We realize that “the “off” and “on” epigenetic states” should be changed to “the “low” and “high” epigenetic states” in Line 127 of the original manuscripts, in consistent with the experimental measurement of H3K27ac (Figure 3J).</p><p>(i) The setting up of cells for the multi-positional live-cell imaging on spinning disk confocal requires multiple moving, adjustment, and checking. The room hosted another confocal microscopy that is also heavily used. Although we paid extra attention, it is tough to ensure the cells were absolute not exposed to ambient light before the experiment. A small fraction of cells might have sporadic nuclear mRNA detected at the beginning, which would influence CV calculation when most of the cells don't have nuclear mRNA. We repeated two experiments with AM 25 mW since the original ones were possibly more influenced by ambient light before the experiment.</p><p>(ii) We added a panel with mean mRNA levels of the three respective cases, as in Figure 5E.</p><p>(iii) The original linear scale plot in Figure 5B-D didn't represent well the true mRNA distribution. The percentage of cells don't have detected nuclear mRNA during the 1000 min are 8%, 20%, and 0.6% for AM 100 mW, 25 mW, and PWM 200 min, respectively. We change the plots to the nature logarithm scale to better represent the distribution of detected mRNA. The number of MCP-tdTomato bound to each mRNA is most likely not identical. Take into consideration of other detection variations. There will be a fraction of nuclear mRNA that failed to be detected in our experiments. We don't have access to better methods at this moment, and the leading labs that developed this technology also use similar spinning disk confocal microscopy. Lightsheet microscopy could increase the signal-noise ratio of these images and improve the detection efficiency. Unfortunately, we don't have access to such microscopy that can track a large number of cells, which is necessary because most of the cells would be out of bound at one time or another due to cell motility. We recently learned a newly developed smFISH method that could be adapted for live cells, but the details are not available at this time. Much more cells need to be analyzed to identify the threshold of “low” and “high” states with nuclear mRNA counts alone. The challenges are detection efficiency and cell motility. The single nuclear mRNA assay RNA The CV calculation is not sensitive to cells with zero mRNA unless the extreme scenario that almost all cells have no mRNA and a few cells with many mRNAs, which would skew the CV value. Our data weren’t the case.</p><p>(iv) With the data presented in logarithm scale, we can notice that many cells exhibit pulsatile behavior (Figure 5C). This can be further visualized with averaging over subpopulations of cells. As shown in Figure 5G in the revised manuscript., there are approximated 57% of cells show oscillations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1E/F and around line 120: The argument of 'limited noise of GFP-GAVPO' requires more details, namely a quantitative analysis of this noise and the effects of noise propagation – the current analysis focuses on relations between means and it is not clear what the effect of GAVPO expression noise on mRuby noise is. In addition, TetR-GFP-nuc may not accurately reflect GAVPO noise if the stabilities of the two proteins are different.</p></disp-quote><p>A revised analysis with quantitative analysis is presented in Line 125-137 of the revised manuscript. In Benzinger and Khammash’s model, the mapping from transcriptional factor concentration to gene expression follows a sigmoidal function, but not experimentally presented (Figure 3D in Benzinger and Khammash, 2018). We calculated the mapping curve of GFP-mRuby in AM with 25 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> light, defined by their model (red line in the center panel of Figure 1H). We agree that the TetR-GFP might not accurately reflect GAVPO noise. We would like to have GFP-GAVPO fusion protein. However, the GAVPO with the current setting would need to be maximum expressed to ensure sufficient mRuby expression at intermediate light. The interference of GAVPO function with fusion protein would be critical for the experiments. If only the static rates of degradation are different and assuming linear degradation process, the TetR-GFP and GAVPO would be well-correlated. The mRNA (small number, influenced by epigenetics, transcriptional bursting, etc.) is more critical for gene expression heterogeneity than protein with an abundant number.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) TetR-noise reducing circuit (or Plasmid A1). The design or purpose of this plasmid is a little confusing. The TetR-GFP-nuc synthetic transcription factor binds to its CMV promoter to repress its own transcription (negative feedback loop). This should repress mean gene expression and &quot;squeeze&quot; the expression variance about the mean (ref: Becskei et al., Nature 2000), i.e. noise reducing. However, the authors added doxycycline one day before the start of light induction and then maintained it throughout the experiment. This would destroy the negative feedback loop and, thus, increase the TetR and GAVPO mean and variance back to unrepressed CMV promoter levels. Are the authors using this circuit to keep TetR and GAVPO low until the start of the experiment (conditional expression) or are the authors using this circuit to reduce variance in TetR and GAVPO levels (noise-reduction)? Please clarify how and why you are using this circuit.</p></disp-quote><p>The TetR-noise reduction circuit was initially chosen to tuning GAVPO expression while maintaining a low noise. During the construction of cell lines, we found that comparing to CAG-GAVPO (plasmid A2), this circuit struggled to provide sufficient GAVPO unless it is maximumly induced, probably due to the addition of TetR-GFP-T2A to the 5' side reduced GAVPO expression level. Therefore, in all experiments, we use 1 mg/mL dox. A sentence was added to lines 110-111 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Although not essential in a revised manuscript, testing systems beyond light-regulated GAVPO would strengthen the generality of the authors' conclusions. The good news is that their rtTA system (which has a VP16 trans-activation domain that recruits both p300/CBP and RNA Poll II) exhibits bimodal distribution at intermediate concentrations of doxycycline (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), so they have a different system, strains, and preliminary results to test the generality of their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your suggestion. Unfortunately, we had performed all the additional experiments suggested earlier. Most of them involve the construction of new plasmids and generate new cell lines and analysis, and with limited human resources at disposal. We didn’t have a chance to test this idea and would love to do it in the next project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Presentation:</p><p>6) The text requires thorough language editing throughout.

The choice of 600 min PWM in scATC-seq experiment (line 354 in the revised manuscript) is due to the limited sample number and resources available while cover approximately one day (1350 min) of the experiment. This choice is a compromise between data points and resource limitation. So it is not explained in the manuscript. The choice for 200 min PWM in mRNA imaging experiment (Line 392 in the revised manuscript) is to help recognize periodicity in mRNA dynamics with more repeats while still exhibit noise reduction at protein level (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B). Due to the photobleaching of tdTomato, we can only take 100 3D imaging stacks for each cell. With a choice of 10 min intervals for the temporal resolution, we can only perform live-cell mRNA imaging for 1000 min. 1000 min only ensures two cycles of 400min PWM, not enough to assure recognition of periodicity. It would cover five cycles of 200 min PWM. The explanation is added to lines 410-412 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 2—figure supplement 1 is a confusing figure because it makes two different points. The first half (A-F) shows that LMK-235 has a minor impact on noise reduction. The second half (G-L) shows that a different strain F9-AB2 shows identical signatures to the HeLa-AB1 strain, i.e. bimodality at intermediate levels of AM light, which is reduced to unimodal by FM light.

The protein dynamics data (Figure 1I in the revised manuscript) indicates that the mean expression level reaches a plateau at around 2000 min for PWM. So we postulate that the chromatin openness will also reach plateaus for both “on” and “off” phase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The title 'RNA dynamics flattens PWM-induced pulsatile chromatin opening' implies an influence of RNA dynamics on chromatin state, which is not plausible given the construction of the synthetic system (the mRNA does not encode a protein that could modify chromatin state) and the postulated model (positive feedback is established via TF binding, not mRNA expression). mRNA dynamics will impact protein dynamics, and the title and text should reflect this aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified it as suggested, shown in Line 381 in the revised manuscript.

Details on methods are missing (and should be provided), but clearly the mRuby monomodal distribution for the empirical transfer function does not match (approximately) the distribution for AM, 20\muW/cm<sup>2</sup> in Figure 1F and it is unclear if it does so for the mRuby marginal in Figure 1G (the raw data for this panel is not available), as would be expected. Furthermore, it is unclear, how the predicted mRuby marginal for high cooperativity was obtained. Very approximate simulations for both scenarios (Matlab code below) rather indicate the opposite of the authors' conclusions when compared to data in Figure 1F,G.</p><p>Matlab code on point (1):</p><p>%% cooperativity simulations (x: GAVPO, y: mRuby)</p><p>ns = 1e4;</p><p>d0 = table2array(readtable('88763_1_data_set_2024261_qtg66v.xlsx','sheet','Fig1H-3','range','a2:b122'));</p><p>cdf = cumsum(d0(:,2));</p><p>[~,idx] = unique(cdf);</p><p>x = interp1(cdf(idx),d0(idx,1),rand(ns,1));</p><p>% loop: cooperativity</p><p>hill = {@(x,k,n) 3 + 1*(x-4.5);.…</p><p>@(x,k,n) 3 + 2*x.^n./(k.^n+x.^n)};</p><p>n = 70;</p><p>k = 5.7;</p><p>figure();</p><p>for z = 1:length(hill)</p><p>subplot(3,2,z)</p><p>xi = linspace(4.5,6.5,100);</p><p>plot(xi,hill{z}(xi,k,n));</p><p>subplot(3,2,z+2)</p><p>y = hill{z}(x,k,n) +.25*randn(size(x));</p><p>ksdensity([x,y]);</p><p>view(2);</p><p>axis([4.5 6.5 2 6])</p><p>subplot(3,2,z+4);</p><p>histogram(y,'Normalization','pdf');</p><p>hold on;</p><p>histogram(x,'Normalization','pdf');</p><p>end</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for not making our analysis clear enough on this part.

The single-cell trajectories in Figure 2G, however, do not represent the population distribution. They were selected according to 'low' or 'high' mRuby signal at 24h; the data only demonstrates the dynamics for reaching the target state, and not bistability. For experiments demonstrating hysteresis, in the regime of bistability, one would expect distinct (bimodal under noise) distributions close to the 'low' or 'high' starting state. This is clearly not the case given the data in Figure 2I,J. The slight shift to higher mRuby in the intermediary regime (10-25 light intensity) used as an argument for hysteresis in the manuscript can be easily explained by the population not being in steady-state because the distribution for the predicted monostable 0 light input case is right-shifted by prior stimulation as well.</p><p>In brief, the single-cell experiments (Figure 2F-H) show a bimodal induction response. The OFF cells stay OFF and the ON cells stay ON. It would have been more convincing to see an induced ON cell stochastically cross a threshold and then return to the OFF state. Or the authors could have started with a fully induced population (100% ON with 100 uW/cm<sup>2</sup> induction) then put at intermediate light and filmed single cells. The expectation would be that a fraction of the cells crosses the threshold and goes to the stable OFF state. Alternatively, the authors could have sorted ON and OFF cells, and then measured the time evolution of mRuby/mCardinal distribution of the OFF population and ON population.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept the judgments on the bistability.
