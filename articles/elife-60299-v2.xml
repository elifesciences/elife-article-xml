and position, is mediated by mechanosensory neurons that detect diverse features of body kinematics. Although proprioceptive feedback is crucial for accurate motor control, little is known about how downstream circuits transform limb sensory information to guide motor output. Here we investigate neural circuits in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that process proprioceptive information from the fly leg. We identify three cell types from distinct developmental lineages that are positioned to receive input from proprioceptor subtypes encoding tibia position, movement, and vibration. 13Bα neurons encode femur-tibia joint angle and mediate postural changes in tibia position. 9Aα neurons also drive changes in leg posture, but encode a combination of directional movement, high frequency vibration, and joint angle. Activating 10Bα neurons, which encode tibia vibration at specific joint angles, elicits pausing in walking flies. Altogether, our results reveal that central circuits integrate information across proprioceptor subtypes to construct complex sensorimotor representations that mediate diverse behaviors, including reflexive control of limb posture and detection of leg vibration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proprioception</kwd><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS102333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agrawal</surname><given-names>Sweta</given-names></name><name><surname>Dickinson</surname><given-names>Evyn S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sustar</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><name><surname>Gurung</surname><given-names>Pralaksha</given-names></name><name><surname>Tuthill</surname><given-names>John C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Truman</surname><given-names>James W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agrawal</surname><given-names>Sweta</given-names></name><name><surname>Dickinson</surname><given-names>Evyn S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sustar</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><name><surname>Gurung</surname><given-names>Pralaksha</given-names></name><name><surname>Tuthill</surname><given-names>John C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Searle Scholars Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agrawal</surname><given-names>Sweta</given-names></name><name><surname>Dickinson</surname><given-names>Evyn S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sustar</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><name><surname>Gurung</surname><given-names>Pralaksha</given-names></name><name><surname>Tuthill</surname><given-names>John C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

For example, muscle spindles, which are proprioceptive sensory organs embedded in vertebrate skeletal muscles, encode both muscle fiber length and contraction velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hunt, 1990</xref>). A functionally analogous structure, the femoral chordotonal organ (FeCO), is housed within the femur of the insect leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Field and Matheson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The FeCO is the largest proprioceptive organ in the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Meigen, 1830</xref>), and its 152 neurons can be divided into at least three anatomically distinct subtypes: the claw, hook, and club neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kuan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mamiya et al., 2018</xref>). Each subtype encodes different kinematic features of the femur-tibia joint: claw neurons encode tibia position (flexion or extension; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), hook neurons encode directional tibia movement (flexion or extension; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and club neurons encode tibia vibration and bidirectional movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Work in other species has shown that proprioceptors synapse directly onto both motor neurons and complex networks of central neurons in the vertebrate spinal cord or invertebrate ventral nerve cord (VNC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bässler, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Proske and Gandevia, 2012</xref>). Central circuits integrate proprioceptive information across different modalities, muscles, or limbs, and in some cases, integrate proprioceptive information with descending motor commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jankowska, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Windhorst, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burrows, 1996</xref>). Ultimately, understanding the role of sensory feedback in motor control will require knowledge about how central neurons transform inputs from limb proprioceptors, as well as their subsequent effect on motor circuits.</p><p>Studying the sense of proprioception presents two major challenges. First, proprioception is multimodal: proprioceptors found at the same location in the body can detect different mechanical features produced by self-movement, such as muscle velocity, muscle tension, or joint position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Proske and Gandevia, 2012</xref>). It is unclear to what degree signals from these diverse proprioceptors are combined to form a composite representation of the body, or whether they are even encoded within a common coordinate system. Additionally, proprioception faces strict constraints on processing speed: in nimble-footed animals like flies, central circuits may have less than 30 ms to process proprioceptive information in between successive steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">DeAngelis et al., 2019</xref>). Perhaps as a result, proprioceptive and motor circuits are heavily intermingled: many primary and second-order sensory neurons are also premotor neurons that synapse onto motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Büschges and Gruhn, 2007</xref>). The lack of clear hierarchical structure within the spinal cord and VNC has made it challenging to identify general organizational principles of central proprioceptive processing.</p><p>To better understand how central circuits process proprioceptive information, we examined how sensory signals from the fly FeCO are transformed by downstream neurons in the VNC. We first used an anatomical screen to identify three neuronal cell types positioned to receive input from at least one of the major FeCO subtypes. We then characterized how each cell type encodes femur-tibia joint kinematics by recording their activity during controlled leg manipulations. Finally, to understand the role of these neurons in motor control, we optogenetically activated each cell type while tracking fly behavior. Our results reveal that, even at this early stage of sensory processing, information from different FeCO subtypes is combined to form diverse, complex representations of tibia movement and position that underlie a range of behaviors, including postural reflexes and vibration sensing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> VNC consists of ~20,000 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bates et al., 2019</xref>) that arise from 30 segmentally repeated neuroblasts, each of which divides to form an ‘A’ and ‘B’ hemilineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Truman et al., 2010</xref>). Developmental lineages are an effective means to classify neuronal cell types: neurons within a hemilineage are morphologically similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Harris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mark et al., 2019</xref>), express the same transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lacin and Truman, 2016</xref>), and release the same primary neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lacin et al., 2019</xref>).

Based on this analysis, we focused our efforts on three driver lines that label specific central cell types: (1) a population of GABAergic neurons from the 13B hemilineage (13Bα neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) that are positioned to receive input from position-tuned claw proprioceptors, (2) a population of GABAergic neurons from the 9A hemilineage (9Aα neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) that are positioned to receive input from directionally tuned hook proprioceptors, and (3) a population of cholinergic neurons from the 10B hemilineage (10Bα neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) that are positioned to receive input from vibration-sensitive club proprioceptors.

All 13Bα cells lacked detectable action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As suggested by the population-level calcium imaging, the membrane potential of individual 13Bα cells provides a continuous readout of tibial position: each cell depolarizes when the tibia is extended and hyperpolarizes when the tibia is flexed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Aside from a small transient depolarization following joint extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), the responses of 13Bα to movement of the femur-tibia joint were remarkably tonic (i.e., non-adapting) at steady state. These properties were stereotyped across all cells, though there was some cell-to-cell variability in the magnitude of membrane potential fluctuations, perhaps due to variability in recording quality.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-60299-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Whole-cell recordings during controlled movements of the femur-tibia joint.</title><p>The video shows example whole-cell recordings during controlled movements of the femur-tibia joint for 13Bα, 9Aα, and 10Bα cells.</p></caption></media><p>The response tuning of single 13Bα neurons was similar to that observed with population-level calcium imaging of extension-tuned claw sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mamiya et al., 2018</xref>). 13Bα activity increased only when the tibia was extended past ~90° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>), and the steady-state membrane potential at a given tibia position was greater when the tibia was extended to reach that position than when the tibia was flexed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This phenomenon, commonly referred to as hysteresis, could introduce ambiguity for downstream neurons that rely on a representation of absolute leg angle. The degree of hysteresis that we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) is comparable to what has been previously reported for claw neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mamiya et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We used pharmacological manipulations to investigate the nature of presynaptic inputs to 13Bα neurons. Bath application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to the VNC prevents action potential propagation in leg mechanosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016</xref>). As expected, TTX abolished activity in 13Bα neurons during tibia movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). FeCO sensory neurons release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mamiya et al., 2018</xref>), and so we would expect that application of acetylcholine receptor antagonists (methyllycaconitine [MLA], an antagonist of nicotinic receptors, or atropine, an antagonist of muscarinic receptors) would also block 13Bα activity. Surprisingly, both MLA and atropine had only subtle effects on 13Bα encoding and never completely abolished 13Bα activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). This result suggests that either 13Bα neurons are coupled to claw sensory neurons via gap junctions, or that MLA and atropine only partially block cholinergic synaptic input from claw neurons.</p><p>When the femur-tibia joint moves from an extended to a flexed position, the membrane potential of 13Bα neurons hyperpolarizes to a new steady state. This hyperpolarization could be due to an increase in inhibitory input, a decrease in excitatory input, or a combination of both. Application of picrotoxin, an antagonist of the inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, GABA<sub>a</sub> and Glu<sub>Cl</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilson and Laurent, 2005</xref>), had no effect on 13Bα activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that 13Bα neurons do not receive inhibitory input via GABA<sub>a</sub> or Glu<sub>Cl</sub> receptors. Inhibition of 13Bα neurons may instead occur through GABA<sub>b</sub> receptors that are not blocked by picrotoxin, though GABA<sub>b</sub>-mediated conductances are slower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilson and Laurent, 2005</xref>) and therefore unlikely to be involved in encoding rapid joint-angle changes. Further evidence that the hyperpolarization of 13Bα neurons is not mediated by an inhibitory input comes from experiments measuring responses to tibia movement after injecting current to shift the cell’s resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Depolarizing the cell by injecting positive current through the patch pipette shifts the membrane potential toward the equilibrium potential for excitation, reducing the driving force for excitatory synaptic input while increasing the driving force for inhibitory synaptic input. Hyperpolarizing the cell by injecting negative current has the opposite effect. We found that when 13Bα cells were depolarized, the change in membrane potential during both extension and flexion decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting that the proprioceptive responses of 13Bα neurons are mediated by increases and decreases in excitatory input. In summary, 13Bα cells are a relatively homogeneous class of neurons that receive excitatory input from extension-sensitive claw neurons, perhaps via mixed chemical and electrical synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Activation of 13Bα neurons causes tibia flexion</title><p>Our measurements of 13Bα activity demonstrate that these neurons encode extension of the femur-tibia joint. Their tonic, non-adapting responses suggest a role in encoding, and potentially controlling, posture of the femur-tibia joint. To test this hypothesis, we optogenetically activated 13Bα neurons in tethered, headless flies. We expressed the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) in 13Bα neurons and used a green laser focused on the ventral thorax at the base of the left front (L1) leg to activate neurons in the left prothoracic VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Because we were interested in whether these neurons drive reflexive leg movements, we measured how optogenetic activation altered movements of the three major leg joints (coxa-femur, femur-tibia, and tibia-tarsus) in headless flies with their legs unloaded (i.e. the fly was suspended in the air; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or loaded (i.e. the fly was positioned on a ball; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In the absence of descending signals from the brain, decapitated flies maintain a consistent leg posture but rarely move their legs spontaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In both loaded and unloaded flies, activation of 13Bα neurons caused a slow extension of the coxa-femur joint and flexion of the femur-tibia joint; this movement was absent during trials without a laser stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). Prior experiments using the same behavioral setup demonstrated that a laser stimulus in the absence of CsChrimson does not cause leg movement in headless flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azevedo et al., 2020</xref>). During some trials we also observed a lateral movement of the middle left (L2) leg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). The movement of both joints was larger in unloaded flies, whereas the lateral movement of L2 was more likely to occur in loaded flies. For those flies that flexed their femur-tibia joint, the change in joint angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) and likelihood of flexion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>) did not vary with initial joint position. Thus, despite systematic differences in initial joint positions of loaded and unloaded flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>), we hypothesize that the distinct responses to optogenetic stimulation were due to the activity of other proprioceptors, such as campaniform sensilla, that are activated by leg loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zill et al., 2004</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that 13Bα neurons mediate slow postural leg movements in response to limb perturbations detected by the FeCO.

Although individual neurons had consistent tuning across the duration of a recording, each 9Aα cell had slightly different response tuning.

However, twice when recording from the driver line labeling 9Aα neurons, we recorded from a cell that was morphologically and physiologically distinct. This cell, which we refer to as 9Aα2, has a cell body located within the same cluster as other 9A neurons, but its neurites extend anteriorly, similar to claw axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). 9Aα2 cells have larger spikes than 9Aα cells (&gt;2 mV), and they encode flexed tibial positions via tonic changes in membrane potential and firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). 9Aα2 cells did not respond to tibial vibration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and MLA application mostly blocked their responses to tibia movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Additionally, most 10Bα neurons were tonically hyperpolarized when the tibia was fully flexed and transiently hyperpolarized when the tibia was fully extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, in addition to movement-sensitive excitatory inputs, 10Bα cells also receive position-tuned inhibition.</p><p>Like club sensory neurons, we found that 10Bα neurons are sensitive to low amplitude and high frequency vibration of the tibia. Interestingly, different 10Bα cells were tuned to different ranges of vibration frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). As vibration amplitude increased, frequency tuning broadened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, light orange) or shifted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, dark orange). 10Bα cells are so sensitive that they responded to vibration caused by the saline perfusion system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left inset). This perfusion response was absent when the tibia was flexed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right inset), suggesting that position-dependent inhibition of 10Bα neurons is sufficient to suppress vibration encoding. Thus, leg position may modulate flies’ ability to sense substrate vibration via the FeCO.</p><p>Tibia position also modulated the sensitivity and timing of 10Bα activity during larger amplitude movements. When we applied an identical 20° triangle-wave oscillation to the tibia starting at either an extended (~145°) or flexed (~20°) position, tibia position affected both the amplitude and phase of the resulting membrane potential oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>). This phase shift decreased as the oscillation frequency increased, and disappeared during movements faster than 320°s<sup>−1</sup>. As a result, the effect of tibia position on the timing of 10Bα activity may only be significant during slower movements like grooming or targeted reaching. During faster movements like walking, tibia position would primarily modulate the amplitude of 10Bα activity, not its timing.</p><p>Finally, pharmacology experiments suggest that 10Bα neurons, like 13Bα neurons, may be electrically coupled to upstream FeCO sensory neurons. Application of acetylcholine antagonists (MLA or atropine) was not sufficient to disrupt 10Bα encoding of tibia swing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>) or tibia vibration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Application of picrotoxin abolished the tonic hyperpolarization present during tibia flexion for some cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>), suggesting that 10Bα neurons receive inhibitory inputs. Application of picrotoxin also decreased responses to vibration and abolished the vibration offset response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>). In summary, 10Bα neurons are intersegmentally projecting central neurons that encode tibia movement and vibration via input from club sensory neurons.

The organization of neuroblasts that gives rise to the insect VNC has undergone little change over 350 million years of insect evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lacin and Truman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thomas et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Truman and Ball, 1998</xref>) and homologous neuroblasts and their resulting lineages have been identified in insects as diverse as silverfish, grasshoppers, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jia and Siegler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thomas et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Truman and Ball, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Witten and Truman, 1998</xref>). Connecting neurons’ functions with their developmental origin in different species will yield a powerful framework for studying the evolution of sensorimotor circuits, revealing the essential bauplan underlying flexible, fast motor control.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Central integration of proprioceptive sensory information</title><p>We found that VNC neurons integrate mechanosensory signals from proprioceptor subtypes that encode distinct features of leg joint kinematics. Convergence of multiple kinematic features has also been described in second-order neurons in other mechanosensory systems. For example, aPN3 neurons, a class of neurons downstream of the Johnston’s organ (JO) in the fly antenna, encode antennal vibrations only at specific antennal positions, similar to 10Bα neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>). Second-order neurons within the mammalian vestibular nuclei include cells that encode head-rotational movements (via inputs from the semi-circular canal), head-translational movements (via inputs from the otolith), or both rotations and translations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dickman and Angelaki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goldberg, 2000</xref>). The continuum from unimodal to complex, multimodal encoding is thought to facilitate the vestibular nuclei’s role in multiple behaviors, including vestibular-ocular reflexes and disambiguating translational motion from gravitational accelerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelaki and Cullen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Green and Angelaki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Green et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, the range of second-order neurons that we found in the VNC are likely shaped by the constraints of processing speed and need for motor flexibility.</p><p>Each VNC cell type we analyzed had a different degree of functional heterogeneity across individual neurons. 9Aα neurons, in particular, demonstrated high cell-to-cell variability in their response tuning. These diverse response profiles could result from different mixtures of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs, similar to what has been observed in aPN3 neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennal mechanosensory circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). By mixing inhibitory and excitatory inputs in different ratios from different populations of sensory neurons, individual aPN3 neurons demonstrate diverse tuning profiles with sensitivity for different stimulus features. From an information coding perspective, such heterogeneous populations could enable continuous representation of multi-modal stimulus spaces, and encode increased information as a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azarfar et al., 2018</xref>). Functional heterogeneity within a cell type has not been systematically analyzed in second-order proprioceptive neurons of larger insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burrows, 1996</xref>), likely due to the inability to unambiguously assign cell-type identity when recording from unlabeled neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Neural representation of tibia position</title><p>Tibia position is encoded by approximately 25 claw sensory neurons per leg, each of which is tuned to a narrow range of femur-tibia joint angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mamiya et al., 2018</xref>). Claw neurons can be separated into two subtypes encoding either flexed (0–90°) or extended (90–180°) tibia angles. 13Bα neurons, based on their anatomy and activity, are likely downstream of extension-sensitive claw neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) and the 9Aα2 neurons are a complementary population of inhibitory neurons that receive inputs from flexion-sensitive claw neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unlike movement-encoding 9Aα or 10Bα neurons, these position-encoding central neurons encode information from only a single FeCO subtype, suggesting that movement information is immediately contextualized by position information, whereas position information can be transmitted independently. Perhaps as a result, optogenetic activation of 13Bα neurons consistently caused leg movements, whereas the effect of 9Aα activation was more variable.</p><p>We also found that 13Bα and claw neurons exhibit a similar degree of hysteresis: the steady-state membrane potential at a given tibia position from 90 to 180° was about 20% greater when the tibia was extended to reach that position than when it was flexed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Proprioceptive hysteresis is found in many vertebrate and invertebrate mechanosensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grigg and Greenspan, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lennerstrand, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Matheson, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ridgel et al., 2000</xref>). However, it is unclear if hysteresis causes problematic ambiguities for downstream circuits that require an accurate readout of tibia angle, or if it is a useful feature, perhaps compensating for the nonlinear properties of muscle activation in short sensorimotor loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zill and Jepson-Innes, 1988</xref>). Non-spiking central neurons in locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Siegler, 1981a</xref>) and stick insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Büschges, 1990</xref>) also exhibit hysteresis, and the effects of hysteresis can be seen in leg motor neuron activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Field and Burrows, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Siegler, 1981b</xref>). These data suggest that hysteresis is preserved within central circuits, and our results show that the same is true in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Behavioral function of central proprioceptive neurons</title><p>Activating both 13Bα and 9Aα neurons caused flies to move their legs, suggesting that these two populations mediate leg postural reflexes in response to perturbations detected by the FeCO. Such reflexes are important to stabilize posture by maintaining joint position, and work in other insects has shown that they are mediated via pathways between the FeCO and leg motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burrows, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Büschges, 1990</xref>). Motor neurons controlling the fly tibia are organized according to a hierarchical gradient of cellular size and electrical excitability that enables motor neurons controlling weak, slow movements to be recruited first, followed by neurons that control progressively stronger, faster movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azevedo et al., 2020</xref>). We found that 13Bα activation caused generally larger leg movements than 9Aα activation. While this distinction could be due to differences in how strongly we were able to excite either population, it may also suggest that 13Bα and 9Aα cells provide input to cells at different levels of the motor neuron hierarchy. 13Bα neurons could provide input to higher gain intermediate or fast motor neurons, whereas 9Aα neurons may provide input to only low gain, slow motor neurons.</p><p>In contrast to 9Aα and 13Bα neurons, activating 10Bα neurons did not produce reflexive leg movements. Instead, 10Bα neurons drive pauses in walking behavior. Previous behavioral experiments found that flies will stop walking when they sense the ground vibrating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fabre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Howard et al., 2019</xref>) – 10Bα neurons may mediate this stopping via vibration-sensitive inputs from the FeCO. If true, this would imply that the FeCO functions as both a proprioceptive and exteroceptive organ. This finding is consistent with work in stick insects and locusts that also found that vibration-tuned FeCO neurons do not contribute to postural reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Field and Pflüger, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kittmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stein and Sauer, 1999</xref>), and instead mediate startle responses to substrate vibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Friedel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stritih Peljhan and Strauß, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Takanashi et al., 2016</xref>). Similar mechanoreceptors that primarily sense substrate vibrations are also found in the limbs of rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Prsa et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A subset of 10Bα neurons send ascending projections to the brain, where they innervate the wedge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), a region that encodes auditory information from the antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>). These ascending projections raise the possibility that vibration signals from 10Bα neurons are integrated with vibration signals from the antennae. Although the purpose of this integration is not yet clear, one possibility is that leg vibration could sensitize flies to other auditory stimuli. Interestingly, however, vibration encoding by the FeCO is not purely exteroceptive: activating vibration-sensitive 9Aα neurons did not cause walking flies to pause, but did cause flies to extend the tibia-tarsus joint. Thus, vibration coding in the FeCO may be used for both exteroceptive detection of substrate vibration and for proprioceptive feedback control of limb movement.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Summary</title><p>In this study, we identify and describe the physiology, activity, and behavioral function of three populations of central neurons that are positioned to receive synaptic input from proprioceptive sensory neurons in the fly leg. While these cell types represent only a subset of the neurons that are downstream of the FeCO, they provide valuable insights into how proprioceptive sensory information is integrated by central neurons to influence locomotion and motor control. Already, even at the earliest stages of sensory processing, proprioceptive signals from the FeCO diverge to multiple neuron types with distinct behavioral roles.</p><p>What is the significance of the specific representations of femur-tibia joint kinematics encoded by these central neurons?

Flies were anesthetized on ice and then positioned ventral side up, with the head glued to the upper side of the fly holder using UV-cured glue (Bondic or Kemxert 300). We further glued the ventral side of the thorax onto the hole and on the bottom side of the holder, we glued down the femur of the experimental leg (the right prothoracic leg for the majority of experiments, unless otherwise indicated) so that we could control the femur-tibia joint angle by moving the tibia. When gluing the femur, we held it at a position where the movement of the tibia during the rotation of the femur-tibia joint was parallel to the plane of the fly holder. To eliminate mechanical interference, we glued down all other legs. We also pushed the abdomen to the left side and glued it at that position, so that the abdomen did not block tibia flexion. To position the tibia using the magnetic control system described below, we cut a small piece of insect pin (length ∼1.0 mm, 0.1 mm diameter; Living Systems Instrumentation) and glued it onto the tibia and the tarsus of the right prothoracic leg. To enhance contrast and improve tracking of the tibia/pin position, we painted the pin with either black India ink (for calcium imaging experiments, Super Black, Speedball Art Products) or white acrylic paint (for electrophysiology experiments, Liquitex heavy body acrylic, titanium white). After immersing the ventral side of the preparation in extracellular fly saline (recipe below), we removed the cuticle above the prothoracic segment of the VNC and took out the digestive tract to reduce the movements of the VNC.

The internal solution for whole-cell recordings was composed of (in mM) 140 KOH, 140 aspartic acid, 10 HEPES, 2 mM EGTA, 1 KCl, 4 MgATP, 0.5 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 13 Neurobiotin, with pH adjusted using KOH to 7.2 and osmolality adjusted to 268 mOsm. Whole-cell patch pipettes were pulled with a P-97 linear puller (Sutter Instruments) from borosilicate glass (OD 1.5 mm, ID 0.86 mm) to have approximately 8–12 MOhm resistance. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were targeted to GFP-labeled cell bodies in the prothoracic region of the VNC. We used a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices) for all recordings. Data were low-pass filtered at 5 kHz before they were digitized at 20 kHz by a 16 bit A/D converter (Axon Digidata 1400A, Molecular Devices Co) and acquired in AxoScope 10.7 (Molecular Devices). Stable recordings were typically maintained for 1–2 hr. Analysis of electrophysiology data was performed with custom scripts written in MATLAB (MathWorks). The liquid junction potential for the whole cell recordings was −12 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</xref>). We corrected the membrane voltages reported in the paper by post-hoc subtraction of the junction potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Moving the tibia/pin using a magnetic control system</title><p>We used a previously described magnetic control system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mamiya et al., 2018</xref>) to manipulate the femur/tibia joint angle. To move the tibia/pin to different positions, we attached a rare earth magnet (1 cm height × 5 mm diameter column) to a steel post (M3 × 20 mm flat head machine screw) and controlled its position using a programmable servo motor (SilverMax QCI-X23C-1; Max speed 533,333°/s, Max acceleration 83,333.33°/s<sup>2</sup>, Position resolution 0.045°; QuickSilver Controls). To move the magnet in a circular trajectory centered at the femur-tibia joint, we placed the motor on a micromanipulator (MP-285, Sutter Instruments) and adjusted its position while visually inspecting the movement of the magnet and the tibia using the tibia tracking camera described below. For each trial, we controlled the speed and the position of the servo motor using QuickControl software (QuickSilver Controls). During all trials, we tracked the tibia position (as described below) to confirm the tibia movement during each trial. Because it was difficult to fully flex the femur-tibia joint without the tibia/pin and the magnet colliding with the abdomen, we only flexed the joint up to ∼18°. We set the acceleration of the motor to 72,000°/s<sup>2</sup> for all ramp and hold and swing movements. Movements of the tibia during each trial varied slightly due to several factors, including the length of the magnetic pin and the positioning of the tibia and motor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Tracking the femur-tibia joint angle during electrophysiology and imaging experiments</title><p>To track the position of the tibia, we illuminated the tibia/pin with an 850 nm IR LED (M850F2, ThorLabs) and recorded video using an IR sensitive high-speed video camera (Basler Ace A800-510um, Basler AG) with a 1.0× InfiniStix lens (94 mm wd, Infinity). The camera used in the calcium imaging prep was further equipped with a 900 nm short pass filter (Edmund Optics) to filter out the two-photon laser light. In order to synchronize the tibia movement with the recorded cell activity, the camera exposure signal was acquired at 20 kHz. To track the tibia angle, we identified the position of the painted tibia/pin against the contrasting background by thresholding the image. We then approximated the orientation of the leg as the long axis of an ellipse with the same normalized second central moments as the thresholded image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haralick and Shapiro, 1992</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Vibrating the tibia using a piezoelectric crystal</title><p>To vibrate the tibia at high frequencies, we moved the magnet using either a piezoelectric crystal (calcium imaging prep, PA3JEW, Max displacement 1.8 μm; ThorLabs) or a preloaded piezoelectric actuator (patch-clamp electrophysiology prep, P-841.40, Physik Instrumente). To control the movement of the piezo, we generated sine waves of different frequencies in MATLAB (sampling frequency 10 kHz) and sent them to the piezo through a single channel open-loop piezo controller (calcium imaging prep: Thorlabs; electrophysiology prep: Physik). Piezo-induced tibia movements during the calcium imaging prep were calibrated as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mamiya et al., 2018</xref>. Piezo-induced movements during the electrophysiology prep were calibrated using the amplitude measured by the piezo’s internal sensor. For each stimulus, we presented 4 s of vibration two to three times with an inter-stimulus interval of 8 s. We averaged the responses within each fly before averaging across flies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Spike detection from whole-cell recordings</title><p>To detect spikes in current clamp recordings of membrane potential, we applied the following analysis steps to our records of membrane voltage: (1) filter, (2) identify events with large peaks above a threshold, (3) compute a distance from a template for each event, (4) compute the amplitude of the voltage deflection associated with the filtered event, (5) select spikes by thresholding events based both on the distance to the filtered template (&lt;threshold) and on the amplitude of the spike in the voltage record (&gt;threshold).

Each drug was further diluted in saline for experiments for a final concentration of 1 µM (TTX and MLA), 20 µM (atropine), or 100 µM (picrotoxin).

The fly’s dorsal thorax was attached to a tungsten wire (0.1 mm diameter) with UV-curing glue (KOA 300, KEMXERT). Tethered flies were food deprived for at least 3 hr prior to being placed in the arena. In the headless preparation, the tethered flies were then decapitated under cold anesthesia and allowed to recover for 5–10 min prior to the experiment. Intact or headless tethered flies were positioned on a hand-milled foam treadmill ball (density: 7.3 mg/mm<sup>3</sup>, diameter: 9.46 mm) that was suspended on a stream of air (5 l/min) and freely rotated under the fly’s movement. The ball and fly were illuminated by three IR lights (M850F2, ThorLabs) to improve motion tracking. In unloaded experiments with the headless prep, we removed the spherical treadmill, leaving the flies suspended in air. For all trials, the temperature in the chamber was maintained between 26 and 28°C with a relative humidity of 58–65%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Tethered behavior assay</title><p>We coaxed flies to walk on the ball by displaying visual stimuli on a semi-circular green LED display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reiser and Dickinson, 2008</xref>). To elicit forward walking, we displayed a single dark bar (width 30°) on a light background, and sinusoidally oscillated the bar at 2.7 Hz across 48.75° about the center of the fly’s visual field. During periods between trials, the LED panels displayed a fixed dark stripe (30°) on a bright background in front of the tethered fly. To characterize the role of the motor neurons in behaving tethered flies, we optogenetically activated genetically targeted motor neurons. A green laser (532 nm, CST DPSS laser, Besram Technology, Inc), pulsed at 1200 Hz with a 66% duty cycle, passed through a converging lens and a pinhole (50 µm diameter) with a resulting power of 87 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at the target. It was aimed at the fly’s left prothoracic coxa-body wall joint, thus targeting the left T1 neuromere below the cuticle. Experiments using a driver line labeling all motor neurons (OK371-Gal4) indicated that optogenetic stimulation primarily affected neurons innervating the left prothoracic leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azevedo et al., 2020</xref>), though we cannot rule out effects on other VNC neurons.</p><p>For intact fly experiments, each trial was 4 s long. We presented walking flies with the visual stimulus, the flies reached a steady running speed at ~1.5 s, and the laser stimulus began at 2 s. The laser stimulus randomly cycled through seven stimulus lengths: 0 ms, 30 ms, 60 ms, 90 ms, 180 ms, 360 ms, and 720 ms. For simplification, we primarily focus on a short stimulus (90 ms), a long stimulus (720 ms), and the control condition (laser omitted, 0 ms). Each fly was presented each laser stimulus six times. For headless fly experiments, we used only the longest laser stimulus length (720 ms) and the control omitted stimulus (0 ms), such that each fly had 24 laser stimulus trials (at 720 ms) and four control trials (no laser), randomly interleaved. Trials were separated by a 25 s period during which video data was written to disk and the LED panels displayed a fixed, stationary stripe.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Quantification of fly behavior</title><p>We used Fictrac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moore et al., 2014</xref>) to calculate fly walking trajectories (position, speed, and rotational velocity) from live video of the spherical treadmill’s rotation (Point Grey Firefly camera, imaging at 30 Hz). Trajectories were then converted from pixels to mm using the spherical treadmill’s diameter of 9.46 mm. Detailed fly movements and kinematics were captured from six simultaneously triggered cameras (Basler acA800-510µm, imaging at 300 Hz) that were distributed around the fly. Digital and analog data signals were collected with a DAQ (PCIe-6321, National Instruments) sampling at 10 kHz and recorded with custom MATLAB scripts. For all experimental trials, we scored the fly’s behavior in the 200 ms preceding the optogenetic stimulus as stationary, walking/turning, grooming or other. Flies that took no steps for the duration of the categorization period were classified as stationary. Flies that took at least four coordinated steps over the duration of the 200 ms period were classified as walking/turning. Trials in which the fly switched behaviors, groomed, or did not display clear markers for walking/turning during the categorization period were classified as other/grooming and excluded from analyses. For each headless fly trial, both unloaded and loaded, we also scored the behavioral response to the laser stimulus during the 720 ms period following the onset of the stimulus into categories based on the repertoire of responses.</p><p>In headless fly experiments, we manually tracked the position of the left front leg via high-speed video during the optogenetic stimulus period. We then calculated the leg joint angles (coxa-femur, femur-tibia, and tibia-tarsus) from the position measurements. For activation experiments in 13Bα headless flies, we calculated the average change in the leg joint angles (coxa-femur, femur-tibia, and tibia-tarus) over time across flies for the control (0 ms laser) and activation stimulus (720 ms laser). We calculated the change in joint angle as the difference in the average joint angle for a 200 ms period before the laser turned and the last 200 ms period of the laser activation. For activation experiments in 9Aα, we subtracted the joint angle during the frame immediately preceding laser onset from the joint angle during the frame immediately following laser offset, excluding any flies that were not stationary in the 200 ms preceding the optogenetic stimulus. We then compared this change in joint angle during trials with a 720 ms laser stimulus with trials with a 0 ms laser stimulus using bootstrap simulations with 100,000 random draws to compare changes in walking speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Saravanan and Berman, 2020</xref>). We calculated the change in joint angle over time for all trials binned by initial joint position (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>) to determine if the initial position of the joint affected the response to activation. Initial joint angles were determined from the camera frame before the laser stimulus started. Comparisons across these different groups were accomplished using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey–-Kramer corrections.</p><p>To calculate the maximum joint flexion that occurred due to 13Bα activation, we used all trials in which the fly was subject to the 720 ms laser activation period and excluded flies that were not stationary during the 200 ms preceding the stimulus. Maximum joint flexion is the change in initial joint angle (×) minus the minimum joint angle achieved during the first 500 ms of the laser activation period.</p><p>For walking fly experiments (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and S8), we calculated the average forward velocity over time in the walking trials for each stimulus length, for each fly. We noticed a response in the control flies (split-half [SH]-Gal4) to the laser light that was correlated with the laser turning off; thus, we compared changes in speed between the control line (SH-Gal4) and each of the central neuron lines. We first calculated the change in running speed within a genotype as the average difference in speed between the 200 ms period preceding the laser stimulus and the 200 ms period occurring 200 ms after the laser onset (black brackets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We calculated the difference between the change in running speed for each stimulus condition in the control line and the interneuron line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We then used bootstrap simulations with 100,000 random draws to compare changes in walking speed for a given central neuron line to the control. To quantify the pausing/stopping behavior observed during activation of the 10Bα neurons, we generated a cumulative probability distribution for the first instance of freezing (speed dropping below 0.3 cm/s) within the 2-s period following the laser stimulus start for each walking trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8D</xref> and S8C).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For electrophysiology and calcium imaging results, no statistical tests were performed <italic>a priori</italic> to decide upon sample sizes, but sample sizes were consistent with conventions in the field.

Agrawal et al. carefully characterized physiological properties and behavioral contributions of 3 types of newly identified putative 2nd order proprioceptive cells. These findings are very significant and useful for future study in the fly model. The analysis is both careful and promising but would benefit from a more explicit discussion of how that sensory information is actually transformed or combined on its way through the central circuits. Then the paper would be a more edifying and generally relevant read.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should undertake a significant rewrite to more clearly explain the relevance of the finding for the general field of motor control. This can be accomplished by discussing what has been learned about the sensory transformation in this system and by incorporating some of what is known from the study of large insects and vertebrates and thus putting the findings in context.</p><p>2) There were specific concerns about the limitations and interpretability of pharmacological (and other) experiments particularly on the 13B neurons. These can be found in the expert reviews and should be thoroughly addressed.</p><p>3) All major concerns of the reviewers should be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Overview: This is an extensive description of the identification and roles of several classes of proprioceptor neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Of necessity, a fair bit of the manuscript deals with fly idiosyncratic methods and approaches, and I found it a bit hard work because it wasn't always as clear as it could be between what has been achieved in this work, and what had been done or surmised in the older work on large insects that benefited by classical neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral work. Indeed, throughout, even into the Discussion, it was hard to find the &quot;big picture&quot; results or conclusions from this work. Of course, I understand that eventual understanding of how the fly uses these neurons and their particular properties will await better understanding of the rest of the circuit. Nonetheless, I am still struggling to walk away from this manuscript with something a bit more conceptual. I realize it is probably embedded in manuscript, but if so, it is well embedded. Even the first paragraph of the Discussion jumps right into the details.</p><p>1) It is fairly common that the concentration of antagonists needed to block synaptically released transmitter can be much higher than the dose needed to apply the same transmitter applied exogenously. This can occur if the synaptically released substance hits the receptors at very high (and unknown) local concentrations. So in general, lack of efficacy of antagonists at a synapse is not a reliable way of arguing transmitter identity at that synapse. This calls into question the strong interpretation argued in paragraph four of subsection “13Bα neurons linearly encode tibia position via tonic changes in membrane potential”.</p><p>2) In Figure 5D,E. Is that an n=3 in control and drug? Is that a large enough sample size? In general, throughout the manuscript, please check that appropriate stats are always included?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Sensory information about limb position is detected by proprioceptors, processed by central circuits, and fed back onto motor neurons to guide postural adjustment and movement. Previous work from the Tuthill lab identified proprioceptors (in the femoral chordotonal organ at the femur-tibial joint) and determined what limb movements, joint angles, and vibration they encode. Here Agrawal et al. locate central neurons from three different developmental lineages in the ventral nerve cord that are in anatomical positions to receive these proprioceptive inputs and determine that they respond to aspects of leg movement.</p><p>Some of the central neurons respond to multiple different kinds of proprioceptive inputs, suggesting that different sensory neurons may converge onto these neurons, while others are more specific. Figure 8E shows a nice summary of these proposed convergence pathways.</p><p>Comparing the response properties of the central neurons to those of the previously-characterized sensory neurons using GCaMP imaging and whole-cell patch electrophysiology suggests some minimal signal processing occurs.</p><p>Optogenetic activation of the central neurons causes leg movements. Induced behaviors tend to counter the maximal sensory response (e.g. activating a neuron that encodes joint extension induces flexion), suggesting that these central neurons form part of feedback circuits that correct limb position.</p><p>This is elegant and careful work that furthers our understanding of how neural circuits process proprioceptive sensory information and use it for motor control.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>How the central nervous system coordinates motor control is a big question in neuroscience. Though <italic>Drosophila</italic> is an exciting model to challenge this question, how proprioception, an important feedback signal for motor control is processed in the central nervous system is not well known. Agrawal et al., beautifully characterized physiological properties and behavioral contributions of 3 types of newly identified putative 2nd order proprioceptive cells. I believe these findings are very significant and useful for future study in the field and therefore.</p><p>1) &quot;In contrast to the sensory neurons, nothing is known about how proprioceptive signals are combined or transformed by downstream circuits in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system&quot; This might be true for &quot;the leg system&quot; of &quot;the adult&quot; <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>2) Paragraph four of subsection “13Bα neurons linearly encode tibia position via tonic changes in membrane potential”. In my understanding, FeCO is supposed to have a baseline firing, and when the tibia is flexed, 13Ba cells are hyperpolarized because FeCO decreases the firing rate. Then is it true that after TTX application, the baseline membrane potential of 13Ba cells drops due to lack of constant baseline input from FeCO? At least, it appears the case in the example trace of Figure 2—figure supplement 1A. Clarifying this might help answering the following question 3).</p><p>3) There are also other inhibitory receptors such as GABAB receptors, so it might still be the case that hyperpolarization during tibia flexion is an inhibitory mechanism. Then, remaining hyperpolarization under MLA can still be explained by an inhibitory mechanism (which is blocked by TTX but not by MLA) instead of gap junction. It would be nice to have additional logic supporting the claim here, if possible.</p><p>4) Figure 3. Since laser OFF conditions are used as the control here, to claim that the effect is not simply due to the laser stimulation itself, it is better to briefly mention that the difference between laser ON and OFF conditions is not evident for some cases in different genotype (e.g. Figure 6).</p><p>5) Figure 3E. It is interesting that the magnitude of activation effect is independent of the initial angle. When the initial angle is close to 180 degrees, 13Ba cells are supposed to be already quite depolarized. Do you assume that the laser activation further depolarizes the cells to still substantially affect behavior in such condition? Or does the probability of the joint flexion decrease as the initial angle increases?</p><p>6) Figure 5D, E. It would be nice to have some speculation why both MLA and picrotoxin abolish excitatory and inhibitory components.</p><p>7) Paragraph four of subsection “10Bα neurons drive pausing behavior in walking flies” and paragraph three of subsection “Behavioral function of central proprioceptive neurons”. Do these sentences mean that the source of vibration detected by club FeCO can be both self- and externally- generated? An alternative possibility of the differential behavioral consequence of the activation of 9Aa and 10Ba cells might be due to the difference in their neurotransmitters instead of their encoding. I am not sure if the result of 9Aa activation obviously supports that they encode self-generated vibration.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Central processing of leg proprioception in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Of necessity, a fair bit of the manuscript deals with fly idiosyncratic methods and approaches, and I found it a bit hard work because it wasn't always as clear as it could be between what has been achieved in this work, and what had been done or surmised in the older work on large insects that benefited by classical neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral work. Indeed, throughout, even into the Discussion, it was hard to find the &quot;big picture&quot; results or conclusions from this work. Of course, I understand that eventual understanding of how the fly uses these neurons and their particular properties will await better understanding of the rest of the circuit. Nonetheless, I am still struggling to walk away from this manuscript with something a bit more conceptual. I realize it is probably embedded in manuscript, but if so, it is well embedded…Even the first paragraph of the Discussion jumps right into the details…</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s confusion is understandable. We have added a new section to the Discussion contextualizing how our findings relate to the prior work in large insects. Additionally, we have adjusted the Discussion so that we discuss these “big picture” results before diving into other interesting details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) It is fairly common that the concentration of antagonists needed to block synaptically released transmitter can be much higher than the dose needed to apply the same transmitter applied exogenously. This can occur if the synaptically released substance hits the receptors at very high (and unknown) local concentrations. So in general, lack of efficacy of antagonists at a synapse is not a reliable way of arguing transmitter identity at that synapse. This calls into question the strong interpretation argued in paragraph four of subsection “13Bα neurons linearly encode tibia position via tonic changes in membrane potential”.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated some of the language to address this concern:</p><p>“Surprisingly, both MLA and atropine had only subtle effects on 13Bα encoding, and never completely abolished 13Bα activity (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-C). This result suggests that either 13Bα neurons are coupled to claw sensory neurons via gap junctions, or that MLA and atropine only partially block cholinergic synaptic input from claw neurons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 5D,E. Is that an n=3 in control and drug? Is that a large enough sample size? In general, throughout the manuscript, please check that appropriate stats are always included?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, in Figure 5D-E, our sample size is 3 cells for each the control and drug. Unfortunately, our recordings rarely lasted long enough to map the entire suite of proprioceptive responses, bath apply a drug, and then remap proprioceptive responses post-drug application. For example, of the 15 9Aα cells we recorded from, we were only able to complete this entire sequence for fewer than half of the recordings (6 cells). Of those 6 cells, we applied MLA to half of them and picrotoxin to the other half.</p><p>Nevertheless, we believe that this sample size, while low, is still meaningful. First, MLA application almost entirely abolished the vibration response of 9Aα neurons. We observed a similar disruption for both a 9Aα neuron that was inhibited by low frequency vibrations (of a type similar to 5A), and two 9Aα neurons that were not inhibited by low frequency vibrations (of a type similar to 5B). As such, we believe that this sample is representative of the larger 9Aα population. Additionally, as the reviewer noted, such pharmacology experiments can be problematic because we are applying the compound exogenously to the entire fly. There are possible issues about efficacy of the antagonists at the synapse in question, and additionally this manipulation likely affects other neurons in the circuit, meaning that any changes in activity that we observed could be due to either a direct effect of that antagonist on the recorded cell’s synapse, or an indirect effect on an upstream neuron in the circuit.</p><p>Regarding the statistics, for all behavior experiments, we made all comparisons, such as the change in joint angle or change in walking speed before and after optogenetic activation by using bootstrap simulations with 100,000 random draws (see Materials and methods for more details). Such a method makes the fewest number of assumptions about the structure of the underlying data (such as normality). Comparisons across different groups were accomplished using a 1-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer corrections for multiple comparisons.</p><p>We compared cell activity before and after drug application in most cases using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test, except for one case in which the number of cells fell below three (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-E) in which case we switched to a two sample t-test. We used a matched-pair test since the same cell’s activity from before and after drug application were being compared. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test is a nonparametric test that does not require the underlying data to be normal. However, because it is not robust to smaller sample sizes, we switched to the two sample t-test when the number of cells fell below 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>How the central nervous system coordinates motor control is a big question in neuroscience.

In my understanding, FeCO is supposed to have a baseline firing, and when the tibia is flexed, 13Ba cells are hyperpolarized because FeCO decreases the firing rate. Then is it true that after TTX application, the baseline membrane potential of 13Ba cells drops due to lack of constant baseline input from FeCO? At least, it appears the case in the example trace of Figure 2—figure supplement 1A. Clarifying this might help answering the following question 3).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, as the reviewer noticed, the membrane potential of 13Bα cells does drop upon TTX application. This is likely because 13Bα neurons receive tonic excitatory input from spiking FeCO neurons that increases or decreases as a function of the femur-tibia joint angle. We have clarified 13Bα connectivity in the relevant paragraph (see response to reviewer #2, major comment #2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are also other inhibitory receptors such as GABAB receptors, so it might still be the case that hyperpolarization during tibia flexion is an inhibitory mechanism. Then, remaining hyperpolarization under MLA can still be explained by an inhibitory mechanism (which is blocked by TTX but not by MLA) instead of gap junction. It would be nice to have additional logic supporting the claim here, if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer has noted, there are other inhibitory receptors that our manipulation does not affect. We have added clarifying language to note this lack, and why we still believe that this manipulation strongly argues against inhibitory input mediating 13Bα activity. Additionally, we have also added in some additional data from current injection experiments that further bolster our conclusion:</p><p>“When the femur-tibia joint moves from an extended to a flexed position, the membrane potential of 13Bα neurons decreases to a new steady state. This hyperpolarization could be due to an increase in inhibitory input, a decrease in excitatory input, or a combination of both. Application of picrotoxin, an antagonist of the inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, GABAA and GluCl, had no effect on 13Bα activity (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D), suggesting that 13Bα neurons do not receive inhibitory input via GABAA or GluCl receptors. Inhibition of 13Bα neurons may instead occur through GABAB receptors that are not blocked by picrotoxin, though GABAB-mediated conductances are slower (Wilson and Laurent, 2005) and therefore unlikely to be involved in encoding rapid joint-angle changes. Further evidence that the hyperpolarization of 13Bα neurons is not mediated by an inhibitory input comes from experiments measuring responses to tibia movement after injecting current to shift the cell’s resting membrane potential (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E-F). Depolarizing the cell by injecting positive current through the patch pipette shifts the membrane potential toward the equilibrium potential for excitation, reducing the driving force for excitatory synaptic input while increasing the driving force for inhibitory synaptic input. Hyperpolarizing the cell by injecting negative current has the opposite effect. We found that when 13Bα cells were depolarized, the change in membrane potential during both extension and flexion decreased (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E), suggesting that the proprioceptive responses of 13Bα neurons are mediated by increases and decreases in excitatory input. In summary, 13Bα cells are a relatively homogeneous class of neurons that receive excitatory input from extension-sensitive claw neurons, perhaps via mixed chemical and electrical synapses.”</p><p>The remaining hyperpolarization under MLA still argues for the existence of gap junctions somewhere in the circuit, either between 13Bα and FeCO neurons, or some intermediate neuron that mediates FeCO input onto 13Bα neurons. This is because FeCO neurons are known release acetylcholine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3. Since laser OFF conditions are used as the control here, to claim that the effect is not simply due to the laser stimulation itself, it is better to briefly mention that the difference between laser ON and OFF conditions is not evident for some cases in different genotype (e.g. Figure 6).</p></disp-quote><p>Previous experiments using the same behavioral setup have shown that the laser alone (without expression of CsChrimson) is not sufficient to elicit a behavioral effect in headless flies (Azevedo et al., 2020). We have adjusted the text accordingly:</p><p>“In both loaded and unloaded flies, activation of 13Bα neurons caused a slow extension of the coxa-femur joint and flexion of the femur-tibia joint; this movement was absent during trials without a laser stimulus (Figure 3C-D, Video 3). Prior experiments using the same behavioral setup demonstrated that a laser stimulus in the absence of CsChrimson does not cause leg movement in headless flies (Azevedo et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3E. It is interesting that the magnitude of activation effect is independent of the initial angle. When the initial angle is close to 180 degrees, 13Ba cells are supposed to be already quite depolarized. Do you assume that the laser activation further depolarizes the cells to still substantially affect behavior in such condition? Or does the probability of the joint flexion decrease as the initial angle increases?</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated Figures 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 to include the probability of joint flexion for the different initial joint angles (Figure 3G-H), as well as the observed joint flexion as a function of initial joint angle for every trial (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The probability of joint flexion does decrease a small amount as the joint angle is more extended in both loaded and unloaded flies, though in the case of the unloaded flies, of the 5 trials that had initial joint angles less than 60°, none demonstrated flexion in response to 13Bα activation. Thus, there does not appear to be a consistent relationship between initial joint angle and probability of flexion in our data.</p><p>We have updated the relevant text:</p><p>“For those flies that flexed their femur-tibia joint, the change in joint angle (Figures 3E-F, Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D) and likelihood of flexion (Figure 3G-H) did not vary with initial joint position.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5D, E. It would be nice to have some speculation why both MLA and picrotoxin abolish excitatory and inhibitory components.</p></disp-quote><p>MLA abolishes excitatory and inhibitory responses because it blocks all nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, meaning it also blocks the majority of input from the cholinergic FeCO sensory neurons. Picrotoxin’s effect on excitatory components of the 9Aα response is likely because application of picrotoxin depolarized 9Aα cells. This depolarization, in turn, is likely to decrease the driving force for excitatory synaptic inputs. We have included an inset in Figure 5E plotting this change in the membrane potential and updated the text accordingly:</p><p>“Picrotoxin also decreased responses to high frequency vibration, but this decrease was likely caused by a reduced excitatory conductance after picrotoxin depolarized the resting membrane potential. Thus, in addition to direction-tuned inputs from FeCO hook neurons, 9Aα cells also receive vibration-sensitive inputs from FeCO club neurons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Paragraph four of subsection “10Bα neurons drive pausing behavior in walking flies” and paragraph three of subsection “Behavioral function of central proprioceptive neurons”. Do these sentences mean that the source of vibration detected by club FeCO can be both self- and externally- generated? An alternative possibility of the differential behavioral consequence of the activation of 9Aa and 10Ba cells might be due to the difference in their neurotransmitters instead of their encoding. I am not sure if the result of 9Aa activation obviously supports that they encode self-generated vibration.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, some vibrations may be externally generated (arising from external sources, such as wind or movement of other animals), while some vibrations could be internally generated (due to the action of musculoskeletal elements within the fly). Unfortunately, we do not know much about the spectral composition of natural femur-tibia joint movements, and so we are unable to determine how often one or the other of these types of vibrations are experienced by the fly, nor which of these could be detected by the FeCO. We believe that 10Bα neurons encode external vibrations because the behavioral effect of activating 10Bα neurons is similar to a startle effect in response to vibrations of the floor. Additionally, activating 10Bα in headless flies did not cause any joint movements in loaded or unloaded flies. In contrast, 9Aα activation does cause joint movements in headless flies but does not cause a change in walking speed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>There remain issues which need resolution before publication.</p><p>1) The manuscript provides no citations for the block of glutamate Cl channels by picrotoxin in flies (or in any system).

We mentioned to both the reviewer and in the Materials and methods section that “We compared cell activity before and after drug application in most cases using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test, except for one case in which the number of cells fell below three (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E) in which case we used a two sample t-test.” In actuality, we only used the two sample t-test in two cases where the number of cells was equal to three, not below three (Figures 4—figure supplement 1E, Figure 7—figure supplement 1F). For the few instances where we had only two data points (namely, experiments in which we applied TTX to either 13Bα, 9Aα, or 10Bα cells), we did not perform any statistical tests because, as the reviewer points out, a statistical test on a sample size that low would be meaningless. We apologize for the confusion, and have corrected this typo. In addition, we have removed the statistics for all cases of n=3, so that now any statistics presented in the manuscript has at least n = 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please do not say that membrane potential &quot;decreases&quot; when you mean &quot;hyperpolarizes&quot;….Decrease is ambiguous.

SROs, which function similarly to muscle spindles and the FeCO, are a classic and beautiful model for studying mechanosensory transduction and motor control. Unfortunately, in the interest of brevity, we chose to focus on muscle spindles, which is likely more familiar to a broad readership.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Are there citations for the findings of the transmitters used in 3 classes of neurons (and do they have co-transmitters in them as well?). What is the evidence for those transmitter assignments?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the transmitter assignments come from Lacin et al., 2019 (cited in the manuscript) who generated a comprehensive neurotransmitter usage map for the entire ventral nerve cord using molecular and genetic tools. In that study, they found that all neurons within a hemilineage use the same neurotransmitter, suggesting that neurotransmitter identity is acquired at the stem cell level. While they did find evidence that the acetylcholine-specific gene ChAT is transcribed in some glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, they found that those transcripts did not leave the nucleus nor were they translated. As a result, they concluded that there was no evidence of neurons using more than one neurotransmitter. However, they only examined transcripts relating to the three fast-acting neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate) and did not examine expression of neuropeptides or small molecule neurotransmitters (SMNs). Thus, it is still possible that the 3 classes of neurons may express other neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, or SMNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) I am a confused by Figure 2 F.

Figure 2G is generated from the steady-state activity, aka the middle second of each 3-second step of the ramp and hold stimulus. If we were to plot the data from the first second of each step, the hysteresis is very similar, though increased in some cases because many cells exhibited an additional small transient depolarization following joint extension.
