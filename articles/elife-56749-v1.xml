Here we found that human liver cancer was dependent on extracellular glutamine. However, targeting glutamine addiction using the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 as monotherapy had a very limited anticancer effect, even against the most glutamine addicted human liver cancer cells. Using a chemical library, we identified V-9302, a novel inhibitor of glutamine transporter ASCT2, as sensitizing glutamine dependent (GD) cells to CB-839 treatment. Mechanically, a combination of CB-839 and V-9302 depleted glutathione and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in apoptosis of GD cells. Moreover, this combination also showed tumor inhibition in HCC xenograft mouse models in vivo. Our findings indicate that dual inhibition of glutamine metabolism by targeting both glutaminase and glutamine transporter ASCT2 represents a potential novel treatment strategy for glutamine addicted liver cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd><kwd>glutaminolysis</kwd><kwd>CB-839</kwd><kwd>glutamine addiction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>Dutch Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KWF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernards</surname><given-names>Rene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science and Technology Key Project of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018ZX10302205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Haojie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81702838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Haojie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81920108025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Wenxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Rising-Star Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19QA1408200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Haojie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YQ20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Haojie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combination of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 and ASCT2 inhibitor V-9302 showed efficient antitumor effect against glutamine addicted liver cancer cells via glutathione depletion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Liver cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide and ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the rapid progress and delayed diagnosis, most liver cancer patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, which leaves very few treatment options and poor prognosis. Currently approved agents, such as sorafenib and lenvatinib, provide only modest survival benefits to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with low response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Llovet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kudo et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapies that target new critical dependencies of liver cancer.</p><p>Metabolic reprogramming contributes to tumor development and introduces metabolic liabilities that can be exploited to treat cancer. Despite significant efforts to develop drugs targeting metabolic pathways of cancer, clinical success has been very limited for decades. One particular potential vulnerability of cancer cells is the metabolic reprogramming toward aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ward and Thompson, 2012</xref>). However, the clinical use of one compound known to block glycolysis, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), is limited by toxicity and insufficient inhibition of tumor growth at tolerable doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Raez et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies have highlighted a very prominent contribution of glutaminolysis to energy and macromolecule homeostasis in several types of hematological and solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spinelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vander Heiden and DeBerardinis, 2017</xref>). Glutaminolysis converts glutamine to glutamate, which is catalyzed by mitochondrial glutaminase (GLS), and then further converted into tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites, generating ATP and NADPH. Glutaminolysis is also directly involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis by providing not only precursors glutamate and cysteine for glutathione (GSH) synthesis but also promoting the production of NADPH via glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman et al., 2016</xref>). Many tumor types, such as pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Son et al., 2013</xref>), acute myeloid leukemia (AML; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jacque et al., 2015</xref>), breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gross et al., 2014</xref>), and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), are particularly dependent on glutamine for proliferation and survival, as glutamine controls oxidative phosphorylation, nucleotide biosynthesis, and redox homeostasis in these cells, and removal of glutamine leads to apoptosis. Recently, it is reported that GLS1, one major isoform of GLS, regulates the stemness properties of HCC, and targeting GLS1 achieved some therapeutic effect against HCC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>CB-839 (also known as telaglenastat) is a potent and noncompetitive allosteric GLS1 inhibitor. It exhibits significant anti-proliferative activity in several types of cancer cell lines and xenografts such as triple-negative breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gross et al., 2014</xref>), lung adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Galan-Cobo et al., 2019</xref>), chondrosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peterse et al., 2018</xref>), and lymphoma cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>). CB-839 is used increasingly in combination to treat cancer. CB-839 overcomes metabolic adaptation to the mTOR inhibitor MLN128 in xenografts and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of lung squamous cell carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Momcilovic et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the combination of CB-839 and CDK4/6 inhibitors has shown promising results in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qie et al., 2019</xref>). CB-839 is also under evaluation for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors in several phase I-II clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is still unclear whether CB-839 has therapeutic potential in liver cancer. Here we show that CB-839 monotherapy is insufficient for the treatment of HCC and identify a novel combination strategy that effectively targets glutamine addiction in liver cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Liver cancer is addicted to glutamine</title><p>To determine whether liver cancer is a glutamine (Gln)-dependent tumor type, we cultured a panel of liver cancer cell lines in a medium with 4 mM Gln or without Gln. Both long-term colony formation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and short-term IncuCyte assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) showed that Gln deprivation impaired the proliferation of most liver cancer cell lines (9 out of 11) in vitro. Accordingly, we defined these 9 cell lines, which need exogenous Gln for efficient proliferation, as Gln dependent (GD) cells, and the other two cell lines as Gln independent (GID) cells. To assess Gln dependency of liver cancer in patients, we analyzed Gln metabolism-related genes in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) named ‘PENG_GLUTAMINE_DEPRIVATION_DN’, whose expression is considered to be positively correlated with Gln metabolism. The heatmap shows the obvious upregulation of these genes in liver cancer tissues as compared to their corresponding non-cancerous liver tissues in TCGA cohort containing 50 paired HCC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Gene set enrichment approach (GSEA) also showed positive enrichment of genes associated with Gln metabolism in both TCGA and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>). Moreover, SurvExpress survival analysis of 381 TCGA samples indicated that the dysregulation of Gln metabolism genes correlated with poor prognosis of human liver cancer patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the liver cancers of poor prognosis have upregulated glutamine metabolism, which may indicate an increased requirement for Gln in HCC tumors.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Liver cancer is addicted to glutamine.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) A total of 11 liver cancer cell lines were cultured with 4 mM glutamine (Gln+) or glutamine deprivation (Gln-).

We first analyzed the expression levels of GLS1 in the GSE14520 cohort (n = 229), which provides data on gene expression for both paired human non-tumor and HCC tissues. The results indicate that mRNA levels of GLS1 are significantly increased in HCC tissues compared to non-tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Among the 229 paired samples, the GLS1 level is increased to more than double in about 55% of HCC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Next, we analyzed the association between GLS1 level and prognosis of liver cancer patients. TCGA data indicated that the high mRNA level of GLS1 correlated with the poor prognosis of human liver cancer patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We also analyzed GLS1 expression using a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 377 HCC specimens by IHC analysis. HCC patients were classified into two groups: GLS1<sup>low</sup> group (n = 175) and GLS1<sup>high</sup> group (n = 202). The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicates that HCC patients with high protein expression of GLS1 exhibit worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) as compared to patients with low protein expression of GLS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e and f</xref>). To explore the therapeutic effect of GLS1 inhibitor CB-839 on liver cancer cells, we treated the panel of 11 liver cancer cell lines with increasing concentrations of CB-839 in long-term colony formation assays and short-term CellTiter-Blue cell viability assays. We found that CB-839 treatment only severely impaired the proliferation of three GD cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g and h</xref>). Other six GD cell lines and two GID cell lines only showed little response to CB-839 treatment in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g and h</xref>). We also analyzed the correlation between CB-839 sensitivity and expression level of its target and found no correlation between protein level of GLS1 and CB-839 sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g, h and i</xref>). In addition, the protein level of GLS1 was not correlated to Gln addiction in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2i</xref>), indicating that Gln addiction to liver cancer cells is not dependent on GLS1 level. These data suggest that targeting glutamine metabolism by GLS1 inhibitor CB-839 alone is insufficient for liver cancer therapy.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 monotherapy shows an insufficient anti-tumor effect in liver cancer.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) mRNA levels of GLS1 in the cohort of GSE14520 (n = 229; probe for GLS1: 203159_at; N: nontumor tissues, T: tumor tissues).

To study this in more detail, we investigated metabolite profiles of two GD liver cancer cell lines, SNU398 and HepG2. A total of 66 named metabolites were identified and mapped to seven major pathways. We found that CB-839 treatment significantly decreased a number of key downstream metabolites involved in Gln metabolism, such as glutamate (GLU), TCA cycle intermediate (α-KG), redox metabolite (glutathione, NADPH) in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that CB-839 efficiently blocks Gln utilization and interferes with the dynamic changes of intermediates in Gln metabolism. Therefore, we hypothesized that CB-839 treatment already caused metabolic vulnerability, which could further be exploited for cancer therapy if co-treated with other anti-metabolic drugs. To prove this, we generated a chemical library consisting of 13 compounds inhibiting a variety of tumor metabolism targets, and tested their ability to enhance the anti-tumor effect of CB-839. Notably, we found that V-9302, a novel inhibitor of Gln transporter ASCT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schulte et al., 2018</xref>), is the most potent agent in sensitizing both SNU398 and HepG2 GD liver cancer cells to CB-839 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>). To study whether this combination has a broad anti-proliferative effect in liver cancer cells, we tested cell viability and proliferation in a panel of liver cancer cell lines after single drug or combination treatment with CB-839 and V-9302 in vitro. Indeed, the combination showed synergistic anti-proliferation effect in GD cell lines, but only showed limited anti-tumor effect in GID cell lines in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b and c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, similar results were observed in these cell lines when combining V-9302 with another GLS1 inhibitor BPTES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These findings suggest that the combination of GLS1 inhibitors and V-9302 could be a novel therapeutic approach for GD liver cancer cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A compounds screen identifies ASCT-2 inhibitor V-9302 sensitizing GD liver cancer cells to CB-839 treatment.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Heatmap representation of 66 metabolites between treated and untreated groups.

Several studies have attributed glutathione (GSH) synthesis and ROS stress with dysregulation of ASCT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schulte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). To investigate whether the combination of CB-839 and V-9302 can disrupt the ROS balance in liver cancer, we first analyzed the GSH levels after single-drug treatment or combination in SNU398 and HepG2 cells, respectively. The results show that CB-839 or V-9302 alone significantly decreased the level of GSH, while the combination resulted in a further decrease in GSH in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). GSH is an important antioxidant that acts as a free radical scavenger upon its reaction with ROS in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bansal and Simon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Okazaki et al., 2017</xref>), raising the possibility that combination of CB-839 and V-9302 may interfere with ROS homeostasis of these liver cancer cells. Analysis of intracellular ROS levels showed that single agent CB-839 or V-9302 only modestly increased the ROS production. However, their combination dramatically increased the already-elevated ROS production, reaching a level that caused severe DNA damage, as evidenced by an increase in γ-H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b and c</xref>). To determine whether the combination inhibited cell viability and proliferation of liver cancer cells via the excessive ROS production, we treated these cells with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). The results show that NAC treatment rescued the cell viability and proliferation of SNU398 and HepG2 cells in the presence of both CB-839 and V-9302 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d and e</xref>). Moreover, the strong synergistic induction of apoptosis can be rescued by NAC treatment in both SNU398 and HepG2 cells, as indicated by the IncuCyte caspase-3/7 apoptosis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). These results suggest a model explaining the synergistic effect between CB-839 and V-9302 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>): GLS1 inhibition by CB-839 reduces mitochondrial Glu level, which decreases TCA-dependent NADPH production, elevating glutathione oxidation. Besides, CB-839 also decreases intracellular Glu that is essential for cystine import by xCT, a cystine/glutamate antiporter, thus cutting down the cysteine conversion that in turn serves as the rate-limiting precursor for GSH biosynthesis. CB-839 treated cells are vulnerable to other perturbations that further deplete glutamine anaplerosis, such as blockage of major Gln transporter ASCT-2 by V-9302. Collectively, these results indicate that the combination of CB-839 and V-9302 achieves a synergistic anti-tumor effect in liver cancer via disrupting the GSH/ROS balance.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Combination of CB-839 and V-9302 depletes GSH and induces lethal ROS levels in GD liver cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Intracellular GSH levels were measured by LC/MS-MS in SNU398 and HepG2 cells treated with indicated drugs for 48 hr, respectively.

For example, de novo pyrimidine synthesis was identified as a metabolic vulnerability of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), suggesting that inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis could sensitize TNBC to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer cells can also be exploited to address drug resistance. Cisplatin-resistant cancer cells were found to be strongly dependent on glutamine for nucleotide biosynthesis and therefore became exquisitely sensitive to treatment with antimetabolites that target nucleoside metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Obrist et al., 2018</xref>). These findings highlight the possibility of precisely directing the metabolic therapeutics to certain cancer types through identification of their metabolic vulnerabilities.</p><p>Liver cancer remains one of the most difficult cancer types to treat due to a paucity of drugs that target critical dependencies and broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors like sorafenib and lenvatinib provide only a modest survival benefit to HCC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lau, 2008</xref>). Exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities may represent a promising strategy for the treatment of liver cancer. Liver cancer has a metabolic dependency on glutamine. The HGF-MET axis was reported to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) activity but activate GLS to facilitate glutaminolysis in multiple liver cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Another study reported that the downregulation of Sirtuin four in liver cancer promoted HCC tumorigenesis via enhancing glutamine metabolism and regulating ADP/AMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, MYC-induced mouse liver tumors had increased GLS expression and decreased glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) expression relative to surrounding tissues, exhibiting elevated Gln catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>). Consistently, our study showed that the vast majority of liver cancer cell lines was highly addicted to exogenous Gln in vitro, and the majority of Gln metabolism-related genes was upregulated in tumor tissues of HCC patients. A previous study showed that targeting GLS could attenuate the stemness properties of HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2019</xref>), indicating the possible application of GLS inhibitors in HCC. However, single-drug treatment of CB-839 only showed a very limited anti-tumor effect in most GD liver cancer cells. High-throughput screenings, such as genome-wide CRISPR screen, should be applied to discover the functionally important genes responsible for glutamine dependence or CB-839 sensitivity in liver cancer. The metabolome analysis revealed that CB-839 treatment already caused strong depletion of several key metabolites involved in Gln metabolism (such as GSH), which did not recover even after 24 hr of drug treatment, indicating a possible persistent metabolic vulnerability in the presence of CB-839. This metabolic vulnerability was further exacerbated by ASCT2 inhibitor V-9302, as a result of a further decrease in GSH levels and a lethal increase in the already-elevated levels of ROS. This synergistic effect may be explained by dual inhibition of Gln metabolism. On the one hand, GLS inhibition by CB-839 prevents glutamate production, a direct precursor of GSH synthesis, as well as cystine/glutamate exchange by xCT, leading to a decrease in cystine, another essential precursor for GSH synthesis. On the other hand, pharmacological blockade of the primary transporter of glutamine ASCT2 can decrease the uptake of extracellular glutamine, leading to the shortage of Gln supply and GSH synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schulte et al., 2018</xref>). However, there is still some debate about the target selectivity of V-9302 for ASCT2. Broer et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelika et al., 2018</xref>) reported that V-9302 did not inhibit ASCT2 and glutamine uptake, but rather blocked sodium-neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2) and the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). Interestingly, it has been reported that, in addition to ASCT2, both SNAT2 and LAT1 also can mediate glutamine uptake in most cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bröer and Bröer, 2017</xref>). Thus, the depression of glutamine uptake by V-9302 remains to be further investigated. Impressively, we find that the CB-839 induced metabolic vulnerability also can be further enhanced by other several anti-metabolic drugs such as OXPHOS inhibitor IACS-10759, PPP inhibitor DHEA, and PHGDH inhibitor NCT503 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). This observation suggests the possibility of developing other new combination strategies against liver cancer based on CB-839. However, it is worth noting that our in vitro study was performed over physiological glutamine concentrations, occurring at concentrations that may not be experienced in solid tumors.</p><p>The liver clears almost all of the portal vein ammonia, converting it into glutamine and urea, preventing entry into the systemic circulation. Chronic liver disease has impaired liver function and usually leads to dysfunction of ammonia metabolism. For example, there is a general correlation between higher levels of ammonia and more severe encephalopathy in cirrhosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Olde Damink et al., 2002</xref>). As a mitochondrial enzyme, GLS plays important roles in liver ammonia metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Botman et al., 2014</xref>). There are two distinct isoforms of GLS, GLS1 and GLS2, which possess discrete tissue distribution, structural properties, and molecular regulation. The <italic>GLS1</italic> gene encodes two isoforms, kidney-type glutaminase (KGA, long transcript isoform) and the glutaminase C (GAC, short transcript isoform), which are expressed in kidneys and in a variety of other tissues including cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Katt et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, we found that the GLS1 expression level was significantly increased in HCC tissues. The <italic>GLS2</italic> gene is strongly expressed and active in periportal hepatocytes, where they generate glutamate and release ammonia for urea synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Katt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curthoys and Watford, 1995</xref>). Interestingly enough, CB-839 selectively inhibits GLS1 but not GLS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gross et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, although many HCC patients co-exist liver disease and thus usually have impaired ammonia metabolism, GLS inhibition by CB-839 treatment is less likely to pose a problem for these patients.</p><p>The advantage of metabolism-targeted therapies is the ability to non-invasively assess the activity of the metabolic pathway in mouse models and even in the clinic. Recently, a voltage-sensitive, positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer known as <sup>18</sup>F-BnTP was developed to measure mitochondrial membrane potential in non-small-cell lung cancer. It was found that only mouse tumors with a high uptake of <sup>18</sup>F-BnTP showed marked growth suppression when treated with oxidative-phosphorylation inhibitor IACS-010759 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Momcilovic et al., 2019</xref>). Another example is the widespread use of a radioisotope labeled glucose analog, [18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG), in clinical use for diagnosing and staging cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kelloff et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nair et al., 2012</xref>). <sup>18</sup>F-FDG undergoes cellular uptake via the same pathway as glucose but becomes trapped intracellularly after phosphorylation by hexokinase, which can be visualized by PET imaging and used to detect glucose uptake in tumors. In our study, we find that the combination of CB-839 and V-9302 only shows synergy in liver tumors that are addicted to Gln. It suggests that measuring Gln uptake or Gln addiction is of potential importance for selecting patients that might benefit from this combination. One way to accomplish this is to test the Gln dependence of tumor cells in vitro, which might be consistent with their metabolic dependence in vivo. A more accurate and practical approach is developing a Gln-based PET imaging agent. The Gln tracers 5-<sup>11</sup>C-(2S)-glutamine (<sup>11</sup>C-Gln) and <sup>18</sup>F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine (<sup>18</sup>F-(2S,4R)4-FGln) provide useful tools for probing and monitoring in vivo metabolism of Gln (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Tracer <sup>11</sup>C-Gln was shown to visualize glutaminolytic tumors in vivo as a metabolic marker for probing glutamine-addicted tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qu et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, <sup>18</sup>F-(2S,4R)4-FGln PET was reported to track cellular Gln pool size in breast cancers with differential GLS activity and applied as a response marker for CB-839 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the development of isotope-labeled Gln PET imaging may facilitate the translation of the drug combination strategy described here through the identification of those patients that are most likely to benefit.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Hep3B</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">Cat#:HB-8064</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Huh7</td><td valign="top">JCRB</td><td valign="top">Cat#:JCRB0403;

Patients were not subjected to any preoperative anticancer treatment. Ethical approval was obtained from the Eastern Hepatobiliary Hospital Research Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed according to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from HCC patients were probed with the GLS1 antibody (12855–1-AP, Proteintech). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples were also obtained from xenograft tumors and probed with antibodies against Ki-67 (sc-23900, Santa Cruz), against γH2AX (#9718) and cleaved caspase-3 (ab2303, Abcam). Following incubation with the primary antibodies, positive cells were visualized using DAB+ as a chromogen.</p><p>Semiquantitative scores were used to analyze the immunostaining of each HCC case in tissue microarray. Intensity score of staining was categorized into 0 (-), 1 (+), 2 (++), or 3 (+++), denoting negative, weak, moderate, or strong staining, respectively. Percentage score of immunostaining was categorized into 0 (0–5%), 1 (6–25%), 2 (26–50%), 3 (51–75%), or 4 (&gt;76%) based on the percentage of positive cells. Three random microscope fields per tissue were calculated. The sum of intensity and percentage of staining was used as the final score of expression level and determined by the formula: final score = intensity score × percentage score. The final score of ≤4 was defined as a low expression of GLS1 and &gt;4 as a high expression of GLS1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Metabolomics</title><p>Cells were cultured in 6-well plates until 60% confluent.

After washing with ice-cold PBS, metabolites were extracted from cells in 0.5 mL lysis buffer containing methanol/acetonitrile/dH<sub>2</sub>O (2:2:1). Samples were spun at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants were collected for LC-MS analysis.</p><p>LC-MS analysis was performed on an Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 autosampler and pump (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The MS operated in polarity-switching mode with spray voltages of 4.5 and −3.5 kV. Metabolites were separated using a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC Columns (2.1 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm, guard column 2.1 mm × 20 mm, 5 μm; Merck) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile and eluent A [20 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 0.1% NH<sub>4</sub>OH in ULC/MS grade water (Biosolve)]. The flow rate was set at 150 μL/min. Metabolites were identified and quantified using LCQUANTM Quantitative Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on the basis of exact mass within 5 ppm and further validated by concordance with retention times of standards. Metabolites were quantified using LCQUANTM Quantitative Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peak intensities were normalized based on median peak intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Compound screen</title><p>SNU398 and HepG2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates, respectively. A total of 13 compounds inhibiting a variety of druggable tumor metabolism targets were independently added into the plates at a certain concentration gradient, and cultured for 4 d. Then IC50 concentrations for each compound were analyzed. Then, SNU398 and HepG2 cells were firstly treated with 4 and 8 μM CB-839, respectively, and further treated with IC50 concentrations of each compound. For the compound has IC50 ≥100 μM, the concentration of 100 μM was used. For 2-DG, a routine concentration at the mM level was used. The synergistic viability inhibition was analyzed using the following formula: synergistic inhibition = inhibition of combination –﻿ inhibition of CB-839 × (1 + inhibition of candidate compound).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Xenografts model</title><p>All animals were manipulated according to protocols approved by the Shanghai Medical Experimental Animal Care Commission and the Shanghai Cancer Institute.

They first confirm a previously observed dependency on glutamine in the media for most liver cancer cell lines to grow in culture, and note that this does not translate into sensitivity to the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839. Through a small molecule screen, they find that V-9302, thought to inhibit the neutral amino acid transporter ASCT2, synergizes with CB-839 in four of the seven glutamine-dependent models that did not respond strongly to CB-839. They show that the combination drug treatment decreases glutathione levels and increases intracellular ROS, and treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine provides a partial rescue, suggesting that glutathione depletion is a major liability of glutamine starvation in liver cancer cells. Finally, they observe the drug combination results in ~40% lower tumor volume and increased expression of markers of DNA damage and apoptosis in xenograft models.</p><p>The result that liver cancer cells respond heterogeneously to glutaminase inhibition is interesting, and fits with glutamine having other fates, including glutathione, that are independent of glutaminase. This is a nice point as many equate glutaminase and glutamine dependency, and the point could be better discussed. Some additional suggestions include:</p><p>1) A major questions raised by this work is what underlies such differential sensitivity to targeting of glutamine metabolism across the cells considered. While they understandably focus on the responders, is there any clue as to how they differ from the non-responders? Perhaps there are clues from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and the Dependency Map (depmap.org), or based on mutational status or gene expression?</p><p>2) Recent work (Broer et al. Front Pharmacol 2018) has suggested that V-9302 is not selective for ASCT2 and instead binds other amino acid transporters such as SNAT2 and LAT1, and that V-9302 could be acting by inhibiting uptake of other amino acids. Are data available as to how much V-9302 reduces glutamine uptake from media?</p><p>3) It would be useful as a resource for the field if all metabolites shown in Figure 3A were labeled and/or presented in a supplementary figure.</p><p>4) As a minor point, suggesting CB-839 is increasingly used to treat cancer in combination is potentially misleading. It is being tested in many trials, but is not yet proven to be effective consistently in any cancer.</p><p>5) How were the 4 GD cell lines to test the combination chosen? If data are available for other cells, including the GID lines, that information should be included.</p><p>6) The authors might consider that invoking TCA-cycle dependent NADPH production as an explanation for why ROS is increased with the drug combination is potentially inconsistent with the NAC rescue. NADPH is also required to keep NAC reduced in cells similarly to GSH.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Following analysis of glutamine metabolism in HCC cell lines, and bioinformatics analysis of human HCC Haojie Jin et al. revealed that combined inhibition of mitochondrial glutaminase (GLS) and the glutamine transporter ASCT2, potently inhibits growth of many human HCC cell lines. Two different inhibitors of ASCT2 were similarly potent in combination with CB-839 – a GLS inhibitor. The combination increased depleted glutathione levels, increased ROS levels, and increased DNA damage marker levels and apoptosis. The latter were dependent on ROS as NAC treatment abolished the DDR and apoptosis. The same combination was tested in vivo, with seemingly good tolerability, and resulted in a twofold reduction in tumor volume, which was much better than each of the drugs alone.</p><p>Tumor metabolism is gaining interest lending hope that metabolic interventions will move into the treatment arena. Parenthetically, they are already there for many years as many of the classic chemotherapy drugs are &quot;metabolic&quot; molecules, interfering with nucleoside metabolism, lending hope that this is indeed a productive path to follow. HCC incidence is rapidly rising, and there are so far no treatments that really succeed in reducing mortality. Thus, the manuscript brings together two highly important topics and reveal a novel metabolic vulnerability of HCC.</p><p>1) Glutamine synthetase is overexpressed in HCC, and catalyzes the reverse reaction from GLS, so there should be sufficient levels of cytoplasmic glutamine. ASCT1 is expressed on both the cell membrane and mitochondrial membrane, using two different splice variants (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.11.020), which can be discriminated by Western blot. I wonder whether the differential sensitivity of the different cell lines relates to the relative abundance of the two ASCT1 variants. This could strengthen the hypothesis that the drug combination targets mitochondrial glutamine metabolism.</p><p>2) GLS1 is a mitochondrial enzyme which is predominantly expressed at the periportal zone of the liver acinus. It plays key roles in ammonia metabolism. This could pose a problem for patients with HCC, in many of which ammonia metabolism is already impaired due to co-existing liver disease. The authors should at least discuss this issue, or possibly test ammonia levels in mice treated with the different drug combinations.</p><p>3) β–catenin is mutated in a significant number of human HCCs and directly regulates hepatocyte glutamine metabolism. Could the authors correlate β-catenin mutation in the cell line and human cohorts with CB-839 response and glutamine metabolism respectively?</p><p>4) The authors tested whether 13 different &quot;metabolic drugs&quot; synergized with CB-839. Can they elaborate on how these were selected?</p><p>5) In Figure 5 the effects on glutathione seems additive, while the effects on ROS and gH2AX are clearly synergistic. This indicates that there could be other reasons for the ROS, gH2AX effects. While NAC treatment indicates that ROS are causal in gH2AX and apoptosis, it doesn't directly implicate glutathione depletion as the cause for increased ROS. The interpretation of the data should be changed accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56749.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please see comments from both reviewers below.

To further confirm the synergistic effect on glutathione levels, we treated the SNU398 cells and HepG2 cells with CB-839, V-9302, or their combination for 48 hours and measured the intracellular glutathione levels. These new data are now shown in Figure 5A of the revised manuscript. In short, we observe that the combination of CB-839 and V-9302 caused an obvious synergistic reduction in glutathione levels after 48 hours of drug treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Reviewer 2 noted that the NAC effect in Figure 5F is not dramatic, and not dose dependent in HEPG2 cells.

However, we still cannot observe clear dose dependent rescue, which suggests that the lower concentration of NAC (1.25 mM) is sufficient to achieve maximal effect in HepG2 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Please address additional points of clarification raised by the reviewers:</p><p>– All metabolites shown in Figure 3A should be more clearly labeled and/or presented in a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, all metabolites shown in Figure 3A are now presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and we also provide the related source file.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Make clear that KGA/GAC represent different splice forms of GLS.</p></disp-quote><p>We have stated that KGA/GAC represent two different splice forms of GLS in the revised manuscript (Discussion and subsection “Compounds and antibodies”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Discuss levels of glutamine in media relative to those in blood.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers mentioned, the normal concentration of glutamine in human plasma is usually around 0.6-0.9mM[1]. In tissues, such as the liver and the skeletal muscles, glutamine concentration is even higher than in plasma[4]. Considering the fact that glutamine is easily broken down in vitro, it is difficult to mimic the glutamine concentration of the tumor microenvironment in 2D culture models over time. To maintain the best viability of tumor cells in vitro, we performed all the experiments in normal DMEM medium with sufficient glutamine (4 mM). Similarly, other studies [Schulte et al., 2018; 5] also used normal culture medium with sufficient glutamine to test the drugs response on tumor cells in vitro.
