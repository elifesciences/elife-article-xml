of both innate and adaptive immunity, and results in higher susceptibility to infection and lower response to vaccination. This immune compromise, coupled with greater risk of exposure to infectious disease at hemodialysis (HD) centers, underscores the need for examination of the immune response to the COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>The immune response to the COVID-19 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was assessed in 20 HD patients and cohort-matched controls. RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed longitudinally before and after each vaccination dose for a total of six time points per subject. Anti-spike antibody levels were quantified prior to the first vaccination dose (V1D0) and 7 d after the second dose (V2D7) using anti-spike IgG titers and antibody neutralization assays. Anti-spike IgG titers were additionally quantified 6 mo after initial vaccination. Clinical history and lab values in HD patients were obtained to identify predictors of vaccination response.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated differing time courses of immune responses, with prolonged myeloid cell activity in HD at 1 wk after the first vaccination dose. HD also demonstrated decreased metabolic activity and decreased antigen presentation compared to controls after the second vaccination dose. Anti-spike IgG titers and neutralizing function were substantially elevated in both controls and HD at V2D7, with a small but significant reduction in titers in HD groups (p&lt;0.05). Anti-spike IgG remained elevated above baseline at 6 mo in both subject groups. Anti-spike IgG titers at V2D7 were highly predictive of 6-month titer levels. Transcriptomic biomarkers after the second vaccination dose and clinical biomarkers including ferritin levels were found to be predictive of antibody development.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Overall, we demonstrate differing time courses of immune responses to the BTN162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in maintenance HD subjects comparable to healthy controls and identify transcriptomic and clinical predictors of anti-spike IgG titers in HD. Analyzing vaccination as an in vivo perturbation, our results warrant further characterization of the immune dysregulation of ESRD.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>F30HD102093, F30HL151182, T32HL144909, R01HL138628.

The most used form of renal replacement therapy for ESRD patients in the United States is hemodialysis (HD). Despite significant improvements in HD technology, the mortality rate in ESRD patients is still as high as 20% annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Williams et al., 2004</xref>), with infections being the most common cause of hospitalization and mortality after cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2008</xref>). The immunocompromised state of ESRD is characterized by simultaneous immunodepression due to the impact of uremic milieu on immunocompetent cells and immunoactivation due to the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2008</xref>). There are alterations to both innate and adaptive immunity, including elevated levels of mannose-binding lectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Satomura et al., 2002</xref>), impaired maturation of monocytes and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Satomura et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lim et al., 2007</xref>), increased B cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernández-Fresnedo et al., 2000</xref>), and decreased T-cell proliferation with elevated Th1/Th2 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stenvinkel et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Studies of genome-wide expression (i.e., transcriptome) profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in ESRD demonstrate a complex picture of immune alterations. One study found upregulation of genes involved in the complement and oxidative metabolism pathways, and downregulation of genes associated with the clathrin-coated vesicle endosomal pathway and T-cell receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scherer et al., 2013</xref>). Two other studies have demonstrated impaired expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Granata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). A study identifying a group of inflammatory genes playing a causative role in oxidative stress in dialysis patients showed unique gene expression alterations in maintenance HD patients compared to un-dialyzed CKD patients and compared to patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zaza et al., 2008</xref>). These studies indicate a range of immune pathways that may impair vaccination response, and further suggest that dialysis leads to unique immune profile alterations. These alterations may lead to higher susceptibility to infection and lower response to vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghadiani et al., 2012</xref>). For example, while more than 90% of patients without CKD develop protective antibodies against HBV after vaccination, only 50–60% of patients with ESRD seroconvert. There have also been higher vaccination failure rates demonstrated against influenza virus, <italic>Clostridium tetani</italic>, and <italic>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</italic> in ESRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eleftheriadis et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the immune response to vaccines in ESRD is particularly important for the new mRNA vaccines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have proven to be efficacious in non-immunocompromised individuals, with initial reports showing 95 and 94.1% reduction of COVID-19 disease in recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Polack et al., 2020</xref>). However, certain immunosuppressed populations remain at risk of infection. Given the widespread transmission of COVID-19, detailed assessments of degree, duration, and determinants of immune protection conferred by these vaccines are vitally needed in immunocompromised patient populations including those with ESRD.</p><p>While recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 BTN162b2 vaccine in HD demonstrate high levels of seroconversion ranging from 84 to 96% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grupper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jahn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attias et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2021</xref>), they also demonstrate quantitatively reduced SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We posit that characterization of the transcriptomic underpinnings of antibody titer development on a continuous scale may identify biomarkers for weaker or less durable immune protection in this population. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses may identify strategies for the development of new, effective vaccines against other infectious diseases for this population. Thus, we characterized the immune response of the HD population to the COVID-19 mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine using mRNA sequencing, anti-spike antibody ELISA, and neutralization titers across multiple time points. We then integrated these data to identify transcriptomic and clinical determinants of the humoral immune response in HD patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study population and sample acquisition</title><p>The study was approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago IRB (#2018-1038) Ethics Review Committee. Maintenance HD patients undergoing vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021 were recruited from the outpatient HD unit at the University of Illinois Hospital (UIH) in Chicago, IL. Control subjects consisted of UIH employees undergoing BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination at UIH from December 2020 to January 2021 with no self-reported history of kidney disease or immune disorders. All subjects provided informed consent for participation in this research and for publication of results. A subset of control subjects matched for age, gender, and COVID-19 history was also analyzed for this study. Blood was collected at 0–48 hr prior to and at multiple time points after both the first (V1) and second vaccination doses (V2), which were administered 3 wk apart. Control samples were collected prior to each vaccination dose (D0) and at 1 d (D1) and 7 d (D7) after each dose, corresponding to six time points: V1D0, V1D1, V1D7, V2D0, V2D1, and V2D7.

Specifically, the first principal component of each BTM was calculated using DESeq2-derived variance-stabilized gene counts from each module’s member genes across the HD V1 time points, and then across the HD V2 time points. Signs (positive or negative) were assigned to the eigengenes such that samples with higher expression of member genes in a BTM would be given a positive sign, while those with lower overall gene expression would be given a negative sign. This was accomplished for each BTM by (1) computing the median gene expression level across membership genes in a given BTM for each sample, (2) computing the Pearson correlation between the eigengene of the BTM and the median gene expression level across all samples, and (3) multiplying the eigengene of the BTM by –1 if the correlation was negative.</p><p>Subsequently, we constructed linear models with log-transformed anti-spike IgG at V2D7 as the dependent variable and change in BTM eigengene expression after vaccination as the independent variable, controlling for SARS-CoV-2 history. Separate models were constructed for each BTM that was enriched at each time point after vaccination in HD (V1D2 vs. V1D0, V1D7 vs. V1D0, V2D2 vs. V2D0, V2D0 V2D7).

Controls demonstrated expected transitions from early type I interferon and myeloid activity to T cell activity after the first vaccination dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The predominant positive enrichment of T cell modules in controls at 1 wk after the first vaccination dose (V1D7) was contrasted with predominant positive enrichment of myeloid modules in HD at V1D7. Interestingly, HD showed prolonged upregulation of myeloid activity at V1D7, while controls showed downregulation of these modules at V1D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, these observations indicate delayed resolution of innate myeloid responses in the HD cohort and suggest diminished transition to an adaptive immune response.</p><p>Following the second vaccination dose, both groups demonstrated early enrichment of innate immune modules, with HC alone transitioning to a plasma cell response by V2D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Direct group comparisons at V2D7 did not show differences of plasma cell response, but metabolic activity was decreased in HD compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Further, HD demonstrated increased V2D7 expression compared to controls of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member BH3, a mediator of lymphocyte apoptosis. A prior study showed accelerated in vitro apoptosis of lymphocytes in uremia, with a particularly pronounced effect on B cells, mediated by dysregulation of Bcl-2. These results suggest a state of heightened cellular stress in HD after vaccination leading to increased apoptotic signaling.</p><p>Despite differing transcriptomic time courses in the two group, our results demonstrate significant elevation of anti-spike IgG titers after two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in both HD and controls. HD demonstrated only a slight decrease of IgG levels at V2D7 when controlling for SARS-CoV-2 history (p&lt;0.05) and no statistically significant difference at 6 mo. Prior studies comparing short-term antibody response to BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in HD versus controls find antibody response rates of 84–96% in HD after two vaccination doses, but with lower mean IgG levels compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grupper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jahn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attias et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agur et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longlune et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drakesmith et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, the HD population studied here is younger and more racially and ethnically diverse. The average age of HD cohorts in prior studies was predominantly in the 60s, compared to an average age of 54 in our study. Jahn et al. found in a subset analysis that HD patients under 60 y of age responded equally to healthy controls, suggesting an interaction between increasing age and less effective antibody response in HD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jahn et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>HD subjects with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to vaccination had wider variance of antibody titers at all time points in this study, with two subjects demonstrating V1D0 antibody titer levels similar to that of uninfected subjects. These two subjects consistently had the lowest titer levels at V2D7 and M6 within the group of previously infected subjects and amongst the lowest titers across all subjects. One subject is the oldest enrolled patient, and both are diagnosed with hyperlipidemia.</p><p>Given previously and presently demonstrated the wider variance of protective immune responses in HD and altered interactions with risk factors including age, it is valuable to identify predictors of the strength of immune response to vaccination in this population. We identified both transcriptomic and clinical predictors of anti-spike IgG development at both V2D7 and 6 mo after the second vaccination dose (M6). Increased gene expression of blood transcription modules (BTMs) including monocyte activity, dendritic cell and antigen presentation activity, IFN type I activity, and T cell activation 2 d after the second vaccination dose (V2D2) in HD were predictive of V2D7 anti-spike IgG. Additionally, increased expression of PLK1 signaling events, indicating increased cell cycle activity, at V2D7 was predictive of V2D7 and M6 anti-spike IgG. Clinically, serum ferritin values in the intermediate range at baseline predicted stronger anti-spike IgG development. A prior study of 58,058 maintenance HD subjects found serum ferritin levels between 200 and 1200 ng/ml to be associated with lower all-cause mortality due to ferritin &lt;200 ng/ml representing low iron status, and &gt;1200 ng/ml representing a hyper-inflammatory state due to ferritin’s status as an acute phase reactant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalantar-Zadeh et al., 2005</xref>). Iron deficiency has been linked to impaired immune response and vaccine efficacy in other infections, while inflammation induces macrophage release of the heavy chain component of ferritin, FTH, which has been reported to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drakesmith et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kernan and Carcillo, 2017</xref>). Additionally, increased LFC in WBC count 1–3 wk after vaccination was predictive of higher antibody titers.</p><p>Our study is limited by different early time points between controls and HD (day 1 vs. day 2 after each vaccination dose), sample size particularly when subdividing SARS-CoV-2 history, and differing racial profiles of the control and HD cohort. The smaller sample size additionally limits our ability to characterize differential immune pathways in clinical subsets of the dialysis population, such as those with low, medium, and high baseline ferritin levels. Our small sample size precludes a validation cohort to validate the study’s results. We also cannot exclude the likelihood that these results are driven in part by immune dysregulation from diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia. While we did not exclude these in recruitment of our control cohort, subjects in the HD cohort are inevitably disproportionately affected by these conditions. Future studies are needed for more comprehensive characterization of the immune pathway recruitment in response to the COVID-19 vaccinations in this population. It will be of further interest to characterize immune responses dependent on etiology of ESRD (i.e., hypertension vs. diabetes mellitus), as well as amount of time spent on hemodialysis, as this study was not sufficiently powered to disentangle these differences.</p><p>The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have proven more efficacious than other vaccines in the ESRD population, both for COVID-19 and for other infectious diseases; for example, there has been an inconsistent antibody response in HD to the adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S compared to mRNA vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunelli et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, while more than 90% of patients without chronic kidney disease develop protective antibodies against hepatitis B after vaccination, only 50–60% of patients with ESRD seroconvert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eleftheriadis et al., 2007</xref>). One explanation is that, in mRNA vaccines, the mRNA both encodes the viral antigen and acts as an adjuvant due to its innate immunostimulatory properties; the mRNA is recognized by endosomal and cytosolic innate sensors upon cell entry, resulting in cellular activation and production of type I interferons and other inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Teijaro and Farber, 2021</xref>). This elevated innate immune stimulus could overcome immune desensitization in ESRD, evidenced by diminished TLR4 expression on monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koc et al., 2011</xref>) and downregulation of activating receptors on natural killer cells in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagai, 2021</xref>). If so, the mRNA vaccine delivery vehicle could prove particularly valuable in vaccine development for ESRD and HD going forward.</p><p>Overall, we demonstrate differing time courses of immune responses to the BTN162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in maintenance HD subjects and identify transcriptomic and clinical predictors of anti-spike IgG titers in HD. Given the efficacy of this vaccination in our HD cohort, the differential transcriptomic responses likely represent immune alterations with subclinical effects on humoral immune response to the BTN162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Our results warrant further characterization of the immune dysregulation of ESRD and of immune biomarkers that underlie efficacious immune responses to vaccination in this population.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Received a grant from Janssen.

We have combined original figures 1,2,3 into Figure 1 (A, B, and C). From original figure 1, we have also eliminated most of the figure panes, only retaining the numbers of differentially expressed genes at each time point for hemodialysis with and without SARS-CoV-2 history. The data that has been removed from original figure 1 is now summarized in the text and included as supplemental figure S1.</p><p>“For HC, the largest number of DEGs is found at V2D1 (3974), indicating the most transcriptional activity immediately after the 2<sup>nd</sup> vaccine dose, followed by V2D7 (177), V1D1 (128), and V1D7 (10). HD follows a similar pattern, with the largest number of DEGs found at V2D2 (1111), followed by V2D7 (153), V1D2 (68), and V1D7 (8).” We have also removed extraneous data from original Figure 3 and presented the data in a more digestible format (as Figure 1C). We have also reworded parts of the new figure legend for Figure 1A-C to summarize conclusions more clearly.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4, the figure in my mind concludes that dialysis patients have a statistically similar response to controls. That point is lost in the results and the text of the figure. Moreover, the legend, coloring scheme, and naming could be improved to enhance readability.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the coloring scheme, legend, and subject naming to enhance readability of this figure (now Figure 2). While both groups did mount a significant antibody response, we did find that membership in the control group was a predictor of anti-spike IgG at V2D7. We have included these statistical results in the legend (in addition to its presence in the text) to clarify these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The exciting finding that T-cell signatures are muted in dialysis patients does not seem clinically supported by any data-ideally, the collection, and analysis of T-cell responses in dialysis patients and controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that the control subject transcriptomic responses are dominated by T and B-cell responses by Day 7 after both the first and second day of vaccination, while HD subject transcriptomic responses continue to be dominated by innate, and in particular myeloid, immune signatures. However, the reviewer is correct that direct comparison of adaptive immune responses at D7 time points between controls and hemodialysis do not reach statistical significance.</p><p>We have revised the Results section in our abstract to state: “Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated differing time courses of immune responses, with prolonged myeloid cell activity in HD at one week after the first vaccination dose. HD also demonstrated decreased metabolic activity and decreased antigen presentation compared to controls after the second vaccination dose.” In our discussion, we state “Overall, these observations indicate delayed resolution of innate myeloid responses in the HD cohort, and suggest diminished transition to an adaptive immune response.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The scientific premise in the discussion was that mRNA might be a superior vaccination methodology compared to traditional protein vaccines. This supposition would be significantly strengthened if there was some comparison made for dialysis patients of more traditional vaccines protein-based like the Ortho vaccine compared to mRNA vaccines in dialysis patients. Please include that in the discussion if data are available from published sources.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a reference to the following study which shows inconsistent antibody response in HD to the Johnson and Johnson adenovirus-based Covid-19 vaccine in comparison to mRNA Covid-19 vaccines:</p><p>Brunelli SM, Sibbel S, Karpinski S, et al. Comparative Effectiveness of mRNA-based BNT162b2 Vaccine versus Adenovirus Vector–Based Ad26.COV2.S Vaccine for the Prevention of COVID-19 among Dialysis Patients. <italic>JASN</italic>. 33(4):688-697. doi: 10.1681/ASN.2021101395</p><p>The following text has been added to the discussion:</p><p>“The Covid-19 mRNA vaccines have proven more efficacious than other vaccines in the ESRD population, both for Covid-19 as well as for other infectious diseases; for example, there has been an inconsistent antibody response in HD to the adenovirus vector-based Covid-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S compared to mRNA vaccines <sup>36</sup>. Additionally, while more than 90% of patients without chronic kidney disease develop protective antibodies against hepatitis B after vaccination, only 50-60% of patients with ESRD seroconvert <sup>9</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>To strengthen this manuscript, the reviewer has some suggestions below:</p><p>1. For publication in eLife Journal, a bigger sample size of both cohorts and matching the number of candidates of different races would be appreciated, although the authors described this weakness in the MS.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this study would be strengthened with a larger number of subjects and better matching of race. We have added the limitation of the differing racial profiles between the control and HD cohorts in our discussion. Unfortunately, the addition of subjects and samples would be challenging at this time. We have included the following text:</p><p>“Our study is limited by different early time points between controls and HD (Day 1 vs Day 2 after each vaccination dose), by sample size particularly when subdividing SARS-CoV-2 history, and by differing racial profiles of the control and HD cohort.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Setting up a validation cohort, either internal or external. Add data or discuss this limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this limitation to our discussion:</p><p>“Our small sample size further precludes a validation cohort to validate the study’s results. Future studies are needed for more comprehensive characterization of the immune pathway recruitment in response to the Covid-19 vaccinations in this population.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Stratifying DM/hypertension/Dyslipidemia patients to compare with those without metabolic diseases in the HD cohort and see how metabolic diseases cause different immune responses in HD patients.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be illuminating to characterize immune differences stratified by etiology of end stage renal disease, as well as by time spent on hemodialysis. We attempted to stratify by DM/hypertension, and to identify differences as a function of months spent on hemodialysis. However, these did not yield meaningful/significant results, most likely d/t lacking sample size. We now include this in our discussion: “It will be of further interest to characterize immune responses dependent on etiology of ESRD (i.e. hypertension vs diabetes mellitus), as well as amount of time spent on hemodialysis, as this study was not sufficiently powered to disentangle these differences.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Do these immune response differences also related to the years and the styles of HD?</p></disp-quote><p>All subjects in the HD cohort received maintenance hemodialysis three times a week, none used peritoneal dialysis. Please see response to #3 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The DM and hypertension candidates in the control cohorts could be deleted. Or the authors need to discuss the limitations in terms of comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We purposefully did not exclude these conditions from our control cohort, as we did not wish for results to be driven by the immune dysregulation of these conditions. However, we do recognize the trade-off with this decision. We would in fact expect more significant findings using a control cohort with these exclusions. We have included this additional text in the discussion:</p><p>“We also cannot exclude the likelihood that these results are driven in part by immune dysregulation from diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia. While we did not exclude these in recruitment of our control cohort, subjects in the HD cohort are inevitably disproportionately affected by these conditions.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
