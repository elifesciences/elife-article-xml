Despite AlphaFold2’s strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2-based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and Induced Fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model-based small-molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different mammalian protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here, we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>artificial intelligence</kwd><kwd>molecular simulation</kwd><kwd>AlphaFold</kwd><kwd>docking</kwd><kwd>enhanced sampling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM142719</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tiwary</surname><given-names>Pratyush</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>AlphaFold2's inability to generate non-native conformations for docking is addressed by AI-molecular dynamics method AlphaFold2-RAVE, which produces Boltzmann-ranked conformations, enabling the retrospective discovery of type II kinase inhibitors.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite the groundbreaking impact of AlphaFold2 (AF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>) on the computational prediction of the ligand-free protein native apo structures, it appears that the determination of high-quality crystal or cryo-EM ligands-bound holo structures remains irreplaceable in the field of structure-based drug design. When ligands bind, residues within the protein pockets may adjust their side-chain rotamer configurations to optimize contacts with ligands, a phenomenon known as the induced fit effect. Furthermore, thermodynamic fluctuations induce protein dynamics and structural flexibility, leading to rearrangements of side-chains and even large-scale backbone movements that can reveal cryptic pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amaro, 2019</xref>). These metastable conformations and associated cryptic pockets can be stabilized upon binding to specific ligands, a phenomenon known as conformational selection. Moreover, due to the similarity of native structures among protein homologs, it has been widely believed that ligands targeting highly diverse metastable conformations should result in better selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2011</xref>). It is thus highly desirable to account for metastable protein conformations or states, instead of investigating native states only. Several AF2-based techniques, including reduced multiple sequence alignment (rMSA) AF2 (or MSA subsampling AF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Alamo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monteiro da Silva et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Porter et al., 2023</xref>), AF2-cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wayment-Steele et al., 2024</xref>), and AlphaFlow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jing et al., 2024</xref>), have been devised to generate distinct decoy structures from native states. However, the suitability of these decoys for subsequent docking and virtual screening remains uncertain. Moreover, accurately assigning Boltzmann weights to decoys produced by those methods lacking a direct physical interpretation is challenging. Such a Boltzmann ranking is critical simply because of the explosion in number of decoys that can be hallucinated from AF2 or future generative AI methods, now including AlphaFold3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>The AF2RAVE protocol integrates rMSA AF2 and the machine learning-based reweighted autoencoded variational Bayes for enhanced sampling (RAVE) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Tiwary, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mehdi et al., 2024</xref>) to systematically explore metastable states and accurately rank structures using Boltzmann weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vani et al., 2023</xref>). Subsequently, traditional grid-based docking methods or recent generative diffusion models, like DiffDock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corso et al., 2022</xref>) and DynamicBind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2024</xref>), can be employed to dock ligands with a few top-ranked structures in metastable states, enabling further virtual screening on large ligand libraries. In this work, we chose the docking method Glide XP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friesner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halgren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friesner et al., 2006</xref>) and Induced Fit docking (IFD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sherman et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sherman et al., 2006b</xref>) from the Schrödinger suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maestro, 2023</xref>) as our primary docking method. By combining these two steps, we propose the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) as an innovative approach for small-molecule drug design, initiated from protein sequences. In this workflow, the conformational selection effect is addressed by probing various metastable states using AF2RAVE. Glide-IFD is then applied to account for the induced fit effect, refine the holo-like pockets further, and predict the ligand-bound holo structures.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A schematic of the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow.</title><p>A schematic of the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow: (<bold>i</bold>) decoy structures generated by reduced multiple sequence alignment (MSA) AlphaFold2 (AF2), (ii) regular space clustering and unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations starting from cluster centers, (<bold>iii</bold>) state predictive information bottleneck model (SPIB, a reweighted autoencoded variational Bayes for enhanced sampling [RAVE] variant) to learn reaction coordinates from unbiased MD, (<bold>iv</bold>) enhanced sampling runs to calculate free energy landscape, (<bold>v</bold>) distinguish holo-like structures from decoys in metastable states based on Boltzmann rank and conduct Glide XP or Induced Fit docking (IFD) on holo-like structures for ligands targeting metastable states.

Protein kinases are involved in the regulation of various cellular pathways by catalyzing the hydrolyzing of ATP and transferring the phosphate group to substrate peptides/proteins. Dysfunctions of various kinases are known to cause human pathologies and cancers. The human genome contains about 500 protein kinases which share highly conserved structures in their catalytic ATP-binding pocket, due to the selection pressure toward functional catalysis. This poses significant challenges in developing selective small-molecule ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors, as they must effectively target the intended kinase while avoiding off-target interactions and associated side effects. Research efforts aimed at achieving selectivity have led to the development of four distinct types of kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Müller et al., 2015</xref>), including two types of ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors: type I inhibitors bind to the ATP-binding site adopting the active catalytic state, while type II inhibitors target the binding pockets adjacent to the ATP-binding site adopting the inactive state. These two states primarily differ in the configurations of their activation loop (A-loop), which is a flexible loop of approximately 20 residues. In the active state, the A-loop is ‘extended’ to create a cleft for substrate peptides to bind, while in the inactive state, it is collapsed or ‘folded’ onto the protein surface, blocking substrate binding. Additionally, in the active state, the three residues ‘Asp-Phe-Gly’ (DFG motif) at the N-terminus of the A-loop bind to an ATP-binding Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, with the Asp side-chain pointing inward to the ATP-binding pocket, while in the inactive state, the Asp side-chain is flipped outward, and the DFG motif adopts the DFG-out conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Modi and Dunbrack, 2019</xref>). Henceforth, we will refer to the type I inhibitor binding state as the active DFG-in state and designate the type II inhibitor binding state as the classical DFG-out state, as previously proposed in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gizzio et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thakur et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gizzio and Thakur, 2024</xref>) (demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> using Abl1 kinase as an example).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DFG-in and DFG-out conformation adopted by DDR1 kinase and their relation with Type I and Type II inhibitors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) structures of Abl1 kinase overlay, comparing the activation loop (A-loop) in the active DFG-in state (red, Protein Data Bank [PDB]: 6XR6) with the classical DFG-out state (blue, PDB: 6XRG). Type I inhibitors target the active DFG-in state, where the DFG motif adopting the DFG-in configuration and the A-loop adopting the ‘extended’ configuration, while type II inhibitors target the classical DFG-out state, where the DFG motif adopting the DFG-out configuration and the A-loop is ‘folded’. The distance between CB atoms of residue N98 (gray bead) and residue R162 (red/blue bead) in Abl1 kinase serves as an order parameter here to illustrate the location of the A-loop. The dashed black block emphasizes the different configurations of the DFG motif in these two states. (<bold>B</bold>) The Dunbrack definition for DFG motif configuration is employed here.

In the following section, we applied AF2RAVE to enrich holo-like structures adopting the classical DFG-out state from the AF2-generated ensembles of DDR1 and Abl1 kinase, and further validated those holo-like structures by docking them with known type II kinase inhibitors. We initiated our investigation by conducting docking experiments involving both type I and type II inhibitors with the AF2 structures of these two kinases. We observed the incapacity of AF2 structures to effectively dock with type II inhibitors targeting the metastable classical DFG-out state. Subsequently, we employed rMSA AF2, an associative memory-like process that generates diverse structure ensembles for both kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Porter et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roney and Ovchinnikov, 2022</xref>), exploring their relatively improved but still limited potential to contain holo-like structures suitable for type II inhibitor binding. Ultimately, our study showcases AF2RAVE’s effectiveness in enhancing the generation and selection of holo-like structures in metastable states by integrating AF2-based ensemble generation with physics-based methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AF2 structures fail to dock with type II kinase inhibitors</title><p>The utility of AF2-generated structures for structure-based drug discovery and virtual screening campaigns has been a subject of controversy and skeptical enthusiasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lyu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holcomb et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scardino et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Díaz-Rovira et al., 2023</xref>). For proteins lacking crystal and cryo-EM structures but with homologous structures available in PDB, such as CDK20 kinase, AF2 demonstrates effectiveness as a homology modeling method for generating initial structures suitable for subsequent virtual screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ren et al., 2023</xref>). Other AF2-based homology modeling method can bias AF2-generated structures toward user-selected template structures with specific druggable conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sala et al., 2023</xref>). However, a significant drop in the hits enrichment factor during virtual screening has been reported when employing AF2 structures as rigid receptors for docking, compared to using holo PDB structures. This occurs even in cases where the binding pockets of AF2 structures differ only slightly at two to three residues, from those of holo PDBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scardino et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Díaz-Rovira et al., 2023</xref>). Given that ligands can induce slight relocation and side-chain rotation of pocket residues upon binding, it is important to note that AF2 does not account for this induced fit effect, as it does not encode co-factors like ligands. Therefore, it appears necessary to perform ligand induced fit modeling or relaxation on AF2 structures before engaging in any further structure-based drug design. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations biased toward adjacent holo-template structure have proved effective in refining apo structures and improving their early enrichment performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guterres et al., 2021</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that AF2 structures can achieve comparable accuracy to crystal holo structures in free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, by superposing AF2 structures with crystal structures, grafting the co-crystallized ligands onto the AF2 structure, and optimizing the AF2 structure/ligand complex to account for subtle induced fit effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beuming et al., 2022</xref>). AF2 structures, decorated with ligands from template ligand grafting method or known-hits docking method, and further refined by Schrödinger IFD-MD protocol, exhibit promising performance in early enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) and the prediction of novel ligand/protein complex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coskun et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, if large backbone motion is not required, it appears feasible to refine the apo pockets in AF2 structures into holo-like pockets for structure-based drug design. However, when AF2 structures exhibit significant steric clashes with holo ligands, especially in cases ligands targeting metastable states, direct application of out-of-the-box AF2 structures in docking methods for virtual screening and early enrichment may pose more challenges. The AF2-predicted kinase structures predominantly exhibit the DFG-in state, with over 95% of human kinases predicted in this conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Modi and Dunbrack, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Masri et al., 2023</xref>). Significant A-loop motion and backbone flipping of the DFG motif are necessary to transition from the AF2-predicted DFG-in state to holo-like states, for type II ligands targeting the classical DFG-out state. As a result, AF2 structures of Abl1/DDR1 kinases exhibit superior performance when docking with type I inhibitors (achieving a minimum ligand RMSD of 2.14 Å) compared to docking with type II inhibitors using Glide XP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Even with Glide’s IFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) and the highly side-chain clashes forgiving docking method DiffDock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>), AF2 structures struggle to dock with these metastable state-targeting ligands (type II inhibitors), with ligand RMSDs above 8 Å across all docking poses from all three docking methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Holo-like metastable structures may be present among decoys generated from rMSA AF2</title><p>AF2-based methods can achieve structural diversity by introducing dropouts in MSA inputs stochastically (rMSA AF2) or in a clustering manner (AF2-cluster). Additionally, models modified from the AF2 framework, such as the flow-match generative model AlphaFlow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jing et al., 2024</xref>), have been developed to explore the diversity of conformational space. Similar protocols to rMSA AF2 have demonstrated the potential to address the induced fit effect by generating diverse structures at the binding pocket, ranging from closed apo pockets to opened holo-like pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meller et al., 2023</xref>). Other investigations have also indicated that larger backbone motions, such as DFG motif backbone flipping and A-loop movement in at least some protein kinases, can be captured by the rMSA AF2 ensemble, although the distributions of conformations deviate significantly from the correct Boltzmann distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vani et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monteiro da Silva et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>In this section, we utilized rMSA AF2 to generate 1280 diverse structures for Abl1 kinase or DDR1 kinase: 640 for MSAs of depth 16 and 32. See Supplementary Material for information regarding Src kinase. Following a filtering step based on RMSD from corresponding AF2 structures, 1198 and 1147 structures remain for Abl1 and DDR1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, for Abl1 kinase, only 4 out of 1198 structures have a folded A-loop, when using a distance cutoff of 15 Å between CB atoms of N98 and R162 in Abl1. However, for DDR1 kinase, 124 out of 1147 rMSA AF2 structures exhibit a folded A-loop, when using a salt bridge distance cutoff of 10 Å between the aligned residue pairs in DDR1 (E110 and R191). We then clustered the A-loop folded structures in the Dunbrack space. For Abl1, only two clusters were identified: one adopts the DFG-in state, and the other adopts the DFG-inter state, referring to an intermediate conformation during the backbone flipping from DFG-in to DFG-out, according to the Dunbrack definition.

To address this gap, we employed enhanced sampling to sample along the SPIB-approximated reaction coordinates and compute the free energy profile inside the classical DFG-out basin. Considering both the flipping of the DFG motif and the overall motion of the large flexible A-loop, it might be impractical to sample direct back-and-forth transitions between various states using metadynamics. Therefore, we opted for umbrella sampling for its simplicity. The reliability of umbrella sampling hinges on two issues, first whether the latent space adequately represents the conformational space and second, whether there is sufficient overlap between different windows for efficient reweighting. Addressing the first challenge remains an ongoing endeavor in the dimensionality reduction research field, and we anticipate that our SPIB latent space is sufficient enough for our current purpose. The second challenge can be managed through careful setup of umbrella sampling windows and bias strength. Given our current setup, sampling the extensive motion of A-loop relocation remains challenging, showing insufficient overlap between the A-loop folded and extended regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consequently, the quantitative reliability of the absolute <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> values between different states is limited, allowing us only to qualitatively assess the relative thermodynamic stability of the DFG-in versus the DFG-out basins. Nevertheless, the qualitative relative stability observed from umbrella sampling aligns with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vani et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, the local potential of mean force (PMF) surrounding each basin should provide quantitatively reliable insights, given their thorough sampling through umbrella sampling. Reassuringly, when we ranked the classical DFG-out structures within the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble, using the local PMF values in the latent space, the ‘holo-model’ structure emerged among the top 2 structures with free energy relative to the minimum smaller than 1 kJ/mol, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, we used DiffDock to conduct docking experiments with type II ligands on the 15 classical DFG-out structures within the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble. Despite poses from most structures surprisingly demonstrating very low ligand RMSD, typically below 2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>), they exhibited significant steric clashes and low DiffDock confidence score due to DiffDock’s disregard for side-chain configurations and clashes. Notably, upon ranking structures based on their AF2RAVE PMF and examining the corresponding poses with the lowest ligand RMSD, we observed that only the poses derived from the top 2 structures selected by AF2RAVE had DiffDock confidence scores higher than –1.5, surpassing the default threshold of the DiffDock model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This implies the general advantage of structures selected by physics-based methods across various docking methods.</p><p>In summary, Boltzmann ranking from AF2RAVE effectively distinguishes holo-like structures from other decoys. Beginning with the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble, AF2RAVE substantially enhances the likelihood of identifying the holo-like structure from 1 out of 15 to at least 1 out of 2 when using a PMF cutoff of 1 kJ/mol. We noted that although the PMF values and Boltzmann ranks may fluctuate with the setup of umbrella sampling, the enrichment effect of holo-like structures remains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Besides, we applied an alternative protocol to compute the PMF profile within the DDR1 classical DFG-out basin, by running unbiased MD simulations starting from the 15 classical DFG-out decoys in the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble. However, this unbiased protocol poses a risk of failing to sample rare events if barriers exit within the region of interest. In this case, the mini-barriers inside the classical DFG-out basin are low enough to enable efficient sampling using 50 ns unbiased MD simulations. Consequently, the Boltzmann ranks derived from unbiased MD simulations also successfully enriched the single holo-like structure in the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble to the top 5 of the structure set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Transferable learning of holo-like structure for Abl1 and Src kinases with AF2RAVE from DDR1 templates</title><p>As mentioned earlier, our current Abl1 rMSA AF2 ensemble lacks any decoy structure in the classical DFG-out state.

The lowest ligand RMSD achieved is 2.74 Å for imatinib and 0.78 Å for ponatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, only four structures (labeled as ‘holo-model’ structures hereafter) out of the 30 decoys are capable of docking with type II inhibitors with ligand RMSD &lt;3 Å, and all other structures produce IFD poses with ligand RMSD&gt;6 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We then investigated whether physics-based methods could enrich the 4 ‘holo-model’ structures from the 30 tAF2 decoys to a practical number of holo-like candidates. To explore the local classical DFG-out basin, we conducted 50 ns unbiased MD simulations starting from each tAF2 decoy structure and combined the trajectories to obtain the final Boltzmann distribution. Remarkably, the PMF for the Abl1 classical DFG-out basin calculated from the unbiased protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) showed the enrichment of all 4 ‘holo-model’ structures among the top 8 tAF2 structures with PMF value &lt;1 kJ/mol. The PMF values of the top 8 tAF2 structures and the lowest ligand RMSD from the corresponding structures are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. We also employed umbrella sampling for the Abl1 kinase by transferring setups and initial structures using the AF2-template from DDR1 umbrella sampling. However, we noted a significant occurrence of αC helix breakage in the Abl1 umbrella sampling trajectories compared to DDR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). After excluding windows with broken αC helix, the Abl1 PMF derived from umbrella sampling ultimately enriched all 4 ‘holo-model’ structures to the top 6 among the 30 tAF2 structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). In Supplementary Information, we also provide results for Src kinase which are in the same quality as for Abl1 kinase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Through our retrospective analysis, we have thus demonstrated that the default AF2 models are ineffective for docking ligands targeting metastable protein kinase conformations. While AF2-based methods can be coaxed into generating diverse structures, they still struggle to produce reliable accuracy decoys for metastable conformations since the AF2 ensembles do not follow Boltzmann distribution. This failure is evident in the inability to generate an Abl1 AF2 ensemble containing holo-like structures for type II inhibitors. To further investigate whether this limitation is common among AF2-based methods, including the rMSA AF2 method we employed earlier, we tested another AF2-based approach, AF2-cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wayment-Steele et al., 2024</xref>). The AF2-cluster ensemble of Abl1 comprises more A-loop folded structures (21 out of 197) compared to our Abl1 rMSA AF2 ensemble (4 out of 1198). However, similar to rMSA AF2, there are still no decoys in the classical DFG-out state, and all A-loop folded structures are located far from the PMF basin of the classical DFG-out state in the latent space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This indicates that AF2-cluster, like rMSA AF2, also fails to generate Abl1 metastable states effectively. Interestingly, we observed comparable structural diversity in sampling the A-loop folded configurations within the AF2-cluster ensembles for DDR1 and Abl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). While for the rMSA AF2 method, the promiscuous kinase DDR1 ensemble exhibits superior structural diversity compared to the Abl1 kinase. This enhanced diversity leads to the identification of one dockable structure for type II inhibitors among decoys in DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble. Through the application of a homology modeling method, AF2-template, we demonstrated that the classical DFG-out decoys in the DDR1 rMSA AF2 ensemble can be transferred to Abl1 kinase. Furthermore, we tested an additional kinase, Src, for which non-native state decoys are reported to be even more challenging to produce using AF2 subsampling methods than Abl1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monteiro da Silva et al., 2024</xref>). We have also verified that rMSA AF2 and AF2-cluster struggle in producing distinct decoys from native structure of Src kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Besides, neither the rMSA AF2 nor the AF2-cluster ensembles for Src kinase adequately sample the classical DFG-out basin in the latent space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Remarkably, AF2-template, as a homology modeling method, can easily produce the classical DFG-out structure of Src kinase, using the top 2 AF2RAVE-picked DDR1 classical DFG-out structures as templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The IFD poses from the tAF2 structure of Src kinase shown a minimal ligand RMSD of 2.82 Å with imatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>With the rapid expansion of chemical space, virtual screening on libraries containing billions of diverse molecules becomes enticing for novel drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lyu et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the enrichment of candidate holo-like structures emerges as a necessary step, offering significant benefits in terms of computational efficiency and feasibility. As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, unlike the non-dockable AF2 structures for type II inhibitors, the diverse rMSA AF2 ensemble (referred to as rAF2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for brevity) shows potential in generating holo-like structures within a large set of decoys. However, it’s only upon AF2RAVE ranking and selection that the ratio of holo-like structures in selected structure set increases to a plausible value of 50%, facilitating further virtual screening on computational models of protein pockets.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparing the Induced Fit docking (IFD) performance of various structure generation methods for docking type II kinase inhibitors.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source-protein (# of structures)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Lowest imatinib ligand RMSD (Å)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Lowest ponatinib ligand RMSD (Å)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Ratio of structs. w. ligand RMSD &lt;3 Å</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">AF2-Abl1 (1)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">9.22</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">9.4</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0/1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">AF2-DDR1 (1)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">9.24</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">9.33</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0/1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">rMSA AF2-Abl1 (2)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">10.14</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">9.11</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0/2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">rMSA AF2-DDR1 (15)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.04<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn1">*</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.89</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1/15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">tAF2-Abl1 (30)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.74</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.78</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4/30</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">AF2RAVE-DDR1 (2)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.04<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn1">*</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.89</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1/2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">AF2RAVE-Abl1 (8)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.74</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.78</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4/8</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table1fn1"><label>*</label><p>Result from IFD-trim.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>AF2 has arguably revolutionized protein structure prediction, but it remains to be constructively demonstrated if it can be reliably used for drug discovery purposes, especially involving non-native protein conformations. In this work we have demonstrated through retrospective studies on kinase inhibitors that a combination of AF2, statistical mechanics-based enhanced sampling, and IFD can be deployed for such calculations. Specifically, we have utilized the AF2RAVE protocol by inputting the sequences of the DDR1 kinases, along with two additional pieces of prior information: a pairwise distance cutoff for evaluating A-loop positions and the Dunbrack definition of DFG type. We then employed Glide IFD to assess our AF2RAVE-generated computational models for type II kinase inhibitor binding pockets. This AF2RAVE-Glide workflow yielded holo-like structure candidates with a 50% successful docking rate for known type II inhibitors. Notably, the holo-like structures in metastable state and the latent space constructed from AF2RAVE of DDR1 are transferable to other kinases. This includes the challenging cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monteiro da Silva et al., 2024</xref>) of Abl1 and Src kinases, wherein we showed that SPIB and sampling performed for DDR1 allowed generating classical DFG-out structures for both Abl1 and Src kinases. This severely reduces the computational cost for retraining SPIB to learn low-dimensional latent space for different kinases.</p><p>This demonstration of AF2RAVE-Glide on kinase inhibitors shows its promising application for discovering drugs targeting general proteins in addition to kinases, such as G-protein-coupled receptors, which are the targets for over one-third of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hauser et al., 2018</xref>). For the design of novel drugs targeting general proteins, developing a protocol that does not require prior information about the system is left for future exploration. Besides, in this study we only investigate the classical DFG-out metastable state for kinases. For a comprehensive protocol, all top-ranked metastable states identified by AF2RAVE should be explored in subsequent docking experiments. Integration of algorithms capable of predicting ligand binding sites on protein surfaces, such as the Graph Attention Site Prediction (GrASP) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2024</xref>), is then essential before utilizing AF2RAVE-selected structures in docking, thus expanding the workflow to AF2RAVE-GrASP-Glide. Additionally, the inclusion of FEP calculations for front-runner ligands to evaluate the actual ligand binding affinity can further enhance this workflow.</p><p>The integration of AF2-based and physics-based methods presents a promising approach toward the development of a mature workflow for computer-aided drug design. AF2-based methods are capable of producing ensembles with structural diversity, which aids physics-based methods in better sampling and exploring the energy landscape of proteins. Additionally, AF2-generated structures can serve as crystal-like decoys, free from distortion that may occur in biased simulations. Physics-based methods play a crucial role in accurately assigning Boltzmann weights and ranking decoy structures to guide the enrichment of holo-like structures, essential for virtual screening on large libraries. This collaborative approach leverages the strengths of both methodologies, leading to enhanced efficiency and efficacy in drug discovery efforts.</p><p>We conclude this manuscript by making a final comment on the horizons opened by generative AI methods, including those involving diffusion models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2022</xref>) and any such future frameworks. These approaches make it possible to easily hypothesize regions of the conformational space underlying arbitrarily complex molecules of life, that then could serve as a starting point to launch more careful investigations. However, these predictions without careful in situ or a posteriori testing through advanced simulations or experiments are only predictions and could just be hallucinations. Having the capability to quickly generate numerous - thousands or more - such structural hypotheses is what made AF2 so crucial to this current work. We believe that a deep integration of the hypothesis creation possibilities of generative AI with careful MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herron et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng et al., 2024</xref>) experiments or other forms of rapid testing is one way these methods will truly facilitate new and reliable scientific discoveries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Summary of systems tested and tools used</title><p>In this work we tested AF2RAVE-Glide protocol on active and inactive conformations of DDR1, Abl1, and Src kinases against type I inhibitors VX-680 and dasatinib, and type II inhibitors imatinib and ponatinib.

For each depth, 128 random seeds were utilized, and each seed produced 5 structural models via ColabFold, resulting in a total of 1280 rMSA AF2 structures per kinase.

Here, in the ‘holo-model’ structure, we manually chose the DFG-Phe residue which is significantly hindered by holo-imatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). For generic systems lacking groundtruth information, broader screening of single residue trimming for the protein pocket may be necessary for this extended-sampling IFD method.

It would be nice to acknowledge this instead of going along with the common practice in drug discovery of attributing any conformational changes to induced fit without thoughtful consideration of conformational selection.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. We aim to highlight the significant role of conformational selection. To clarify this, we have expanded the discussion on conformational selection in the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors aim to enhance AlphaFold2 for protein conformation-selective drug discovery through the integration of AlphaFold2 and physics-based methods, focusing on improving the accuracy of predicting protein structures ensemble and small molecule binding of metastable protein conformations to facilitate targeted drug design.</p><p>The major strength of the paper lies in the methodology, which includes the innovative integration of AlphaFold2 with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking to produce protein ensembles with structural diversity.

The authors note in the Conclusion that an enhancement in the workflow might result from the addition of free energy calculations. Can the authors comment on the prospects for generating more accurate estimates of the free energy that might be used to qualitatively evaluate poses and the free energy landscape surrounding putative metastable states? What are the principal challenges and what might help overcome them? What would the most effective computational protocol be?</p></disp-quote><p>More accurate estimates of the free energy can theoretically be achieved by increasing the number of umbrella sampling windows and extending the simulation length until the PMF converges. However, there is always a trade-off between PMF accuracy and computational costs, so we have chosen to stick with the current setup. Metadynamics is another method to obtain a more accurate free energy profile, which we have used in previous versions of AlphaFold2-RAVE, but for the specific systems we investigated, it had issues in achieving back and forth movement given the high entropic nature of the activation loop. Research in enhanced sampling methods and dimensionality reduction techniques for reaction coordinates is continually evolving and will play a critical role in alleviating this problem.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I was surprised that there was not more correlation of a funnel-like shape in Figures S16 and S18, showing a stronger correlation between low RMSD and better docking score. This is true for both the ponatinib and imatinib applications in DDR1 and Abl1. That also seems true for the trimmed results for Src kinase in Figure S19. I was also surprised that there are structures with very large RMSD but docking scores comparable to the best structures of the lowest RMSD. Might something be done to make the docking score a more effective discriminator?</p></disp-quote><p>The docking algorithm and docking score are used to filter out highly improbable docking poses. False positives in predicted docking poses are a common issue across all docking methods as described for instance in:</p><p>Fan, Jiyu, Ailing Fu, and Le Zhang. &quot;Progress in molecular docking.&quot; Quantitative Biology 7 (2019): 83-89.</p><p>Ferreira, R.S., Simeonov, A., Jadhav, A., Eidam, O., Mott, B.T., Keiser, M.J., McKerrow, J.H., Maloney, D.J., Irwin, J.J. and Shoichet, B.K., 2010. &quot;Complementarity between a docking and a high-throughput screen in discovering new cruzain inhibitors.&quot; Journal of medicinal chemistry, 53(13), pp.4891-4905.</p><p>Moreover, there is always a trade-off between docking accuracy and computational cost. While employing more accurate docking methods may decrease false positives, it can also be resource-intensive. In such scenarios, our approach to enriching holo-structures can be impactful by reducing the number of pocket structures in the input ensembles and significantly enhancing docking efficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) I think that it is fine to identify one structure as &quot;IFD winner&quot; but also feel that its significance is overstressed, especially given that it can be identified only in a retrospective analysis rather than through de novo prediction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We did not intend to emphasize the specific structure &quot;IFD winner&quot;. Rather, we aimed to demonstrate that our method can enrich promising candidates for holo-structures. We verified this by showing that our holo-structure candidates performed well in retrospective docking using IFD, which we previously referred to as &quot;IFD winner&quot;.
