The surgeon removed a region of the brain known as the temporal lobe from both sides of his brain. After the surgery, Molaison's epilepsy was greatly improved, but he was also left with a profound amnesia, unable to form new memories of recent events.</p><p>Subsequent experiments, including many with Molaison himself as a subject, have attempted to identify the roles of the various structures within the temporal lobes. The hippocampus—which is involved in memory and spatial navigation—has received the most attention, but in recent years a region called the entorhinal cortex has also come to the fore. Known as the gateway to the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex relays sensory information from the outer cortex of the brain to the hippocampus.</p><p>In rats and mice the entorhinal cortex can be divided into two subregions that have distinct connections to other parts of the temporal lobe and to the rest of the brain. These are the medial entorhinal cortex, which is the subregion nearest the centre of the brain, and the lateral entorhinal cortex, which is to the left or right of the centre.</p><p>For many years researchers had assumed that human entorhinal subregions were located simply to the center or to the sides of the brain. However, it was difficult to check this as the entorhinal cortex measures less than 1 cm across, which placed it beyond the reach of most brain-imaging techniques. Now, two independent groups of researchers have used a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging to show a different picture. The fMRI data—which were collected in a magnetic field of 7 Tesla, rather than the 1.5 Tesla used in previous experiments—reveal that the entorhinal cortex is predominantly divided from front-to-back in humans.</p><p>One of the groups—Navarro Schröder, Haak et al.—used three different sets of functional MRI data to show that the human entorhinal cortex has anterior-lateral and posterior-medial subregions. In one of these experiments, functional MRI was used to measure activity across the whole brain as subjects performed a virtual reality task: this task included some components that involved spatial navigation and other components that did not. The other group—Maass, Berron et al.—used the imaging data to show that the pattern of connections between the anterior-lateral subregion and the hippocampus was different to that between the posterior-medial subregion and the hippocampus.</p><p>The discovery of these networks in the temporal lobe in humans will help to bridge the gap between studies of memory in rodents and in humans. Given that the lateral entorhinal cortex is one of the first regions to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, identifying the specific properties and roles of these networks could also provide insights into disease mechanisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06738.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06738.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>medial temporal lobe</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-StG 261177</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navarro Schröder</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name><name><surname>Doeller</surname><given-names>Christian F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO-Vidi 452-12-009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navarro Schröder</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name><name><surname>Doeller</surname><given-names>Christian F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO-Vidi 864-12-003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beckmann</surname><given-names>Christian F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UK Strategic Award 098369/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haak</surname><given-names>Koen V</given-names></name><name><surname>Beckmann</surname><given-names>Christian F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By employing high-field fMRI and taking advantage of well-known global connectivity fingerprints and sensitivity to spatial and non-spatial information, it is shown that the entorhinal cortex is primarily divided into anterior and posterior subregions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The entorhinal cortex (EC)—defining the interface between the hippocampus and the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munoz and Insausti, 2005</xref>)—plays a pivotal role in the integration of different sensory inputs into higher order mnemonic representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eichenbaum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moser and Moser, 2013</xref>). In rodents—and on the basis of cytoarchitectonics—the EC is typically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Strien et al., 2009</xref>) subdivided into two major subregions, the medial- and the lateral entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC, respectively). The MEC receives inputs about spatial information from parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and the LEC receives item-related information from perirhinal cortex (PRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Strien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knierim et al., 2013</xref>). Similar functional roles of the PHC and PRC have been described in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davachi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eichenbaum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ekstrom and Bookheimer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Litman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duarte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Staresina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vilberg and Davachi, 2013</xref>) and relate to distinct visual processing streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kravitz et al., 2011</xref>). The differential input pattern into the rodent LEC and MEC also dovetails with a cell-type specific functional specialisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eichenbaum and Lipton, 2008</xref>). The MEC contains a high proportion of head-direction and grid cells, whose activity is modulated by running direction and spatial location, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, cells in the LEC respond to individual objects in the environment rather than to specific locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knierim et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite a wealth of data and marked differences in structure and function of the rodent MEC and LEC evidence for their human homologue remains elusive. This hampers translational studies, which is particularly relevant in the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with AD pathology starting in the EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braak and Braak, 1992</xref>). Within the EC, the vulnerability to AD-related pathology is not homogeneously distributed and differs between medial and lateral strips in humans, which has been related to similar findings in the rodent MEC and LEC, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 2014</xref>). However, the localization of the human homologue of the rodent MEC and LEC remains unclear. A source of considerable confusion is the fact that ‘MEC’ and ‘LEC’ are referring to cytoarchitectonically defined areas and not to anatomical locations. Hence, they do not circumscribe strips of medial and lateral EC. Rather, the MEC is located medially in the septal (posterior) part of the EC and the LEC is located laterally in the temporal (anterior) part of the EC in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Strien et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, tracing studies on PHC and PRC pathways in non-human primates suggest a dominant anterior-posterior division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki and Amaral, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Insausti and Amaral, 2008</xref>), as do single-unit recordings that show activity consistent with the rodent LEC in the anterior EC in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Killian et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, neuroimaging studies on memory in healthy participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schultz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reagh and Yassa, 2014</xref>) and participants with preclinical AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 2014</xref>) suggest that the rodent MEC and LEC map on medial and lateral strips of EC in humans.</p><p>To resolve this discrepancy in the literature, one needs to investigate the relatively small EC (25–30 mm<sup>2</sup> in humans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krimer et al., 1997</xref>) with high anatomical precision. An earlier study investigated entorhinal connectivity with high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but averaged signal changes over the entire region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lacy and Stark, 2012</xref>). To achieve higher resolution imaging, here we leveraged high-field, sub-millimetre fMRI at 7 T and sought to identify the human homologue of the rodent MEC and LEC by informing our analysis by well-known functional and structural properties of the EC. Specifically, it has been shown that MEC and LEC exhibit differential connectivity with cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Witter and Groenewegen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Strien et al., 2009</xref>). The differential fingerprints of anatomical connectivity should lead to differences in functional connectivity identifiable with fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansen-Berg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). To test patterns of functional connectivity, we measured whole-brain activity while participants performed a virtual reality task with spatial and non-spatial components and validated the results in publicly available resting-state data from the WU-Minn Human Connectome Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Van Essen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) (HCP—<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.humanconnectome.org">www.humanconnectome.org</ext-link>). In addition, differential sensitivity to spatial and non-spatial stimuli could provide converging evidence to identify the human homologue of the rodent MEC and LEC, which we tested in a third, independent dataset. A complementary approach to the global network perspective presented here is given by Maass et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maass et al., 2015</xref>) who scrutinized the fine-grained connectivity pattern of medial temporal lobe regions with the EC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A recent model on cortical memory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</xref>) posits that an anterior-temporal (AT) system converges on the PRC and a posterior-medial (PM) system on the PHC. Based on studies in rodents, the two networks are hypothesised to connect to either the LEC or the MEC, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Witter and Groenewegen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Strien et al., 2009</xref>). Studies in non-human primates predict that the entorhinal projections of the two systems show a strong anteroposterior division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki and Amaral, 1994</xref>). In order to test this prediction and to elucidate the role of the EC, we first applied a model-based approach on fMRI data acquired while participants were performing a virtual-reality navigation task to directly mimic studies in rodents (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). This task targeted all entorhinal systems, because it involved both navigation-related spatial components and processing of non-spatial stimuli.</p><p>We created spherical regions-of-interest (ROIs) with 4 mm radius around coordinates pertaining to either of the networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Libby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), as well as ROIs for both the medial and lateral half, and anterior and posterior half of the EC to ensure comparable number of voxels per parcel and therefore comparable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) properties. Then we computed seed-based connectivity from the two neocortical networks to either sets of EC ROIs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We found a main effect of network on entorhinal connectivity (repeated-measures ANOVA: F<sub>(1,21)</sub> = 10.0, p = 0.005). Post-hoc t-tests revealed that the lateral parts of EC connected stronger to the AT compared to the PM network (T<sub>(21)</sub> = 2.6, p = 0.015; medial parts of EC: T<sub>(21)</sub> = −0.2 p = 0.83). However, in contrast to previous suggestions, we additionally observed a connectivity difference along the anteroposterior axis (repeated-measures ANOVA: main effect of network, F<sub>(1,21)</sub> = 13.2, p = 0.001) and post-hoc t-tests showed that the anterior parts of EC connected more with the AT compared to the PM network (T<sub>(21)</sub> = 2.7: p = 0.01; posterior EC: T<sub>(21)</sub> = −0.49, p = 0.63).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06738.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Selection of regions associated with the posterior-medial (PM) and the anterior-temporal (AT) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Libby et al., 2012</xref>).</title><p>The coordinates of the PM system reflect peak voxel coordinates of a seed-based connectivity contrast of right parahippocampal cortex &gt; right perirhinal cortex connectivity reported by Libby et al.

For example, the selected volume and location of neocortical seed regions could introduce biases (e.g., spatial proximity of the seeds) and imperfect normalisation procedures could affect the results particularly in the frontal lobes where projections from both the rodent LEC and MEC are neighbouring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerr et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, manual subdivision of the EC along cardinal axes likely misrepresents cytoarchitectonic boundaries. Therefore, we adopted a complementary approach to trace the dominant modes of functional connectivity change within the EC in a fully data-driven manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haak et al., 2014</xref>) (see ‘Materials and methods’). In brief, for every voxel in the EC, we determined its functional connectivity fingerprint with respect to the rest of cortex and used these fingerprints to compute the pair-wise similarities among all voxels within the ROI. The ensuing (voxels-by-voxels) similarity matrix was then fed to the Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belkin and Niyogi, 2003</xref>), which has previously also been successfully applied to trace changes in white-matter tractography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansen-Berg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerliani et al., 2012</xref>) and resting-state fMRI connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haak et al., 2014</xref>). The LE algorithm projects the high-dimensional, voxel-wise connectivity data onto a series of one-dimensional vectors, with the requirement that the similarities among the connectivity fingerprints are maximally preserved (in the vein of e.g., multidimensional scaling). These vectors represent multiple, spatially overlapping maps (as revealed by colour-coding the EC voxels according to the vectors' values) and are sorted according to how well they preserve the similarities among the original, high-dimensional connectivity fingerprints. Thus, the first vector represents the dominant mode of connectivity change in the EC, the second represents the second-dominant mode, and so on.</p><p>Applied to the fMRI data acquired while subjects performed the virtual-reality task, we observed that the dominant mode of functional connectivity change extended along the long-axis of the EC, approximately from the posterior to the anterior end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), while the orientation of the second was largely perpendicular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both modes of connectivity change could also be reliably detected using an independent resting-state fMRI dataset (60 subjects of the WU-Minn Human Connectome Project; see ‘Materials and methods’), suggesting that the organization of EC functional connectivity is largely task-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Both the first and second-dominant modes of functional connectivity change were highly reproducible across resting-state sessions (Pearson's R = 0.99, p &lt; 0.001 and Pearson's R = 0.98, p &lt; 0.001, for the dominant and second-dominant modes, respectively).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06738.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dominant mode of functional connectivity change within EC and sensitivity to spatial and non-spatial information.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dominant mode of functional connectivity change at the group-level (Spearman's R = 0.53).

Hence, each cluster comprises 50% of voxels in the EC. 3D-rendering of the two clusters derived from the dominant mode of connectivity change revealed a consistent topology across hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). One division contained the posterior EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>—displayed in blue).

In addition to the dominant anterior-posterior distinction, the posterior cluster was located more medially (and to some extent more dorsally) and the anterior cluster was located more laterally (and to some extent more ventrally). Hereafter, we refer to the clusters as posterior-medial EC (‘pmEC’) and anterior-lateral EC (‘alEC’), respectively, consistent with Maass et al.

To test this hypothesis, we computed whole-volume connectivity maps of the two clusters. Group-level contrasts showed peaks in the medial-prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex for the alEC, regions associated with the AT system. In contrast, occipital and posterior-parietal cortex was dominated by connectivity with the pmEC, areas associated with the PM system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</xref>). In addition, the pmEC showed increased connectivity with frontal regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These findings are in line with the patterns of reciprocal connections of the rodent LEC and MEC, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerr et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, this was not the case for the connectivity maps of the two clusters derived from the second-dominant mode of connectivity change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) that were widely dominated by only one of the clusters.</p><p>Furthermore, we examined both spatial and temporal SNR (tSNR) of the alEC and the pmEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). tSNR did not differ between alEC and pmEC (T<sub>(21)</sub> = 0.2, p = 0.83) but spatial SNR did (T<sub>(21)</sub> = 9.7, p &lt; 0.001). This was associated with higher signal in the pmEC compared to the alEC (mean signal: alEC = 4.97; mean signal pmEC = 7.76; T<sub>(21)</sub> = 38, p &lt; 0.001) in the absence of differences in spatial standard deviation (T<sub>(21)</sub> = 1.5, p = 0.144). Note, that mean signal was subtracted from time-series prior to all connectivity analyses (see ‘Materials and methods’), which makes it unlikely that signal intensity differences affected the connectivity results.</p><p>We used an independent component analysis (ICA)-based method for data cleaning (see ‘Materials and methods’) that has been shown to efficiently remove residual effects of head motion. However, we additionally repeated the data-driven connectivity analysis after excluding time periods with large head movements (motion scrubbing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Power et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2015</xref>]). Motion scrubbing had only minimal effects on the results. Pearson correlation coefficients of the pre- and post scrubbing results were close to 1 and highly significant (gradient one: left R = 0.9964, right R = 0.9958; gradient two: left = 0.9348, right = 0.8816; all p values &lt;0.001).</p><p>We also tested if the alEC and pmEC exhibited stronger connectivity with their potential homologue region in the contralateral hemisphere compared to each other. Here we observed that homologous connectivity indeed exceeded non-homologous connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Importantly, this was also the case if non-homologous connectivity was assessed within the same hemisphere, between adjacent parts of the EC (T<sub>(21)</sub> = 4.05, p = 0.0006).</p><p>Finally, studies on rodent electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knierim et al., 2013</xref>) predict that the LEC and its human homologue should respond preferentially to non-spatial stimuli, whereas the MEC and its human homologue should be involved in processing spatial information. We tested this prediction by conducting a second fMRI study at 7 T in which an independent group of participants was presented with spatial (pictures of scenes) and non-spatial stimuli (pictures of objects), see ‘Materials and methods’ for details. We contrasted fMRI responses to spatial and non-spatial stimuli. Here, we observed higher responses to spatial than non-spatial stimuli in the posterior EC, while the inverse contrast (objects vs scenes) showed higher responses in the anterior EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). ROI analyses using the clusters derived from the dominant mode of connectivity change revealed that the anterior-lateral cluster showed higher sensitivity to non-spatial stimuli compared to the PM cluster (T<sub>(20)</sub> = 4.9, p = 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

While the shape and location of the EC differs between rodents and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Witter and Groenewegen, 1989</xref>), the anatomical organisation and connectivity patterns are largely conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canto et al., 2008</xref>). However, translational studies on EC subregions faced the problem of identifying homologous regions across species. For example, recent neuroimaging studies on mnemonic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schultz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reagh and Yassa, 2014</xref>) and Alzheimer's pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 2014</xref>) directly related medial and lateral strips of EC in humans to the rodent MEC and LEC. However, the anatomical locations of these cytoarchitectonically defined regions in rodents differ along more than only the mediolateral axis. More specifically, the LEC is situated more anterior-ventrally, whereas the MEC is situated more posterior-dorsally in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Strien et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that medial and lateral strips of EC in humans correspond to the rodent MEC and LEC, respectively. Furthermore, in primates the characteristic projections from the PRC and PHC strongly map onto the anteroposterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki and Amaral, 1994</xref>). Here, we leveraged the distinct connectivity fingerprints and functional roles (such as complementary computation of scene and object information) of the rodent LEC and MEC to find their human homologues with fMRI with three complementary methods and three independent datasets. Both model-based and data-driven connectivity analyses, as well as sensitivity to non-spatial vs spatial stimuli provide evidence for an anterior-lateral and a PM localisation of the homologues of the rodent LEC and MEC, respectively. Maass et al confirmed these findings in a study with two high-resolution, high-field fMRI datasets by focusing on local connectivity between regions of the medial temporal lobes. They found preferential connectivity of PRC and proximal subiculum to anterior-lateral parts of the EC, whereas posterior-medial parts of the EC were more connected to PHC and distal subiculum. This corresponds well with our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In line with the present study, Maass et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maass et al., 2015</xref>) report local connectivity fingerprints of the human anterior-lateral and posterior-medial EC that mimicked those of the rodent LEC and MEC, respectively.</p><p>In addition to the change in functional connectivity from PM to anterior-lateral, our data-driven connectivity analysis also revealed a second organisation structure approximately perpendicular to the first (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which might reflect bands of intra-entorhinal projections that are known to cross the LEC/MEC boundary in a roughly orthogonal orientation in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canto et al., 2008</xref>) and in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chrobak and Amaral, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The selective sensitivity to spatial and non-spatial information, or ‘context vs content’ more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knierim et al., 2013</xref>), points towards fundamental difference in computations of the LEC and MEC. How to characterise those differences most accurately remains an open question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knierim et al., 2013</xref>), but our results can help to inform future studies on the role of the human alEC and pmEC in higher-level cognition.</p><p>Notably, the present findings confirm three out of four complementary criteria for the definition of cortical areas that have traditionally been advocated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Essen, 1985</xref>), namely topographic organization, connectivity and functional properties (the fourth one being cyto- and myeloarchitectonic organization).</p><p>Previous neuroimaging studies in humans reported differences between medial and lateral aspects of EC that mimicked differences between the rodent MEC and LEC and assumed that both subregions are present on coronal slices of the EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schultz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reagh and Yassa, 2014</xref>), that is, that the MEC and LEC correspond to medial and lateral strips of the EC. In light of our findings, these reports could be explained by a partial overlap of the medial and lateral divisions with the pmEC and the alEC, respectively. For example, we noticed a mediolateral difference of responses to spatial and non-spatial stimuli on some coronal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, our results suggest that coronal slices through the most posterior EC exclusively harbour the human homologue of the rodent MEC. Similarly, anterior slices appear to contain mostly the homologue of the rodent LEC. Hence, improved mapping of homologous regions between rodents and humans should lead to increased effect sizes and more accurate interpretations.</p><p>In summary, the present findings can help to inform future translational research on the role of entorhinal subregions in fields ranging from clinical neuroscience, such as on the early progression of Alzheimer's disease, to cognitive neuroscience, for example, nature and mechanisms of different forms of memory and their integration into higher order representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eichenbaum and Lipton, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Navigation experiment</title><p>26 participants took part in the study (11 females, age 19–36, mean 23 years). 22 entered the analysis and 4 were excluded due to excessive movement (number of instantaneous movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Power et al., 2012</xref>] &gt; 0.5 mm exceeded the mean plus 1 standard deviation).

In this self-paced task participants collected and replaced six everyday objects within a virtual arena. They collected each object from its associated location once during an initial trial, by running over it. In each subsequent trial they saw an image (cue) of one of the objects in the upper part of the screen and had to move to the object's associated location and press a button (replace phase). After this response, the object appeared in its associated position and participants collected it again (feedback phase). After an average of 3 trials (range 2–4 trials), a fixation cross on a grey background was presented for 4 s (inter-trial-interval, ITI). Next to the spatial aspects of the navigation task, non-spatial task components were present approximately half of the time. Therefore, the task engaged functions associated with both the PM and the AT network, respectively. Each scanning session was subdivided into EPI acquisition blocks of 210 volumes.

The use of a group-specific EPI template was feasible because of the anatomical detail provided by the sub-millimetre images. In addition, this rendered the registration to structural images unnecessary, which poses an additional source of noise because of regional differences in distortion of the 7 Tesla EPIs. The functional data were smoothed with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel of 2.5 mm<sup>3</sup> (roughly 2.5 times the voxel size) to increase the SNR and improve ICA-based data de-noising with the FIX procedure (see above) while maintaining high spatial resolution for connectivity analyses.

A medial EC and a lateral EC ROI of roughly equal volume were created by dividing the main ROI mediolaterally (which roughly corresponded to a proximo-distal division in relation to the hippocampus) on consecutive coronal slices along the entire anteroposterior axis. An anterior EC and a posterior EC ROI of roughly equal volume were created by dividing the main ROI mid-way between the most anterior and the most posterior coronal slice of the EC.</p><p>For the ‘model-based’ analysis, one ROI mask was created for the PM system and another one for the AT system.

For the control analysis using the resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, a probabilistic entorhinal ROI was generated using the Freesurfer toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augustinack et al., 2013</xref>).

Finally, Pearson's partial correlation coefficients were Fisher-Z transformed and used for across-subject comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). For the estimation of voxel-wise connectivity maps we used the ‘dual_regression’ function implemented in FSL 5.0.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/">http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/</ext-link>).

First, the fMRI time series from the EC were rearranged into a time-by-voxels matrix, which was also done for the fMRI time series of all gray-matter voxels outside the EC. For reasons of stability and computational tractability, we losslessly reduced the dimensionality of the data outside the EC using SVD.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this well written and interesting study, the authors used 7 Tesla ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify functional subdivisions of the human EC through the analysis of preferred connectivity with parahippocampal and perirhinal cortices. Aside from a solidly supported hypothesis on how connectional patterns might allow the definition of functionally different domains in the human entorhinal cortex, the authors addressed intrinsic connectivity of the EC. This study, as well as its counterpart study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maass et al.</xref>, should be welcomed and heralded as an important step forward to our understanding of how to functionally divide EC in humans.</p><p>1) Like its counterpart paper, the study falls into a well-known trap of comparative anatomical studies in that chosen nomenclatures are taken to have implications that have never been intended, neither implicit nor explicit. How to define an area in the brain is one problem, how to find the homologue of an area defined in one species in a second species is another question. The authors take an originally cytoarchitectonically defined subdivision of EC into LEC and MEC as the starting point, adding connectivity patterns as the defining second criterion. They then look for connection patterns in the human and find two regions as well. That supports the conclusion that the functional homologues of LEC and MEC can be defined in humans based on the data available (Discussion). In the same sentence it is clearly stated that the LEC homologue is situated anterolateral, while the MEC homologue is to be found at a posteromedial position. Unfortunately, then the trap snaps; the authors then claim that this position is different from that in the rodent since LEC means lateral and MEC means medial. Although they are correct that the given names indicate a position, this is a rather unfortunate interpretation/nomenclature, because in the rodent and in several other species MEC has a posteromedial preferred position and LEC an anterolateral. Maybe a bit less extreme as in the monkey and human, but not all that different. Several papers on the primate brain, including both monkey and human data, unfortunately make the same mistake and assume that all that has a lateral position in EC is LEC and all with a medial position is MEC. The authors correctly conclude that this is likely incorrect, but do not make this explicit and therefore add to the confusion.</p><p>A few examples of sentences that add to the confusion instead of clarifying it:</p><p>In the Introduction: “Furthermore, the two subregions differ not only in structure and function, but also in their vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease-related pathology (Khan et al., 2013)”. In Khan et al. 2013, the authors indeed use LEC to describe AD pathology, but they actually describe pathology in a longitudinal strip of EC that likely encompasses both LEC and MEC, both when one looks at cytoarchitectonics as well as monkey connectivity studies.</p><p>In the Results section: “Based on studies in rodents, the two networks are hypothesised to connect to either the LEC or the MEC, respectively. Studies in non-human primates, however, predict that the two systems project to the anterior and posterior EC, respectively. In order to test both of these predictions…” Here the authors implicitly assume that LEC and MEC are two entities different from alEC and pmEC.</p><p>In the Discussion: “Here, we show that a simple correspondence of MEC/LEC to the mediolateral axis in humans is not valid.” This sentence, although literally true, implicitly contradicts the authors' own concluding statement that the functional homologue can be determined based on the outcome.</p><p>Also in the Discussion: “Previous neuroimaging studies in humans reported differences between medial and lateral entorhinal cortex that mimicked differences between the rodent MEC and LEC. In light of our findings, these reports could be explained by a partial overlap of the medial and lateral divisions with the pmEC and the alEC, respectively.” Again, medial and lateral are here used as pure topological indicators, not as functional, hodological or cytoarchitural definition, so using LEC and MEC is confusing.</p><p>Therefore, we strongly suggest that the authors start off with defining areas as alEC and pmEC, and state that other human studies used LEC and MEC to indicate lateral and medial strips of EC. In the remainder of the manuscript they should only use LEC and MEC when is clear that these are defined, not just indicating a position. This would lead and support their statement in the Discussion: “However, the anatomical organisation and connectivity patterns are largely conserved across species and the characteristic projections from the PRC and PHC rather map on the anteroposterior axis in primates.”</p><p>2) The paper can be improved by adding a few simple analyses that can hopefully illustrate the results in a clear manner. Below are potential technical issues that the authors should address. These issues, described in more detail below, should be straightforward to deal with in the revision:</p><p>A) The study elegantly demonstrates that pmEC and alEC show different patterns of whole-brain connectivity with extended posterior medial (PM) and anterior temporal (AT) neocortical networks. If we understand the methods, the authors used a single ROI for the entire PM network and one for the entire AT network. At least for illustrative purposes, it would be useful to present separate results for each sphere and each EC ROI. Ideally they could show a correlation matrix with the 4 EC ROIs (well, actually 8, as described in my next point) in columns and the individual PM and then AT ROI spheres in rows. Hopefully, on a quick scan of the matrix, readers will be able to see differences in the connectivity profiles of the anterior lateral and posterior medial EC ROIs.</p><p>B) I did not see any mention of laterality. I might have missed it, but if the authors collapsed across hemispheres, I'd like them to consider also presenting results with separate left and right hemisphere ROIs. Doing so would provide a natural internal replication, because one would expect more extensive contralateral connectivity within the alEC regions and within the pmEC regions than between alEC and pmEC.</p><p>C) Along the same lines as the first 2 points, it appears that the first set of a priori ROI analyses separately examine medial and lateral EC ROIs and anterior and posterior EC ROIs. If the authors planned to investigate both axes, wouldn't it make sense to include all 4 ROIs in a single factorial analysis with anterior-posterior and medial-lateral factors? If the analysis revealed an interaction, it would strengthen the case that the functional organization of the EC cuts across both axes.</p><p>3) It might also help to present whole-brain maps (preferably on a surface rendering) for the contrast between anterior-lateral and posterior-medial ROI connectivity, so that readers can see which regions show differential connectivity. Alternatively, it might be preferable to show single-region connectivity maps.</p><p>4A) In general, motion artifact is always a concern with functional connectivity analyses (summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Power et al., 2015</xref>), and more so when one considers that the EC is typically a site with significant signal dropout. It is surprising that these issues are not raised in the paper. We would like to know whether the pmEC and alEC (either defined arbitrarily or using the ConGrads approach) have different spatial or temporal SNR values.</p><p>B) Also, the authors used ICA to deal with residual motion artifact, but it is not clear that ICA will adequately remove the effects of transient motion spikes while preserving the rest of the timeseries. It would be reassuring if the authors can replicate the results of at least one of the functional connectivity analyses by using motion scrubbing/censoring instead of ICA correction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Power et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>5A) The ConGrads analysis is not clear. Giving the authors the benefit of the doubt (more so if they can present the simple analyses suggested above), but a better and simpler explanation of this method is needed. It sounds like a promising approach, but given that the method is not in widespread use, readers may be put off by the brief explanation.</p><p>B) As a related issue, the meaning of the two “connectopies” was difficult to figure out. It sounds like what the authors are saying is that there are two connectivity gradients, one anterior-posterior, and one that is lateral-medial.

How to define an area in the brain is one problem, how to find the homologue of an area defined in one species in a second species is another question. The authors take an originally cytoarchitectonically defined subdivision of EC into LEC and MEC as the starting point, adding connectivity patterns as the defining second criterion. They then look for connection patterns in the human and find two regions as well. That supports the conclusion that the functional homologues of LEC and MEC can be defined in humans based on the data available (Discussion). In the same sentence it is clearly stated that the LEC homologue is situated anterolateral, while the MEC homologue is to be found at a posteromedial position. Unfortunately, then the trap snaps; the authors then claim that this position is different from that in the rodent since LEC means lateral and MEC means medial. Although they are correct that the given names indicate a position, this is a rather unfortunate interpretation/nomenclature, because in the rodent and in several other species MEC has a posteromedial preferred position and LEC an anterolateral. Maybe a bit less extreme as in the monkey and human, but not all that different. Several papers on the primate brain, including both monkey and human data, unfortunately make the same mistake and assume that all that has a lateral position in EC is LEC and all with a medial position is MEC. The authors correctly conclude that this is likely incorrect, but do not make this explicit and therefore add to the confusion</italic>.</p><p><italic>[…] Therefore, we strongly suggest that the authors start off with defining areas as alEC and pmEC, and state that other human studies used LEC and MEC to indicate lateral and medial strips of EC. In the remainder of the manuscript they should only use LEC and MEC when is clear that these are defined, not just indicating a position. This would lead and support their statement in the second paragraph of the Discussion: ‘However, the anatomical organisation and connectivity patterns are largely conserved across species and the characteristic projections from the PRC and PHC rather map on the anteroposterior axis in primates</italic>.’</p><p>We thank the referees for raising this important issue and pointing out the need for clarification. Indeed, ‘MEC’ and ‘LEC’ could be considered a somewhat unfortunate nomenclature, because a literal interpretation misrepresents the actual anatomical localization of the cytoarchitectonic regions. In response to the reviewers' comment we have made the distinction between cytoarchitectonic regions and anatomical location explicit and altered the manuscript accordingly to avoid confusion.</p><p>Partly in response to Comment 5B (see below), we decided to change the naming of the two regions we have identified from ‘pmEC’ and ‘alEC’ to septal EC (sEC) and temporal EC (tEC). We feel that this is a less ambiguous nomenclature for the two regions. Firstly, the mediolateral distinction is negligible, while the septotemporal division is dominant (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, below). Secondly, the septotemporal axis can be identified independently of the orientation of a given MRI acquisition and therefore is preferable to ‘anteroposterior axis’.</p><p>We therefore modified text as follows:</p><p>Introduction: “In rodents—and on the basis of cytoarchitectonics—the EC is typically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Strien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canto et al., 2008</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerr et al., 2007</xref>) subdivided into two major subregions, the medial- and the lateral entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC, respectively). The MEC receives inputs about spatial information from parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and the LEC receives item-related information from perirhinal cortex (PRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Strien et al., 2009</xref>; Deshmukh et al., 2011, Knierim et al., 2014, and Ranganath et al., 2012).</p><p>Also in the Introduction: “Despite a wealth of data and marked differences in structure and function of the rodent MEC and LEC evidence for their human homologue remains elusive. […] In contrast, neuroimaging studies on memory in healthy participants (Schultz 1012, Reagh 2014) and participants with preclinical <underline>AD (Khan 2013)</underline> suggest that the rodent MEC and LEC map on medial and lateral strips of EC in humans.”</p><p>Discussion: “While the shape and location of the EC differs between rodents and primates (Witter et al., 1989), the anatomical organisation and connectivity patterns are largely conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canto et al., 2008</xref>). However, translational studies on EC subregions faced the problem of identifying homologous regions across species.”</p><p>Still in the Discussion section: “Previous neuroimaging studies in humans reported differences between medial and lateral aspects of entorhinal cortex […] Likewise, anterior slices through the temporal EC contain mostly the homologue of the rodent LEC.”</p><p><italic>2) The paper can be improved by adding a few simple analyses that can hopefully illustrate the results in a clear manner. Below are potential technical issues that the authors should address. These issues, described in more detail below, should be straightforward to deal with in the revision</italic>:</p><p><italic>A) The study elegantly demonstrates that pmEC and alEC show different patterns of whole-brain connectivity with extended posterior medial (PM) and anterior temporal (AT) neocortical networks. If we understand the methods, the authors used a single ROI for the entire PM network and one for the entire AT network. At least for illustrative purposes, it would be useful to present separate results for each sphere and each EC ROI. Ideally they could show a correlation matrix with the 4 EC ROIs (well, actually 8, as described in my next point) in columns and the individual PM and then AT ROI spheres in rows. Hopefully, on a quick scan of the matrix, readers will be able to see differences in the connectivity profiles of the anterior lateral and posterior medial EC ROIs</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We think that it is indeed highly relevant to characterise the connectivity profiles of the suggested human homologue of the rodent MEC and LEC. Initially, we showed differential whole-volume connectivity maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), to meet this goal. However, comment 2A mainly refers to the model-based analysis that required manual segmentation of the EC. We indeed performed two separate analyses. Each time the EC was divided in two halves: Once along the anteroposterior (septotemporal) axis, once along the mediolateral/proximodistal axis. This approach was pursued to ensure comparable number of voxels per parcel and therefore comparable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) properties per parcel. We have now described the analysis in more detail in the revised text (Results): we created spherical regions-of-interest (ROIs) <italic>with 4 mm radius</italic> around coordinates pertaining to either of the networks (Ranganath et al., 2012, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Libby et al., 2012</xref>) (see Supplementary file 1), as well as ROIs for both the medial and lateral half, and anterior and posterior half of the EC to ensure comparable number of voxels per parcel and therefore comparable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) properties.</p><p>Analysing connectivity of 8 manually segmented EC subregions with single spheres on peak coordinates of the two neocortical networks (AT &amp; PM system, reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Libby et al. (2012)</xref> is an interesting suggestion but also comes with challenges, both on a biological and analytical level: This approach relies on piece-wise constant connectivity patterns, where both the EC subregions and the neocortical regions have an all-or-none connectivity preference. However, the connectivity profile—as determined by invasive tracing studies—of the rodent MEC and LEC is not fully segregated, but rather shows overlap. For example, all EC regions have reciprocal projections to the frontal lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerr et al., 2007</xref>) and our own data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) suggest this is the case in humans as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Libby et al. (2012)</xref> used a Gaussian smoothing kernel of 5 mm FWHM for their functional connectivity analyses (in contrast to 2.5 mm FWHM in our study), which might smooth-out some of the fine-grained differences. The power of the model-based approach results from combining time-courses of a large number of voxels to increase effective SNR. The analysis of connectivity between time-courses of single spheres with 8 EC subregions would suffer from significantly decreased effective SNR.</p><p>Nevertheless, we performed the suggested analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>). Note that our initial selection of the ∼100 coordinates reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Libby et al. (2012)</xref> comprised many unilateral regions. To avoid proximity biases on connectivity with left or right EC regions, we created a new sub-selection of AT &amp; PM regions with bilateral coordinates (4 bilateral spheres per network, i.e. 16 ROIs) and computed connectivity with 8 EC ROIs (4 quadrants in each hemisphere, as suggested in the following point). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref> shows the resulting connectivity matrix. Note that the division lines of the manually created EC quadrants are roughly parallel to the cardinal axes. This is in contrast to the curved and rather diagonal division line identified with the ConGrads method. Therefore, the anterior-medial and posterior-lateral quadrant likely encompass about equal parts of tEC and sEC. Black boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref> outline connectivity of the anterior-lateral and posterior-medial EC quadrants to the AT and PM network. Only these fields can be expected to have a unique, albeit fractional, contribution of the tEC and sEC regions defined in the main study with the data-driven ConGrads approach. Restricting the analysis to these quadrants indeed revealed an interaction between EC subregion and cortical network (repeated-measures ANOVA: network * EC region: F<sub>(1,21)</sub>=6.9 p=0.0155 ). However, this is not readily apparent from Figure R1 itself. Based on the arguments outlined above, we would prefer to not include this analysis in the manuscript.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06738.018</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Detailed model-based connectivity analyses.

I might have missed it, but if the authors collapsed across hemispheres, I'd like them to consider also presenting results with separate left and right hemisphere ROIs. Doing so would provide a natural internal replication, because one would expect more extensive contralateral connectivity within the alEC regions and within the pmEC regions than between alEC and pmEC</italic>.</p><p>We are grateful for the referees' suggestion to test interhemispheric connectivity of the tEC and sEC. As predicted, the tEC is more connected to itself across hemispheres, than to the sEC on either side. This suggests that even though the two different subregions within a hemisphere are in close spatial proximity, they connect much stronger to their homologue region on the contralateral side. We feel that this is an important addition to the article and included these new results in the revised manuscript (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>C) Along the same lines as the first 2 points, it appears that the first set of a priori ROI analyses separately examine medial and lateral EC ROIs and anterior and posterior EC ROIs. If the authors planned to investigate both axes, wouldn't it make sense to include all 4 ROIs in a single factorial analysis with anterior-posterior and medial-lateral factors? If the analysis revealed an interaction, it would strengthen the case that the functional organization of the EC cuts across both axes</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We used the connectivity matrix created in response to comment 2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>) for a full factorial analysis including factors for each axis (mediolateral and anteroposterior). This analysis did not reveal interactions between cortical network and the two axes (repeated-measures ANOVA; network* anteroposterior: F<sub>(1,21)</sub>=1.3, p=0.259; network* mediolateral: F<sub>(1,21)</sub>=1.77, p=0.198; network* anteroposterior * mediolateral: F<sub>(1,21)</sub>=3.4, p=0.079). Based on their anatomical location in rodents, the anterior-lateral and posterior-medial quadrants are most likely to distinguish the LEC and the MEC, respectively. Therefore they should exhibit the strongest difference in connectivity between the AT and the PM network. Focusing the analysis to these quadrants indeed revealed an interaction between EC subregion and cortical network (repeated-measures ANOVA: network * EC region: F<sub>(1,21)</sub>=6.9 p=0.0155 ). Post-hoc t-tests revealed that the anterior-lateral quadrant connected stronger to the AT compared to the PM network (T<sub>(21)</sub>=4.4, p= 0.0003), while the posterior-medial quadrant did not show this pattern (T<sub>(21)</sub>=1.5: p=0.15). As outlined above, we feel that this information is not essential to the manuscript and would prefer to not include it in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) It might also help to present whole-brain maps (preferably on a surface rendering) for the contrast between anterior-lateral and posterior-medial ROI connectivity, so that readers can see which regions show differential connectivity. Alternatively, it might be preferable to show single-region connectivity maps</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We agree that whole brain connectivity maps are valuable for illustrating the connectivity profiles of the tEC and sEC. We show whole-volume connectivity maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Crucially, these show strong resemblance of the whole brain connectivity maps of PRC and PHC seeds shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Libby et al. (2012)</xref> and therefore complement the initial model-based analysis.</p><p><italic>4A) In general, motion artifact is always a concern with functional connectivity analyses (summarized in</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42"><italic>Power et al., 2015</italic></xref><italic>), and more so when one considers that the EC is typically a site with significant signal dropout. It is surprising that these issues are not raised in the paper. We would like to know whether the pmEC and alEC (either defined arbitrarily or using the ConGrads approach) have different spatial or temporal SNR values</italic>.</p><p>Following the advice by the referees, we performed additional analyses on spatial and temporal SNR and described the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>, and in the Results section:</p><p>“…we examined both spatial and temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the tEC and the sEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>). Temporal SNR did not differ between tEC and sEC (T<sub>(21)</sub>=0.2, p=0.83) but spatial SNR did (T<sub>(21)</sub>= 9.7, p&lt;0.001). This was associated with higher signal in the sEC compared to the tEC (mean signal: tEC=4.97; mean signal sEC=7.76; T<sub>(21)</sub>= 38, p&lt;0.001) in the absence of differences in spatial standard deviation (T<sub>(21)</sub>= 1.5, p=0.144). Note, that mean signal was subtracted from time-series prior to all connectivity analyses (see Methods), which makes it unlikely that signal intensity differences affected the connectivity results.”</p><p>Furthermore, the ConGrads method converted the voxel-wise signal to percent-signal-change prior to the functional connectivity analyses. Rather than being sensitive to the magnitude of the signal at a given point in time, our analyses rely on the signal variance over time. Therefore we feel that our results cannot be explained by differences in signal magnitude.</p><p><italic>B) Also, the authors used ICA to deal with residual motion artifact, but it is not clear that ICA will adequately remove the effects of transient motion spikes while preserving the rest of the timeseries. It would be reassuring if the authors can replicate the results of at least one of the functional connectivity analyses by using motion scrubbing/censoring instead of ICA correction (see</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42"><italic>Power et al., 2015</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the importance of correcting for motion artefacts. Recently it has been shown that ICA-based methods for correcting motion artefacts (such as the FIX approach employed by us) outperform motion scrubbing and spike-regression methods (Pruim et al., 2015, ICA-AROMA: A robust ICA-based strategy for removing motion artefact from fMRI data; Pruim et al., 2015, Evaluation of ICA-AROMA and alternative strategies for motion artifact removal in resting-state fMRI).</p><p>We revised our manuscript accordingly and added the following sentence to the Methods section (in the subsection headed “Data pre-processing”):</p><p>“Correction for residual motion artefacts was performed with an ICA-based method, which has been shown to outperform motion scrubbing and spike-regression methods both in terms of reproducibility of resting-state networks and conservation of temporal degrees of freedom”.</p><p>We also followed the suggestion of the reviewers and applied motion scrubbing in a separate analysis. The ConGrads analysis yields practically the same results with and without scrubbing. In the initial submission, we already excluded 4 out of 26 participants, based on large numbers of framewise displacements (FD) above 0.5 mm. Now, we extended this approach according to the following description in the Methods section:</p><p>“Motion scrubbing. First, we determined time points where instantaneous movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Power et al., 2012</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Power et al., 2015</xref>) exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm. Then we excluded these time points (volumes) including the one preceding and the two thereafter from subsequent analyses. Hence, per instantaneous movement above threshold, four volumes were removed. On average this resulted in 121 volumes being removed from participant's time-series (range: 4-300).”</p><p>In addition, we now describe the outcome in the Results section in the following way:</p><p>“We used an ICA-based method for data cleaning (see Methods) that has been shown to efficiently remove residual effects of head motion. However, we additionally repeated the data-driven connectivity analysis after excluding time periods with large head movements (motion scrubbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Power et al., 2012</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Power et al., 2015</xref>). Motion scrubbing had only minimal effects on the results. Pearson correlation coefficients of the pre- and post scrubbing results were close to 1 and highly significant (gradient one: left R = 0.9964, right R = 0.9958; gradient two: left = 0.9348, right = 0.8816; all p values &lt; 0.001).”</p><p><italic>5A) The ConGrads analysis is not clear. Giving the authors the benefit of the doubt (more so if they can present the simple analyses suggested above), but a better and simpler explanation of this method is needed. It sounds like a promising approach, but given that the method is not in widespread use, readers may be put off by the brief explanation</italic>.</p><p>We expanded and simplified the description of the ConGrads analysis (now mostly referred to as data-driven connectivity analysis) in the following way. The Results section now reads as follows:</p><p>Therefore, we adopted a complementary approach to trace the dominant modes of functional connectivity change within the EC in a fully data-driven manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haak et al., 2014</xref>; see Methods). […] The first and second-dominant modes of functional connectivity change were highly reproducible across resting-state sessions (Pearson's R = 0.99, p &lt; 0.001 and Pearson's R = 0.98, p &lt; 0.001, for the dominant and second-dominant modes, respectively).</p><p>In addition, we adapted the Methods section in the following way (subsection headed “Data-driven connectivity analysis”):</p><p>“To overcome limitations of the seed-based connectivity analysis, we employed ConGrads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haak et al., 2014</xref>), which allows for tracing the dominant modes of functional connectivity change within a pre-specified region of the brain in a fully data-driven manner. […] For the ROI analyses on the data of the spatial and non-spatial stimulation experiment, the clusters were warped into MNI space.</p><p><italic>B) As a related issue, the meaning of the two “connectopies” was difficult to figure out. It sounds like what the authors are saying is that there are two connectivity gradients, one anterior-posterior, and one that is lateral-medial. If so, it would be nice for the authors to spell this out, and to simplify the corresponding caption text for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>. Also, if the algorithm is pulling out two connectivity gradients, could the relationship be more simply and intuitively captured by a single al-to-pm gradient. If it does not distort the actual patterns in the data, the authors should consider somehow merging the two connectopies to create simple alEC and pmEC ROIs. At present, it is difficult for the reader to look at the figures and see a figure that convincingly depicts the functional topography that is described in the text</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We replaced the term ‘connectopy’ with ‘dominant modes of functional connectivity change’.</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot simply merge the two modes of functional connectivity change. As described above, these represent vectors of multiple, spatially overlapping maps that are sorted according to how well they preserve the similarities among the original, high-dimensional connectivity fingerprints. Thus, the first vector represents the dominant mode of connectivity change in the EC, the second represents the second-dominant mode, and so forth. This is exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>In order to improve the written description of the functional topography and the correspondence with the Figures, we created <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> that shows coronal slices of the clusters from the dominant mode of connectivity change.
