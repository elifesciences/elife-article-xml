successful goal-directed actions in the face of changing physiological states, biomechanical constraints, and environmental contexts. Amongst these processes, implicit sensorimotor adaptation is of primary importance, ensuring that movements remain well-calibrated and accurate. A large body of work on reaching movements has emphasized how adaptation centers on an iterative process designed to minimize visual errors. The role of proprioception has been largely neglected, thought to play a passive role in which proprioception is affected by the visual error but does not directly contribute to adaptation. Here, we present an alternative to this visuo-centric framework, outlining a model in which implicit adaptation acts to minimize a proprioceptive error, the distance between the perceived hand position and its intended goal. This proprioceptive re-alignment model (PReMo) is consistent with many phenomena that have previously been interpreted in terms of learning from visual errors, and offers a parsimonious account of numerous unexplained phenomena. Cognizant that the evidence for PReMo rests on correlational studies, we highlight core predictions to be tested in future experiments, as well as note potential challenges for a proprioceptive-based perspective on implicit adaptation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>error based learning</kwd><kwd>motor learning</kwd><kwd>proprioception</kwd><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>sensory recalibration</kwd><kwd>motor adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009713</institution-id><institution>Foundation for Physical Therapy Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PODS II Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsay</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F31NS120448</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsay</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS116883-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivry</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K12 HD055931</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Hyosub</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1934650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Hyosub</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new computational model reveals how implicit sensorimotor adaptation is elicited to re-align one's felt and desired hand position.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Implicit adaptation of the sensorimotor system</title><p>Motor adaptation is an essential feature of human competence, allowing us to flexibly move in novel and dynamic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Krakauer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Morehead and Orban de Xivry, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>). A sailor adjusts her sails in response to variations in the wind; a basketball player fights against fatigue to maintain a similar force output. Motor adaptation refers to the processes that ensure well-learned movements remain accurate across a broad range of contexts.</p><p>Motor adaptation is not a unitary operation but relies on multiple learning processes. Paralleling the memory literature, one broad distinction can be made between processes that are under conscious control and those that operate outside awareness. To continue with the sailing example, a skilled skipper can strategically adjust the sails to achieve a desired heading, while implicitly maintaining that heading based on subtle fluctuations in the rope’s tension. The interplay of explicit and implicit processes in sensorimotor adaptation has been the focus of many studies over the past decade. Whereas the former is volitional and well-suited for rapid modifications in behavior, the latter occurs automatically and operates over a slower time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Hegele and Heuer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Huberdeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">McDougle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib203">Werner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Taylor et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Computationally, explicit and implicit processes for adaptation are constrained to solve different problems, whereas explicit processes focus on goal attainment, implicit processes are designed to ensure that the selected movement is flawlessly executed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this distinction, the deployment of aiming strategies to offset an experimentally imposed perturbation requires prefrontal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anguera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Taylor and Ivry, 2014a</xref>), whereas implicit adaptation is dependent on the integrity of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Butcher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Haar and Donchin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Hadjiosif et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Schlerf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Taylor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib189">Tseng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Tzvi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>One paradigmatic way to study motor adaptation is to introduce a visuomotor perturbation between the motion of the arm and the corresponding visual feedback. Historically, such visuomotor perturbations were accomplished with prism glasses that introduced a translation in the visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Helmholtz, 1924</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Kitazawa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Petitet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Redding and Wallace, 2001</xref>). Nowadays, motion tracking and digital displays enable more flexible control over the relationship between hand position and a feedback signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Krakauer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Krakauer et al., 2000</xref>). In a typical study, participants are instructed to make reaching movements towards a visual target on a horizontally mounted computer monitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). By positioning the hand below the display, vision of the hand is occluded. However, a visual cursor is presented on the monitor to indicate hand position, a signal that is readily incorporated into the body schema if its spatial and temporal properties are correlated with the movement. After a few reaches to familiarize the participant with the task environment, a rotation (e.g. 45°) is introduced between the motion of the hand and the visual cursor. If participants continued to move directly to the target, the cursor would miss the target, introducing a visual error. Over several reaches, participants adapt to this perturbation, with the hand’s heading angle shifted in the opposite direction of the rotation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Contrasting visuo-centric and proprioceptive-centric views of implicit motor adaptation</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experiment setup.

Hand angle is presented relative to the target (0°) during veridical feedback, rotation, and no-feedback trials (grey background). Hand angle is similar during the no-feedback trials for all four perturbation sizes, indicating equivalent implicit adaptation. Shaded region denotes SEM. Note that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bond and Taylor, 2015</xref>) used eight target locations, and thus, had eight reaches per cycle. (<bold>C</bold>) The cursor feedback (red dot) follows a trajectory that is rotated relative to the line connecting the start position and target (blue dot). With visual clamped feedback, the angular trajectory of the visual cursor is not spatially tied to the angular trajectory of the participant’s (hidden) hand but follows a trajectory that is at an invariant angle relative to the target. Despite awareness of the manipulation and instructions to always reach directly to the target, participants show a gradual change in heading direction that eventually reaches an asymptote. According to visuo-centric models, the goal of implicit adaptation is to minimize a visual error (i.e. error = visual cursor – target; upper panel), with the extent of implicit adaptation being the point of equilibrium between learning and forgetting (lower panel). (<bold>D</bold>) According to the proprioceptive re-alignment model (PReMo), the goal of implicit adaptation is to minimize a proprioceptive error (i.e. error = perceived hand position – target, upper panel). The perceived (shaded) hand position is influenced by the actual, the expected (based on efference copy), and seen (i.e. visual cursor) hand location. The extent of implicit adaptation corresponds to the point in which the perceived hand position is at the target (lower panel).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76639-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The aggregate behavioral change in response to a large perturbation is driven by a combination of strategic aiming and implicit adaptation. One source of evidence originates from a study examining how people respond to visuomotor rotations of varying sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bond and Taylor, 2015</xref>). Explicit strategy use, as measured by verbal aim reports, was dominant when the error size was large, producing corrective adjustments in reaching direction that scaled with the size of the rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, adapted from Figure 7A in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bond and Taylor, 2015</xref>). Yet, the extent of implicit adaptation, as measured by no-feedback aftereffects trials in which participants were instructed to ‘move directly to the target’ without re-aiming, remained constant for perturbations ranging from 15° to 90°. Thus, while explicit re-aiming can flexibly compensate for errors of varying sizes, implicit adaptation saturates, at least for large errors.</p><p>The rigidity of implicit adaptation is evident in a variety of other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Hegele and Heuer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Maresch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Mazzoni and Krakauer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Taylor and Ivry, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib203">Werner et al., 2015</xref>). The visual clamped feedback task provides an especially striking method to study implicit adaptation without contamination from explicit processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Morehead et al., 2017</xref>). With clamped feedback, the angular trajectory of the cursor is invariant with respect to the target, always following a trajectory that is offset from the target by a fixed angle. As such, the direction in which the cursor moves is not contingent on the direction of the participant’s movement. Participants are instructed to always reach directly to the target and ignore the visual cursor. Despite being fully aware of the manipulation, participants adapt, with the heading angle shifting in the opposite direction of the rotation in an automatic and implicit manner. Although the size of the visual error never changes, adaptation eventually reaches an upper bound, averaging between 15° and 25° away from the target. Consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bond and Taylor, 2015</xref>, this asymptote does not vary across a wide range of clamped rotation sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Neville and Cressman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Tsay et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Tsay et al., 2021c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>The visuo-centric view of implicit sensorimotor adaptation</title><p>Implicit adaptation in response to visuomotor perturbations has been framed as an iterative process, designed to minimize a <italic>visual</italic> error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cheng and Sabes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Donchin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Herzfeld et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Mazzoni and Krakauer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Morehead et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib179">Thoroughman and Shadmehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib205">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>). The visual error experienced on the previous trial is used to modify the visuomotor map, such that the motor command on a subsequent trial will be adjusted to reduce that error. According to this visuo-centric view, the extent of implicit adaptation represents a point of equilibrium, one at which the trial-by-trial change in heading angle in response to the visual error is counterbalanced by the trial-by-trial decay (‘forgetting’) of this modified visuomotor map back to its baseline, default state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Morehead and Smith, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>A widely employed model of implicit adaptation posits that trial-to-trial learning is driven by a visual error (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The learning process is controlled by a learning rate (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), which specifies how much is learned from the visual error.

To accommodate this effect, some models center on the notion that the motor system reduces its learning rate (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) in response to large visual errors, an argument that is motivated by the idea that large errors are rare, and likely due to external events rather than error within the motor system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Herzfeld et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Shams and Beierholm, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib202">Wei and Körding, 2009</xref>). Another hypothesis is that short-term plasticity is limited within the motor system, with the upper bound reflecting the maximum amount of behavioral change the motor system can accommodate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). While these models differ in how they are implemented, they all suggest that implicit adaptation is driven by a visual error, and that an asymptote is reached at the equilibrium between learning and forgetting.</p><p>This visuo-centric perspective on adaptation is appealing. Not only does it fit with a zeitgeist which holds vision as a ‘dominant’ sense, but it also matches our intuition of how we view task success: In day-to-day life, we frequently interact with visual objects, whether it be picking up a glass of water or moving the computer mouse over a desired icon. When a perturbation is introduced, we try to re-establish conditions such that the visual feedback is once again reinforcing. In visuomotor adaptation studies, the experimenter manipulates where the cursor is presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Krakauer et al., 2000</xref>) or when the visual cursor is shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Brudner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Honda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Kitazawa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The resultant change in hand trajectory is interpreted as a response to nullify the visual error. A dramatic demonstration of visual dominance comes from the study of deafferented monkeys and humans who have lost their sense of proprioception and haptics. Despite their sensory loss, deafferent individuals adapt in a similar manner as those observed in control participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bernier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Sarlegna et al., 2010</xref>), indicating that vision alone is sufficient to drive implicit adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Blouin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fleury et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Lefumat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Sarlegna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Taub and Goldberg, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Yousif et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>The neglected role of proprioception</title><p>Despite its appeal, the visuo-centric view is an oversimplification. The brain exploits all of our senses: While olfaction may not be essential for precisely controlling the limb, proprioception, the perception of body position and body movement, is certainly critical for motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Sober and Sabes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Sober and Sabes, 2005</xref>). The classic work of Mott and Sherrington at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century demonstrated that surgical deafferentation of an upper limb produced severe disorders of movement in the monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Mott and Sherrington, 1895</xref>). The actions of the animal indicated that the intent was intact, but the movements themselves were clumsy, inaccurate, and poorly coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Bossom, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Munk, 1909</xref>). Humans who suffer neurological disorders resulting in deafferentation show a surprising capability to produce well-practiced movements, yet these individuals have marked deficits in feedback control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Rothwell et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Sanes et al., 1985</xref>). Indeed, recent work indicates that healthy participants rely almost exclusively on proprioceptive information for rapid feedback control, even when visual information about the limb is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Crevecoeur et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A large body of work underscores the important role of proprioception in sensorimotor adaptation. First, deafferented individuals fail to generate specific patterns of isometric and isotonic muscle contractions in a feedforward manner as they initiate rapid elbow flexion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Forget and Lamarre, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Gordon et al., 1995</xref>). Second, neurologically healthy and congenitally blind individuals can adapt to a force-field perturbation without the aid of vision, presumably relying solely on proprioceptive input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">DiZio and Lackner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Franklin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Marko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Striemer et al., 2019</xref>). Third, when opposing visual and proprioceptive errors are provided, aftereffects measured during the no-feedback block after adaptation are in the direction counteracting the proprioceptive error instead of the visual error. Although it is possible that strategic effects extended into the aftereffect block, this result would suggest that proprioceptive errors can be prioritized over visual errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>) (also see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Haswell et al., 2009</xref>). Fourth, honing in on tasks that have eliminated strategy use, individual differences in proprioception are robustly correlated with the extent of <italic>implicit</italic> adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Ruttle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Salomonczyk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Tsay et al., 2021a</xref>) (but see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib194">Vandevoorde and Orban de Xivry, 2021</xref>). That is, both proprioceptive uncertainty during baseline and proprioceptive biases induced by a visuo-proprioceptive discrepancy are associated with greater aftereffects (Features 1 and 3).</p><p>Despite these observations, the computational role of proprioception in implicit motor adaptation is unclear. In some models, proprioception is seen as playing a passive role, a signal that is biased by vision but does not drive implicit adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Mattar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Ohashi et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Ohashi et al., 2019b</xref>). Other models consider a contribution of proprioception to implicit adaptation, but the computational principles of how this information is used have not been elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Ruttle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Salomonczyk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Zbib et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this review article, we present a new model of sensorimotor adaptation, the proprioceptive re-alignment model (PReMo). The central premise of the model is that proprioceptive error is the primary driver of implicit adaptation, solving the computational problem of ensuring an alignment of the perceived and desired position of the hand. After laying out a set of core principles motivating the model, we present a review of the adaptation literature through this new lens to offer a parsimonious and novel account of a wide range of phenomena. Given that much of the evidence reviewed here is based on correlational studies, we conclude by outlining directions for future experimental manipulations that should provide strong tests of PReMo.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Interaction of visual and proprioceptive information</title><p>Perception depends on a combination of multisensory inputs, contextualized by our expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Rock, 1983</xref>). In reaching to pick up objects in the environment, the location of the hand is specified by afferent inputs from muscle spindles that convey information about muscle length/velocity as well as by visual information relayed by photoreceptors in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Proske and Gandevia, 2012</xref>). Estimates of hand position from these signals, however, may not be in alignment due to noise in our sensory systems or perturbations in the environment. To resolve such disparities, the brain shifts the perception of discrepant representations towards one another – a phenomenon known as sensory recalibration.</p><p>In the case of a visuomotor rotation, exposure to the systematic discrepancy between vision and proprioception results in a reciprocal interaction between the two sensory signals. As shown in many studies, there is a pronounced shift in the perceived hand position toward the visual cursor, an effect that is referred to as a proprioceptive shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Burge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cressman and Henriques, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Recanzone, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Synofzik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Synofzik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">van der Kooij et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">van der Kooij et al., 2016</xref>). There is also a shift in the perceived location of the cursor towards the hand (i.e. visual shift) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Block and Bastian, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Rand and Heuer, 2019b</xref>), although this effect is much smaller and less consistently observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Simani et al., 2007</xref>) (see Appendix, ‘The contribution of visual shifts in PReMo’). For large discrepancies between vision and proprioception, this recalibration process does not result in a unified percept. Rather the shift within each modality saturates as the visuo-proprioceptive discrepancy increases. For example, visuomotor rotations of either 15° or 30° will result in a 5° shift in proprioception toward the visual cursor and a 1° shift in vision towards the actual hand position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Block and Bastian, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Rand and Heuer, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Salomonczyk et al., 2013</xref>). [Footnote 1: One critical difference between sensory recalibration and sensory integration is in terms of the resulting percept. As commonly conceptualized (but see Footnote 2), sensory integration results is a unified percept of hand position by combining sensory information in a weighted fashion based on their relative uncertainties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Burge et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">van Beers et al., 1999</xref>). It is a transient phenomenon that is measured only when <italic>both</italic> modalities are present. In contrast, sensory recalibration is an enduring bias that can be observed when each sensory modality is assessed independently].</p><p>Sensory expectations also play a role in sensory recalibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">’t Hart and Henriques, 2016</xref>). For instance, perception of the moving limb is biased towards the direction of the motor command (e.g. a visual target) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bhanpuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Blakemore et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gaffin-Cahn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gandevia and McCloskey, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Kilteni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Lanillos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">McCloskey et al., 1974</xref>). One model suggests that the cerebellum receives an efference copy of the descending motor command and generates a prediction of the expected sensory consequences of the movement. This prediction is widely relayed to different regions of the brain, providing a form of predictive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Grüsser, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Sperry, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib196">von Holst and Mittelstaedt, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib204">Wolpert and Miall, 1996</xref>). In sum, sensory recalibration seeks to form a unified percept of hand position by combining sensory inputs and sensory expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Körding and Wolpert, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Sensory recalibration has several notable features: First, sensory recalibration effects are enduring and can be observed even when each sensory modality is assessed alone. For instance, after exposure to a visual perturbation, a visual shift is observed when participants are asked to judge the position of a briefly flashed visual cursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Simani et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, a proprioceptive shift is observed when participants locate their unseen hand using a touch screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Ruttle et al., 2021</xref>). Second, these shifts occur rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Ruttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Ruttle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Ruttle et al., 2018</xref>), with both the visual and proprioceptive shift reaching asymptotic values within just a few reaches after the introduction of a visuomotor perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Ruttle et al., 2016</xref>). In the following section, we formalize how sensory recalibration during visuomotor adaptation drives implicit adaptation. Third, as noted above, while the extent of recalibration is a fixed ratio for small visuo-proprioceptive discrepancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib208">Zaidel et al., 2011</xref>), the magnitude of the change within each modality exhibits marked saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Salomonczyk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Tsay et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Tsay et al., 2020b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>The proprioceptive re-alignment model (PReMo)</title><p>Reaching movements are enacted to transport the hand to an intended goal. In most situations, that goal is to pick up an object such as the fork at the dinner table. The resultant feedback allows the brain to evaluate whether the movement ought to be modified. This feedback can come from vision, seeing the hand miss the fork, as well as proprioception, gauging the position of the hand as it misses the fork. The sensorimotor system exploits these multiple cues to build a unified percept of the position of the hand. When the action falls short of meeting the goal – the fork is missed or improperly grasped – adaptation uses an error signal to recalibrate the system. In contrast to visuo-centric models, we propose that the fundamental error signal driving adaptation is proprioceptive, the mismatch between the perceived and desired hand position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top). From this perspective, the upper bound of implicit adaptation will correspond to the point at which the hand is perceived to be aligned with the target.

One common method to quantify measures of proprioception involves asking participants to report the position of their hand after passive displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The psychometric function derived from these reports is used to estimate the participants’ bias and variability (see Feature 3 below for an extended discussion on proprioceptive variability).

In the latter case, the proprioceptive estimate requires an extra coordinate transformation. Nevertheless, PReMo can account for proprioceptive recalibration/shifts if provided with a representation of the actual hand position, predicted hand position, and visual feedback regarding hand position, with the orthogonal case requiring a coordinate transformation. There is considerable behavioral and neural evidence showing that we perform coordinate transformations with considerable flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Miller et al., 2018</xref>).

As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (Panels E-G), the magnitude of the shift is negatively correlated with the upper bound of implicit adaptation. That is, the more proprioception shifts towards the cursor position, the greater the extent of implicit adaptation away from the perturbed cursor. A similar pattern has been observed in many other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Clayton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gastrock et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Modchalingam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Salomonczyk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Salomonczyk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Simani et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The correlation between proprioceptive shift and the upper bound of adaptation is in accord with PReMo (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ14">Equation 14</xref>). A greater shift in perceived hand location towards the perturbed visual feedback would create a greater misalignment between the perceived hand position and the desired hand position (i.e. the perceived location of the target). As such, one would expect that a larger deviation in hand angle would be required to offset this shift. With the focus on the visual error signal, visuo-centric models of implicit adaptation do not consider how the visual perturbation impacts the perceived hand location. Thus, these models do not predict, or rather are moot on the relationship between proprioceptive shift and the upper bound of adaptation.</p><p>In the following section, we will explore five phenomena of implicit adaptation that can be accounted for by observed features of the shift in proprioception.</p><sec id="s6-1-1"><title>Feature 1, Corollary 1: The rate and extent of implicit adaptation saturates</title><p>Many studies of sensorimotor adaptation have examined how the system responds to visual errors of varying size. Standard adaptation tasks that use a fixed perturbation and contingent visual feedback are problematic since behavioral changes that reduce the error also increase task success. To avoid this problem, two basic experimental tasks have been employed. First, the visual perturbation can vary in terms of both size and sign on a trial-by-trial basis, with the rate of implicit adaptation quantified as the change in hand trajectory occurring on trial n+1 as a function of the visual error experienced on trial n (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Marko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib202">Wei and Körding, 2009</xref>). By varying the sign as well as the size, the mean visual error is held around 0°, minimizing cumulative effects of learning. Second, clamped visual feedback can be used to look at an extended learning function to a constant visual error signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Morehead et al., 2017</xref>). With these data, one can estimate an initial rate of implicit adaptation (e.g., change over the initial trials in response to a clamp), as well as measure the asymptotic value of adaptation. With traditional adaptation tasks, the asymptote of implicit adaptation can only be measured in an aftereffect block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bond and Taylor, 2015</xref>).</p><p>A striking result has emerged from this work, namely that the rate and extent of implicit adaptation is only proportional to the size of the error for small errors before saturating across a broad range of larger errors at around 5° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Kasuga et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Marko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Morehead et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Tsay et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Tsay et al., 2022c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib202">Wei and Körding, 2009</xref>). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the rate (e.g. trial-to-trial change in hand angle) is relatively invariant in response to visual errors that exceed 10°.

As such, the error signal that drives implicit adaptation only produces local changes around the location where the error was experienced.

Cross-sensory recalibration has been shown to result in visual and proprioceptive shifts that extend across the training space.

PReMo therefore provides a qualitative account of generalization as a combination of (1) a local pattern of generalization of implicit adaptation around the training target caused indirectly by the proprioceptive shift at the target location, and (2) a global pattern of generalization attributable to the proprioceptive shift at the start location. Future experiments should be conducted to quantify the relative contribution of these two components to the global pattern of generalization following adaptation to a visuomotor rotation.</p></sec><sec id="s6-1-3"><title>Feature 1, Corollary 3: Implicit adaptation is correlated with the proprioceptive shift induced by passive movements</title><p>Perturbed feedback during passive limb movement can also drive implicit adaptation.

In the exposure phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the participant’s arm was passively moved along a constrained pathway by a robotic device while a cursor moved to a remembered target location (i.e., the target disappeared when the robot-controlled movement started). Across trials, the passive movement of the arm was gradually rotated away from the cursor pathway over trials, eliciting an increasingly large discrepancy between the feedback cursor and perceived motion of the hand. When asked to report their hand position, the participants showed a proprioceptive shift of around 5° toward the visual cursor, comparable to that observed following active movements with perturbed visual feedback in a standard visuomotor rotation paradigm. After the passive perturbation phase, participants were instructed to actively reach to the visual target. These movements showed a motor aftereffect, deviating in the direction opposite to the cursor rotation. Moreover, the size of the aftereffect was correlated with the magnitude of the proprioceptive shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

The attenuating effect of delayed visual feedback has been attributed to temporal constraints associated with cerebellar-dependent implicit adaptation. Specifically, while the cerebellum generates sensory predictions with exquisite resolution, the temporal extent of this predictive capability is time-limited, perhaps reflecting the kind of temporal delays that would be relevant for a system designed to keep the sensorimotor system calibrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Keele and Ivry, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Miall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib204">Wolpert and Miall, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib205">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>). Delaying the visual feedback would presumably result in a weaker sensory prediction error, either because of a misalignment in time between the predicted and actual sensory feedback or because the sensory prediction fades over time. The consequence of this delay would be attenuated implicit adaptation.</p><p>Although we have not included temporal constraints in PReMo, it has been shown that delayed visual feedback also attenuates the proprioceptive shift; as such, the model would predict reduced adaptation since the signal driving adaptation is smaller (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4 equ6 equ8">Equation 4, 6, 8)</xref>. In visuomotor adaptation studies, the proprioceptive shift is reduced by ~30% for participants for whom the visual feedback on reaching trials was delayed by 750ms, relative to those for whom the feedback was not delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Debats and Heuer, 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Debats et al., 2021</xref>). A similar phenomenon is seen in a completely different task used to study proprioceptive shift, the rubber hand illusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Botvinick and Cohen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Longo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Makin et al., 2008</xref>). Here, timing is manipulated by varying the phase relationship between seeing a brush move along the rubber hand and feeling the brush against one’s own arm: When the two sources of feedback are out of phase, participants not only report less ownership of the rubber hand (indexed by subjective reports), but also exhibit a smaller shift in their perceived hand position toward the rubber hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Rohde et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Shimada et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>While studies on the effect of delayed feedback hint at a relationship between proprioceptive shift and implicit adaptation, the supporting evidence is indirect and based on inferences made across several different studies.

For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Neville and Cressman, 2018</xref> found that participants exhibited less implicit adaptation (indexed by the motor aftereffect) when they were fully informed about the nature of visuomotor rotation and the strategy required to offset the rotation (see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benson et al., 2011</xref>; but see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib203">Werner et al., 2015</xref>). Relative to participants who were uninformed about the perturbation, the extent of implicit adaptation was reduced by ~33%. This attenuation has been attributed to plan-based generalization whereby the locus of implicit adaptation is centered on the aiming location and not the target location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Day et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">McDougle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Schween et al., 2018</xref>). By this view, the attenuation is an artifact: It is only reduced when probed at the original target location, since this position is distant from the center of the generalization function. Alternatively, if adaptation and aiming are seen as competitive processes, any increase in strategic re-aiming would be expected to damp down the contribution from the adaptation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>For the present purposes, we note that none of the preceding accounts refer to a role of proprioception. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Debats and Heuer, 2020a</xref> have shown that awareness of a visuomotor perturbation attenuates the size of the proprioceptive shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Debats and Heuer, 2020a</xref>). The magnitude of this attenuation in response to a wide range of perturbations (0° - 17.5°) was around 30%, a value similar to the degree to which implicit adaptation was attenuated by awareness in the Neville and Cressman study. A quantitative correspondence in the effect of awareness on proprioceptive shift and implicit adaptation is predicted by PReMo (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ14">Equation 14</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, there is some, albeit relatively thin, evidence that the proprioceptive shift and implicit adaptation may be attenuated by awareness. PReMo provides motivation for further research on this question, both to clarify the impact of awareness on these two phenomena and to test the prediction that awareness would affect proprioceptive shift and adaptation in a correlated manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6-2"><title>Feature 2. Non-monotonic function of perceived hand position following introduction of visual perturbation</title><p>A core feature of PReMo is that the error signal is the difference between perceived hand position and desired hand position. Perceived hand position is rarely measured, perhaps because this variable is not relevant in visuo-centric models. When it is measured (e.g. in studies measuring proprioceptive shift), the data are usually obtained outside the context of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cressman and Henriques, 2011</xref>).

Participants reached to a target and received 15° clamped visual feedback.

The results of the study, especially the non-monotonic shape of the hand report function, inspired the development of PReMo.]. Surprisingly, these reports followed a striking, non-monotonic pattern. The initial responses were biased towards the clamped visual feedback by ~5°, but then reversed direction, gradually shifting <italic>away</italic> from the clamped visual feedback and eventually plateauing at around 1° on the opposite side of the actual target position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Continuous <italic>reports of perceived hand position during implicit adaptation</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) On each trial, participants reached to a target (blue dot) with and received 15° clamped visual feedback (red dot).

It is this shift, a consequence of crossmodal recalibration between vision and proprioception, which introduces the proprioceptive error signal that drives adaptation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 8</xref>). This error signal results in the hand moving in the opposite direction of the clamp in order to counter the perceived proprioceptive error. This, in turn, will result in a corresponding change in the perceived hand position since it is determined in part by the actual hand position (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4 equ6">Equations 4; 6</xref>). As such, the perceived hand location gradually converges with the perceived target location.</p><p>Intriguingly, the perceived hand position does not asymptote at the actual target location, but rather overshoots the target location by ~1°. This overshoot of the perceived hand position is also accounted for by PReMo. During exposure to the rotated visual feedback, not only is the perceived location of the cursor shifted away from the actual cursor position due to cross-sensory recalibration, but this shift is assumed to be a generic shift in visual space, not specific to just the cursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Simani et al., 2007</xref>) (see Feature 1, Corollary 2 above). As such, the perceived location of the target is shifted away from the cursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Indeed, the overshoot provides a measure of the magnitude of this visual shift, given the assumption that behavior will asymptote when the proprioceptive error is nullified (i.e. when the perceived hand position corresponds to the desired hand position: the perceived target location).</p><p>Notably, the putative 1° of visual shift inferred from the PReMo parameter fits is consistent with empirical estimates of a visual shift induced by a visuo-proprioceptive discrepancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Rand and Heuer, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Simani et al., 2007</xref>). The convergence between measures obtained from very different experimental tasks supports a surprising feature of PReMo, namely that the final perceived hand position will be displaced from the actual target location. That being said, a more direct test would be to modify the continuous report task, asking participants to report the (remembered) location of the target rather than the hand.</p></sec><sec id="s6-3"><title>Feature 3. The effect of proprioceptive uncertainty on implicit adaptation</title><p>The preceding sections focused on how a proprioceptive shift biases the perceived hand position away from the movement goal, eliciting a proprioceptive error that drives implicit adaptation. Another factor influencing implicit adaptation is the variability in perceived hand location, i.e., proprioceptive uncertainty. This is also estimated from the psychometric function obtained from subjective reports of sensed hand position. If obtained during adaptation, the shift in perceived hand position would impact the estimates of variability. As such, a cleaner approach is to measure proprioceptive uncertainty prior to adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As shown in several experiments, greater proprioceptive uncertainty/variability is associated with a greater extent of implicit adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H, I, J</xref>).</p><p>As with measures of proprioceptive shift, conventional visuo-centric models of implicit adaptation do not account for the relationship between proprioceptive uncertainty and the magnitude of adaptation. In these models, the extent of implicit adaptation reflects the point of equilibrium between learning and forgetting from a <italic>visual</italic> error and do not specify how the extent of implicit adaptation may be related to proprioception. In contrast, PReMo predicts that proprioceptive variability will be negatively correlated with implicit adaptation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ14">Equation 14</xref>). When there is greater uncertainty in the proprioceptive system, the perceived hand position is more biased by the location of sensory expectations from the motor command (i.e. the visual target, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>). Therefore, participants with greater uncertainty in proprioception would require a greater change in their actual hand position to bring their perceived hand position into alignment with the perceived target.</p></sec><sec id="s6-4"><title>Feature 4. The effect of visual uncertainty on implicit adaptation</title><p>Visual uncertainty can also affect motor adaptation. In a seminal study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Burge et al., 2008</xref>, the visual feedback in a 6° (small) visuomotor rotation task was provided in the form of a sharply defined cursor (low uncertainty) or a diffuse Gaussian blob (high uncertainty). In the high uncertainty condition, motor adaptation was attenuated both in rate and asymptotic value. The authors interpreted this effect through the lens of optimal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Burge et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ernst and Banks, 2002</xref>), where the learning rate is determined by the participant’s confidence in their estimate of the sensory prediction and feedback. When confidence in either is low, the learning rate will be decreased; thus, the added uncertainty introduced by the Gaussian blob reduces the learning rate and, consequently, the asymptotic value of total adaptation. By this view, visual uncertainty should attenuate adaptation for all visual error sizes. [Footnote 6: Since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Burge et al., 2008</xref>) used a standard visuomotor rotation task where visual feedback is contingent on the participant’s behavior, the learning function may also include a contribution from strategy use. This motivated us to use the clamped feedback task in a re-examination of the effect of visual uncertainty on implicit adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib180">Tsay et al., 2020a</xref>)].</p><p>PReMo offers an alternative interpretation of these results. Rather than assume that visual uncertainty impacts the strength of the error signal, PReMo postulates that visual uncertainty indirectly affects implicit adaptation by influencing the magnitude of the proprioceptive shift. This hypothesis predicts that the impact of visual uncertainty may depend on the visual error size.</p><p>To explain this prediction, consider <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ14">Equation 14</xref>, the core equation specifying the relationship between the upper bound of implicit adaptation and the degree of the proprioceptive shift, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf54"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> .

The effect of sensory prediction uncertainty on implicit adaptation</title><p>All models of implicit adaptation require a comparison of predicted and observed feedback to derive an error signal. In the previous section, we discussed how PReMo can account for attenuated adaptation observed in the face of noisy feedback – a variable that is easy to manipulate.

Extrinsic variability, defined here as variability in movement outcomes that are not attributable to one’s own motor output, will reduce one’s ability to make accurate sensory predictions. Such effects are usually simulated in the lab by varying the perturbation across trials. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2021</xref> compared implicit adaptation (i.e. indexed by motor aftereffects during the washout phase where participants were instructed to forgo any strategy use) in two groups of participants, one exposed to a constant 30° visuomotor rotation and a second exposed to a variable rotation that, across trials, averaged 30° (SD = 12°) (Experiment 7 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2021</xref>). Aftereffects were attenuated by around 30% in the latter condition. From the perspective of PReMo, this effect could be attributed to increased sensory prediction noise.</p><p>However, these results should be interpreted with caution: Other studies have found no effect of perturbation variability on adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avraham et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Butcher et al., 2017</xref>) or even an amplified effect on learning from increased perturbation variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Burge et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, the attenuation of adaptation due to uncertainly can emerge from differential sampling of error space relative to a condition with low uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Tsay et al., 2022c</xref>), even when the learning rate is identical for the two conditions. Given the mixed results on this issue (also see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Hutter and Taylor, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib199">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), it is unclear if extrinsic variability contributes to the strength of the sensory prediction.</p><p>We define variability as noise arising within the agent’s nervous system.

For example, the disease process may result in a lower (generic) learning rate or core proprioceptive variables. However, with respect to the latter, various lines of evidence indicate that proprioception, at least those aspects highlighted in PReMo, are not impacted by cerebellar pathology. First, these individuals do not exhibit impairment on measures of proprioception obtained without volitional movement (i.e., under static conditions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bhanpuri et al., 2013</xref>).

In terms of arm movements, force-field perturbations have provided a second model task to study adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Shadmehr et al., 1993</xref>). In a typical task, participants reach to a visual target while holding the handle of a robotic device. The robot is programmed such that it exerts a velocity-dependent force in a direction orthogonal to the hand’s movement. Over the course of learning, participants come to exert an opposing time-varying force, resulting in a trajectory that once again follows a relatively straight path to the target.</p><p>In contrast to visuomotor adaptation tasks, there is no manipulation of sensory feedback in a typical force-field study; people see and feel their hand exactly where it is throughout the experiment. Nevertheless, several studies have reported sensory shifts following force-field adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).

At the end of the movement, the participant judged the position of their hand relative to the target (left or right).

Consider the situation where a force-field pushes the hand to the right, an effect that is maximal at peak velocity for a velocity dependent force-field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–F</xref>). An estimate of hand position will involve intramodal integration of sensory feedback signals (the cursor for vision, the actual hand position for proprioception) and the sensory prediction (i.e. a straight trajectory of the hand toward the target). This will result in an integrated representation of the hand and cursor trajectory as shifted toward the target. Importantly, given that proprioceptive variability is greater than visual variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">van Beers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">van Beers et al., 1999</xref>), this shift toward the target is likely greater for the hand than the cursor. The visuo-proprioceptive discrepancy between integrated positions will result in crossmodal calibration, with the integrated hand and cursor positions shifted toward each other, forming the perceived hand and cursor positions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). Thus, there will be a small but systematic shift in the perceived location of the hand in the direction of the force-field perturbation.</p><p>Models of force-field adaptation suggest that the error signal driving adaptation is the deviation between the ideal and actual forces applied during the movement. This can be estimated based on the deviation of the hand’s trajectory from a straight line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Donchin et al., 2003</xref>). These models are agnostic to whether this error is fundamentally visual or proprioceptive since the position of the cursor and hand are one and the same. That is, the error could be visual (the trajectory of the cursor was not straight towards the target) or proprioceptive (the trajectory of the hand did not feel straight towards the target). Notably, neurologically healthy and congenitally blind individuals can adapt to a force-field perturbation without the aid of vision, with their perceived hand position relying solely on proprioceptive input from the moving limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">DiZio and Lackner, 2000</xref>). Similarly, deafferented individuals also adapt in response to force-field perturbations. Presumably their perceived hand position is dependent on the position of the feedback cursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Miall et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Sarlegna et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, when opposing visual and proprioceptive errors are provided, aftereffects measured during the no-feedback block after adaptation are in the direction counteracting the proprioceptive error instead of the visual error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>). As such, we suggest that force-field adaptation may be fundamentally proprioceptive. Consistent with the basic premise of PReMo, the difference between the perceived and desired hand position constitutes the error signal to drive force-field adaptation, a process that can operate in the absence of visual feedback. Strikingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Mattar et al., 2013</xref> found that the degree in which participants adapt to the forcefield is correlated with the amount of proprioceptive shift in the direction of the force-field, strengthening the link between the sensory and motor changes that arise during force-field adaptation (also see Feature 1).</p><p>In summary, PReMo offers a unified account of the motor and perceptual changes observed during force-field and visuomotor adaptation – both of which place emphasis on participants reaching directly to a target. The applicability of the model for other types of movements remains to be seen. Proprioception seems quite relevant for locomotor adaptation where the goal of the motor system is to maintain gait symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Morton and Bastian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Reisman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>): The misalignment between the desired and perceived gait might serve as a proprioceptive error, triggering implicit locomotive adaptation to restore its symmetry. Indeed, for locomotor adaptation, it is unclear what sort of visual information might be used to derive an error signal. In contrast, the goal in saccade adaptation is fundamentally visual, to align the eye on a target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Groh and Sparks, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Grüsser, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Pélisson et al., 2010</xref>). The oculomotor system appears to rely on a visual error signal to maintain calibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Lewis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Noto and Robinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib197">Wallman and Fuchs, 1998</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>In the current article, we have proposed a model in which proprioception is the key driver of implicit adaptation. In contrast to the current visuo-centric zeitgeist, we have argued that adaptation can be best understood as minimizing a proprioceptive error, the discrepancy between the perceived limb position and its intended goal. On ecological grounds, our model reframes adaptation in terms of the primary intention of most manual actions, namely, to use our hands to interact and manipulate objects in the world. In visuo-centric models, the central goal is achieved in an indirect manner, with the error signal derived from visual feedback about the movement outcome being the primary agent of change. Empirically, the proprioceptive re-alignment model accounts for a wide range of unexplained, and in some cases, unintuitive phenomena: Changes in proprioception observed during both visuomotor and force-field adaptation, phenomenal experience of perceived hand position, the effect of goal and sensory uncertainty on adaptation, and saturation effects observed in the rate and extent of implicit adaptation.</p><p>To be clear, the core ideas of PReMo are framed at Marr’s ‘computational’ and ‘algorithmic’ levels of explanation. At the computational level, we seek to explain <italic>why</italic> implicit adaptation is elicited (to align felt hand position with the movement goal); at the algorithmic level, we ask <italic>how</italic> implicit adaptation is instantiated (felt hand position being a combination of vision, proprioception of the moving limb, and efferent information; movement goal being the perceived location of the target). We hope PReMo motivates studies that focus on the implementational level. Here we anticipate that it will be important to consider both peripheral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dimitriou, 2016</xref>) and central mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Latash, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Proske and Gandevia, 2012</xref>) to account for the modification of multisensory representations across the course of adaptation.</p><p>It should be emphasized that, to date, much of the key evidence for PReMo comes from correlational studies; in particular, the relationship between the magnitude of adaptation and the extent and variability of induced changes in proprioception following adaptation. While studies using a wide range of methods have revealed robust correlations between measures of proprioception and adaptation, other studies have failed to find significant correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Cressman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cressman et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib194">Vandevoorde and Orban de Xivry, 2021</xref>). The reason for these differences is unclear but may be related to the methodological differences. For instance, when proprioception is assessed via subjective reports obtained after an active movement, it may be impossible to dissociate the relative contributions of proprioceptive variability and sensory prediction variability to perceived hand position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Izawa and Shadmehr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Synofzik et al., 2008</xref>). More important, correlations of the proprioceptive data with implicit adaptation would confound these two sources of variability.</p><p>Development and validation of proprioceptive measures that do not rely on subjective reports may bypass these shortcomings. Rand and Heuer, for instance, have developed a measure of proprioception that is based on movement kinematics, without participants being aware of the assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Rand and Heuer, 2019a</xref>). Using a center-out reaching task, the participants’ perceived hand position after the outbound movement is inferred by the angular trajectory of the inbound movement back to the start position. A straight trajectory to the start position may indicate that the participant is fully aware of their hand position, whereas any deviation in this trajectory is inferred to reveal a proprioceptive bias. This indirect measure of proprioception shows the signature of a proprioceptive shift with a similar time course as that observed when the shift is measured in a more direct manner.</p><p>Even though each correlation, when considered in isolation, should be interpreted with caution, we believe that when considered in aggregate, PReMo provides a parsimonious explanation for a wide range of empirical phenomena. Importantly, PReMo provides sufficient detail to generate a host of qualitative and quantitative predictions based on a reasonable set of assumptions. For example, the computation of perceived hand position is based on established principles of sensory integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ernst and Banks, 2002</xref>) and sensory recalibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib208">Zaidel et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, the key proposition of PReMo, namely that implicit sensorimotor adaptation operates to reduce a proprioceptive error, is highly ecological.</p><p>As with all correlational work, inferences about the causality are indirect and may be obscured by mediating variables. For example, instead of implicit adaptation being driven by the proprioceptive shift, it is possible that the visual error introduced by a perturbation independently drives implicit adaptation and the proprioceptive shift. By laying out a broad range of phenomena in this review, we hope to establish a benchmark for comparing the relative merits of PReMo and alternative hypotheses.</p><p>Beyond model comparison and appeals to parsimony, a more direct tack to evaluate the core proposition of PReMo would involve experimental manipulations of proprioception. Brain stimulation methods have been used to perturb central mechanisms for proprioception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armenta Salas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balslev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balslev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Block et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Miall et al., 2007</xref>) and tendon vibration has been a fruitful way to perturb proprioceptive signals arising from the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bernier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bock and Thomas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Gilhodes et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Goodwin et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Layne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Manzone and Tremblay, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Roll et al., 1991</xref>). PReMo would predict that implicit adaptation would be enhanced with greater proprioceptive bias induced by tendon vibration to one muscle group (e.g. vibration to the biceps resulting in illusory elbow extension) and greater proprioceptive uncertainty via vibrating opposing muscle groups (e.g. vibration to biceps and triceps adding noise to peripheral proprioceptive afferents).</p><p>Adaptation encompasses a critical feature of our motor competence, the ability to use our hands to interact and manipulate the environment. As experimentalists we introduce non-ecological perturbations to probe the system, with the principles that emerge from these studies shedding insight into those processes essential for maintaining a precisely calibrated sensorimotor system. This process operates in an obligatory and rigid manner, responding, according to our model, to the mismatch between the desired and perceived proprioceptive feedback. As noted throughout this review, the extent of this recalibration process is limited, likely reflecting the natural statistics of proprioceptive errors. The model does not capture the full range of motor capabilities we exhibit as humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Listman et al., 2021</xref>). Skill learning requires a much more flexible system, one that can exploit multiple sources of information and heuristics to create novel movement patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib206">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). These capabilities draw on multiple learning processes that use a broad range of error and reinforcement signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Galea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Shmuelof et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Tsay et al., 2021b</xref>) that may be attuned to different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avraham et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Heald et al., 2021</xref>). While we anticipate that these processes are sensitive to multimodal inputs, it will be useful to revisit these models with an eye on the relevance of proprioception.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Open questions</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>How general are the principles of PReMo for understanding sensorimotor adaptation in other motor domains?

Alternatively, within the framework of PReMo, the impairment might relate to a reduced learning rate, a disturbance of proprioception, or a combination of factors. Specifying the source of impairment will require experiments involving tasks that yield independent measures of these variables to constrain parameters when fitting learning functions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>New insights into cerebellar function have come about by considering the representation of error signals in Purkinje cells during saccade adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Herzfeld et al., 2018</xref>). Can the principles of PReMo be validated neurophysiologically by examining the time course of error-related activity during adaptation. For example, in response to clamped feedback, PReMo would predict an attenuation of the error signal as proprioceptive alignment occurs whereas standard state-space models would predict little change, with the asymptote reached when the effect of the persistent error is offset by forgetting.</p></list-item><list-item><p>What are the implications of PReMo for physical rehabilitation of neurologic populations who are at high risk of proprioceptive impairments, such as stroke and Parkinson’s disease?</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s9"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>RI is a co-founder with equity in Magnetic Tides, Inc</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the CognAc lab, Sensorimotor learning lab, and BLAM lab for insightful discussions.

modalities exhibit a mutual attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Burge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ghahramani et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Hong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib208">Zaidel et al., 2011</xref>). For example, after being exposed to a persistent discrepancy between visual and auditory signals conveying an object’s location, the perceived location of the vision and auditory stimuli gravitate towards each other. Similarly, we would assume that that visual and proprioceptive signals are attracted towards each other in the context of a visuomotor rotation. The presence of a proprioceptive shift towards the cursor has been well-documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cressman and Henriques, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cressman and Henriques, 2011</xref>). However, the evidence of a visual shift towards the hand is much weaker (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Simani et al., 2007</xref>), and when observed, the effect is relatively small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Block and Bastian, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Rand and Heuer, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We note that visual shifts of the feedback and target play a minor role in PReMo. Implicit adaptation is driven by a proprioceptive error, the mismatch between the perceived hand position and the desired hand position (the visual target). These variables are not affected by visual shift. The effect of a visual shift comes about indirectly if one assumes that the perceived location of the feedback cursor is shifted towards the hand once the clamp is introduced. Assuming that shift is applied across the visual space, this would also shift the perceived position of the target. As such, adaptation would not cease when the hand is perceived at the true target location but rather at the perceived target location. The hand report data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Tsay et al., 2020b</xref> indicate that, at asymptote, the perceived hand position is shifted by about 1°. A shift of this size would result in a small increase of the upper bound of adaptation. Given the inconsistencies in the literature concerning a visual shift during visuomotor adaptation, it will be important to replicate these effects and more important, employ methods to directly measure perceived target position (e.g., blanking the target during the reach).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11"><title>Fitting the Proprioceptive re-alignment model</title><p>Using R language’s fmincon function, we started with 10 different initial sets of parameter values to estimate the parameter values that minimized the least squared error between the average data and model output.

For example, shift and uncertainty could each make positive, yet independent contributions to implicit adaptation. There are theoretical reasons, mainly from the sensory integration world to expect shift and uncertainty to be correlated. Empirically, however, several studies have found this to not be the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ayala et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Tsay et al., 2021a</xref>). While noting this is a null result, these data suggest that the degree of sensory recalibration may not follow a Bayesian optimal rule in which the extent of sensory shifts are based on the relative reliabilities of each sensory signal. This hypothesis is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib208">Zaidel et al., 2011</xref> who found that visual/vestibular cross-modal recalibration did not follow Bayesian optimality principles. Instead, these two sensory modalities appear to shift towards each other in a fixed ratio manner. For these reasons, we opted to formulate the proprioceptive shift in PReMo as independent of sensory uncertainty (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5 equ6">Equations 5; 6</xref>).</p></sec></app></app-group></back></article>
