We show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoids <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA14) in part by detecting PA14-produced NO. PA14 mutants deficient for NO production fail to elicit avoidance and NO donors repel worms. PA14 and NO avoidance are mediated by a chemosensory neuron (ASJ) and these responses require receptor guanylate cyclases and cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels. ASJ exhibits calcium increases at both the onset and removal of NO. These NO-evoked ON and OFF calcium transients are affected by a redox sensing protein, TRX-1/thioredoxin. TRX-1’s trans-nitrosylation activity inhibits the ON transient whereas TRX-1’s de-nitrosylation activity promotes the OFF transient. Thus, <italic>C. elegans</italic> exploits bacterially produced NO as a cue to mediate avoidance and TRX-1 endows ASJ with a bi-phasic response to NO exposure.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36833.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nitric oxide is a colorless gas that contains one nitrogen atom and one oxygen atom. Found at very low levels in the air, this gas is produced by the intense heat of lightning strikes and by combustion engines. Almost all living organisms also produce nitric oxide.

In mammals, NO regulates key physiological events, such as vasodilation, inflammatory response, and neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feelisch and Martin, 1995</xref>). NO regulates innate immunity and life span in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gusarov et al., 2013</xref>), as well as virulence and biofilm formation in different bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cutruzzolà and Frankenberg-Dinkel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shatalin et al., 2008</xref>). NO signaling is mediated by either of two biochemical mechanisms. As a reactive oxygen species, NO covalently modifies the thiol side chain of reactive cysteine residues (forming S-nitrosylated adducts), thereby modulating the activity of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foster et al., 2003</xref>). NO can also bind to the heme co-factor associated with soluble guanylate cyclases (sGCs), thereby stimulating cGMP production and activating downstream cGMP targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denninger and Marletta, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Almost all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, are able to produce NO with nitric oxide synthases (NOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh and Salerno, 2003</xref>). Due to its small molecular weight and gaseous nature, NO readily diffuses throughout the surrounding tissues to regulate cellular physiology. NO is also released into air, where it may function as an environmental cue. Lightning generates the major abiotic source of environmental NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Navarro-González et al., 2001</xref>). Despite its prevalence in the environment, it remains unclear if NO is utilized as a sensory cue by terrestrial animals to elicit behavioral responses. sGCs are the only described sensors for biosynthetically produced NO, mediating NO-evoked muscle relaxation and vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gow et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stoll et al., 2001</xref>). However, it is unclear if sGCs also play a role in NO-evoked sensory responses. In vertebrates, NO modulates the activities of various ion channels, either directly through S-nitrosylation or indirectly through sGCs. NO regulation of ion channels alters neuron and muscle excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolotina et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broillet and Firestein, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson and Garthwaite, 2010</xref>). For example, in salamander olfactory sensory neurons, S-nitrosylation of a cysteine residue in cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels activates these channels, thereby directly altering odor-evoked responses in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broillet and Firestein, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1997</xref>). CNG channels are highly conserved among invertebrates and vertebrates. Because both CNG channels and guanylate cyclases are essential for transducing responses for many sensory modalities, these results suggest that CNG channels and guanylate cyclases may also play a role in NO-evoked sensory responses.</p><p>Unlike most metazoans, the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> lacks genes encoding NOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gusarov et al., 2013</xref>) and consequently cannot synthesize NO. Nonetheless, <italic>C. elegans</italic> is exposed to several potential environmental sources of NO, including NO produced by bacteria, which regulates <italic>C. elegans</italic> stress responses and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gusarov et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> lives in rotting organic matter, where it feeds on diverse microbes, including the gram-negative bacteria from the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and the <italic>Bacillus</italic> genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Samuel et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits a rich repertoire of behavioral interactions with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Serratia marascens</italic>, and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandt and Ringstad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garsin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reddy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Styer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).

Prior studies reported that a PA14 mutant carrying a <italic>nirS</italic> mutation exhibits decreased ability to kill infected <italic>C. elegans</italic>, likely due to the decreased expression of virulence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Alst et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2009</xref>).

This avoidance response is mediated by a specific chemosensory neuron (ASJ) and requires NO-mediated activation of receptor GCs and cGMP gated ion channels. Below we discuss the significance of these findings.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>NO as an environmental cue</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is among only a few organisms that do not synthesize NO and, likely, acquires NO from the environment. We show that NO is sensed by a chemosensory neuron (ASJ), NO sensing requires functional ciliated sensory endings, and that NO sensing is defective in <italic>daf-25</italic> mutants (which lack DAF-11 and TAX-4 localization to cilia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fujiwara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jensen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wojtyniak et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate the role of NO as an external sensory cue that represents environmental information to worms.</p><p>Several results suggest that ASJ neurons are the primary NO-sensing neurons. NO-avoidance is strongly defective following genetic ablation of ASJ neurons. Similarly, <italic>tax-4</italic> CNG and <italic>daf-11</italic> rGC mutant defects in NO avoidance are partially rescued by transgenes restoring expression of these genes selectively to ASJ neurons. Given the partial rescue observed for ASJ expressed TAX-4 and DAF-11, it remains likely that other neurons also contribute to NO-evoked behaviors. Seven heme-containing sGCs (<italic>gcy-31–37</italic>) are expressed in oxygen sensing neurons AQR, PQR, URX, and BAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zimmer et al., 2009</xref>). Several sGCs, including GCY-35, mediate sensory responses to oxygen but also display a low affinity binding to NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, these oxygen sensing neurons may also respond directly to NO.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>rGCs and CNG channels are required for NO sensing</title><p>The only previously described NO sensors are sGCs that bind NO via their associated Heme co-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malinski and Taha, 1992</xref>). Here we show that NO-sensing by ASJ neurons is mediated by two rGCs (DAF-11 and GCY-27). Interestingly, a prior study showed that another rGC (GCY-9) mediates CO<sub>2</sub> detection by the BAG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hallem et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, rGCs mediate detection of two environmental gasses (NO and CO<sub>2</sub>) by <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In addition, we show that NO-sensing requires the function of the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel subunit TAX-4 in the ASJ neurons. Together, our results identify rGCs and CNG channels as one underlying mechanism for NO sensation.</p><p>How does <italic>daf-11</italic> mediate NO responses? While DAF-11 is required for both the onset and removal response to NO, neither DAF-11 nor GCY-27 contains a Heme-NO-binding (HNOB) domain. Instead, DAF-11 contains a Heme-NO-binding associated (HNOBA) domain, suggesting that DAF-11 mediates NO sensing by interacting with other NO-binding proteins. Consistent with this possibility, removing the HNOBA domain from DAF-11 abolished the ASJ calcium response to NO. In addition to NO sensing, <italic>daf-11</italic> mediates chemosensory responses to several volatile chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birnby et al., 2000</xref>). DAF-11 may regulate sensory responses to different cues by acting together with different signaling molecules. The complete transcriptome of ASJ is not yet available, which would aid the characterization of other factors that regulate various sensory transduction pathways in ASJ.</p><p>How do DAF-11 and GCY-27 detect NO? NO could be detected by S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues in DAF-11 and GCY-27 (or proteins associated with them), thereby activating the GC catalytic domain. Consistent with this idea, mutations inactivating the de-nitrosylating enzymes TRX-1/Thioredoxin and GSNOR-1 eliminate the NO-evoked OFF transient in ASJ, while having little effect on the ON transient. Thus, accumulation of protein SNO-adducts or SNO-Glutathione adducts (in the de-nitrosylation defective mutants) was associated with a loss of the ASJ response to removing NO. Alternatively, the transmembrane GCs may associate with other NO binding proteins, such as Heme-containing globins. In this regard, it is interesting that DAF-11, like the mammalian atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptors, contains a conserved cytoplasmic HNOBA domain, which is similar to PAS domains. HNOBA/PAS domains are thought to be directly bound by HSP90, a chaperone that catalyzes incorporation of heme groups into sGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghosh and Stuehr, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarkar et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, mutations in <italic>daf-21</italic>/HSP90 mimic all of the phenotypes found in <italic>daf-11</italic> mutants, indicating that DAF-11 function requires its interaction with HSP90 (potentially through binding to DAF-11’s HNOBA/PAS domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birnby et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, deleting the DAF-11 HNOBA domain abolished the NO response in ASJ. Thus, the coordinated action of DAF-21/HSP90 and DAF-11 in NO sensing could indicate that DAF-11 associates with other heme-binding proteins (e.g. globins). GCY-27 lacks the HNOBA/PAS domain, and consequently would have to detect NO by a distinct mechanism.</p><p>Our results suggest that DAF-11 and GCY-27 mediate different aspects of the NO response. GCY-27 is required for the NO-evoked OFF transient whereas DAF-11 is required for both the ON and OFF transients. The mechanism underlying this difference is not known but could reflect a differential GC activation by increasing (DAF-11) and decreasing (DAF-11 and GCY-27) NO concentration. A similar mechanism was previously proposed for detecting increasing (GCY-35/36) and decreasing (GCY-31/33) O<sub>2</sub> concentrations by distinct cytoplasmic GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zimmer et al., 2009</xref>). In this case, we predict that co-expression of DAF-11 and GCY-27 allows ASJ to detect both increasing and decreasing NO concentration, thereby producing ON and OFF transients.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>TRX-1 shapes ASJ’s bi-phasic response to NO</title><p>TRX proteins are redox sensitive proteins that have been proposed to play several important roles in cellular responses to NO. TRX has an enzymatic activity that removes SNO-protein and SNO-glutathione adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benhar et al., 2009</xref>). This de-nitrosylation activity is mediated by a pair of active site cysteine residues (C38 and C41 in TRX-1). Thioredoxins have also been proposed to promote nitrosylation of other protein substrates, and this trans-nitrosylation activity requires a third cysteine residue (C72 in TRX-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchell and Marletta, 2005</xref>). Our results suggest that TRX-1 regulates the NO-evoked ASJ response via two distinct activities. TRX-1 inhibits and shortens the NO-evoked ON response, as indicated by a larger and more prolonged ON response in <italic>trx-1</italic> null mutants. This inhibitory function of TRX-1 is eliminated in the C72S mutant, implying that inhibition is mediated by the TRX-1’s trans-nitrosylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchell and Marletta, 2005</xref>). Two results suggest that TRX-1’s de-nitrosylating activity promotes the NO-evoked OFF response in ASJ. The OFF response was eliminated in both <italic>trx-1</italic> mutants containing a mutation in the de-nitrosylation active site (<italic>nu517</italic> C38S) and in <italic>gsnor-1</italic> mutants (which lack a second de-nitrosylating enzyme) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benhar et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our results suggest that TRX-1 shapes ASJ’s bi-phasic response to NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Specifically, we propose that during NO exposure TRX-1’s active site cysteines (C38/41) are oxidized, thereby decreasing de-nitrosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engelman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Oxidation of C38 and 41 promotes C72 nitrosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barglow et al., 2011</xref>), which increases trans-nitrosylation activity. Thus, during NO exposure the net effect of TRX-1 would be increased trans-nitrosylation of protein substrates. We propose that these trans-nitrosylated proteins inhibit the ON response. Following NO-removal, TRX-1 active site cysteines are reduced, thereby enhancing TRX-1’s de-nitrosylation activity and inhibiting its trans-nitrosylation activity. As a result, following NO removal, inhibitory SNO-protein adducts formed during NO exposure could be removed by TRX-1’s de-nitrosylating activity, giving rise to the OFF response. Thus, the combined activities of TRX-1 produce ASJ’s bi-phasic ON and OFF responses to NO.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36833.014</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model for TRX-1/Thioredoxin function in NO sensation.</title><p>Our data suggest that two enzymatic functions of TRX-1 endow ASJ neurons with a bi-phasic response to environmental NO.

The de-nitrosylation activity is proposed to be active following NO removal and is proposed to activate the ASJ OFF response (by reversing the inhibitory SNO-protein adducts formed during NO exposures). This model is described in greater detail in the Discussion section.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36833-fig8-v2"/></fig><p>How does ASJ’s bi-phasic response to NO shape behavioral responses to NO and PA14? Mutations that diminish both the ON and OFF responses (i.e. <italic>daf-11</italic>, <italic>daf-25</italic>, and <italic>tax-4</italic> mutations) were also deficient for both PA14 and NO avoidance. By contrast, mutations that diminish ASJ’s OFF response but retain ON responses produced inconsistent behavioral results. For example, PA14 avoidance was decreased in <italic>gcy-27</italic> mutants, supporting the idea that OFF transients (which are deficient in <italic>gcy-27</italic> mutants) are required to promote avoidance behavior. On the other hand, PA14 avoidance was unaffected in the de-nitrosylation defective mutants, <italic>trx-1(nu517</italic> C38S) and <italic>gsnor-1</italic>, which also lack the OFF response. Finally, PA14 avoidance was significantly reduced in mutants deficient for trans-nitrosylation, <italic>trx-1(</italic>C72S) and <italic>trx-1(jh127)</italic> null mutants, which have a heightened and prolonged ON response. Collectively, these results support the idea that the temporal structure of ASJ’s NO response plays an important role in PA14 avoidance. However, it remains unclear how (or if) the bi-phasic ON and OFF responses are utilized to produce behavioral responses. To further address this question, we will need new behavioral assays. In our current assays, behavior is measured over many minutes (NO donor avoidance) or hours (PA14 avoidance). By contrast, ASJ calcium responses to NO addition and removal occur in 10–20 s. Thus, assessing the behavioral impact of the ON and OFF responses will require recording behavioral responses that are rapidly evoked by NO exposure and removal (for example in microfluidic chambers).</p><p>In principle, ASJ’s biphasic response could have several beneficial effects. A current model for <italic>C. elegans</italic> chemotaxis proposes that chemosensory cues elicit avoidance by decreasing the rate of turning, thereby promoting dispersal away from the cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999</xref>). In this scenario, ASJ’s biphasic response could promote avoidance behavior if the ON and OFF transients both resulted in decreased turning (thereby promoting movement away from PA14 or NO donors). Alternatively, ASJ’s rapid responses to NO (or other PA14 metabolites) could promote transcriptional responses or release of neuromodulators, which could modulate behavior or innate immune responses over longer time scales.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Metabolite sensing in pathogen avoidance</title><p>A prior study suggested that bacterially produced CO<sub>2</sub> was utilized as a contextual cue to promote <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoidance of another pathogen, <italic>Serratia marascens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandt and Ringstad, 2015</xref>). These authors proposed that environmental CO<sub>2</sub> indicates proximity to metabolically active bacteria, and that pathogen avoidance is mediated by the coincident detection of CO<sub>2</sub> in conjunction with other virulence factors. Such a coincidence detection strategy is proposed to optimize the ability of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to forage for nutritional resources since it would allow worms to actively feed on avirulent bacteria while avoiding ingestion of pathogenic bacteria. Our results suggest that <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoidance of PA14 is mediated by a similar coincidence detection strategy.

Forty synchronized young adult animals were washed off of OP50 plates, washed three times in M9 buffer, and transferred to the assay plates (0.5 cm off the edge of the bacterial lawn), incubated at 25°C, and scored for avoidance 8 hr later. PA14 avoidance exhibits some variability from day to day, most likely due to differences in PA14 growth or small variations in plate conditions.

NO donor solution was prepared freshly by dissolving DPTA NONOate (Cayman Chemical, #82110) in ddH2O to a final concentration of 100 mM. Forty synchronized young adult animals were washed off OP50 plates, washed three times in M9 buffer, and transferred to the assay plate (0.5 cm off the edge of the bacterial lawn). Immediately after, 10 ul of the NO donor solution was added on top of the OP50 lawn. Avoidance of the bacterial lawn was scored over the following 30 min. NO donor avoidance varies considerably across days, most likely due to differences in the time course and abundance of NO produced by different DPTA NONOate aliquots. For this reason, all figures represent same day comparisons for all genotypes.</p><p>All assays were conducted by an experimenter unaware of genotype or experimental treatment.

Fluorescence time-lapse imaging was collected on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U inverted microscope with a 40X oil immersion objective and a Yokogawa CSU-X1 scanner unit and a Photometrics CoolSnap EZ camera at five frames second<sup>–1</sup>. The GCaMP6.0s signal from the soma of the ASJ neurons was measured using Fiji. The change in the fluorescence intensity (∆F) for each time point was the difference between its fluorescence intensity and the average intensity over the 20 s of the recording before stimulus onset (F<sub>base</sub>): ∆F = F–F<sub>base</sub>. To analyze the response evoked by the onset of the NO donor for each genotype, the average ∆F/F<sub>base</sub>% within a 3 s window prior to the stimulus onset was compared with the average ∆F/F<sub>base</sub>% within a 10 s window after the switch; average ∆F/F<sub>base</sub>% 10 s after onset minus average ∆F/F<sub>base</sub>% 3 s before onset generates the ‘ON response’ (Figure supplements for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). To analyze the response evoked by the removal of the NO donor, the average ∆F/F<sub>base</sub>% within a 3 s window prior to the stimulus removal was compared with the average ∆F/F<sub>base</sub>% within a 20 s window after the switch; average ∆F/F<sub>base</sub>% 20 s after removal minus average ∆F/F<sub>base</sub>% 3 s before removal generates ‘OFF response’ (Figure supplements for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).Data was assessed for a normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. To assess whether a genotype generates an ON or OFF response, paired sample t-test was used for in group comparison for normally distributed data and a Wilcoxon signed rank test was used (SPSS Statistics) for data that were not normally distributed. The ON or OFF responses of mutants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> were compared with a common set of wild-type controls using Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance, which analyzes multiple comparisons on data that are not entirely normally distributed (Figure supplements for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Fresh NO donor solution was prepared before each recording session by dissolving 10 mg of DPTA NONOate (Cayman Chemical, Item Number 82110) in 15 ml of nematode growth medium buffer (3 g/L NaCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH6.0) and kept at room temperature for 30 min to allow adequate NO release before use.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH Research Grants DK80215 (JMK) and DC009852 (YZ).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Alejandro Aballay (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Both reviewers and the Reviewing Editor are overall enthusiastic about the work and the new insights the results provide into the interactions between nematodes and pathogenic bacteria. However, several issues were noted that will require revision prior to the manuscript being formally accepted. Some of these requested revisions are textual, and only a few experimental revisions are requested to strengthen the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The importance of the OFF response in ASJ neurons for NO avoidance behavior is shown – to a limited extent – in the behavioral analysis (Figure 5B) and in the calcium imaging (Figure 5E) of <italic>gcy-27</italic> mutants. (Consistently, the weak rescue of the behavioral phenotype in ASJp::<italic>tax-4</italic> in Figure 3C may be correlated with the unclear bi-phasic response in Figure 4E.) However, to strengthen the arguments in the paper, the authors need to examine whether the <italic>trx-1</italic> and <italic>gsnor-1</italic> mutants exhibit defects in the PA14/NO avoidance behavior.</p><p>2) Related to the above, the manuscript states that TAX-4 is required in ASJ neurons to elicit NO avoidance behavior (subsection ~” ASJ neurons mediate NO sensation to elicit avoidance behavior”, first paragraph). However, the transgene expressing <italic>tax-4</italic> selectively in ASJ neurons showed only partial rescue (Figure 3C). Similarly, killing of ASJ neurons led to only about 40% animals inside the lawn compared with about 80% animals inside the lawn when <italic>tax-4(p678)</italic> mutants are used (compare Figures 3C and 3F). Please rephrase (partial rescue) and discuss other ASJ-independent potential mechanisms.</p><p>3) The relationship between GCaMP6s signal and the avoidance behavior could be better explained. What is the physiological role of the bi-phasic response? Why does a class of sensory neurons need to be activated when they experience an increase as well as a decrease in a chemical stimulus?

(Consistently, the weak rescue of the behavioral phenotype in ASJp::tax-4 in Figure 3C may be correlated with the unclear bi-phasic response in Figure 4E.) However, to strengthen the arguments in the paper, the authors need to examine whether the trx-1 and gsnor-1 mutants exhibit defects in the PA14/NO avoidance behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we analyzed PA14 and NO avoidance behaviors in <italic>trx-1</italic> and <italic>gsnor-1</italic> mutants.</p><p>For PA14 avoidance, we observed robust defects in <italic>trx-1</italic> mutants, which are described as follows:</p><p>Results:</p><p>“To determine if protein-SNO modifications also regulate behavioral responses, we measured PA14 avoidance in <italic>trx-1</italic> and <italic>gsnor-1</italic> mutants. […] These results suggest that TRX-1’s trans-nitrosylation activity is required for PA14 avoidance.”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“How does ASJ’s bi-phasic response to NO shape behavioral responses to NO and PA14? Mutations that diminish both the ON and OFF responses (i.e. <italic>daf-11, daf-25,</italic> and <italic>tax-4</italic> mutations) were also deficient for both PA14 and NO avoidance. […] However, it remains unclear how (or if) the bi-phasic ON and OFF responses are utilized to produce behavioral responses.”</p><p>Consistent NO avoidance defects were not observed in <italic>trx-1</italic> and <italic>gsnor-1</italic> mutants. For several reasons, we do not believe that these experiments provide a sensitive test of TRX-1 and GNSOR-1 function in NO avoidance behavior. First, our current NO avoidance assay lacks the temporal resolution to detect behaviors acutely elicited by NO exposure and removal, as detailed in the revised Discussion section:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“In our current assays, behavior is measured over many minutes (NO donor avoidance) or hours (PA14 avoidance). […] Thus, assessing the behavioral impact of the ON and OFF responses will require recording behavioral responses that are rapidly evoked by NO exposure and removal (for example in microfluidic chambers).”</p><p>Second, NO avoidance exhibits considerable day to day variability due to the inherent variability in NO donor potency, as described in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“NO donor avoidance varies considerably across days, most likely due to differences in the time course and abundance of NO produced by different DPTA NONOate aliquots. For this reason, all figures represent same day comparisons for all genotypes.”</p><p>For these reasons, we are able to detect strong NO avoidance phenotypes (e.g. in <italic>tax-4</italic> mutants) but lack the sensitivity to detect more subtle phenotypes. Given these limitations, we chose not to include the new NO avoidance data in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the above, the manuscript states that TAX-4 is required in ASJ neurons to elicit NO avoidance behavior (subsection ~” ASJ neurons mediate NO sensation to elicit avoidance behavior”, first paragraph). However, the transgene expressing tax-4 selectively in ASJ neurons showed only partial rescue (Figure 3C). Similarly, killing of ASJ neurons led to only about 40% animals inside the lawn compared with about 80% animals inside the lawn when tax-4(p678) mutants are used (compare Figures 3C and 3F). Please rephrase (partial rescue) and discuss other ASJ-independent potential mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the Results and Discussion to address this concern:</p><p>Results:</p><p>“By contrast, a transgene expressing <italic>tax-4</italic> selectively in ASJ sensory neurons (using the <italic>trx-1</italic> promoter) (Miranda-Vizuete et al., 2006) fully rescued PA14 avoidance and partially rescued NO donor avoidance defects exhibited by <italic>tax-4(p678)</italic> mutants (Figure 3A and 3C).”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Several results suggest that ASJ neurons are the primary NO-sensing neurons. NO-avoidance is strongly defective following genetic ablation of ASJ neurons. […] Thus, these oxygen sensing neurons may also respond directly to NO.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The relationship between GCaMP6s signal and the avoidance behavior could be better explained. What is the physiological role of the bi-phasic response?</p></disp-quote><p>This question is now addressed in the Discussion section:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“How does ASJ’s bi-phasic response to NO shape behavioral responses to NO and PA14?

[…] Thus, assessing the behavioral impact of the ON and OFF responses will require recording behavioral responses that are rapidly evoked by NO exposure and removal (for example in microfluidic chambers).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why does a class of sensory neurons need to be activated when they experience an increase as well as a decrease in a chemical stimulus?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this comment. This question is addressed in the revised Discussion section:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“In principle, ASJ’s biphasic response could have several beneficial effects. A current model for <italic>C. elegans</italic> chemotaxis proposes that chemosensory cues elicit avoidance by decreasing the rate of turning, thereby promoting dispersal away from the cue (Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999). […] Alternatively, ASJ’s rapid responses to NO (or other PA14 metabolites) could promote transcriptional responses or release of neuromodulators, which could modulate behavior or innate immune responses over longer time scales.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, how does activation of ASJ neurons cause avoidance behavior? Additional discussion and a model of behavioral regulation in terms of the wiring as a supplementary information is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Prior studies showed that ASJ promotes avoidance (Meisel, Cell 2014; Ward, Nature Neuroscience 2008) or regulates ascaroside responses (Greene, <italic>eLife</italic> 2016). In particular, Meisel identified a pair of interneurons (RIM and RIC) as important synaptic targets of ASJ. Because none of our experiments address how ASJ wiring produces avoidance behavior, we do not feel comfortable commenting on this in our discussion. We hope that the reviewers will agree that understanding the circuit basis for PA14/NO avoidance is not required for our analysis of how AJ responds to NO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For all imaging experiments, please provide scatter plots (preferably) of the peak amplitudes for the ON and OFF responses, and perform the appropriate statistical tests to compare genotypes. Statistical analyses should be described in detail (in supplementary material if needed).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now provide average ON and OFF response amplitude scatter plots (see supplements to Figures 4-7). We compared mutant and wild type responses using the Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance, which is appropriate for multiple comparison on data that are not entirely normally distributed.

To avoid overlap with the ON response (which lasts up to 15 seconds), the baseline for OFF responses was the average signal in the 3-seconds before NO removal. To be consistent, we also used the 3-second average before NO onset as a baseline for ON responses. F<sub>base</sub> is the average response during the 20-second time window before the NO switch. This 20-second average signal is used to normalize each response trace to minimize the variability introduced by differences in GCaMP6 expression individual animals.
