xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/collections/9b1e83d1/reproducibility-project-cancer-biology">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> to investigate the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology. The initial aim of the project was to repeat 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers, using an approach in which the experimental protocols and plans for data analysis had to be peer reviewed and accepted for publication before experimental work could begin. However, the various barriers and challenges we encountered while designing and conducting the experiments meant that we were only able to repeat 50 experiments from 23 papers. Here we report these barriers and challenges. First, many original papers failed to report key descriptive and inferential statistics: the data needed to compute effect sizes and conduct power analyses was publicly accessible for just 4 of 193 experiments. Moreover, despite contacting the authors of the original papers, we were unable to obtain these data for 68% of the experiments. Second, none of the 193 experiments were described in sufficient detail in the original paper to enable us to design protocols to repeat the experiments, so we had to seek clarifications from the original authors. While authors were <italic>extremely</italic> or <italic>very helpful</italic> for 41% of experiments, they were <italic>minimally helpful</italic> for 9% of experiments, and <italic>not at all helpful</italic> (or did not respond to us) for 32% of experiments. Third, once experimental work started, 67% of the peer-reviewed protocols required modifications to complete the research and just 41% of those modifications could be implemented. Cumulatively, these three factors limited the number of experiments that could be repeated. This experience draws attention to a basic and fundamental concern about replication – it is hard to assess whether reported findings are credible.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>open data</kwd><kwd>open science</kwd><kwd>preregistration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Arnold Ventures</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Errington</surname><given-names>Timothy M</given-names></name><name><surname>Denis</surname><given-names>Alexandria</given-names></name><name><surname>Perfito</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name><name><surname>Iorns</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Nosek</surname><given-names>Brian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A project to repeat experiments from high-impact papers in cancer biology encountered a series of challenges, many of which were caused by a lack of detail in the original papers.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Template</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Science is a system for accumulating knowledge. The credibility of knowledge claims relies, in part, on the transparency and repeatability of the evidence used to support them. As a social system, science operates with norms and processes to facilitate the critical appraisal of claims, and transparency and skepticism are virtues endorsed by most scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2007</xref>). Science is also relatively non-hierarchical in that there are no official arbiters of the truth or falsity of claims. However, the interrogation of new claims and evidence by peers occurs continuously, and most formally in the peer review of manuscripts prior to publication. Once new claims are made public, other scientists may question, challenge, or extend them by trying to replicate the evidence or to conduct novel research. The evaluative processes of peer review and replication are the basis for believing that science is self-correcting. Self-correction is necessary because mistakes and false starts are expected when pushing the boundaries of knowledge. Science works because it efficiently identifies those false starts and redirects resources to new possibilities.</p><p>We believe everything we wrote in the previous paragraph except for one word in the last sentence – efficiently. Science advances knowledge and is self-correcting, but we do not believe it is doing so very efficiently. Many parts of research could improve to accelerate discovery. In this paper, we report the challenges confronted during a large-scale effort to replicate findings in cancer biology, and describe how improving transparency and sharing can make it easier to assess rigor and replicability and, therefore, to increase research efficiency.</p><p>Transparency is essential in any system that seeks to evaluate the credibility of scientific claims. To evaluate a scientific claim one needs access to the evidence supporting the claim – the methodology and materials used, the data generated, and the process of drawing conclusions from those data. The standard process for providing this information is to write a research paper that details the methodology and outcomes. However, this process is imperfect. For example, selectively reporting experiments or analyses, particularly reporting only those that 'worked', biases the literature by ignoring negative or null results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fanelli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Fanelli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ioannidis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Rosenthal, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Sterling, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Sterling et al., 1995</xref>). And the combined effect of constraints related to the research paper format (including word limits, and only reporting what can be described in words), the tendency of authors to report what they perceive to be important, and rewards for exciting, innovative outcomes is an emphasis on reporting outcomes and their implications, rather than a comprehensive description of the methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Kilkenny et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Landis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Moher et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The sharing of data, materials, and code can also increase the efficiency of research in a number of ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Molloy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Murray-Rust et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Nosek et al., 2015</xref>). For example, sharing provides opportunities for independent observers to evaluate both the evidence reported in papers and the credibility of the claims based on this evidence; it allows other researchers to analyze the data in different ways (by, for example, using different rules for data exclusion); and it helps other researchers to perform replications to determine if similar evidence can be observed independently of the original context. Moreover, giving other researchers access to data, materials, and code may allow them to identify important features of the research that were not appreciated by the original researchers, or to identify errors in analysis or reporting.</p><p>Transparency and sharing therefore contribute to assessment of research reproducibility, robustness, and replicability. Reproducibility refers to whether the reported findings are repeatable using the same analysis on the same data as the original study. Robustness refers to whether the reported findings are repeatable using reasonable alternative analysis strategies on the same data as the original study. Replicability refers to whether the reported findings are repeatable using new data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">NAS, 2019</xref>). By these definitions, all reported findings should be reproducible in principle; variability in robustness may imply fragility of the phenomenon or greater uncertainty in its evidence base; and variability in replicability may imply fragility, more limited scope of applicability than originally presumed, or uncertainty in the conditions necessary for observing supporting evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Nosek and Errington, 2020a</xref>). All three are important for assessing the credibility of claims and to make self-corrective processes as efficient as possible.</p><p>From 2013 to 2020, as part of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/collections/9b1e83d1/reproducibility-project-cancer-biology">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link>, we tried to replicate selected results in high-impact preclinical papers in the field of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Errington et al., 2014</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?sc5ZbU">Table 1</ext-link>). The aim of the project was not to repeat every experiment in each paper: rather it was to repeat a selection of key experiments from each paper. The project also adopted an approach in which a Registered Report describing the experimental protocols and plans for data analysis had to be peer reviewed and accepted for publication before experimental work could begin. The Replication Study reporting the results of the experiments was then peer reviewed to ensure that the experiments had been conducted and analyzed according to the procedures outlined in the Registered Report: crucially, reviewers were asked not to take the ’success' or 'failure' of the experiments into account when reviewing Replication Studies.</p><table-wrap id="table1"

In a separate paper we report a meta-analysis of the results of those 50 experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Errington et al., 2021b</xref>). In this paper, we describe the challenges we confronted during the different phases of the research lifecycle. A completed replication attempt passed through six phases: designing the experiment (and writing the Registered Report); peer reviewing the Registered Report; preparing the experiments; conducting the experiments; analysing the data (and writing the Replication Study); and peer reviewing the Replication Study.</p><p>The next section discusses in detail the challenges faced during the first of these phases. A subsequent section covers the challenges encountered when conducting the experiments and during the peer review of the Replication Studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>The challenges encountered when designing experiments</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sampling papers</title><p>At the start of the project in 2013 we searched various databases to identify basic research papers in cancer biology published between 2010 and 2012 that were having a substantial impact as indexed by citation rates and readership in multiple databases. We selected the highest impact papers from each year that met inclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). We excluded papers that reported exclusively genomics, proteomics, and high-throughput assays. This resulted in 50 included papers for which we initiated the process of preparing a replication. During inquiries with original authors, two papers were identified that we determined would be unfeasible to attempt and we decided to halt the effort; for another paper we requested, but did not receive, a key material (i.e., mouse model) so replication was not feasible. We decided to go back to the sampling pool and pull the next available papers, bringing the effective sample to 53 papers. Observing that challenges like this were relatively common, we did not return to the pool for resampling again for the rest of the project. Among the 53 selected papers, 35 were published in the Nature family of journals, 11 in the Cell family of journals, 4 in the Science family of journals, and three in other journals.</p><p>From each paper, we identified a subset of experiments for potential replication with an emphasis on those supporting the main conclusions of the paper and attending to resource constraints (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

For four criteria (protocol clarifications needed; authors helped; modifications needed; modifications implemented) the average of the scores from the experiments was assigned to the paper. For five criteria (data shared; analysis reported; code shared; reagents offered; reagents shared), scoring was conducted with a 'liberal' interpretation for sharing: for example, if data were shared for just one experiment in a paper, the paper was coded as data shared.

Additionally, it was uncommon for papers to include the summary statistics (such as sample size, means, standard deviations, and inferential statistics) that were needed to calculate the original effect size. We searched the original paper and supplemental files for the original data. When data were not publicly accessible, we requested them from the original authors.

Further, failure to share data upon request – even summary statistics – leaves the nature of the original research and inference testing opaque. When we could not obtain the data we needed we estimated means and variability from the available information reported in the original papers (e.g., estimating bar heights and error bars from graphs). In cases where there was no information to estimate, such as only a representative image, we treated the extracted representative data point as the mean and estimated a range of variances to determine the replication sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Errington et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Analytic code availability was not common, although, unlike data, we did not explicitly request it for all experiments.

We coded if we requested a key reagent (i.e., cell lines, plasmids, model organisms, antibodies) that was not available commercially or in a repository.

Zero experiments needed no clarifications (0%), 17 experiments needed few clarifications (9%), 77 experiments needed some clarifications (40%), 60 experiments needed moderate clarifications (31%), 29 experiments needed strong clarifications (15%), 10 experiments needed extreme clarifications (5%). To illustrate, one experiment needing few clarifications was missing reagent identifying information (e.g., catalog numbers), cell density at time of transfection (or harvest), and some specific details about the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methodology (e.g., ramping, derivatization volume, injection volume). An experiment needing moderate clarifications was missing reagent identifying information, specific details about the transfection and infection methodologies (e.g., cell density, amount of plasmid/viral titer), and specific details about the flow cytometry methodology (e.g., cell dissociation technique, specific gating strategy). And, an experiment needing extreme clarifications was missing reagent identifying information, specific details about the transfection and infection methodologies, specific details for injecting mice with cells (e.g., number of cells and volume injected, injection methodology), specific details about the bioluminescence imaging (e.g., amount and location of luciferin injected, time post-injection until measurement), and clarification of measurement details (e.g., the exact days post-injection when measurements were taken, how the reported ratio values were calculated).</p><boxed-text id="box1"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>Case study: Designing a replication protocol by reading the original paper.</title></caption><p>Designing the replication protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Kandela et al., 2015a</xref>) for measuring the effect of doxorubicin alone or in combination with a tumor penetrating peptide in mice bearing orthotopic prostate tumors was challenged by a lack of details in the original paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Sugahara et al., 2010</xref>). There was no detailed protocol for the peptide generation in the paper or the cited references. Instead, the sequence and a general description of the ‘standard’ technique was briefly described. Data variability, sample size, and statistical analyses were reported; however, no raw data was available. The strain and sex of the mice and the cell type and number of cells implanted were provided; however, there were no detailed protocols available for generating or harvesting the orthotopic prostate tumors which meant these details were filled in based on the standard approach used in the replicating laboratory. Most end-point measurements were described or discernable; however, there was no description of how ‘positive area’ was determined for TUNEL staining which meant this needed to be surmised and articulated for the replication attempt.

We coded if original authors were willing to share key reagents. Of the 45 papers for which we requested a key reagent, the authors of 33 papers (73%) offered to share at least one key material.

However, the original authors supplied us with most of the missing details. Based on the description in the paper, multiple strains of knockout mice could have been used for the replications. The authors provided strain stock numbers ensuring the same genetic background was selected. The authors also shared the raw data and statistical analysis: this was particularly helpful for understanding the original effects and sample size planning because the data did not have a normal distribution. The tumor cells used in the original study, engineered to express luciferase, were not available in a repository but the original authors provided them upon request. The authors also provided detailed protocol information and clarified uncertainties with reporting in the original paper. This included the age of the mice, injection details of the cells and luciferin (e.g., location, timing, procedural details), a detailed immunostaining and microscopy protocol (e.g., number of fields taken per section, magnification and specs of the objective), and the euthanasia criteria that was approved by the original study’s ethics committee. The latter determined the number of days the mice were maintained in the original study. The authors also shared an additional assay, which was included in the published Replication Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Sheen et al., 2019</xref>), that demonstrated the extracellular matrix remodeling capabilities of the cells that was not shown in the original paper because journal policy restricted the number of supplemental figures.

Authors were extremely helpful for 51 experiments (26%), very helpful for 28 experiments (15%), moderately helpful for 18 experiments (9%), somewhat helpful for 18 experiments (9%), minimally helpful for 17 experiments (9%), and not at all helpful/no response for 61 experiments (32%). An example of an extremely helpful response was the corresponding author reaching out to the other authors (who since moved to other institutions) to help with the requests, sharing detailed protocol and reagent information, providing additional information beyond what we requested to help ensure the experimental details were complete, and providing additional feedback on any known deviations that were needed (e.g., different instrumentation) to help ensure a good-faith replication would be designed. An example of a moderately helpful response was replying to all of our requests with the necessary information and providing additional clarifications when follow-up requests were made, but where some parts of the response were not very helpful. For example, a request for specific protocol details was responded with “a standard procedure was used.” Examples of not at all helpful responses include non-response to multiple requests (6/53 papers [11%]) or responses questioning the value of conducting replications and declining to assist.</p><p>An obvious hypothesis is that the helpfulness of the original authors was determined by the extent of clarifications requested because of the workload. If only minimal clarification were needed, then authors would be helpful. If lots of clarifications were needed, then authors would not be helpful.

A material transfer agreement (MTA) was initiated to obtain the plasmid. More than one year passed without the MTA being finalized preventing us from acquiring the plasmid. To complete the replication study, we regenerated the plasmid adding time and cost to the study. The regenerated plasmid for the replication study was deposited in Addgene (plasmid# 97204; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_97204">Addgene_97204</ext-link>) for the research community to easily access for future research.

Despite often obtaining original materials and reagents and having fully specified and peer reviewed protocols, it was common that the preregistered procedure had to be modified to complete the experiments (see Case study in <xref ref-type="box" rid="box4">Box 4</xref>). Sometimes just minor modifications were needed (e.g., changing antibody concentrations or blocking reagents to detect the protein of interest during a Western blot assay). Sometimes moderate modifications were needed. In some cases, for example, despite attempts to adjust the conditions, we were still unable to produce the expected intermediate results (e.g., obtaining the desired transfection efficiency as indicated by a reporter system) and an additional protocol step, different reagent source, or change in instrumentation was needed (e.g., including an enrichment step, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS], to increase the number of transfected cells). And in some cases extreme modifications to the preregistered procedure were needed. For example, in one case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib194">Yan et al., 2019</xref>) the preregistered protocol did not result in the generation of tumors in mice that were needed for a downstream infection and tumorigenicity assay, so substantial changes had to be made to this protocol to proceed with the experiment (e.g., changing the source of the tumor cells, modifying the timing and technique of infection to achieve the desired transduction efficiency, and using a different technique to detect the molecule of interest).</p><boxed-text id="box4"><label>Box 4.</label><caption><title>Case study: Solving challenges during data collection.</title></caption><p>The replication protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kandela et al., 2015b</xref>) for evaluating BET bromodomain inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to target c-Myc described the timeframe for tumor cell inoculation, injection with luciferin to image the tumor progression, and injection with a BET bromodomain inhibitor. This followed the same timing as the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). An initial attempt was unsuccessful in detecting bioluminescence even though disease progression was observed, indicating tumor cell inoculation occurred, and the luciferase expressing tumor cells had a strong luminescent signal prior to injection. Lack of bioluminescence meant that we could not test the BET bromodomain inhibitor because the predetermined baseline bioluminescence indicating disease progression for inhibitor administration was never achieved. We modified the preregistered protocol and selected for highly expressing cells to enrich the tumor cells. We also designed a pilot study to identify a modified time frame in which mice could establish the same detectable baseline bioluminescence as the original study before administration of the inhibitor. We included the initial preregistered study, the pilot, and the modified replication in the published Replication Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aird et al., 2017</xref>) and discussion of the variability of the timing from tumor cell inoculation until baseline disease detection, comparing the original study, the replication, and other published studies using the same model. This experiment was coded as “completely implemented” for the “extreme modifications” needed for the experiment.</p></boxed-text><p>We coded each experiment on the extent to which modifications were needed to conduct a fair replication of the original findings. No modifications were required for 25 of the 87 experiments (29%), few modifications for 18 (21%), some modifications for 12 (14%), moderate modifications for 8 (9%), strong modifications for 6 (7%), and extreme modifications for 7 (8%). We did not start 11 experiments and thus did not assess the level of modification required for these. This means that a total of 76 experiments were started.</p><p>The implementation of the modifications varied. When modifications could be carried out, in some cases they were completely implemented (see Case study in <xref ref-type="box" rid="box4">Box 4</xref>) and in others they were only partially implemented. For example, modifications were successfully implemented to reach some preregistered end-point measurements, but not all (e.g., modifications were implemented to enable quantification of one protein of interest, while continued challenges detecting another protein of interest was eventually halted). Not all modifications could be carried out. In some cases this was due to feasibility or resource constraints; and in other cases it was due to pronounced differences in the behavior of model systems or experimental protocols from what was reported in the original paper that had no obvious strategy for modification (see Case study in <xref ref-type="box" rid="box5">Box 5</xref>). We coded the extent to which we were able to implement the needed modifications to complete the replication experiments. Modifications were not needed for 25 of the 87 experiments (29%). We completely implemented modifications for 21 experiments (24%), mostly implemented them for four experiments (5%), moderately implemented them for four experiments (5%), implemented some of them for six experiments (7%), implemented few of them for four experiments (5%), and did not implement any for 12 experiments (14%). As before, the 11 experiments that were not started were not assessed. Excluding papers that needed no modifications or were not assessed, the correlation between extent of modification needed and implementation of modifications was –0.01 (95% CI [–0.42, 0.40]) across papers and 0.01 (95% CI [–0.27, 0.28]) across all experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><boxed-text id="box5"><label>Box 5.</label><caption><title>Case study: Failing to solve challenges during data collection.</title></caption><p>The replication protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chroscinski et al., 2015b</xref>) for evaluating whether glioblastoma stem-like cell-derived endothelial cells contribute to tumor growth in vivo required generating cancer cells that stably expressed the thymidine kinase gene under the control of the transcriptional regulatory elements of the endothelial marker <italic>Tie2</italic>. The preregistered protocol required achieving at least 80% positive expression of the gene, based on a GFP reporter, among the cell populations before proceeding with the xenograft experiment. However, after multiple attempts the required expression level could not be achieved despite obtaining new cells, plasmids, and incorporating changes to the protocol suggested by the original authors to improve the infection efficiency and enrich GFP expressing cells. Eventually, the replication attempt was stopped because of the increasing costs associated with multiple optimization attempts with no feasible path to a solution. The original finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2010</xref>), that selective killing of tumor-derived endothelial cells results in tumor reduction and degeneration, was not tested.

The observed implementation challenges could mean that the original finding is not valid because the model system or other parts of the protocol do not operate that way in reality – for example, the original procedure was confounded or influenced by some unrecognized factors. It might also be that, in some cases, a failure to replicate was caused by the replication team deviating from the protocol in some way that was not recognized, or that a key part of the procedure was left out of the protocol inadvertently. It is also possible that the effect reported in the original paper depended on methodological factors that were not identified by original authors, the replication team, or any other experts involved in the peer review of the original paper or the Registered Report.</p><p>Whatever the reason, all of these factors are barriers to replicability and causes of friction in efficiency of replication and discovery. Failures during implementation leave untested the original claim because the original experiment could not be carried out as described. That does not falsify the original claim because the replication does not test it. But, depending on the reasons for failure in implementation, it could raise doubt about the reliability of the claim if it seems that the original methodology could not have produced the reported outcomes either. For example, if the replication study suggests that the model system does not behave as reported in the original study, it could indicate a flaw in the original study or an unknown feature that is necessary to obtain the original behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The challenges encountered during peer review of the Replication Studies</title><p>In total, we completed 50 experiments from 23 of the original papers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This means that no experiments were completed for six of the original papers for which Registered Reports were published. For 18 of the original papers we were able to complete all experiments described in the Registered Report, so for each of these we prepared and submitted a Replication Study that reported the results of the completed experiments. For five of the original papers we were only able to complete some of the experiments described in the Registered Report: in these cases the results of the completed experiments were reported in an aggregate paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Errington et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>In the Registered Report/Replication Study model (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cos.io/rr/">https://cos.io/rr/</ext-link>), peer review of the Replication Study is supposed to be independent of outcome to mitigate publication bias, suppression of negative results, and results-contingent motivated reasoning interfering with publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Nosek and Lakens, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chambers, 2019</xref>). Reviewers examine whether the authors completed the experiments as proposed, appropriately interpreted the outcomes, and met any outcome-independent quality control criteria that were defined during the review of the Registered Report. Usually the review process played out according to these ideals, occasionally it did not. This is understandable, partly because the Registered Report model is new for many reviewers, and partly because when observed outcomes differ from expectations it provokes immediate reasoning and rationalizing about why it occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Nosek and Errington, 2020a</xref>). Indeed, such interrogation of unexpected outcomes is productive for hypothesis generation and exploration of what could be studied next.</p><p>A presumed virtue of Registered Reports is that it incorporates preregistration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Camerer et al., 2018</xref>) to very clearly separate hypothesis testing (confirmatory) and hypothesis generating (exploratory) modes of analysis. Another virtue is that expert feedback is incorporated during design to improve the quality of the experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Soderberg et al., 2021</xref>). During peer review of the Registered Reports the reviewers ensure that the proposed experiments are appropriately designed and fair tests of the original findings. That precommitment, by both replication authors and reviewers, is a mechanism to ensure that all results are taken seriously whether they confirm or disconfirm the original finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Nosek and Errington, 2020b</xref>).</p><p>During peer review of the Replication Study, the authors and reviewers observe the outcomes and wrestle with what they mean. But, because they made precommitments to the experiments being diagnostic tests of the original finding, new ideas that occur following observation of the outcomes are clearly designated as hypothesis generating ideas for what should be studied next. For example, when an outcome is inconsistent with the original finding, it is common for reviewers to return and re-evaluate methodology (see Case study in <xref ref-type="box" rid="box6">Box 6</xref>). Features or differences from the original experiments that seemed immaterial a priori become potentially important <italic>post facto</italic>. The risk, of course, is that the <italic>post facto</italic> reasoning is just rationalization to maintain belief in an original finding that should now be questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Kerr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Kunda, 1990</xref>). Registered Reports mitigates that risk with the precommitment to publishing regardless of outcomes, and then speculations for the causes of different results from the original experiments can be actively and independently tested to assess their veracity.</p><boxed-text id="box6"><label>Box 6.</label><caption><title>Case study: Peer review of protocols prior to conducting the experiments and after the results are known.</title></caption><p>The replication protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Vanden Heuvel et al., 2016</xref>) for testing the sensitivity of Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines to PARP inhibitors was based on the original paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>), like all replication protocols. The original authors provided additional feedback to ensure a good-faith replication protocol. Peer review of the protocols further increased the rigor and accuracy of the experimental designs, such as including additional measurements of proliferation to ensure all cell lines were replicating at the time of drug treatment and specifying the minimal number of colonies in the control condition before stopping the experiment. Peer review of the protocols also acknowledged the challenge we faced of not having access to all of the exact same cell lines as the original study and did not raise any concerns when cell lines of the same disease/status were proposed (e.g., different Ewing’ sarcoma cell lines). After the experiments were conducted, the results were submitted for peer review, and the reviewer comments were largely focused on trying to reconcile the differences between the results of the original study and the results of the replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Vanden Heuvel et al., 2018</xref>). A lack of concern about inexact comparability of cell lines in the reviews before the results were known was replaced with highlighted concern that this difference accounted for the lack of statistically significant results in the replication after the results were known. Similarly, after the fact, reviewers raised concerns about the timing of an experiment as potentially not allowing for the effect to be measurable due to the need for cells to be in a proliferative state despite the fact that the design was identical between the replication and original experiments. Some speculations, such as the use of different sarcoma cell lines and the level of knockdown efficiency, are possible explanations for the different results in the replication experiments, but they require follow-up tests to assess whether they actually account for the observed differences. We included these possibilities when discussing the results in the Replication Study, but disagreed with a request from the reviewers that the speculations justified labeling the replication result as “inconclusive”.</p></boxed-text><p>This mostly occurred as intended in this project.

Our experience conducting this project identifies a much more basic and fundamental concern about replication – it is hard <italic>to assess</italic> whether reported findings are credible. We attempted to replicate 193 experiments from 53 papers, but we experienced reproducibility challenges at every phase of the research lifecycle. Many original papers failed to report key descriptive and inferential statistics including 27 % of experiments just presenting representative images and 21% of experiments reporting inferential test outcomes not reporting which test was conducted. Raw data was publicly accessible for just 2% of experiments to reproduce the findings, compute effect sizes, and conduct power analyses. After requesting original data from authors, we acquired raw data for 16%, summary data for 14%, and nothing for 68% of experiments. None of the 193 experiments was described completely enough to design a replication protocol without requesting clarifying details from the original authors.</p><p>Authors were bimodal in their helpfulness in sharing data and materials and providing feedback, 32% were <italic>not at all helpful/no response</italic> and 26 % were <italic>extremely helpful</italic>. Implementation of peer-reviewed and preregistered protocols often led to unexpected challenges such as model systems behaving differently than originally reported, requiring modifications to protocols. Just 33% of experiments required no modifications. Of those needing modifications, 41% were implemented completely. Cumulatively, these process challenges for assessing replicability slowed the project and increased costs (see Appendix 1). After an extended data collection period, we completed replications of 50 experiments from 23 papers.</p><p>Original papers do not include enough information about the methodology and results. Original data and materials are not archived and accessible in repositories. Original authors are variably willing or able to clarify information gaps and share data, materials, and reagents to facilitate assessment of original findings. These challenges slowed progress, inflated costs, and made it harder to design and conduct replication studies. None of this is a direct indication of whether any particular original finding is credible, but all of it is a challenge for credibility of research in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Begley and Ioannidis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ioannidis et al., 2014</xref>). Credibility of scientific claims is rooted in their independent verifiability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Nosek and Errington, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Putnam, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Schmidt, 2009</xref>). Pervasive impediments to verification mean that research is not living up to the “show me” ethos of science and is functionally operating as a “trust me” enterprise.</p><p>Practical barriers to the assessment of replicability compounds the credibility risk that is already present with a research culture that prizes innovation at the expense of verification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Martin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Sovacool, 2008</xref>). Publication is achieved, grants are given, and careers are made on the production of positive results not negative results, tidy evidence and explanation not uncertainty and exceptions, and novel findings not replications or incremental extensions of prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Giner-Sorolla, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Mahoney, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Nosek et al., 2012</xref>). These incentives encourage publication bias against negative results and selective reporting to indicate stronger, cleaner findings than the reality of the evidence – and the behaviors that produce these outcomes could occur without intention or control via motivated reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Hart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Kunda, 1990</xref>), confirmation bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Nickerson, 1998</xref>), and hindsight bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Christensen-Szalanski and Willham, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Fischhoff and Beyth, 1975</xref>). Lack of documentation and transparency of the research process makes it difficult to identify these behaviors. And, even if researchers are motivated to conduct independent verification, not only are there disincentives to spend resources on reproduction and replication and cultural resistance to the practice, there are also mundane practical barriers to doing so because of lack of documentation, transparency, and sharing. In short, we have created a research culture in which assessing replicability and reproducibility is unrewarded, unnecessarily difficult, and potentially career damaging.</p><p>If the published literature were highly credible, and if false starts were efficiently weeded out of the literature, then the lack of reward and feasibility for verification and replication efforts might not be a cause for concern. However, the present evidence suggests that we should be concerned. As reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Errington et al., 2021b</xref>, replication efforts frequently produced evidence that was weaker or inconsistent with original studies. These results corroborate similar efforts by pharmaceutical companies to replicate findings in cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Begley and Ellis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Prinz et al., 2011</xref>), efforts by a non-profit biotech to replicate findings of potential drugs in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Perrin, 2014</xref>)<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?gHSYly">,</ext-link> and systematic replication efforts in other disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Camerer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Camerer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ebersole et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ebersole et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Klein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Open Science Collaboration, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Steward et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the evidence for self-corrective processes in the scientific literature is underwhelming: extremely few replication studies are published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Makel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Makel and Plucker, 2014</xref>); preclinical findings are often advanced to clinical trials before they have been verified and replicated by other laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chalmers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Drucker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Ramirez et al., 2017</xref>); and many papers continue to be cited even after they have been retracted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Budd et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Madlock-Brown and Eichmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Pfeifer and Snodgrass, 1990</xref>). If replicability is low and the self-correction processes in science are not efficiently separating the credible from the not credible, then the culture of modern research is creating unnecessary friction in the pace of discovery.</p><p>Fundamentally, the problem with practical barriers to assessing replicability and reproducibility is that it increases uncertainty in the credibility of scientific claims. Are we building on solid foundations? Do we know what we think we know? Assessing replicability and reproducibility are important mechanisms for identifying whether findings are credible, for clarifying boundary conditions on circumscribed findings, and for generalizing findings to untested circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Nosek and Errington, 2020a</xref>). There are open questions about the appropriate distribution of resource investment between innovation and verification efforts. Here, for example, though costs increased because of the unexpected impediments, the final cost per experiment of approximately $53,000 might be seen as comparatively modest compared to the losses incurred by follow-on research for findings that are unreplicable or much more limited than initially believed. DARPA’s Friend or Foe program might be a case in point in which a portion of the program budget is invested in independent verification and validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Raphael et al., 2020</xref>). In any case, an efficient science would not impose unnecessary practical barriers to verification just as it should not impose unnecessary practical barriers to innovation. We can do better. Fortunately, there are mechanisms that could greatly enhance the ability to assess whether reported findings are credible, and reduce the barriers to verification efforts more generally. Moreover, some mechanisms are in practice already demonstrating their feasibility for broad implementation.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Improving documentation and reporting</title><p>Reading the paper and supplementary materials was sufficient to design the replication study for none of the 193 experiments. Lack of interest or attention to methods, space constraints, and an absence of standards may all contribute to weaknesses in documentation of how the research was done. Better reporting will improve research efficiency by helping authors and peer reviewers identify errors or other potential limitations. Better reporting will also improve research efficiency by helping readers who wish to replicate or extend the research to develop accurate experimental designs. Our sample of papers came from articles published between 2010 and 2012. Since then, some publishers have taken steps to improve reporting and standards have emerged to promote consistency, clarity, and accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Marcus, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Nature, 2013</xref>), and a coalition of publishers and other stakeholders are promoting minimum reporting standards for life science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Macleod et al., 2021</xref>). Also, increasing frequency of citation of data, materials, reagents, and antibodies highlights improving reporting standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Macleod, 2017</xref>).</p><p>There is still a long way to go before strong reporting is normative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Gulin et al., 2015</xref>), but the efforts to establish reporting standards and requirements has positioned the community for significant improvement in making it possible to understand how the research was conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Glasziou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Macleod et al., 2014</xref>). A potential negative consequence of improving documentation and reporting is additional burden on researchers without compensatory benefits for actually improving research. Regardless of their benefits, implementations of reporting standards should make them easy and efficient to adopt and attentive to diminishing returns. The sweet spot of reporting standards is to provide sufficient structure, specificity, and support to make the research process transparent and simultaneously to avoid turning a good practice into just another bureaucratic burden.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Improving data, code, and materials transparency and sharing</title><p>For many of the experiments we examined, we could not determine key details of the original results from the paper such as sample size, effect size, or variability. Data and code were almost never available in public repositories, and requests for sharing the original data mostly failed. It is not possible to assess reproducibility or robustness if data are not available. And, policies that data are to be made available “upon request” are recognized as ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">McNutt et al., 2016</xref>). One obvious reason is that such requests come long after the original researchers have moved on from the project, making the data difficult, impossible, or time-consuming to recover. Hundreds of journals have strengthened their policies to promote data and code sharing, and the rates of sharing are improving, if slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Camerer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Serghiou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Stodden et al., 2013</xref>; see journal transparency policies at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://topfactor.org">https://topfactor.org</ext-link>). The infrastructure for sharing and archiving data and code has blossomed with domain-specific repositories for a wide variety of data types such as GenBank, Protein DataBank, and Cancer Imaging Archive, and emergence of metadata standards more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib189">Wilkinson et al., 2016</xref>). Generalist repositories such as OSF, Zenodo, and Figshare offer archiving solutions for digital data of almost any kind.</p><p>Repositories are likewise available for sharing digital materials such as protocols, additional images, IACUC or IRB documentation, or any other content. For example, the OSF projects for these replication efforts include cell line authentication (e.g., STR and mycoplasma testing), plasmid verification (e.g., sequencing files), maintenance records (e.g., cell culture, animal husbandry), and all raw images (e.g., Western blot, immunohistochemistry, bioluminescence images) for relevant experiments alongside the data and code. Another challenge to address to improve research efficiency is burdens and delays for sharing physical materials such as cells, plasmids, animals, and antibodies. Repositories are available for sharing physical materials (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org">https://www.addgene.org</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mmrrc.org">https://www.mmrrc.org</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.atcc.org">https://www.atcc.org</ext-link>) and relieves scientists of having to maintain and distribute to other researchers minimizing costs associated when researchers have to make them again (see Case study in <xref ref-type="box" rid="box3">Box 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Lloyd et al., 2015</xref>). When not available in a repository, we experienced a variety of unnecessary barriers and delays navigating material transfer agreements with institutions because of lack of interest, infrastructure, or policy for facilitating material sharing. There is an opportunity for substantial improvement not only for replications but also for novel research that builds upon published research by having better funding and legal structures for sharing materials. For example, the initiation of replication experiments at replication labs was significantly accelerated by the existence of standard master services agreements already in place with all replicating labs via the Science Exchange marketplace.</p><p>Potential negative consequences of improved sharing can occur if the scholarly reward systems fail to catch up. At present, some researchers see risk and little reward for sharing because of lack of credit for doing so. Evidence suggests that there is more benefit than cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">McKiernan et al., 2016</xref>), but altering reward systems toward treating data, materials, and code as citable scholarly contributions will ease the perceived risks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Improving preregistration of experiments and analysis plans</title><p>Two key factors undermining the credibility and replicability of research are publication bias and questionable research practices like <italic>p</italic>-hacking.

Preregistration of experiments mitigates publication bias by making all research discoverable whether or not it is ultimately published. Preregistration of analysis plans solves selective reporting by making clear what analyses were planned a priori and what was determined and conducted after the fact. Planned and unplanned analyses both contribute to advancement of knowledge, the latter often being the source of unexpected discoveries. But, unplanned analyses that occur after observing the data are usually more tentative and uncertain. Preregistration helps increase visibility of that uncertainty and reduce the likelihood of inadvertently mistaking an uncertain exploratory result as a confirmatory test of an existing hypothesis. For areas of research that have been investigating replicability, such as psychology and economics, preregistration has gained rapid adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Christensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Nosek and Lindsay, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Preregistration is still relatively rare in basic and preclinical research in the life sciences, but the potential for improving replicability and research efficiency is pronounced. In life science experiments involving animals, there are significant ethical implications for not publishing negative results derived from these experiments. Recent studies suggest the data from only 26 % of animals used in life science experiments are ever published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">van der Naald et al., 2020</xref>). One could argue that ensuring outcome reporting of all animal experiments is an ethical issue, and IACUC’s could incentivize or require preregistration as a compliance mechanism. A recent NIH committee report focusing on improving research rigor and reproducibility recommended piloting preregistration in animal research to test its effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Wold et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Like improving reporting standards, a potential risk of preregistration is creating bureaucratic burden that does not exceed the benefits of instituting the process. Technology supporting preregistration can minimize that burden with efficient workflows that researchers perceive as supporting effective research planning rather than imposing reporting burdens. Also, misperceptions that preregistration discourages exploratory or discovery oriented research could interfere with effective adoption and application. As such, education and training are essential components of effective adoption.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Improving rigor, reporting, and incentives with Registered Reports</title><p>All replication studies were peer reviewed at <italic>eLife</italic> prior to conducting the research, a publishing model called Registered Reports. With Registered Reports, expert critique improves experimental designs before they are conducted rather than just pointing out the errors and problems after the work is completed. Preregistration is built into the process eliminating publication bias and providing a clear distinction between planned analyses and exploratory discoveries. Publication decisions are made based on the importance of the research question and the quality of the methodology proposed to test the question, not whether the observed outcomes are exciting or as expected. Incentives for exciting findings, regardless of credibility, are removed. Researchers are instead incentivized to ask important questions and design creative and compelling tests of those questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chambers, 2019</xref>).</p><p>As of late 2021, more than 300 journals have adopted Registered Reports as a submission option, mostly in the social-behavioral sciences and neuroscience. Evidence to date suggests that Registered Reports are effective at eliminating publication bias. In a sample of 71 Registered Reports and 152 comparison articles from the same outlets published around the same time, 56 % of primary outcomes were negative results for Registered Reports and 4 % for comparison articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Scheel et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, despite the increase of supposedly “boring” negative results, a sample of Registered Reports received similar or greater altmetric attention and citation impact as comparison articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Hummer et al., 2017</xref>). An observational study also found evidence that Registered Reports outperform comparison articles on all 19 outcome measures from slightly on measures of novelty and creativity to strongly on measures of quality and rigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Soderberg et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Some funders and journals are conducting partnerships via Registered Reports in which a single peer review process results in in-principle acceptance of the paper and funding to conduct the experiments such as programs sponsored by the Children’s Tumor Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ctf.org/research/drug-discovery-initiative-registered-reports-ddirr">https://www.ctf.org/research/drug-discovery-initiative-registered-reports-ddirr</ext-link>) and The Flu Lab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cos.io/flulab/">https://cos.io/flulab/</ext-link>). This offers a compelling incentive alignment for researchers and opportunity for journals to receive and publish high-quality, funded projects and funders to maximize their return on investment by ensuring that funded studies don’t wind up in the file drawer. Like preregistration, a potential unintended negative consequence of Registered Reports is if the model shifts the culture away from valuing exploratory and discovery-oriented research. Ideally, both practices facilitate clarity of when research is testing versus generating hypotheses without fostering the perception that research progress can occur with one and without the other.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Improving incentives for replication</title><p>With a research culture that prizes innovation and novelty, verification and replication gets pushed aside.

Investigations of the prevalence of replication studies in the published literature yield extremely low estimates in different disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Makel and Plucker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Makel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Pridemore et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Valentine et al., 2011</xref>). There is no known systematic investigation of the prevalence of replication studies in cancer biology, but like other fields – with a strong emphasis on innovation and novelty in cancer biology – there is little encouragement by journals or funders for proposing, conducting, or reporting replications. Without reward systems for replication research, it is unlikely that the near exclusive emphasis on innovation will be reduced.</p><p>Simultaneously, it is not clear that a dramatic shift in the proportion of studies for replication is needed. Only a small portion of the research literature has a substantial impact on the direction and investment in research. By focusing replication resources on the research that is having significant impact and spurring new investment, even a small infusion of funding, journal space, and institutional reward for replications could have a dramatic effect on improving clarity about credibility and replicability – emboldening investments on productive paths and saving resources from dead ends. That is not to suggest that replications provide definitive evidence to confirm or disconfirm original findings. Rather, successful replications promote confidence that new findings are reliable and justify further investigation into their validity and applicability, and unsuccessful replication prompt questions to look closer at the phenomenon to determine whether the failure is due to a false positive in the original research, a flaw in the replication, or previously unidentified conditions that influence whether the phenomenon is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Errington et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Nosek and Errington, 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Nosek and Errington, 2020a</xref>).</p><p>There is some movement toward valuing replication research more explicitly with some journals providing explicit statements in their policies about publishing replications and funders like DARPA in the US explicitly investing in independent verification and validation as part of ongoing programs pursuing research innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Raphael et al., 2020</xref>). Also, funders are occasionally launching programs to support replication studies such as the NWO in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker, 2016</xref>) and the NSF in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cook, 2016</xref>). A potential risk of increased rewards for replication is if expectations for conducting or achieving replicability become so high that they discourage risk-taking and pursuit of highly resource intensive investigations. For example, in early phases of research, low replicability is not surprising because researchers are often pursuing ideas that have low prior odds of success. The optimal mixture of investment in innovation versus verification research is unknown.</p><p>Collectively, these improvements to transparency and sharing are captured by the Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines (TOP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cos.io/top">https://cos.io/top</ext-link>), a policy framework for publishers, funders, and institutions to set standards for transparency of the research process and outputs by their authors, grantees, or staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Camerer et al., 2018</xref>). As of 2020, more than 1,000 journals have implemented TOP compliant policies for one or more of the categories of improvements. TOP Factor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://topfactor.org">https://topfactor.org</ext-link>) rates journal policies on promoting transparency, openness, and reproducibility, and the web interface makes it easy to compare across journals. Pervasive adoption of open behaviors and policies by all stakeholders would help shift norms and set higher standards for transparency, sharing, and reproducibility of research.</p><p>Simultaneously, an active metascience research community that evaluates the impact of these new behaviors and policies will help identify unintended negative consequences, improve their implementation, and optimize their adoption for facilitating research progress. Stakeholders in the cancer biology community including researchers, funders, societies, and institutional representatives could facilitate and support research investigations of the scientific process so that decisions about adopting these behaviors at scale can be evidence-based and clearly represent both the costs and benefits.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We experienced substantial challenges when designing protocols to replicate experiments from published papers because the papers often did not contain the information required for such replications (such as raw data and identifiers for reagents and research materials). There is substantial opportunity to improve the seemingly mundane but critical behaviors of documentation, transparency, and open sharing of protocols, data, and research materials, if the scientific community is to improve the reproducibility, replicability, and reuse of research. Initiatives to improve the reporting of methods and results – including preregistration of experiments, and the reporting of both negative and positive results – have started to make headway in the life sciences, and some are becoming mainstream in neighboring disciplines. Collectively, these initiatives offer substantial opportunities to improve the replicability and credibility of research and, ultimately, to advance scientific knowledge in a way that is both efficient and reliable.</p></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s6-1"><title>Paper and experiment selection strategy</title><p>50 papers published in 2010, 2011 or 2012 were selected as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Errington et al., 2014</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Vuew3x">.</ext-link> After the project started one paper was replaced because it contained sequencing and proteomic experiments and should not have been selected in the first place. During the course of the project, after contacting the original authors, we determined that it would not be feasible to conduct replications for three papers, so these papers were replaced.</p><p>Experiments for replication were identified as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Errington et al., 2014</xref>. Corresponding authors were contacted and shared the drafted replication protocols based on information from the original papers. Specific questions were highlighted including requests for original data, key materials that were identified, and protocol clarifications. We also asked for any additional information that could improve the quality of the replication attempt. Following initial author feedback, we shared replication protocols with research providers from the Science Exchange marketplace, which consists of a database of searchable scientific service providers that have been qualified and contracted under a standard already negotiated master services agreement. On average it took 6 days from placing requests to receiving a quote from replicating labs (median = 2 days; IQR = 1–8). In total 48 providers participated in the project (22 academic shared resource facilities and 26 contract research organizations [CROs]) by reviewing and contributing to replication protocols, including describing deviations from the original study (e.g., different instrumentation), and conducting the replication experiments themselves. Experimental designs and protocols were iterated based on comments and suggestions from original authors, when possible, and the replicating researchers. Experiments were then submitted as a Registered Report to <italic>eLife</italic> where it underwent peer review and if approved began experimentation. In all, 193 experiments were included in the project: 188 experiments were identified at the start of the project; three were added during peer review of the Registered Reports, and two were added following the exchange of comments and suggestions with original authors. At the same time, 83 experiments were dropped following exchanges with original authors. Of the 110 experiments that continued, 97 were included in Registered Reports that we submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>. The 29 Registered Reports that were accepted for publication included 87 experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s6-2"><title>Coding</title><p>Papers were coded for metadata and whether corresponding authors responded to any email requests. Experiments were coded on a number of variables from the papers, requests and input from the original authors, and information about the replication attempt.

evaluating reproducibility</title><p>In conducting research, there is a constant interplay of evaluating available resources for making decisions about research investments. This is a combination of time, cost, and accessibility of materials and reagents to do the research. In typical work, that decision matrix also includes questions about potential viability of the research direction, potential impact of success, and confidence in the current evidence (shall we replicate or proceed with the evidence we have?). These latter items were not complicating factors for our project, but the former ones were substantial as we had many papers, many experiments, lab sourcing, design feedback, cost projections, time projections, and coordination decisions to resolve. One of the most concrete ways to express that challenge is the evolving cost estimates for conducting the research over the course of the project.</p><p>At the start of the project we budgeted $25,000 per paper, and updated this figure as the project progressed. By the time peer review of the Registered Reports began, the estimated cost per paper had increased to $35,750 (median = $33,822; IQR = $26,448–$44,260). At the onset of data collection, the average estimate was $42,017 (median = $39,843; IQR = $28,069–$55,750). And, the actual average cost on completion was $52,574 per replication study (median = $53,089; IQR = $33,994–$61,496). In total, $1,524,640 was spent on replication experiments. Not included in these costs are project administration costs, particularly personnel costs, accrued as the project took longer to complete than originally estimated because of the unexpected challenges of getting feedback, obtaining materials, carrying out the experiments, internal delays in project management, and the common delays in peer review. Additionally, not counted in these costs are donated reagents from scientific suppliers and replicating labs that provided discounted costs to support the project.</p><p>Delays and increasing costs were practical challenges for investigating reproducibility. If data and materials were readily available, the time and cost of designing experiments would have been lower. If original papers were more comprehensive in reporting methodology, the time and cost of designing protocols would have been lower. If providing feedback on replication designs were normative, the time and cost of confirming protocols would have been lower. Improving sharing, documentation, and feedback are fixable with changes to norms and policies.</p><p>Some delays and costs were due to experimental systems (e.g., tumor growth in animals) not behaving as they had in the original study. Whether or not it is possible to make experimental systems more consistent in their behavior depends on whether these inconsistencies are an inherent feature of working with complex biological systems that cannot be avoided, or if they are due to weaknesses in methodology that could be addressed.</p><p>Delays and increasing costs also had other consequences: for example, experiments were staggered over time, so as some experiments were completed, we were able to update time and cost estimates for experiments not yet started. Decisions to end individual experiments were influenced partly by challenges unique to that experiment, and partly by factors related to time and cost estimates across the project as a whole. A decision to end an experiment does not necessarily mean that the original finding is unreplicable. It is possible that devoting more project resources to any one finding would have ultimately resolved the challenges and replicated the result successfully. Likewise, a decision to end an experiment does not validate the original finding. It is possible that the practical challenges are indicators of deeper issues with the original findings.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67995.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Rodgers</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>eLife</institution><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box7"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Challenges for Assessing Reproducibility and Replicability Across the Research Lifecycle in Preclinical Cancer Biology&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic> for consideration as a Feature Article. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including the <italic>eLife</italic> Features Editor Peter Rodgers and the evaluation has been overseen by Eduardo Franco as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers and editors have discussed the reviews and we have drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well written paper that clearly expresses the various issues concerning interactions with scientists to acquire reagents etc. to test data reproducibility for &quot;high impact&quot; papers published during 2010-2012.</p><p>For the purpose of this review, I refer to the authors of the series as the &quot;replicators&quot; to distinguish them from the &quot;authors&quot; of the 2010-2012 publications. The current manuscript summarizes the heterogeneity of the outcomes of their communications with the authors of the papers whose experiments they sought to replicate. Many authors do not appear to have been willing to provide additional data when requested by the replicators. In this regard, Figure 3 presents an interesting analysis that suggests a limited correlation between the amount of information requested by the replicators and the degree of cooperation by the authors. However, a majority of the authors were willing to provide key reagents.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The Discussion makes several recommendations for increasing transparency of preclinical experiments under several headings: improving documentation and reporting; improving data, code, and materials transparency and sharing; improving preregistration of studies and analysis plans; improving rigor, reporting, and incentives with Registered Reports; and improving incentives for replication. The recommendations are presented as though none of them might have any unintended negative consequences, an unlikely scenario.</p><p>Please include a brief discussion of the possible unintended negative consequences of the recommendations.</p><p>2. In several instances, the replicators note that changes in the direction they are recommending have already been instituted by journals, which implies that this landscape is changing. It would seem prudent to suggest that an appropriately constituted committee consider the current situation before deciding what further changes might be appropriate.</p><p>Please include a brief discussion of the next steps for the preclinical cancer research community in response to your findings.</p><p>3. It is not clear how devoting more resources to the replication of experiments will help the overall process, as such experiments can only evaluate a small proportion of the published literature. In this regard, the replicators seem to have two beliefs that may be flawed.</p><p>First, they seem to believe that the scientific community will accept that the inability of replicators to replicate the findings of a particular experiment means that the initial experiment was flawed and that other investigators will be skeptical of the conclusion of the publication in question. However, that may not be the case.</p><p>Conversely, the replicators seem to believe that if other laboratories in the course of their regular studies fail to replicate the findings, either they will not publish the negative results or, if they do publish them, those results will not be accepted by the scientific community as implying that they should be skeptical of the conclusion of the initial publication. Again, this belief may be wrong.</p><p>Please comment on these two points in the manuscript.</p><p>4. Were there any particular types of experiments/techniques for which published papers lacked adequate details and/or for which authors seemed less likely to provide you with information and/or materials (such a cell lines and reagents)?</p><p>5.
