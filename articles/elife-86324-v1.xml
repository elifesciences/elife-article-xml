Their ability to move, creating mutations by insertion/excision, and amplify in genomes – thus generating new copies that provide opportunities for recombination – make them a major source of genetic variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tenaillon et al., 2010</xref>). For this reason, TEs are considered a major driver of plant genome evolution, both in the wild and under human selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lisch, 2013</xref>). TE insertions and other structural variants, however, have been frequently overlooked when using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to look for genetic variants linked to interesting phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Voichek and Weigel, 2020</xref>). The recent development of efficient tools to identify transposon insertion polymorphisms (TIPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vendrell-Mir et al., 2019</xref>) has allowed the incorporation of TIPs in these analyses, and several GWAS reports have shown that TIPs uncover additional variability linked to phenotypic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akakpo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domínguez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castanera et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, TIPs often explain more phenotypic variance compared to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and can be used for genomic prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vourlaki et al., 2022</xref>). The reason for this could be that, as compared with SNPs, TE insertions are more frequently the causal mutation.</p><p>A major fraction of the mutations linked to crop domestication and breeding are associated with changes of the expression of genes involved in signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Swinnen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meyer and Purugganan, 2013</xref>). TEs can alter gene transcription, activating or repressing them, by different means. On the one hand, insertion of TEs within a promoter can interfere with transcription, and the silencing of TEs inserted close to genes can result in repression of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Quadrana, 2020</xref>). Alternatively, TE insertions can also result in gene overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Studer et al., 2011</xref>), as TEs bring their own transcriptional promoters that can induce expression of neighboring genes. This is particularly clear for LTR retrotransposons which contain promoters in their 5′ and 3′ LTRs, and may provide nearby genes with alternative promoters. In addition, TEs can also contain transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS) that can alter the expression of host genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rebollo et al., 2012</xref>); it has been shown, for example, that miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) have frequently amplified and redistributed TFBS in plant genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morata et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we explore the impact of the movement of TEs during the recent evolution of rice on the variability of gene expression in this species. Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world, and varieties are generally found in two subspecies – <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>japonica</italic> and ssp. <italic>indica</italic>. Other minor variety groups include aus varieties, which appear closely related to indica, and basmati rice varieties that appear to be a hybrid between ssp. <italic>japonica</italic> and aus. We took advantage of a recently published transcriptional analysis of 208 rice varieties belonging to the major rice variety groups grown under wet paddy and intermittent drought conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Groen et al., 2020</xref>) to perform an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) GWAS using TIPs as genetic markers. We show that TIPs are frequently associated with changes of expression of rice genes and that many TIPs altering the expression of regulatory genes have been positively selected in indica and japonica rice subspecies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TIPs are associated with gene expression variation in rice</title><p>We used a recently published dataset containing genome resequencing and transcription data for rice (<italic>O. sativa</italic>) varieties to perform TIP-eQTL mapping analyses. The data we analyzed consist of an ‘indica’ dataset for 126 <italic>O. sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>indica</italic> and some <italic>circum</italic>-aus accessions, and 82 ‘japonica’ accessions comprising of <italic>O. sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>japonica</italic> and some <italic>circum</italic>-basmati varieties, described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Groen et al., 2020</xref>. We predicted TIPs using PopoolationTE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kofler et al., 2016</xref>), and identified 45,050 TIPs. Using the Minghui MH63 short-read data and assembled genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), we estimated the performance of the TIP genotyping on this dataset to have 97.1% sensitivity and 92.2% precision (see methods). Most of the TIPs detected are DNA transposons (84%), especially MITEs belonging to the <italic>Stowaway</italic> (24%) and <italic>Tourist</italic> (20%) superfamilies; LTR retrotransposons make up a minor fraction (9 %).</p><p>The 45,050 TIPs are distributed along the 12 chromosomes and 81.3% of them are less than 5 kb away from an annotated gene (IRGSP RAP-DB gene models). This results in up to 81.4% of rice genes having a TIP less than 5 kb distant. In order to analyze the potential of TIPs to generate gene expression variability in rice, we used the 3′ mRNA-seq expression data from leaves of adult plants grown in normally watered soil (‘wet’ condition) and under intermittent drought stress (‘drought stress’ condition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Groen et al., 2020</xref>). We selected data from 15,549 genes showing expression in more than 10% of the samples. Due to the strong population structure present in rice we separately analyzed data in the indica (126 varieties) and japonica (82 varieties) datasets. We found a total of 563 significant associations between TIPs and gene expression levels in the indica population and 356 in the japonica population (TIP-eQTLs with minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt;3%, false discovery rate [FDR] adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 in at least one replicate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These involve 477 and 317 genes, in indica and japonica, respectively, representing 3.1% and 2% of the expressed genes. The TIP-eQTLs were related to the different TE types (orders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wicker et al., 2007</xref>), and the proportion of TE orders found in the significant TIPs did not differ significantly from their representation across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of rice transposon insertion polymorphism (TIP)-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Association between TIPs and gene expression levels in cis (TIP-eQTLs) found in indica and japonica population along the 12 rice chromosomes.

We obtained 4913 SNP-eQTLs in indica and 3308 SNP-eQTLs in japonica associated with SNPs located less than 5 kb from the gene (were each SNP-eQTL represents the leading SNP–gene association). This corresponds to ~31.6% of the genes in indica and ~21.3% in japonica. For each gene with a significant TIP-eQTL association, we compared the proportion of variance (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) explained by the most significantly associated TIPs and/or SNPs. For most genes that have an associated TIP, either there is no associated SNP or the TIP explains more expression variance than the associated SNP (~62% of the indica TIP-eQTLs and ~73% of the japonica TIP-eQTLs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This result could be reproduced by running the association using SNPs and TIPs together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and also by subsampling SNPs to the same number of TIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This demonstrates that TIPs uncover genetic associations with changes of expression that are not observed when using SNPs as molecular markers.</p><p>The SNP-eQTLs found in our study are associated to both positive (47%) and negative (53%) effects on gene expression levels, very close to an even distribution. In contrast, TIPs more frequently have a negative effect (59%). The proportion varies among TE superfamilies, with TIR/MULEs being close to 50%, and LTR/Gypsy having the most frequently negative impact on gene expression (67%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This suggests that, as compared with SNP-eQTLs, TIP-eQTLs are more frequently the likely causal mutation responsible for the change in expression, and that the effect of the insertion is more generally negative, in line with recent analyses done in <italic>Capsella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uzunović et al., 2019</xref>), especially for long elements such as LTR retrotransposons.</p><p>An analysis of the TIP- and SNP-eQTL location with respect to the associated genes shows that while SNP-eQTLs are more evenly distributed across the genic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), TIP-eQTLs are over-represented in the 1 kb region upstream of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which is the region that most frequently contains promoter elements regulating transcription. This suggests that although some TIP-eQTLs could be in linkage disequilibrium with the causal mutation for the change of expression, an important fraction of TIP-eQTLs could be the actual causal mutation inducing expression variation.</p><p>It has been proposed that an important fraction of gene expression variation is deleterious, and therefore, alleles associated with major expression effects should be maintained at lower frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Josephs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lye et al., 2022</xref>). An analysis of the effect size of the different TIP-eQTLs taking into account their frequency in the population shows that, indeed, low- and high-frequency TIPs (corresponding to rare alleles) show the highest positive or negative effect on the expression of the associated gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with what is described as the rare variant effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lye et al., 2022</xref>) where rare (and likely deleterious) mutations in a population are associated with greater effects on gene expression in a population.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect size and population frequencies of wet and drought-stress transposon insertion polymorphism (TIP)-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).</title><p>Representation of the effect size (beta) of the TIP-eQTLs with respect to their population frequency in indica (<bold>A, C</bold>) and japonica (<bold>B, D</bold>) for positive (<bold>A, B</bold>) and negative (<bold>C, D</bold>) effects.

Such overlap increases to 90% (average of indica and japonica, wet) and 71% (average of indica and japonica, drought stress) when we compare TIP-eQTLs of one condition with non-FDR-corrected TIP-eQTLs in the other environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). All the associations shared in the two environments had the same effect type on expression (positive or negative). This result suggests that the majority of TIP-eQTLs are general associations with changes of expression in both growth conditions, and that only a small number of TIP-eQTLs (81 in indica and 78 in japonica) are associated with stress-specific changes of expression. Nevertheless, among the TIP-eQTLs associated with changes of gene expression in both wet and drought stress, there are TIP associated with genes known to be involved in drought tolerance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As an example, TIP_49046 is associated with a reduction of the expression of the gene synaptotagmin-5 (<italic>OsSYT-5</italic>). <italic>OsSYT-5</italic> encodes a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing protein with a C2 domain, is expressed in both stressed and non-stressed plants, and it has been recently shown that its silencing enhances drought tolerance in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shanmugam et al., 2021</xref>). Other examples are TIP_23764 and TIP_52367, associated with an increased expression of the gene encoding the OsSAPK10 ABA-activated protein kinase and the S-type euonymus-related lectin gene OsEULS2 in, respectively, two genes known to mediate drought stress in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lambin et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TIP-eQTLs are present at different population frequencies in indica and japonica</title><p>Although the overlap of TIPs associated with changes in expression under wet and drought stress conditions is very high, the overlap between indica and japonica TIP-eQTLs is low, and only 90 TIP-eQTLs out of the 563 from indica and 356 from japonica are significantly associated with variation of gene expression in both subspecies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Even when we make the less-stringent comparison of the TIP-eQTLs of one subspecies with the non-FDR-corrected TIP-eQTLs of the other, as much as ~69% of indica and ~60% of japonica TIP-eQTLs appear as subspecies specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Regarding the common associations between subspecies, all of them have the same effect type on expression (positive or negative). This result may suggest differences in the transcriptional networks in indica and japonica or, alternatively, that different alleles showing expression level differences may be differentially represented in the two subspecies. An analysis of the frequencies in indica and japonica of all the TIP-eQTLs described here shows that approximately one-third of the TIPs are only found in one of the two subspecies at MAF &gt;3%, although only 59 (indica) and 21 (japonica) associations correspond to truly species-specific TIPs (completely absent in one of the two subspecies). We looked for these TIPs in 82 <italic>Oryza rufipogon</italic> and <italic>Oryza nivara</italic> varieties and found that 56% of the indica-specific and 24% of the japonica-specific TIPs were present in such population. This suggests that TEs have been actively inserting (or have been excised or eliminated from the population) very recently during rice evolution, likely post-domestication and during the crop diversification phase, as has already been proposed for some rice TE families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpentier et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we show that some of these recent TIPs are associated with changes in gene expression and may therefore have phenotypic consequences. Some of these insertions are found at high frequencies in its corresponding subspecies, which suggest that they may have been under positive selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>However, the vast majority of TIP-eQTLs found in this study (90%) correspond to TIPs present in both subspecies, which suggests that these insertions are relatively old and were already present in the ancestor of indica and japonica rice. Remarkably, in most cases they are found at very different frequencies in the two subspecies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This suggests that these insertions were already present in the ancestor of indica and japonica rice and have been differentially retained in the two subspecies. Interestingly, an analysis of all non-eQTL-TIPs shows that an important fraction is found at the same frequency in both genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). This differential pattern between eQTL and non-eQTL-TIPs is also found when we consider only the upstream gene regions (1 kb, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the preferential retention of TIP-eQTLs in indica or japonica may be a specific phenomenon potentially linked to their impact on the expression of the associated genes.</p><p>We examined whether TIP-eQTLs present in both indica and japonica varieties are also found in either <italic>Oryza rufipogon</italic> and <italic>Oryza nivara</italic>, the wild rice relatives believed to be the ancestors of domesticated rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2017</xref>).

Up to 552 of the 829 TIP-eQTLs present in indica and/or japonica (66%), can be found in rufipogon/nivara varieties, confirming that an important fraction of TIP-eQTLs found in indica and japonica may be relatively old insertions already present in the wild ancestors of domesticated rice. Not surprisingly, in most cases the TIP frequencies in rufipogon/nivara are different from the frequencies of these insertions in indica and/or japonica (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>); these may have arisen either due to selection or genetic drift accompanying the bottleneck associated with crop evolution.</p><p>In order to identify possible selection of TIPs in indica and japonica populations, we used the Population Branch Statistic (PBS) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yi et al., 2010</xref>) which examines strong differentiation in frequencies between populations. This approach consists in comparing the three pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> values between indica, japonica, and rufipogon/nivara to estimate the frequency change in TIPs that occurred since the divergence of the two rice subspecies from its wild ancestor. We calculated PBS values for a total of 11,698 TIPs present in the japonica, indica, and rufipogon/nivara populations, which included 354 TIPs that are eQTLs in in indica and/or japonica populations. TIP-eQTLs showed much higher PBS values in comparison to those not identified as eQTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (mean absolute PBS of 0.06 vs 0.02, respectively, p &lt; 0.01, Wilcoxon test). Furthermore, TIPs with the most extreme PBS values (above 95 percentile) are enriched for TIP-eQTLs (Fisher’s exact test odds ratio = 4.87, p &lt; 0.01), suggesting that a high fraction of TIP-eQTLs have been positively selected in indica or japonica. Note that some of the TIPs not identified as eQTLs in this particular dataset may actually be linked to variation of gene expression in organs, developmental stages or environmental conditions different from the ones analyzed here. Interestingly, up to 35% of the TIP-eQTLs identified here, associated with 119 genes, fell within the top 10% of absolute PBS values for all TIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that TIPs associated with gene expression variation have likely been under differential selection during rice evolution.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Signatures of positive selection on transposon insertion polymorphism (TIP)-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Absolute Population Branch Statistic (PBS) of 354 TIP-eQTLs (left) and 11,344 TIPs (no-eQTL, right) present in indica, japonica, and rufipogon populations.

This analysis showed that <italic>EG2</italic> is primarily found in two different haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). One haplotype, Hap A, contains the three MITE insertions associated with higher expression of EG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), while the second haplotype, Hap B, contains the fourth MITE insertion and is associated with reduced EG2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hap A was identified to be at high frequency in rufipogon/nivara (48%), whereas Hap B is at lower frequency (16%). The frequency of both Hap A and Hap B is slightly increased in japonica (65% and 28%, respectively). In indica, however, there is a clear reduction in the frequency of Hap A and a concomitant strong frequency increase of Hap B, associated with reduced expression in indica (16% and 83%, respectively).

The two TIPs defining the two haplotypes are present in the rufipogon/nivara population at complementary frequencies (73% and 19%, respectively).

Reduced seed dormancy is a common target for selection of cultivated varieties, but this trait may come at a cost of a higher PHS risk, which may be a problem, especially in regions where heavy rain is common during the harvest season. Therefore, the appropriate degree of dormancy may depend on the agroecological conditions in which a particular variety is grown.

A recent pangenome analysis in tomato has shown that the phenotypic variation of important crop traits is linked to structural variants present in the species, which are associated to subtle changes of transcription of genes involved in signal transduction. Many of these SV-eQTLs are likely TIPs, and some lead to phenotypic consequences such as the jointless trait caused by a transposon insertion, which allows complete separation of fruits from other floral parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonge et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study we evaluated the importance of TIP-related expression variability in the recent evolution of rice. To this end we performed a TIP-eQTL mapping using expression data from rice varieties from the <italic>O. sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>indica</italic> and <italic>O. sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>japonica</italic> subspecies. We show here that using TIPs in addition to SNPs as genetic information allows the uncovering of additional genomic associations to changes in gene expression, and that when both TIPs and SNPs are both associated, TIPs often explain more of the variance in expression. This is in line with recent reports that have also used TIPs for GWAS with different phenotypes in tomato and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domínguez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castanera et al., 2021</xref>), and suggests that, even if some of the TIPs described here are probably just linked to the causal mutation of the phenotype (i.e., an SNP or a different type of SV), they may be more frequently the causal mutation themselves as compared with SNPs. The concentration of TIP-eQTLs in upstream regions of genes, where most transcriptional regulatory elements usually reside, also suggest that a high fraction of the TIP-eQTLs here described are the actual mutation underlying gene expression variation.</p><p>The close association of some TEs with genes could also partially explain the frequent association of more than one TIP with changes of expression of particular genes. Indeed, among the 718 genes with TIP-eQTLs described here, 18% have two or more TIPs associated with changes of expression. Interestingly, among the 30 genes with TIPs in indica and japonica that have the highest PBS – an indicator of strong differential selection – 43% have more than one TIP-eQTL. This suggests that TIPs are an important source of gene expression variability in rice, in particular in genes that may have been strongly selected during its recent evolution. In some cases, the different TIPs linked to a gene are associated with opposite effects on its expression and are present in different haplotypes. In these instances, as shown for the <italic>OsJAZ1</italic> and <italic>OsGAP</italic> genes, the two haplotypes have strong signs of selection, although one positively and the other negatively, which suggests that both TE insertions may have played a role in the diversification of rice subspecies.</p><p>The results presented here show that most TIPs associated with variation of gene expression in indica and/or japonica are relatively old insertions that are also present in rufipogon/nivara, the wild ancestors of rice. This is in line with recent data showing that a high number of the structural variants associated with changes of expression in tomato were already present in its wild ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonge et al., 2020</xref>) and highlights the importance of the standing variation, already present in the wild ancestors, for crop adaptation. It is assumed that most TE insertions are selectively neutral or slightly deleterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arkhipova, 2018</xref>), and the presence of TIPs associated with expression variation of genes in the wild ancestors of rice, suggests that this variation can be well tolerated in wild rice. Interestingly, we show here that many of these TIPs have been positive or negative selected in rice populations, which shows that they translate into selectable phenotypic differences in the agroecological conditions of cultivated rice. Indeed, we show examples of selected variants with modified expression of genes known to be linked to important traits that were targets of selection. It has been already proposed that a major fraction of the mutations linked to crop domestication and breeding are associated with changes of gene expression involved in signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Swinnen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meyer and Purugganan, 2013</xref>). Here, we show that specific expression variants of genes involved in signal transduction have been differentially selected in indica and japonica rice populations. In addition, our results also point to TEs as a major driver of gene expression variation selected during crop adaptation and breeding.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>TIP detection</title><p>Resequencing data for 126 indica and 82 japonica rice accessions were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Groen et al., 2020</xref> (Bioproject accessions PRJNA557122, PRJNA422249, and PRJEB6180). BBDuK (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/</ext-link>) was used for adaptor and quality trimming. Clean reads were aligned to the Nipponbare reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matsumoto et al., 2005</xref>) using BWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li and Durbin, 2010</xref>). PoPoolationTE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kofler et al., 2016</xref>) was used to detect TIPs in the mode ‘joint’ using Nipponbare TE annotation described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ou et al., 2019</xref>. TIPs with a zygosity lower than 0.25 in all samples were excluded to avoid false positives. TIPs were further filtered using the parameters –-min-count 5, --max-otherte-count 2, --max-structvar-count 2, and only those having MAF higher than 3% and no missing data were kept. Finally, the TIP matrix was transformed to binary form using zygosity cutoff of 0.05 to define an insertion as present.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Evaluation of TIP-calling performance in our dataset</title><p>Resequencing data from 48 indica rice accessions randomly sampled from our dataset were used to identify TIPs with the objective of evaluating the performance of TIP calling. MH63 was included among these accessions. This variety has a chromosome-level assembly as well as short-read resequencing data publicly available. MH63 sequencing short reads were obtained from NCBI SRA accession SRX1639978 and subsampled to 15× to match the mean coverage of the full dataset. TIP detection was carried out using Nipponbare genome as reference, and the ‘joint’ mode of PopoolationTE2, with the parameters described in the Methods section.

The TIP matrix was filtered to remove TIPs with more than 5% missing data, or with MAF &lt;5%. The remaining missing data (1.7%) were imputed using the ‘wright’ algorithm implemented in SNPready.

This was done using a custom script ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gupta, 2023</xref>) in a window of 25 SNPs with a sliding window of 5. Further, we also estimated the H12 homozygosity statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garud and Rosenberg, 2015</xref>) that can detect the presence of both hard and soft sweeps associated with selection. Since we expect long runs of homozygosity in the regions around the selected loci, H12 was calculated in windows of 50 SNPs, with a sliding window of 25. Both these statistics were estimated separately for indica and japonica, and for the samples with TIP insertions present and absent. This was for a range of 100 kb (50 kb up- and downstream the TIP insertion), using SNPs identified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Groen et al., 2020</xref> but without the 1000 bp linkage thinning. To test for the significance of the statistics, we performed a permutation test (<italic>N</italic> = 1000) with random sampling with the same number of individuals that were used to estimate the selection statistics. The statistics were estimated for these 1000 random pulls in the same regions, and using the same window sizes as the original statistics.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Extended information on significant transposon insertion polymorphism (TIP)-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86324-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Transposon insertion polymorphism (TIP)-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) effect on gene expression levels up, for increased gene expression when tansposable element (TE) is present, down for decreased gene expression when TE is present according to TE superfamily classification.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86324-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Extended information on indica- and japonica-specific transposon insertion polymorphisms (TIPs) associated with expression changes.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86324-supp3-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>NCBI-SRA accession numbers for <italic>O. rufipogon</italic> and <italic>O. nivara</italic> accessions used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86324-supp4-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Population Branch Statistic (PBS) results and transposon insertion polymorphism (TIP) information for TIP-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) present in indica, japonica, and rufipogon/nivara populations.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86324-supp5-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>Statistical significance of the permutation test performed to identify selection on OsJAZ1, OsGAP, and OsMPH1.</title><p>Only the haplotypes that cleared the p-value cutoff of 0.01 were reported to be under selection.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86324-supp6-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-86324-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Resequencing data are available at SRA Bioproject accessions PRJNA557122, PRJNA422249 and PRJEB6180.

This is because, in addition to simple knockouts of genes, TEs carry regulatory sequences that can, and sometimes do, affect the expression of genes near the TEs. However, because TEs can be difficult to map to reference genomes, they have generally not been used for trait mapping. Instead, single nucleotide polymorphisms are widely used because they are easy to detect when using short reads. However, improvements in sequencing technology, as well as an increased appreciation of the importance of TEs to both linked to favorable alleles and are more likely to be causing the changes that make those alleles beneficial in a given environment. Further, because TE activity can occur after bottlenecks, they can provide polymorphisms in the absence of variation in point mutations.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors carefully examine insertion polymorphisms in rice and demonstrate linkage to differences in expression. To do this, they used expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) GWAS using TIPs as genetic markers to examine variation in 208 rice accessions. Because they chose to focus on genes that were expressed in at least 10% of the accessions, presumably because more rare variants would end up lacking statistical power. This is an understandable decision, but it says that recent insertions, such as the MITE elements detailed in a previous paper, would not be included. Importantly, although TIPs associated with differentially expressed genes are far less common than SNPs' traditional eQTLs, there were a significant number of eQTLs that showed linkage to TIPs but not to QTL.</p><p>The authors then show that of the eQTLs associated with both TIPs and SNPs, TIPs are more tightly linked to the eQTL, and are more likely to be associated with a reduction in expression, with variation in the effects of various TEs families supporting that hypothesis. Here and throughout, however, the distance of the TEs could be an important variable. It is also worth noting the relative numbers in order to assess the claim in the title of the paper. The total number of eQTL-TIPs is ten-fold less than the number of eQTL-SNPs, and, of the eQTLs that have both, there are a significant number of eQTL-TIPs that are not more tightly linked to the expression differences than the eQTL.</p><p>The authors show that eQTL-TIPs are more likely to be in the promoter-proximal region, but this may be due to insertion bias, which is well documented in DNA-type elements. Here and throughout the authors are careful to state that the data is consistent with the hypothesis that TEs are the cause of the change, but do not claim that the data demonstrate that they are.</p><p>Throughout the rest of the manuscript, the authors systematically build the case for a causal role for TEs by showing, for instance, that eQTL-TIPs show much stronger evidence for selection, with increased expression being more likely to be selected than decreased expression. The authors provide examples of genes most likely to have been affected by TE insertions.</p><p>Overall, the authors build a convincing case for TEs being an important source of regulatory information. I don't have any issues with the analysis, but I am concerned about the sweeping claims made in the title. Once you get rid of eQTLs that could be altered by either SNPs or TIPs and include only those insertions that show strong evidence of selection, the number of genes is reduced to only 30. And even in those cases, the observed linkage is just that, not definitive evidence for the involvement of TEs. Although clearly beyond the scope of this analysis, transgenic constructs with the TEs present or removed, or even segregating families, would have been far more convincing.</p><p>The fact that many of the eQTL-TIPs were relatively old is interesting because it suggests that selection in domesticated rice was on pre-existing variation rather than new insertions. This may strengthen the argument because those older insertions are less likely to be purged due to negative effects on gene expression. Given that the sequence of these TEs is likely to have diverged from others in the same family, it would have been interesting to see if selection in favor of a regulatory function had caused these particular insertions to move away from more typical examples of the family.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86324.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this manuscript, Castanera et al. investigated how transposable elements (TEs) altered gene expression in rice and how these changes were selected during the domestication of rice.

This is what we wanted to convey in the title, were we were cautious to not claiming that TEs are the most important contributor to gene expression variability in rice populations. However, we agree with the referee that the title may be improved to better describe the results presented. We have therefore changed the title to &quot;Transposons are an important contributor to gene expression variability under selection in rice populations&quot;.</p><p>With respect to demonstrating causality by removing or introducing the TEs, this is indeed a work we plant to do but that, as stated by the referee, is beyond the scope of this analysis.</p><p>The fact that many of the eQTL-TIPs were relatively old is interesting because it suggests that selection in domesticated rice was on pre-existing variation rather than new insertions.

On the other hand the effect of TIPs on expression can be positive or negative (we show actually that it is often negative). In the later case, a plausible scenario would be of the insertion inactivating a promoter element, and in this case it would be the insertion itself, and not the actual sequence of the TE what would be selected.</p><p>Also, previous work done in our lab has shown that TEs can amplify and mobilize transcription factor binding sites that are bound by the TF even when they are not close to a gene and therefore probably not directly affecting gene expression (Hénaff et al.,2014. The Plant Journal). In that case, the sequence of the eQTL TEs and those that are far away from genes will not necessarily differ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, Castanera et al. investigated how transposable elements (TEs) altered gene expression in rice and how these changes were selected during the domestication of rice.

The authors compare the proportion of the variance explained by the most significant TIP and SNP on the observed eQLTs associated with TIPs and SNPs. Thereby the authors conclude that TIPs explain more variance than SNPs. If I am not mistaken the GWAS was run separately for TIPs and SNPs, however, I am wondering if running the GWAS on the combined TIP and SNP dataset might be the better way to compare the variance explained by TIPs and SNPs on gene expression differences. It would be nice to see if these results also hold true if a TIP and SNP combined dataset is used as the most significant marker in a GWAS might not be the causal mutation but might just be linked to the causal mutation. Further in the TIP dataset, the number of markers is only 45k and in the SNP dataset, it is 1 000k, which could bias the GWAS toward finding markers that explain more of the variation in the dataset with fewer markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the reviewer concern by using two complementary approaches, whose results are described in the text (lines 119-121) and in the new Figure 1-figure supplement 1.</p><p>First, we addressed the concern regarding the independent GWAS for TIPs and SNPs vs a combined strategy. For this, we built new japonica/indica genotype matrices containing all TIP and SNP matrix together and ran eQTL mapping again. Using the same strategy (association + FDR adjust), we found 100% of the previous TIP-eQTLs and 99% of the previous SNP-eQTLs. We repeated the same analysis (proportion of expression variance), and the results were mostly the same (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A).</p><p>Second, we addressed the two concerns (combined genotypes and different amount of TIP and SNP markers) using a single approach. SNP matrices were LD pruned using a r2 = 0.9 and later subsampled to the exact number of TIPs (Indica = 30,396, Japonica = 25,168). We verified that these SNPs covered well the 12 rice chromosomes. SNP and TIP genotypes were later merged into a single matrix, and eQTL mapping was repeated for each of the subspecies and conditions using the same parameters as in the previous version of the manuscript. 100 % of the previously reported TIP-eQTL associations were found using this new approach. Nevertheless, we found a very important drop of sensitivity in the SNP-eQTLs (only 15-20% of the previous associations were detected), possibly due to the strong reduction in the number of SNPs (&gt; 95 %), which results in much lower number of markers at &lt; 5Kb from genes. We repeated the analysis of Figure 1D, and observed very similar results (Figure 1-figure supplement 1D). There is a very important number of TIP-eQTL associations that do not coincide with SNP-eQTLs, (74% in indica, 83% in japonica) indicating that TIP-eQTL mapping is complementary to SNP-eQTL mapping as it uncovers additional associations (note that in this case the overlap between TIP-eQTLs and SNP-eQTLs is lower than in the previous analysis due to the lower sensitivity of SNP-eQTL mapping using less markers). In the cases were both a TIP and a SNP coincide as eQTL, TIPs explained slightly more variance than SNPs in both indica and japonica (in 54% of the cases TIP variance &gt; SNP variance).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line 146 to 152: in this section, the authors describe overlaps between TIP-eQTLs in two different growth conditions, however, in the text it is not mentioned if the TIPs have the same effect on gene expression in the two conditions or if the gene expression is up-regulated in one condition but down-regulated in the other. This information would be interesting to have here, especially as the authors go on to say that only a small number of TIP-eQTLs are stress-specific. The same comment also goes for the eQTL overlap described on lines 167 to 170.</p></disp-quote><p>We checked the effect type (positive or negative) of TIP-eQTLs in both scenarios (associations shared between wet/dry conditions, and associations shared between subspecies). In both cases, 100 % of the shared TIP-eQTLs have the same effect type in the two conditions or subspecies. We have updated the text accordingly (Lines 55-157 and Lines 179-181)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Lines 192 to 196: the authors mention that the frequency of non-eQTL-TIPs was at the same frequency in indica and japonica, which is in contrast to eQTL-TIPs. However, on line 132 it is mentioned that eQTL-TIPs were overrepresented in 1 kb regions upstream of genes. Hence, is the pattern of the frequency of non-eQTL-TIPs being at the same frequency in indica and japonica also observed in the 1 kb regions upstream of genes and/or if the distribution of non-eQTL-TIPs is matched to one of the eQTL-TIPs? Or is this pattern driven by non-eQTL-TIPs far away from genes?</p></disp-quote><p>We checked the frequencies of TIPs at 1Kb upstream genes and found that the general pattern is maintained, with the frequencies of TIP no-eQTLs being more correlated than that of TIP-eQTLs. We have included this information (lines 204-206) an added a new supplementary file (Figure 2-figure supplement 2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In the discussion, the authors could briefly discuss how linked selection affecting TIPs could contribute to the observed results. After reading the second example in the result section where one of the example TIPs (TIP_50059) is found on the Hap B which contains &quot;some additional structural differences&quot; (line 290), I was left wondering how much of the increase in TIP frequency can be attributed to genetic hitchhiking? And how much of the results could be caused by linked selection, especially when considering that structural variations are not included in the GWAS analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee in that some of the TIP eQTLs here described might be not the actual cause of expression variability (ej, TIP linked with the causal mutation), although we cannot know the exact fraction. This is stated in several places of the results and discussion sections. However, the fact that TIPs tend to explain more variance than SNPs and that TIP eQTL, but not SNP eQTL, tend to concentrate in the upstream proximal region of genes where most transcription regulatory sequences are located (Figure 1), suggest that TIP eQTLs could be more frequently the causal than SNP eQTLs. We revised the text to ensure that we convey this message appropriately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>• Lines 80 to 83: the description of the rice phylogeny should be moved to the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>Done (Lines 68-72)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Line 177 to 186: It was unclear to me if the authors checked in the ancestral rice population laced the TIPs described in this section as recently inserted in the indica and japonica ssp.

The approximate 1/3 of subspecies specific TIP-eQTLs refers to the TIPs at 3% MAF (ie, some of these insertions could be present at &gt; 3% in indica, but at &lt; 3% MAF in japonica).
