estrogen receptor α (ERα). We found that an HSF1 deficiency may decrease ERα level, attenuate the mitogenic action of E2, counteract E2-stimulated cell scattering, and reduce adhesion to collagens and cell motility in ER-positive breast cancer cells. The stimulatory effect of E2 on the transcriptome is largely weaker in HSF1-deficient cells, in part due to the higher basal expression of E2-dependent genes, which correlates with the enhanced binding of unliganded ERα to chromatin in such cells. HSF1 and ERα can cooperate directly in E2-stimulated regulation of transcription, and HSF1 potentiates the action of ERα through a mechanism involving chromatin reorganization. Furthermore, HSF1 deficiency may increase the sensitivity to hormonal therapy (4-hydroxytamoxifen) or CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib). Analyses of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database indicate that HSF1 increases the transcriptome disparity in ER-positive breast cancer and can enhance the genomic action of ERα. Moreover, only in ER-positive cancers an elevated <italic>HSF1</italic> level is associated with metastatic disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>About 70% of breast cancers rely on supplies of a hormone called estrogen – which is the main hormone responsible for female physical characteristics – to grow.

Four clinically relevant molecular types are distinguished based on the expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) and HER2 (ERBB2). Among them, luminal adenocarcinomas, characterized by the expression of estrogen receptors, constitute about 70% of all breast cancer cases. There are two classical nuclear estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ (encoded by <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>ESR2</italic> genes, respectively), and structurally different GPR30 (<italic>GPER1</italic>), which is a member of the rhodopsin-like family of the G protein-coupled and seven-transmembrane receptors. ERα expression is most common in breast cancer, and its evaluation is the basis for determining the ER status. The activity of estrogen receptors is modulated by steroid hormones, mainly estrogens, which are synthesized from cholesterol via androgens in the reaction catalyzed by aromatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuentes and Silveyra, 2019</xref>). According to epidemiological and experimental data, estrogens alongside the mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>, <italic>CHEK2</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>STK11</italic> (<italic>LKB1</italic>), <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic>, and other genes, are key etiological factors of breast cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yaşar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Verigos and Magklara, 2015</xref>). The mechanism of estrogen-stimulated breast carcinogenesis is not clear. According to the widely accepted hypothesis, estrogens acting through ERα stimulate cell proliferation and can support the growth of cells harboring mutations that then accumulate, ultimately resulting in cancer. Another hypothesis suggests the ERα-independent action of estrogens via their metabolites, which can exert genotoxic effects, contributing to cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yager and Davidson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pescatori et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, hormonal therapies targeting either estrogen production (i.e., aromatase inhibitors) or the hormone receptor itself such as selective ER modulators (SERMs; i.e., tamoxifen) and selective ER degraders (SERDs; i.e., fulvestrant) are widely used to block the mitogenic action of estrogens in patients with ER-positive breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Renoir, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farcas et al., 2021</xref>), contributing to the decline in mortality from breast cancer in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iwase et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we have found that the major female sex hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) stimulates activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells via MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vydra et al., 2019</xref>). HSF1 is a well-known regulator of response to cellular stress induced by various environmental stimuli. It mainly regulates the expression of the heat shock proteins (HSPs), which function as molecular chaperones and regulate protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ran et al., 2007</xref>). HSF1-regulated chaperones control, among others, the activity of estrogen receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Echeverria and Picard, 2010</xref>). ERs remain in an inactive state trapped in multimolecular chaperone complexes organized around HSP90, containing p23 (PTGES3), and immunophilins (FKBP4 or FKPB5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Segnitz and Gehring, 1995</xref>). Upon binding to E2, ERs dissociate from the chaperone complexes and become competent to dimerize and regulate the transcription. ERs bind DNA directly to the estrogen-response elements (EREs), or indirectly, via tethering factors, and promote the transcription at either nearby promoters or through chromatin loops from distal enhancers. The dynamic action of ERs, which enables the adaptation of cancer cells and impacts the clinical outcome, relies on many transcriptional coactivators and corepressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heldring et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Renoir, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farcas et al., 2021</xref>). HSP90 is essential for ERα hormone binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fliss et al., 2000</xref>), dimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Powell et al., 2010</xref>), and binding to the EREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inano et al., 1994</xref>). Also, the passage of the ER to the cell membrane requires association with the HSP27 (HSPB1) oligomers in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Razandi et al., 2010</xref>). More than 20 chaperones and co-chaperones associated with ERα in human cells have been identified through a quantitative proteomic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhamad et al., 2016</xref>), but their specific contribution in the receptor action still needs to be investigated. Moreover, HSF1 is involved in the regulation of a plethora of non-HSP genes, which support oncogenic processes: cell cycle regulation, signaling, metabolism, adhesion, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mendillo et al., 2012</xref>). A high level of HSF1 expression was found in cancer cell lines and many human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vydra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Thonel et al., 2011</xref>) and was shown to be associated with the increased mortality of ER-positive breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santagata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gökmen-Polar and Badve, 2016</xref>).</p><p>E2-activated HSF1 is transcriptionally potent and takes part in the regulation of several genes essential for breast cancer cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vydra et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, HSF1-regulated chaperones are necessary for ERα proper function. Thus, a hypothetical positive feedback loop between E2/ERα and HSF1 signaling may exist, which putatively supports the growth of estrogen-dependent tumors. Here, to study the cooperation of HSF1 and ERα in estrogen signaling and the influence of HSF1 on E2-stimulated transcription and cell growth and mobility, we created novel experimental models based on HSF1-deficient cells and performed an in-depth bioinformatics analysis of the relevant genomics data. We also compared the influence of HSF1 on ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HSF1 deficiency reduces the estrogen-stimulated proliferation and mobility of ERα-positive MCF7 cells</title><p>To study the contribution of HSF1 in E2 signaling, we established MCF7 cell lines with reduced HSF1 expression. Firstly, we tested a few <italic>HSF1-</italic>targeting shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Then, the most potent variant that reduced HSF1 level about 10-fold (termed afterward shHSF1) was chosen for further studies. Although the heat shock response was significantly reduced, the expression of <italic>HSP</italic> genes (<italic>HSPA1A</italic>, <italic>HSPH1</italic>, <italic>HSPB1</italic>, and <italic>HSPB8</italic>) was still induced after this HSF1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, we additionally created MCF7 variants with HSF1 functional knockout using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting approach (clones arisen from two individual cells termed KO#1 and KO#2 afterward). Then, considering the slight differences between clones, we created an additional experimental model: six new individual HSF1-negative (HSF1−) and six HSF1-positive (HSF1+) MCF7 clones obtained using the DNA-free CRISPR/Cas9 system (which was more effective) were pooled before analyses. The complete elimination of HSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) was connected with a substantial loss of inducibility of <italic>HSP</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and proteins (HSP105/HSPH1, HSP90, HSP70/HSPA1) following hyperthermia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The ability of cells to form colonies in the clonogenic assay was reduced in all MCF7 experimental models of HSF1 depletion (using shRNA and sgRNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, the population size of ALDH-positive (stem/progenitor) cells correlated with the HSF1 level and was reduced in HSF1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Also, the increased contribution of cells in the G1 phase was associated with the HSF1 knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). HSF1 knockdown did not affect the proliferation rate, while the functional HSF1 knockout led to a slight reduction in the proliferation rate under standard conditions (this effect was not visible under less favorable growing conditions, i.e., in phenol red-free 5% dextran-activated charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To check if HSF1 deficiency would affect the growth of another ERα-positive cell line, we modified T47D cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Under standard conditions, we did not observe differences between HSF1+ and HSF1− T47D cells in the proliferation and clonogenic assay (not shown). Unlike MCF7 cells, HSF1− T47D cells grew slightly faster than HSF1+ cells, but this difference was not statistically significant and no differences were observed in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of HSF1 depletion on MCF7 cell growth and migration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HSF1 level and (<bold>B</bold>) heat shock response assessed by western blot in unmodified cells (WT) and in cells obtained using DNA-free CRISPR/Cas9 system: HSF1+ (six clones with the normal HSF1 level were pooled) and HSF1− (six HSF1-negative clones were pooled).

Since most of these genes code for proteins involved in E2 signaling, we expected that HSF1 downregulation could affect E2-dependent processes, especially cell proliferation. Therefore, we compared E2-stimulated proliferation of HSF1-proficient and HSF1-deficient MCF7 cells in all experimental models. HSF1 deficiency resulted in weaker growth stimulation by E2 (than in the corresponding control cells), but a statistically significant difference was not observed in all experimental conditions/cell variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, E2-stimulated proliferation was not significantly reduced in HSF1-deficient T47D cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results indicate that HSF1 may influence the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells, unstimulated and stimulated by estrogen, although the effect also depends on other factors (differences between cells, culture conditions).</p><p>We then searched for differences between modified cells in response to longer E2 treatment. We noticed that stimulation of HSF1-proficient MCF7 cells with E2 for 7–14 days resulted in cell-cell dissociation, the acquisition of an ameboid- or mesenchymal-like morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>), and enhanced adhesion to collagens (I and IV) but reduced to vitronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; adhesion to fibronectin, laminin, and tenascin was not affected; not shown). These changes enabled cells to migrate faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). HSF1 deficiency counteracted cell scattering after E2 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref> ). This was associated with the reduced adhesion to collagens and cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). It is noteworthy that T47D cells differed from MCF7 cells in response to E2 treatment for 14 days, especially in acquired cell morphology. Amoeboid-like morphology was dominant among the scattered MCF7 cells, while mesenchymal-like morphology was dominant in T47D cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>). Also, adhesion to collagens was not affected by E2 in T47D cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

At control conditions (no E2 stimulation), we found relatively few genes differentially expressed in HSF1-proficient and HSF1-deficient cells that were common for different models of HSF1 downregulation. These included mainly known HSF1 targets (e.g., <italic>HSPH1</italic>, <italic>HSPE1</italic>, <italic>HSPD1</italic>, <italic>HSP90AA1</italic>) slightly repressed in HSF1-deficient cells. Analyzing the response to E2, we initially compared cell variants from different models: with the normal level of HSF1 (WT, SCR, and MIX) and HSF1-deficient cells (shHSF1, KO#1, and KO#2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, sheet 1). We found 50 genes similarly regulated by E2 (47 upregulated and 3 downregulated) in all HSF1-proficient MCF7 cell variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). On the other hand, only 13 genes were similarly upregulated after E2 stimulation in HSF1-deficient MCF7 cell variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>). The gene set enrichment analyses indicated that HSF1 deficiency negatively affected the processes activated by estrogen (the early and late estrogen response; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, though almost all genes upregulated by E2 in HSF1-proficient cells were also upregulated in HSF1-deficient cells (except <italic>NAPRT</italic>), the degree of their activation (measured as a fold change E2 versus Ctr) was usually weaker in the latter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), which indicated that the transcriptional response to estrogen was inhibited in the lack of HSF1. Interestingly, however, several E2-dependent genes revealed slightly higher basal expression (without E2 stimulation) in HSF1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>), which suggested that in the absence of E2, HSF1 could be involved in the suppression of these genes.</p><p>Considering differences between KO#1 and KO#2 HSF1 knockout clones derived from individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we performed an additional transcriptomic analysis using a putatively more representative MCF7 cell model obtained by DNA-free CRISPR/Cas9 method (heterogeneous populations of HSF1+ and HSF1− cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, sheet 2). The analysis showed that 3715 genes significantly changed the expression (2336 upregulated and 1479 downregulated) in HSF1+ cells after E2 stimulation. On the other hand, only 2969 genes (1818 upregulated and 1151 downregulated) changed the expression in HSF1− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, approximately 20% of genes responding to E2 treatment in HSF1+ cells did not respond similarly in HSF1− cells. Moreover, among genes up- or downregulated in both cell variants, approximately 68% or 81%, respectively, responded less effectively (fold change E2 versus Ctr) in HSF1− cells than HSF1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom panel). The gene set enrichment analyses revealed the slight differences in the early and late estrogen response pathways (Hallmark gene sets M5906 and M5907) but also in genes defining epithelial-mesenchymal transition (M5930). Interestingly, the expression of genes from these pathways already differentiated untreated HSF1− and HSF1+ cells. Genes encoding cell cycle-related targets of E2F transcription factors (M5925), involved in the G2/M checkpoint (M5901) as well as ECM proteoglycans (M27219) and collagen formation (M631), also discriminated HSF1− and HSF1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The analysis confirmed that the transcriptional response to estrogen was inhibited in the lack of HSF1. In addition, signaling pathways related to proliferation, migration, and collagen adhesion were identified as primarily affected, which was consistent with the results of functional tests. Among E2-responding genes that were common for all MCF7 cell models, 46 were upregulated and 2 were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Observed differences in response to E2 between cells with different levels of HSF1 may result from altered expression of ERα in HSF1-deficient cells. We found that although the kinetics of ERα activation (as assessed by S118 phosphorylation) in response to E2 treatment was similar in HSF1+ and HSF1− MCF7 cells, ERα and pS118 ERα levels were lower in HSF1− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>ERα is known to be kept in an inactive state by HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pratt and Toft, 1997</xref>), in particular by HSP90AA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhamad et al., 2016</xref>), that is, the HSF1 transcriptional target. Thus, looking for a reason for the decreased ERα level and its dysregulated binding to DNA in HSF1-deficient cells, we focused on ERα and HSP90 interactions. Analyses of the proximity of both proteins by PLA revealed that the number of ERα /HSP90 complexes decreased after estrogen treatment in HSF1+ MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This indicates that liganded (and transcriptionally active) ERα is indeed released from the inhibitory complex with HSP90. <italic>HSP90AA1</italic> expression was substantially reduced in HSF1-deficient cells (RNA-seq analyses), which correlated with the reduced HSP90 protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Also, the ERα level was considerably decreased in most HSF1-deficient cell variants (except KO#1 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), especially in cells cultured in phenol-free media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the number of ERα/HSP90 complexes could be reduced in HSF1-deficient cells, which would result in enhanced basal transcriptional activity of ERα in untreated cells. However, we observed an increased number of such complexes both in untreated and E2-stimulated HSF1− cells when compared to HSF1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This indicates that the response to estrogen could be dysregulated in HSF1-deficient cells, also at the level of ERα/HSP90 interactions, in a mechanism not related directly to the HSP90 and ERα downregulation mediated by the HSF1 deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>HSF1 can cooperate with ERα in chromatin binding and participate in the spatial organization of chromatin loops</title><p>Since estrogen-activated HSF1 was shown to bind to chromatin, we compared the binding patterns of ERα and HSF1 in wild-type MCF7 cells (using our ChIP-seq data deposited in the NCBI GEO database; accession no.

Although in untreated cells (Ctr) there were 1535 and 2248 annotated peaks for ERα and HSF1 respectively (compared to the input), only a few (below 50) binding sites with overlapped peaks for both transcription factors were identified. Moreover, these common binding regions were characterized by a small number of tags (smaller in the case of ERα) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, sheet 1). On the other hand, the search for ERα and HSF1 common binding regions created after estrogen treatment (E2 versus Ctr) returned more than 200 peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, sheet 2). They represented only a small fraction of the total number of ERα-binding sites (~2.6% from 8320 peaks; in the case of HSF1, this represents 35% of 571 peaks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Numbers of tags per peak and fold enrichment increased after E2 stimulation for both factors, yet more for ERα than HSF1 binding in such regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results suggest that although there is a significant overlap between two sets of peaks (p-value=0.0099, ChIPpeakAnno, peakPermTest), the cobinding of both factors in the same DNA region may not be critical in the regulation of the ERα transcriptional activity. Instead, we postulate that HSF1 may influence the organization of the chromatin loops created after estrogen stimulation. When we combined ERα and HSF1 ChIP-seq peaks with data from chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fullwood et al., 2009</xref>, it was evident that the HSF1-binding sites mapped to ERα-interacting loci (ERα anchor regions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) even if actual ERα binding was not detected in the same locus (examples of such anchors in <italic>FAM102A</italic>, <italic>HSPB8</italic>, <italic>PRKCE</italic>, and <italic>WWC1</italic> regulatory sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

To distinguish between cobinding, tethering, and canonical binding, regions of HSF1 and ERα ChIP-seq peaks (and ChIA-PET reads) were analyzed whether each sequence contained a motif match of HSF1 (heat shock element [HSE]) and/or ERα (ERE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Analyses of all peaks/reads existing after E2 treatment showed that most of them reflected canonical binding through the corresponding motif. We found 569 genes that could be independently co-regulated by both transcription factors. In addition, ERα and HSF1 may directly cooperate in the regulation of 275 genes: cobinding was found for 65 genes and possible tethering (i.e., the presence of both transcription factors in a given chromatin region containing only one motif) for 220 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). In the last group, it is also possible that ERα and HSF1 bound to chromatin in different sites can interact, leading to the formation of a chromatin loop. Moreover, various binding patterns were found in the regulatory region annotated to one gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Therefore, out of all breast cancer cases, we selected four groups (numbered from I to IV) characterized by significantly different levels of ERα (mRNA and protein level) and <italic>HSF1</italic> (mRNA) expression: ER−/HSF1<sup>low</sup>, ER−/HSF1<sup>high</sup>, ER+/HSF1<sup>low</sup>, and ER+/HSF1<sup>high</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These groups varied in molecular subtypes composition.

In ER– cases (basal-like and HER2-enriched), the HSF1<sup>high</sup> group was more homogenous (mostly basal-like) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Importantly, the exclusion of cases with moderate/intermediate expression of <italic>ESR1</italic> or <italic>HSF1</italic> enabled us to observe the effect of both transcription factors on the survival of breast cancer patients, although the expression of <italic>HSF1</italic> alone had no significant effect on the survival in either ER– or ER+ group analyzed separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

On the other hand, HSF1<sup>high</sup> and HSF1<sup>low</sup> cases were not separated, although they were slightly shifted against each other.

These analyses indicate that HSF1 may enhance estrogen signaling. On the other hand, the analysis focused on terms related to response to stimulus and protein processing (i.e., functions presumed to be dependent on HSF1 action via the HSPs expression) revealed that most of them reached the statistical significance of differences between ER+/HSF1<sup>high</sup> and ER−/HSF1<sup>high</sup> cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>We additionally compared the expression of E2-regulated genes (the set identified in MCF7 cells by RNA-seq, i.e., 46 upregulated and 2 downregulated genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) in selected groups of breast cancers with different levels of <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>HSF1</italic>.

Moreover, regardless of ER status, cancers with high HSF1 levels revealed a higher expression of <italic>MYBL1</italic> than cancers with low HSF1 levels. Furthermore, expression of a few genes systematically differentiated cancers with high levels of both factors (ER+/HSF1<sup>high</sup>) compared to cancers with the low level of at least one factor (including <italic>RAPGEFL1</italic>, <italic>AMZ1</italic>, <italic>KCNF1</italic>, <italic>HSPB8</italic> upregulated<italic>,</italic> and <italic>CYP24A1, SIM1</italic> downregulated in ER+/HSF1<sup>high</sup> cancers), which was consistent in all relevant comparisons (marked with green boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Nevertheless, the observed features of gene expression profiles confirmed collectively that HSF1 affects the genomic action of ERα in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>HSF1 functional knockout results in a better response to hydroxytamoxifen and palbociclib treatments in MCF7 cells</title><p>ER-positive breast cancers are frequently treated with tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator. More recent therapeutic options include palbociclib, a selective inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, approved for women with advanced metastatic cancer. Thus, we studied the influence of HSF1 on the response of MCF7 and T47D cells to these drugs. Treatment of HSF1+ cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) resulted in slightly enhanced proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This may be a consequence of ERα activation (estimated by its phosphorylation at S118; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and induction of ERα-regulated genes (not shown) and is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 1993</xref>). Although HSF1 functional knockout by itself had different effects in both cell lines (MCF7 growth was inhibited, while T47D growth was enhanced after HSF1 knockout; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), treatment with 4-OHT did not result in increased proliferation, thus it gave better results than in HSF1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). 4-OHT slightly inhibited E2-stimulated cell proliferation, and the differences between HSF1+ and HSF1− cells reflected differences in response to E2. T47D cells were more resistant to palbociclib than MCF7 cells. The difference between HSF1+ and HSF1− was not significant in T47D cells while in MCF7 cells inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) of palbociclib was more than twofold lower in HSF1− than in HSF1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Palbociclib also inhibited E2-stimulated cell proliferation, yet only in MCF7 cells, it was slightly more effective in the absence of HSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). These results show only some tendencies (the statistical significance depends on the tests used) but suggest that ER-positive breast tumors with low HSF1 expression may be more sensitive to treatment with 4-OHT and palbociclib than cases with high HSF1 levels.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>HSF1 functional knockout affects the response of cells to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) and palbociclib (Palbo).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth of HSF1+ and HSF1− MCF7 and T47D cells (assessed using crystal violet staining).

We found that estrogen action may be supported by HSF1, a deficiency of which in ER-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells slows down the mitogenic effect of estrogen. This may be a consequence of a reduced level of ERα and transcriptional response to estrogen in these cells. In addition, analyses of the transcriptome of breast cancers from TCGA database showed the importance of HSF1 as evidenced by higher transcriptome disparity in ER-positive cases with a high expression of <italic>HSF1</italic> rather than with low <italic>HSF1</italic> levels. The effect of E2 and ERα on cell migration and metastasis also is unclear and published data are inconsistent. E2 was shown to suppress the invasion of ER-positive breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Padilla-Rodriguez et al., 2018</xref>) or to enhance breast cancer cell motility and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanchez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vazquez Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>). Correspondingly, ERα silencing or inhibition (by fulvestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader) was shown to enhance cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2017</xref>) or to reduce motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bischoff et al., 2020</xref>). We showed that longer exposure to E2 induced cell scattering and increased mobility in ER-positive breast cancer cells and HSF1 deficiency could counteract these processes. It is noteworthy that responses to E2 and the effects of HSF1 are slightly different in MCF7 and T47D cells. Ameboid-like morphology and enhanced adhesion to collagens are induced by E2 in MCF7, while mesenchymal-like morphology is induced in T47D cells. Generally, T47D cells differ from MCF7 cells in response to estrogen, partially due to a lower level of ERα in T47D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vydra et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, T47D cells harbor a p53 missense mutation (L194F), which causes p53 stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lim et al., 2009</xref>). The mutant p53 exhibits gain-of-function activities in mediating cell survival, and this is likely the reason for the differences between T47D and MCF7 cells. Nevertheless, the data from TCGA showing a correlation between increasing levels of HSF1 and metastatic disease in ER-positive breast cancers support the observations from the in vitro model that HSF1 may affect migration.</p><p>The mechanism of supportive action of HSF1 in ER-positive cells was already proposed, by which upon E2 treatment HSF1 is phosphorylated via ERα/MAPK signaling, gains transcriptional competence, and activates several genes essential for breast cancer cell growth and/or ERα action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vydra et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we found that HSF1 deficiency results in a weaker response to estrogen stimulus of many estrogen-induced genes. It is noteworthy that the reduced transcriptional response to estrogen could at least partially result from the enhanced binding of unliganded ERα to chromatin and higher basal expression of ERα-regulated genes. This suggests that HSF1-dependent mechanisms may amplify ERα action upon estrogen stimulation while inhibiting it in the absence of ligands. The proper action of ERs depends on HSF1-regulated chaperones, especially HSP90. As expected, the number of HSP90/ERα complexes decreased after ligand (E2) binding in cells with normal levels of HSF1. However, although HSP90 was downregulated in HSF1-deficient cells, more HSP90/ERα complexes were found both in untreated and estrogen-stimulated cells. Hence, increased activity of ERα in HSF1-deficient cells could not be explained by the reduced sequestration of unliganded ERα by HSP90. Accordingly, additional HSF1-dependent factors may influence the formation of these complexes. Nevertheless, because it is known that HSP90 inhibitors affected the ERα level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fliss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nonclercq et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fiskus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wong and Chen, 2009</xref>), a decreased level of ERα observed in our experimental model may be a consequence of the decreased level of HSP90. Ligand-independent genomic actions of ERα are also regulated by growth factors that activate protein-kinase cascades, leading to phosphorylation and activation of nuclear ERs at EREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stellato et al., 2016</xref>). The involvement of HSF1 in the repression of estrogen-dependent transcription was reported in MCF7 cells treated with neuregulin (NRG1), the ligand for the HER2 (NEU/ERBB2) receptor tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khaleque et al., 2008</xref>). Interactions of HSF1 with the corepressor metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) and several additional chromatin-modulating proteins were implicated in that process. Therefore, since the lack of HSF1 can alter the cellular context, it cannot be ruled out that HSF1 influences unliganded and liganded ERα by various mechanisms that have to be further investigated. Our observation from cell culture models that silencing or knockout of HSF1 has a different effect on ERα-regulated genes in the absence or presence of estrogen implicates that the consequences in real cancer may depend on the hormonal status of the patient, which is connected with age (pre-/postmenopausal) or use of contraceptive and hormone replacement therapies.</p><p>Transcriptional activation by ERα is a multistep process modulated by coactivators and corepressors. Cofactors interact with the receptor in a ligand-dependent manner and are often part of large multiprotein complexes that control transcription by recruiting components of the basal transcription machinery, regulating chromatin structure, and/or modifying histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Welboren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kovács et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pescatori et al., 2021</xref>). Liganded ERα may bind directly to DNA (to ERE), and indirectly via tethering to other transcription factors such as FOS/JUN (AP1), STATs, ATF2/JUN, SP1, and NFκB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Björnström and Sjöberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Welboren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heldring et al., 2011</xref>). It was established that direct ERE binding is required for most (75%) of the estrogen-dependent gene regulation and 90% of the hormone-dependent recruitment of ERα to genomic binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stender et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, 10% of ERα binding occurs through tethering factors. Here, we found that HSF1 can potentially be an additional factor tethering liganded ERα to DNA. ERα has been shown to function via extensive chromatin looping to bring genes together for coordinated transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fullwood et al., 2009</xref>). Since ERα anchor sites were identified also in sites bound by HSF1 but not ERα, we propose that HSF1 may be a part of this ‘looping’ machinery. Other components in the same anchoring center are also possible. According to the data from ENCODE, the HSF1-binding sites may coincide with NR2F2, JUND, FOSL2, CEBPB, GATA3, MAX, HDAC2, etc. It is consistent with the finding that transcription factor binding in human cells occurs in dense clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). In general, estrogen-induced HSF1 binding was weaker than ERα binding. However, PLA analyses indicated a large heterogeneity in a cell population regarding ERα and HSF1 interactions. The final transcriptional activity of ERα is modulated by interactions with various tethering factors, including HSF1. Therefore, we hypothesize that it can be modulated differently at the single-cell level by different cofactors and chromatin remodeling factors. Thus, the response measured on the whole-cell population is heterogeneous, while stochastic when a single cell is considered.</p><p>Some premises indicate that high levels of HSF1 may be associated with resistance of estrogen-dependent breast cancers to hormonal therapies based on antiestrogens. A significant association between high HSF1 expression and increased mortality among the ER-positive breast cancer patients receiving hormonal therapy was first noticed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santagata et al., 2011</xref>, then confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gökmen-Polar and Badve, 2016</xref>. It was proposed that overexpression of HSF1 in ER-positive breast cancers was associated with a decreased dependency on the ERα-controlled transcriptional program for cancer growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Silveira et al., 2021</xref>). However, this conclusion was based on experiments performed without estrogen stimulation. Our in vitro studies indicate that the influence of HSF1 on ERα action depends on the presence of the estrogen and HSF1 may repress the ERα-controlled transcriptional program only in the absence of the ligand. Nevertheless, we confirmed that HSF1-deficient cells responded better to 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment than cells with normal HSF1 levels. Also, palbociclib, an inhibitor of CDK4/6, was more effective in these cells. Enhanced resistance to hormonal therapies could be mediated by HSF1-regulated genes. HSPs themselves can be prognostic factors in breast cancer and especially oncogenic properties of HSP90AA1 correlated with aggressive clinicopathological features and resistance to the treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whitesell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klimczak et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we have proposed a novel mechanism of the HSF1 action in ER-positive breast cancers, which is independent of typical HSF1-regulated genes. This mechanism assumes that HSF1 influences the transcriptional response to estrogen via the reorganization of chromatin structure in estrogen-responsive genes. This mode of HSF1 action may be important in all ERα-expressing cells. For example, ERα is a critical transcription factor that regulates epithelial cell proliferation and ductal morphogenesis during postnatal mammary gland development. It is noteworthy that HSF1 has been shown to promote mammary gland morphogenesis by protecting mammary epithelial cells from apoptosis and increasing their proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Experimental data indicate that the level of HSF1 can be used to predict response to treatment, while HSF1 targeting may improve the efficacy of breast cancer treatment and prevent the development of metastases. High HSF1 nuclear levels (estimated by immunohistochemistry in patients with invasive breast cancer at diagnosis; in situ carcinomas and stage IV cancers were excluded from the outcome analysis) were previously associated with decreased survival specifically in ER-positive breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santagata et al., 2011</xref>). However, in another study performed on samples from patients with ER-positive tumors, only a weak association was found between the HSF1 protein expression and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gökmen-Polar and Badve, 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, both studies showed a significant correlation between <italic>HSF1</italic> transcript levels and the survival in ER-positive breast cancer patients. In our analysis, using data from TCGA gene expression database, we did not observe such a correlation. <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>HSF1</italic> levels may be prognostic only if analyzed groups of patients are preselected regarding the high/low expression, and may reflect the differences between luminal and basal cancers. We found that in cancers with high expression of estrogen receptor (ER+), the HSF1<sup>low</sup> group consisted mainly of luminal A cases, which are known to have the best prognosis. Although high <italic>HSF1</italic> levels slightly reduced the survival in ER+ cancer patients, they had a greater negative outcome on survival in ER-negative patients. In that group, HSF1<sup>high</sup> cases consisted mainly of the basal-like subtype, known to have a worse prognosis.</p><p>In conclusion, HSF1 and ERα cooperate in response to estrogen stimulation. The regulation is known to be mediated by HSF1-dependent chaperones, which are important for the proper ERα action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Echeverria and Picard, 2010</xref>). Additionally, however, estrogen via ERα and MAPK activates HSF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vydra et al., 2019</xref>), which together with ERα forms new chromatin loops that enhance estrogen-stimulated transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This may be affected by other factors (acting differently in individual cells). Moreover, HSF1 may be involved in the repression of unliganded ERα. Furthermore, genes activated by ERα and HSF1 play an important role in regulating the growth and spread of estrogen-dependent tumors.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of cooperation between ERα and HSF1 in response to estrogen (E2) stimulation.</title><p>Both ERα and HSF1 are kept in an inactive state by the complexes of HSP90, p23, and immunophilins (I). The binding of E2 to ERα is connected with the release of the chaperone complex and activation of ERα, leading to the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 followed by HSF1 activation. Oligomers of active transcription factors can bind to DNA and cooperate in the regulation of the transcription either directly or through chromatin reorganization. This may be influenced by other factors (differently in individual cells).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69843-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MCF7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">American Type Culture Collection</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#:HTB-22;

Cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 10% FBS (EURx, Gdansk, Poland) and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. For heat shock, logarithmically growing cells were placed in a water bath at a temperature of 43°C for 1 hr. The cells were allowed to recover for the indicated time in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C. For estrogen treatment, cells were seeded on plates and the next day the medium was replaced into a phenol-free medium supplemented with 5% or 10% dextran-activated charcoal-stripped FBS (PAN-Biotech GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany). 17β-estradiol (E2; #E4389, Merck KGaA) was added 48 hr later to a final concentration of 10 nM unless otherwise stated for the indicated time. For longer E2 treatments, the medium was changed every two days. In the case of treatments with palbociclib (hydrochloride salt, #P-7788, LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (#T176, Merck KGaA), an equal volume of DMSO was added as vehicle control.

Then we selected four groups (numbered I–IV) of patients: ER-positive/negative with high/low HSF1 expression level using the following clinical and expression (log CPM) criteria: ER-positive if er_status_by_ihc: ‘Positive,’ er_status_ihc_Percent_Positive: ‘90–99%’ and expression level of <italic>ESR1</italic> &gt;6, ER-negative if er_status_by_ihc: ‘Negative’ and expression level of <italic>ESR1</italic> &lt;6, HSF1<sup>high</sup> (<sup>low</sup>) if the expression of <italic>HSF1</italic> was above 67 (below 33) percentile across all TCGA_BRCA cases. We also excluded cases classified to HER2-enriched and basal-like subtypes from the ER-positive group, and luminal A (LumA), luminal B (LumB), and normal-like subtypes from the ER-negative group. In reduced groups (numbered I<sup>R</sup>–IV<sup>R</sup>), only the luminal A and basal-like cases were analyzed.</p><p><italic>Survival analysis</italic> was performed using the <italic>survfit</italic> function from the <italic>survival</italic> package (v. 3.1–8) and plotted with the <italic>ggsurvplot</italic> function from the <italic>survminer</italic> package (v. 0.4.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Therneau and Grambsch, 2000</xref>).</p><p><italic>MDS plots</italic> were used to visualize differences between patients.

Differential expression of <italic>HSF1</italic> between metastatic and nonmetastatic tumors was assessed using the glmQLFTest function from edgeR. Statistical significance of the differences shown by contingency tables was assessed using fisher.test() function for 2 × 2 contingency tables and chisq.test() for the greater tables.

Lowly expressed genes were filtered out by filterByExpr function with default parameters, resulting in 24,696 genes kept for statistical analysis. Then we performed a quasi-likelihood F test for all groups’ combinations one-versus-one and two obvious two-versus-two cases: ER+ versus ER− and HSF1-high versus HSF1-low (using mean expression levels for joined groups, with the weight of 0.5). p-Values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23-4"><title>Comparison of the number of genes differentially expressed between groups</title><p>To compare the size of differences identified in each test, we plotted the cumulative distributions of false discovery rate (FDR).

shock factor 1 (HSF1) in breast cancer cells. They show that HSF1 indirectly interacts with estrogen receptor α (ERα) by regulating the transcription of HSP90, which is essential for normal folding and function of the receptor. They also show that HSF1 and ERα tether within the genome to enhance the transcription of a subset of genes associated with disease progression. Finally, they show the relevance to the breast tumors through comparing their data to publicly available data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69843.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Maureen E</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>The Wistar Institute</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Mary Ann</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Colorado</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Fanning</surname><given-names>Sean W</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of Chicago</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) as a new tethering factor for ESR1 supporting its action in breast cancer&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Namely, they show that HSF-1 indirectly interacts with estrogen receptor α (ERα) by regulating the transcription of HSP90, which is essential for normal folding and function of the receptor. They also show that HSF-1 and ERα tether within the genome to enhance the transcription of a subset of genes associated with disease progression. They show relevance to the breast cancer patient through comparing their data to publicly available data. However there are concerns about some of the conclusions reached in the manuscript, and how some of the statistical analyses have been performed.</p><p>Major Concerns:</p><p>1. The RNA-seq comparisons were done by counting the number of genes that were different. They note that the basal level of several of the genes targeted by ESR1 is higher in HSF1 deficient cells. If that is true then my expectation is fold-change will be lower after ligand addition. Mathematically, fold change is a ratio, and increasing the denominator decreases the ratio value. It is unclear if they removed the ER target genes with higher basal levels in HSF1 deficient cells that the higher induction they note would still be present. To clarify my confusion, I would like to know if the difference in the presence of ligand due to the difference before the ligand was added or due to what happens after the ligand is added. Also, Figure 4 seems to imply that the level of ESR1 is lower in the HSF1- cells. Is that a factor in the RNA-seq response to E2?</p><p>2. The authors show that HSF1 deficient cells have a higher number of ESR1 peaks with more tags in the absence of E2. However, a spike-in was not used, so the change seen in the ChIP-seq could be a technical artifact. For example, formaldehyde crosslinking varies from plate to plate regardless of the sample type. Sequencing depth of the ChIP-seq samples was not discussed and unless the depth is comparable, graphs should be on normalized tags, not tags.</p><p>3. All figures that compare chip regions should be randomizing one of the two data sets and asking what is the expectation for overlap. For instance, they talk about how often HSF1 bound sites are also ESR1 bound. Knowing if that amount of interaction is expected by random chance is only possible if they shuffle the positions of one of the datasets and ask for overlap rate. (Or using an equivalent statical test like bedtools jaccard or reldist).</p><p>4. When comparing the HSF1 ChIP-seq the ESR1 ChIP-seq to the ChIA-pet their intersections, and overlap statics should be used to determine if the interactions in 5D are just random overlaps or are seen more than one would expect by chance. (See comment above on shuffling and bedtools tests.)</p><p>5. The relationship is not clear between their results regarding the sequencing of HSF1 deficient cells and the human tumor data. The molecular data implies HSF1 regulates ESR1 in wild-type cells. The authors should add to the discussion potential reasons why are ESR1+/HSF1low and ER-/HSFhigh are the most divergent groups.</p><p>6. Title: In contrast to the classical DNA-binding mode, where ER binds directly to EREs, tethering factors such as AP-1 family transcription factors (PMIDs: 11162939, 21964465) and Sp1 (PMID: 16651265), have been shown to recruit ER to their target genes, which lack canonical EREs. The proposed model suggests that HSF1 acts as a cooperative factor for ER, where both transcription factors bind DNA independently (Figure 8). The authors also stated that &quot;co-binding of both factors in the same DNA region is not critical in the regulation of the ESR1 transcriptional activity&quot; (pg 12, ln 286-287). Thus, the mechanism of HSF1 action does not meet the basic requirements of a tethering factor as suggested in the title.</p><p>7. Analysis of data: A strength of this manuscript is the use of RNA-seq to examine the effect of HSF1 loss on the estrogen-regulated transcriptional program in MCF7 cells. However, the data presentation is unnecessarily complicated (Figure 1A). Moreover, data presented as fold change E2/Ctr (Figure 2B, 2C and 2E) can be misleading and should be avoided in this case, because HSF1 KO appears to have gene-specific effects on estrogen-deprived cells.</p><p>8. The MGAT3/FOS/CYP24A1 expression profile, where HSF1 loss reduces gene expression with and without estrogen stimulation (Figure 2F), supports a role of HSF1 as an ER collaborator or cooperative factor. In contrast, the predominant expression profile, which is exhibited by GREB1/PGR/KDM4B, where HSF1 loss enhances gene expression in estrogen-deprived cells (Figure 2F), supports an inhibitory role for HSF1 under estrogen-deprived conditions, which undermines the role of HSF1 as a cooperative tethering factor for ER at these estrogen-induced genes. Together, these findings are interesting, but do not show conclusively that the efficacy or potency of E2 is reduced in HSF1-deficient cells.</p><p>9. The authors examined the effect of HSF1 KO on the ER-HSP90 interaction using PLA. The authors show conclusively that HSF1 loss enhanced the ER-HSP90 interaction (Figure 4). This finding is novel and compelling, but evidence that HSP90 contributes to the HSF1 KO phenotypes was not presented, which is a major weakness in the paper.</p><p>10. The authors used ChIP-seq to compare ER and HSF1 binding sites across the MCF7 cell genome. ER and HSF1 binding sites show &lt; 3% overlap in estrogen-deprived cells, with about 4-fold more overlapping binding sites observed upon E2-stimulation (Figure 5A, 5B), which indicates that both factors generally bind DNA independently, with some cooperative binding where ER recruitment was increased. Comparing ChIP-seq recruitment data with ChIA-PET interaction data, suggests interaction between some distinct overlapping and non-overlapping HSF1 and ER binding sites (Figure 5D). It is not clear exactly how prevalent these long-range interactions are across the genome. Using PLA, the authors showed that E2 enhanced the ER-HSF1 interaction (Figure 5F), suggesting that ER can drive chromatin organization that enables these long interactions or chromatin looping. However, chromatin conformation capture (3C) showed that some of these long-range interactions occur in HSF1 KO cells (Figure 5E), suggesting that ER does not require HSF1 to drive chromatin looping. Can the authors clarify these findings into a cogent model?</p><p>11. In breast cancer, ER+ status is an independent and mostly favorable prognostic marker (PMIDs: 6488142, 28601929). High HSF1 expression is associated with mortality in ER+ breast cancer (PMID: 22042860, 27713164). Prognostic impact of HSF1 expression on ER- cases was not obvious (PMID: 27713164). Here, the authors analyzed the TCGA database for prognostic value of ER and HSF1 mRNA and suggest that ER- cases with high HSF1 mRNA levels have the poorest outcome (Figure 6D), suggesting an ER-independent role for HSF1 in breast cancer. However, this conclusion is probably a biased reflection of the prognostic difference between basal and luminal breast cancer subtypes (Figure 6C) (PMID: 26693050). Moreover, how this finding supports a HSF1 role as a cooperative or tethering factor for ER is not clear, and the prognostic value of HSF1 mRNA levels in ER+ breast cancer was not obvious from the data presented.</p><p>12. With regard to their conclusion that HSF1 increases the diversity of the transcriptome in ER-positive breast cancers, the rationale for this analysis is unclear, and the idea that HSF1 affects ER-target genes has already been demonstrated in the KO model using RNA-seq (Figure 2).</p><p>13. Stylistic changes are needed: Much of the text in the figures are too small to read. It was hard to tell the differences between the A, B, C, D groups and the a, b, c, d groups in figure 7.</p><p>14. In figure 5, they authors should be subsampling the &quot;all&quot; groups to the same number as the smaller groups to see if the distributions are the same.</p><p>15. Figures 5A and 5B are trying to show information for the HSF1 and ESR1 overlapping peaks. However, for that data to be useful we need to understand non-overlapping peak data. Also, is the figure showing tags from ESR1 ChIP-seq or HSF1 ChIP-seq?</p><p>16. Important concern: The authors should be using statistical tests to see if overlap in data sets are above random chance.</p><p>17. The authors generated HSF-1 knockouts for MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells. However, the vast majority of their work was performed with only the T47D cells. These cell lines show different dependencies on ERα and antiestrogen differently affect receptor stability between them. More work should have been done outside of one knockdown and proliferation experiment to show that HSF-1 is important in both cell lines. It would give credence to its role in breast cancer cells beyond MCF7 cells.</p><p>18. The authors used an aldefluor assay to show that HSF-1 affects stem-progenitor populations. They did not show any additional data for this line of inquiry. If this phenotype is affected by HSF-1 they should examine EMT signatures along with cellular invasion, and migration.</p><p>19. Therapeutic approaches to targeting ERα were not discussed in this manuscript. However, the role of HSF-1 in the therapeutic response to antiestrogens would be of great importance to the field. Showing the impact of HSF-1 knockdown to ERα transcriptional activity and cellular proliferation in the presence of clinically important hormone therapies fulvestrant and 4-hydroxytamoxifen as well as CDK4/6 inhibitors like palbociclib would greatly enhance the impact of this paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69843.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Concerns:</p><p>1.

Is that a factor in the RNA-seq response to E2?</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware that the lower gene activation (fold-change) by estrogen in HSF1-deficient cells could partially result from the higher baseline expression level of some genes; data presented in old Figure 2F (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1G). To elucidate that, we performed additional RNAseq analyses on the new HSF1-deficient cell model, which revealed that there are together 209 genes up-regulated by E2 at least two-fold in either HSF1+ or HSF1− cells. Higher basal expression in HSF1− cells (versus HSF1+) was observed in the case of 79 genes. In the case of 59 genes (~75%) smaller fold change after E2 treatment was observed in HSF1− cells. Lower basal expression in untreated HSF1− cells was observed in the case of 125 genes. In this set, fold change after E2 treatment was smaller in HSF1− cells in the case of 82 genes (~63%). Stronger activation by E2 (measured as fold change) in HSF1− cells was observed in the case of 67 out of 209 genes (32%), which included 25%/37% of genes with higher/lower basal expression in HSF1− cells. This suggests that the fraction of genes with a lower basal expression may be more responsive to E2 stimulation than the fraction with a higher basal expression. When we focused only on the E2-stimulated genes identified in all RNA-seq analyzes, i.e. 46 genes, 37 (~80%) responded less effectively in HSF1− cells. Significantly higher/lower basal expression in HSF1− cells (versus HSF1+) was observed in the case of 10/9 such genes. Hence, higher basal expression in HSF1-deficient cells was not the major cause for the weaker response to E2. Nevertheless, the new RNA-seq analyses generally confirmed observations from the previous model (differences are in details), that the lack of HSF1 generally results in the inhibition of transcriptional response to E2, yet some genes respond to E2 stronger in HSF1-deficient cells. Thus, the response is gene-specific.</p><p>We agree that the altered response to E2 in HSF1-deficient cells may be a consequence of the changed level of ERα (ESR1). Among two HSF1 KO clones, KO#1 had a higher level of ERα than KO#2 (shown in the revised Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). KO#1 cells responded to E2 better than KO#2 cells, although weaker than WT and control MIX cells (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>The lower level of ERα can be a consequence of the reduced HSP90 level, which is dependent on HSF1. This is in line with previous works that investigated the effects of HSP90 inhibitors on ERα (Fliss et al., 2000) (Nonclercq et al., 2004) (Fiskus et al., 2007) (Wong and Chen, 2009). However, it has been postulated recently that overexpression of HSF1 is associated with decreased levels of ERα. The authors suggested that high levels of HSF1 triggered the degradation of ERα through the proteasome (Silveira et al., 2021). Hence, the relationship between HSF1 and ERα levels remains unclear.</p><p>Importantly, the level of ERα is variable and depends on the culture conditions. The reduced level of ERα in HSF1-deficient MCF7 cells is better visible in phenol red-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>) , which is recommended for all experiments with E2 (to avoid activation of ERα by phenol red). The level of ERα also decreases after longer E2 treatment in phenol red-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>) .</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>ERα level (assessed by western blot) is decreased in HSF1− cells (new model), especially in media without phenol red (A) and in wild-type MCF7 cells after treatment with E2 (B).</title><p>Cells were seeded on plates and the next day the medium was replaced into a phenol-free medium supplemented with 10% dextranactivated charcoal-stripped FBS. 48 hours later cells were collected (A) or E2 was added to a final concentration of 10 nM for the indicated time (B).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69843-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

All ERα ChIP-seq samples were normalized together and have a comparable number of reads. In the revised version, we additionally normalized ChIP-seq data by scaling factor using <italic>bamCoverage</italic> tool and obtained the same results. An enhanced binding of ERα in untreated HSF1-deficient cells and weaker enrichment after E2 stimulation were observed in many binding sites (examples of normalized peaks are shown in the revised Figure 3D). Additionally, the results were validated and confirmed by ChIP-qPCR (at least in regions well above the background level) on another HSF1 deficient cell model (Figure 3E). Nevertheless, since the binding of ERα in E2-untreated cells is relatively weak, we cannot say with certainty that it will not be influenced by other factors. Thus, we have toned down our conclusions:</p><p>“Therefore, we confirmed that in this experimental system, the deficiency of HSF1 may result in enhanced binding of unliganded ERα (in particular at strongly responsive ERα binding sites) and weaker subsequent enrichment of ERα binding upon estrogen stimulation.”</p><p>instead of:</p><p>“Therefore, we validated ChIP-seq results and confirmed that in strongly-responsive ESR1 binding sites deficiency of HSF1 correlated with enhanced binding of unliganded ESR1 and weaker enrichment of ESR1 binding upon estrogen stimulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Using ChIPpeakAnno we prepared a Venn diagram that better shows the overlap between ERα and HSF1 binding regions after E2 treatment (revised Figure 4B). Using the peakPermTest function we performed a permutation test, which revealed that there is a significant overlap between two sets of peaks (P-value: 0.0099). The revised manuscript was supplemented with this information. Also, the final Jaccard statistic reflecting the similarity of the two sets, as well as the number of intersections indicated that the overlap of two sets of peaks is not accidental (p &lt;0.01, n_intersections = 213, with the degree of similarity at the level of 0.0203251).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Using cell culture models, we have shown that HSF1 silencing or knockout may have different effects on ERα regulated genes depending on the presence of estrogen. This implicates that the hormonal status connected with age (pre/post-menopausal), or use of contraceptive and hormone replacement therapies may determine the effect of HSF1 and ERα on breast cancer prognosis. Generally, the difference between ER+/HSF1<sup>low</sup> and ER-/HSF1<sup>high</sup> groups correlates with the differences between breast cancer subtypes, especially when groups reduced to basal-like and luminal A cancers were analyzed. Basal-like (ER-negative) cases are known to have a worse prognosis, while luminal A (ER-positive) cases have the best prognosis. It is noteworthy, however, that HSF1<sup>high</sup> cases dominated in basal-like cases, while HSF1<sup>low</sup> dominated in luminal A cases. Thus, the level of HSF1 may be a part of the molecular signature of these subtypes. Extended analysis of the survival probability of TCGA breast cancer patients indicated that the level of HSF1 did not affect the survival of ER-positive luminal A cancers and worsened the prognosis of basal-like cancers. However, these groups are relatively small, and no statistical significance is observed (revised Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). The reason why HSF1 is connected with a worse prognosis in ER-negative breast cancers is speculative and requires further investigation. Gene ontology analysis revealed differences in terms related to spliceosomal complex assembly, especially the formation of a quadruple snRNP complex, between HSF1<sup>high</sup> and HSF1<sup>low</sup> cancers (revised Figure 7—figure supplement 2). Thus, addressing the hypothetical role of HSF1 in alternative splicing could open a new direction in this area. These points were added to the revised results and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Title: In contrast to the classical DNA-binding mode, where ER binds directly to EREs, tethering factors such as AP-1 family transcription factors (PMIDs: 11162939, 21964465) and Sp1 (PMID: 16651265), have been shown to recruit ER to their target genes, which lack canonical EREs. The proposed model suggests that HSF1 acts as a cooperative factor for ER, where both transcription factors bind DNA independently (Figure 8). The authors also stated that &quot;co-binding of both factors in the same DNA region is not critical in the regulation of the ESR1 transcriptional activity&quot; (pg 12, ln 286-287). Thus, the mechanism of HSF1 action does not meet the basic requirements of a tethering factor as suggested in the title.</p></disp-quote><p>It was established that direct ERE binding is required for most of (75%) estrogen-dependent gene regulation and 90% of hormone-dependent recruitment of ERα to genomic binding sites (Stender et al., 2010). Therefore, only 10% of hormone-dependent ERα binding putatively happens through different tethering factors. Taking into account that for example FOS/JUN (AP1), STATs, ATF2/JUN, SP1, NFκB can also be found in such tethering sites, 2.5% of all ERα binding sites shared with HSF1 seems to be rational. However, to distinguish between canonical binding, cobinding, and tethered binding regions of HSF1 and ERα within ChIP-seq peaks (and ChIAPet reads), we analyzed whether the peak contained a motif match of HSF1 (HSE, heat shock element) and/or ERα (ERE, estrogenresponsive element). We applied MAST software from the MEME Suite package to scan DNA sequences corresponding to ChIP-seq peaks with the PWM (position weight matrix) of HSF1/ERα to determine the direct binding positions of the transcription factor within ChIP-seq peaks. Canonical binding was defined when the transcription factor was bound directly to DNA within its ChIP-seq peaks and its binding motif was present in the peak. Cobinding was defined when both factors were simultaneously bound to DNA within the region and both motifs were present. If ERα bound indirectly to DNA and its ChIP-seq peaks contained only HSF1 binding motifs (and vice versa), tethered binding could be expected. However, in this situation it is also very likely that both factors interact with each other when bound to DNA in different regions, leading to looping of the chromatin. Furthermore, such interactions can be mediated by other co-factors. Given that further research is needed to prove tethering, in the revised version of the manuscript we only suggest that it is possible. Thus, the title of the manuscript was changed.</p><p>We have already proposed in the first version of the manuscript that HSF1 may only be a part of the “looping” machinery and other components in the same anchoring center are also possible. Currently, new information was added to the revised discussion:</p><p>“According to the data from ENCODE, the HSF1 binding sites may coincide with NR2F2, JUND, FOSL2, CEBPB, GATA3, MAX, HDAC2, etc. It is consistent with the finding that transcription factor binding in human cells occurs in dense clusters (Yan et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Analysis of data: A strength of this manuscript is the use of RNA-seq to examine the effect of HSF1 loss on the estrogen-regulated transcriptional program in MCF7 cells. However, the data presentation is unnecessarily complicated (Figure 1A). Moreover, data presented as fold change E2/Ctr (Figure 2B, 2C and 2E) can be misleading and should be avoided in this case, because HSF1 KO appears to have gene-specific effects on estrogen-deprived cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the remark concerns old Figure 2A (Figure 1A was a western blot). Indeed, this figure mainly showed differences between models and could be confusing. Figures2B, C, and F showed normalized read counts (row z-score in B, C), Figure 2E showed fold changes, while Figure 2F was intended to show the normalized expression levels before and after E2 treatment. In the revised manuscript, we performed additional RNA-seq analyses of cells that were initially used for validation yet finally appeared as the most relevant/representative model. Therefore, for the simplicity of the RNA-seq data presentation, we focused in the main manuscript on the results from this new experimental model. These new data are presented in the revised Figure 2, while data from other models are presented as supplementary data (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1). All experimental models are included to illustrate the common and specific effects for each one (each generates different side effects). In the revised Figure 2A, we showed differences in the response to estrogen treatment in HSF1+ and HSF1− cells (the Venn diagram). Then, we selected only these genes, which were responding to E2 in all our experimental models similarly, and showed the changes in the expression on the heatmap with hierarchical clustering and combined diagram with fold change and normalized expression levels (other panels of the revised Figure 2). Hence, the presentation of data was simplified in the revised manuscript as much as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The MGAT3/FOS/CYP24A1 expression profile, where HSF1 loss reduces gene expression with and without estrogen stimulation (Figure 2F), supports a role of HSF1 as an ER collaborator or cooperative factor. In contrast, the predominant expression profile, which is exhibited by GREB1/PGR/KDM4B, where HSF1 loss enhances gene expression in estrogen-deprived cells (Figure 2F), supports an inhibitory role for HSF1 under estrogen-deprived conditions, which undermines the role of HSF1 as a cooperative tethering factor for ER at these estrogen-induced genes. Together, these findings are interesting, but do not show conclusively that the efficacy or potency of E2 is reduced in HSF1-deficient cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We propose that the regulation of ERα pathway by HSF1 takes place at two levels: through HSF1dependent chaperones, which are important for the proper ERα action, and at the level of chromatin organization, which may be influenced by other factors (differently in individual cells), thus the final result (effect on transcription of a specific gene in an individual cell) could be difficult to predict. Analyzes of the presence of HSE and ERE motifs in HSF1 and ERα ChIP-seq peaks and ChIA-PET reads showed that both cobinding and tethering (or interactions of both factors directly binding to DNA in distinct regions) are possible. However, other gene-specific cofactors may interact with both transcription factors in unstimulated and estrogen-stimulated cells and they may be modified differently. In the revised manuscript, we additionally compared the changes after E2 treatment in HSF1+ and HSF1− MCF7 cells created using the DNA-free CRISPR/Cas9 method. Analyzes showed again that transcriptional response to E2 was lower in HSF1− cells. This can not be simply explained by the lower level of ERα in HSF1− cells and approximately 27% of genes similarly regulated in both cell variants responded stronger (fold change) in HSF1− cells. Importantly, the response is genespecific and different modes of regulation are observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The authors examined the effect of HSF1 KO on the ER-HSP90 interaction using PLA. The authors show conclusively that HSF1 loss enhanced the ER-HSP90 interaction (Figure 4). This finding is novel and compelling, but evidence that HSP90 contributes to the HSF1 KO phenotypes was not presented, which is a major weakness in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to show the above mentioned results, although they do not fit the simplest model that could be expected in the case of HSF1-deficient cells. Hence, we propose that the activity of ERα in these cells may also be influenced by other HSF1-dependent factors (yet unidentified), different then HSP90. This topic requires further research, which, in our opinion, was beyond the scope of this manuscript. HSP90 comprises 1–2% of the total cellular protein in unstressed mammalian cells and several hundred of HSP90 client substrates are estimated (Sanchez, 2012). Therefore, inhibition of HSP90 chaperone function results in the repression of cell growth and apoptosis in cancer cells, which is mediated by different HSP90 client proteins. Also, the ERα level was affected by HSP90 inhibitors (Fliss et al., 2000); (Nonclercq et al., 2004); (Fiskus et al., 2007); (Wong and Chen, 2009). Further experiments that could demonstrate how HSP90 contributes to HSF1-deficient phenotypes should be carefully planned to distinguish between effects mediated by ERα and other client proteins. Therefore, at the moment we cannot propose any meaningful experiments that could be completed within the time given for the revision. Hence, we decided to move Figure 4 to the supplement (Figure 3—figure supplement 2; also to provide a space for additional new Figures).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The authors used ChIP-seq to compare ER and HSF1 binding sites across the MCF7 cell genome. ER and HSF1 binding sites show &lt; 3% overlap in estrogen-deprived cells, with about 4-fold more overlapping binding sites observed upon E2-stimulation (Figure 5A, 5B), which indicates that both factors generally bind DNA independently, with some cooperative binding where ER recruitment was increased. Comparing ChIP-seq recruitment data with ChIA-PET interaction data, suggests interaction between some distinct overlapping and non-overlapping HSF1 and ER binding sites (Figure 5D). It is not clear exactly how prevalent these long-range interactions are across the genome.

Can the authors clarify these findings into a cogent model?</p></disp-quote><p>In our opinion, HSF1 modulates the estrogenic response and the action of ERα, but it is not a critical factor (see the response to point 6 for detail). HSF1 works on two levels: indirectly, through the HSF1-regulated genes (e.g. HSP90), and directly through the influence on the organization of chromatin, which is mainly emphasized in our work. Some long-range interactions occur in HSF1deficient cells since they can be mediated by other proteins (3C is showing only connections between genomic loci regardless of which proteins are involved in them). According to the data from ENCODE, the HSF1 binding sites may coincide with NR2F2, JUND, FOSL2, CEBPB, GATA3, MAX, HDAC2, etc. It is consistent with the finding that transcription factor binding in human cells occurs in dense clusters (Yan et al., 2013). To clarify these findings we initially planned to conduct additional experiments – ChIP-3C using anti-HSF1 and anti-ERα Abs in MCF7 and T47D cells, both HSF1-proficient and HSF1deficient. However, within the time given for the revision, these new experiments were not concluded due to several technical problems. Nevertheless, by re-analyzing the presence of HSE and ERE in HSF1 and the revision ChIP-seq peaks or ChIA-PET reads, we provided a model of possible interactions shown in the new Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

High HSF1 expression is associated with mortality in ER+ breast cancer (PMID: 22042860, 27713164). Prognostic impact of HSF1 expression on ER- cases was not obvious (PMID: 27713164). Here, the authors analyzed the TCGA database for prognostic value of ER and HSF1 mRNA and suggest that ER- cases with high HSF1 mRNA levels have the poorest outcome (Figure 6D), suggesting an ER-independent role for HSF1 in breast cancer. However, this conclusion is probably a biased reflection of the prognostic difference between basal and luminal breast cancer subtypes (Figure 6C) (PMID: 26693050). Moreover, how this finding supports a HSF1 role as a cooperative or tethering factor for ER is not clear, and the prognostic value of HSF1 mRNA levels in ER+ breast cancer was not obvious from the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Inconsistent data regarding the prognostic role of HSF1 are present in the available literature and databases, which are discussed below. Moreover, the presentation of own results was improved in the revised manuscript, as abbreviated below.</p><p>Our analyses (shown in revised Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and analyses of TCGA data available in the Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000185122-HSF1/pathology/breast+cancer https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000091831-ESR1/pathology/breast+cancer) indicate that neither HSF1 nor ERα are prognostic in breast cancer when there is no pre-selection of patients. A similar analysis performed using Kaplan-Meier Plotter, Pan-cancer RNA-seq, confirmed these results (https://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&amp;cancer=pancancer_rnaseq). On the other hand, however, the better prognosis of breast cancer patients with high ESR1 levels (logrank p &lt; 1E-16) or low HSF1 levels (p = 0.00089) is visible in Kaplan-Meier Plotter, Breast Cancer analyses based on Affymetrix gene chip (in the case of HSF1, only when Auto select best cutoff is used to split patients) (https://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&amp;cancer=breast#).</p><p>Importantly, however, HSF1 and ERα may have prognostic value when TCGA dataset analyses are restricted to selected subtypes. For example, high <italic>HSF1</italic> level is connected with better prognosis in stage 1 (logrank p = 0.021), white race (p = 0.049), and Asian race (p = 0.016), while with worse prognosis in stage 3 (p = 0.05), stage 4 (p = 0.0043), grade 1 (p = 0.021), grade 2 (p = 0.013), and African American race (p = 0.0075). High <italic>ESR1</italic> level is connected with with better prognosis in stage 3 (logrank p = 0.015), stage 4 (p = 0.022), grade 1 (p = 0.02), grade 2 (p = 1.3e-05), grade 3 (p = 0.042), African American race (p = 0.0098), and Asian race (p = 1e-04), while with worse prognosis in stage 1 (p = 0.013), and white race (p = 0.034). In our selected groups caucasians (white race) predominates. On the other hand, caucasians are more likely to be diagnosed with luminal A, while African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with basal-like.</p><p>To delineate the clinical and prognostic significance of HSF1 in breast cancer two analyses have been performed so far, by (Santagata et al., 2011) and (Gökmen-Polar and Badve, 2016)(mentioned by the reviewer and discussed in our manuscript). In the paper by Santagata et al., the association of nuclear HSF1 status (high vs low, detected by IHC) with clinical parameters and survival outcomes in 1,841 breast cancer patients (diagnosed between 1976 and 1996) were investigated. They revealed a significant correlation between high HSF1 levels and mortality of ERpositive patients (1416 cases) but not ER-negative ones ( triple-negative 267 cases, HER+ 193 cases). However, in the other study performed on samples from patients with ER-positive tumors, only a weak association was found between the HSF1 protein expression and poor prognosis (GökmenPolar and Badve, 2016). Studies by Sanatagata et al., and Gokmen-Polar and Badve showed a significant correlation between <italic>HSF1</italic> transcript levels and the survival in ER-positive breast cancer patients. However, in the paper of Satagata et al., data from (van de Vijver et al., 2002) were utilized. In that study, patients were preselected to have a good or bad prognosis to better evaluate the predictive power of the prognosis profile: patients (295 cases) with primary breast carcinomas as having a gene-expression signature associated with either a poor prognosis or a good prognosis were chosen. All patients had stage I or II breast cancer and were younger than 53 years old; 151 had lymph-node-negative disease, and 144 had lymph-node-positive disease. Thus, they are not representative of all breast cancers. Gokmen-Polar and Badve analyzed publicly available Affymetrix U133A gene expression data, thus a bit earlier than those available in TCGA. Our results based on the TCGA cohort are different from those previously published. At the moment, we can only speculate on the cause. Generally, different sets of patients were compared. We should keep in mind that early screening tests and new treatments have improved the survival rate of breast cancer in women (Iwase et al., 2021) and this may be one of the reasons for the difference between these cohorts. Especially HER2-positive cancers have a much better prognosis nowadays.</p><p>We are aware that in our selected ER+/− groups, differences in survival may simply reflect the prognostic difference between breast cancer subtypes. In our analysis, we excluded cases with moderate HSF1 and ERα levels and compared only the most divergent groups to better see the possible effect of HSF1 and ERα on the transcriptome. Such selection enabled us to reveal a statistically significant difference in survival between ER+ and ER− patients as well as HSF1+ and HSF1− (the effect was not observed when all TCGA cases were analyzed). However, the effect of HSF1 was poorly visible in each ER group (but slightly separated ER− cases, regardless of the size of the analyzed groups, see Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B, C). Significantly, luminal A cases were dominant in our HSF1<sup>low</sup>/ER+ group. Increased expression of HSF1 was connected with the enrichment of the ER+ group with luminal B cases, known to have a slightly worse prognosis than luminal A. Analyzes of the survival probability in the reduced (selected) groups (defined in Figure 7B) containing only basal-like or luminal A cancers showed that high levels of HSF1 may worsen the prognosis of ER-negative patients but not of luminal A (revised Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). Nonetheless, experimental data (e.g. HSF1 impact on cell migration or response to anti-cancer treatments) supports the idea that HSF1 may influence the probability of survival.</p><p>We also analyzed pre/postmenopausal breast cancers for survival probability, obtaining different results depending on ER+ and ER− inclusion criteria. However, we do not have clear conclusions from these analyzes because there is a lack of important information about the patient's condition that may have an impact on survival (among others obesity, contraceptive or hormone replacement therapies, etc.). Considering that the HSF1-dependent survival rate may be multivariable, in the revised manuscript we focused on other aspects of HSF1 action in breast cancer that were documented in new set of data. Thus, the subtitle “The combined expression level of ESR1 and HSF1 can be used to predict the survival of breast cancer patients” was changed to: “Metastatic and nonmetastatic breast cancers differ in the level of HSF1 only in the ER+ group”. The abstract also was changed accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. With regard to their conclusion that HSF1 increases the diversity of the transcriptome in ER-positive breast cancers, the rationale for this analysis is unclear, and the idea that HSF1 affects ER-target genes has already been demonstrated in the KO model using RNA-seq (Figure 2).</p></disp-quote><p>This is true, but using patient/cancer-derived data we wanted to support the results obtained in the cellular model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Stylistic changes are needed: Much of the text in the figures are too small to read. It was hard to tell the differences between the A, B, C, D groups and the a, b, c, d groups in figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>The initial idea was about maintaining connections between initial and reduced patient groups (patients from group “A” were selected to group “a”, etc.) and avoiding typing the full description of the groups each time, which appeared confusing. Hence, the group description was changed in the revised figure: initial groups are numbered from I to IV and reduced groups are marked with superscript R (I<sup>R</sup> to IV<sup>R</sup>). In the revision, figures are uploaded separately (not embedded in the text), thus we believe that their quality and readability are better.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. In figure 5, they authors should be subsampling the &quot;all&quot; groups to the same number as the smaller groups to see if the distributions are the same.</p><p>15. Figures 5A and 5B are trying to show information for the HSF1 and ESR1 overlapping peaks. However, for that data to be useful we need to understand non-overlapping peak data. Also, is the figure showing tags from ESR1 ChIP-seq or HSF1 ChIP-seq?</p><p>16. Important concern: The authors should be using statistical tests to see if overlap in data sets are above random chance.</p></disp-quote><p>Points 14-16. In the revised manuscript we tested the distributions of ERα and HSF1 ChIP-seq peaks using Jaccard bedtool as well as peakPermTest function from the ChIPpeakAnno tool, which revealed that there is a significant overlap between two sets of peaks. The revised manuscript was supplemented with this information (see the response to Main Concerns 3 and 4 for detail). Also, we included the Venn diagram in the relevant figure (revised Figure 4B) showing better overlapping and nonoverlapping peak data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. The authors generated HSF-1 knockouts for MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells. However, the vast majority of their work was performed with only the T47D cells. These cell lines show different dependencies on ERα and antiestrogen differently affect receptor stability between them. More work should have been done outside of one knockdown and proliferation experiment to show that HSF-1 is important in both cell lines. It would give credence to its role in breast cancer cells beyond MCF7 cells.</p><p>18. The authors used an aldefluor assay to show that HSF-1 affects stem-progenitor populations. They did not show any additional data for this line of inquiry. If this phenotype is affected by HSF-1 they should examine EMT signatures along with cellular invasion, and migration.</p></disp-quote><p>Points 17-18. In the revised manuscript, we showed additional data documenting the effect of HSF1 on the phenotype of both MCF7 and T47D cells (revised Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, and Figure 1—figure supplement 2). In addition to the proliferation and clonogenic assay, we showed results from estrogen-stimulated migration in the Boyden chamber, cell adhesion, and morphology. For simplicity, we decided to show in the main manuscript only the results from the HSF1-deficient MCF7 model obtained with the DNA-free CRISPR/Cas9 system, which appeared the most relevant and representative (revised Figure 1). The same functional tests performed on other models are shown in the revised supplement (revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>HSF1 deficiency in MCF7 cells may result in a slight reduction in the proliferation rate under standard conditions. Unlike MCF7 cells, HSF1-deficient T47D cells grew slightly faster than HSF1proficient cells. T47D cells harbor a p53 missense mutation (L194F). Although p53 mutations were found in approximately 5% of all breast cancer cases, L194F mutation is only present in 0.38% of cases (TCGA data), so we believe that the results obtained on this line, while valuable, are less representative. L194F mutation causes p53 stabilization (Lim et al., 2009) and generally T47D cells differ from MCF7 cells in response to estrogen (lower level of ERα in T47D; (Vydra et al., 2019)). Also, the mutant p53 exhibits gain-of-function activities in mediating cell survival of T47D cells. This is likely the reason for the differences in proliferation between cells.</p><p>Both cell lines (T47D and MCF7) also respond differently to prolonged estrogen treatment, especially in acquired cell morphology: amoeboid-like morphology was dominant among the scattered MCF7 cells, while mesenchymal-like morphology was dominant in T47D cells. HSF1 deficiency resulted in inhibition of estrogen-mediated cell migration (as assessed by Boyden assay), but this effect was more pronounced in MCF7 cells. However, the differences in EMT markers were not documented in these cell lines. Results of in vitro analysis that showed an effect of HSF1 on E2stimulated cell migration prompted us to analyze the TCGA data for <italic>HSF1</italic> expression and the presence of metastases at diagnosis. We found that an elevated HSF1 expression correlated with the occurrence of metastatic disease only in ER-positive breast cancer patients (revised Figure 6F-H and Figure 6—figure supplement 2), which suggests that HSF1 in cooperation with ERα may facilitate metastasis formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. Therapeutic approaches to targeting ERα were not discussed in this manuscript. However, the role of HSF-1 in the therapeutic response to antiestrogens would be of great importance to the field. Showing the impact of HSF-1 knockdown to ERα transcriptional activity and cellular proliferation in the presence of clinically important hormone therapies fulvestrant and 4-hydroxytamoxifen as well as CDK4/6 inhibitors like palbociclib would greatly enhance the impact of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, which prompted us to perform additional experiments related to the role of HSF1. A significant association between high HSF1 expression and increased mortality among the ER-positive breast cancer patients receiving hormonal therapy was first noticed by Santagata et al., 2011, then confirmed by (Gokmen-Polar and Badve, 2016). Recently, it has been shown that overexpression of HSF1 induces resistance to antiestrogens (tamoxifen, fulvestrant) in MCF7 cells (Silveira et al., 2021). Our new results (included in the revised manuscript) also showed that the response to hydroxytamoxifen is better in HSF1− than in HSF1+ cells, although the HSF1− knockout itself has a different effect on the growth of MCF7 and T47D cells (revised Figure 8). Palbociclib is a relatively new therapeutic option and the effect of HSF1 on its effectiveness has not yet been investigated. We found that HSF1 functional knockout was connected with higher sensitivity to palbociclib but this effect was better visible in MCF7 than T47D cells (which generally were more resistant to palbociclib than MCF7 cells). These results suggest that ER-positive breast tumors with low HSF1 expression may be more sensitive to treatment with 4-OHT and palbociclib than cases with high HSF1 levels.</p></body></sub-article></article>
