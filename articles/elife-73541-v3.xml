seizures in patients with epilepsy. Although they occur far more often than seizures, IEDs are less studied, and their relationship to seizures remains unclear. To better understand this relationship, we examined multi-day recordings of microelectrode arrays implanted in human epilepsy patients, allowing us to precisely observe the spatiotemporal propagation of IEDs, spontaneous seizures, and how they relate. These recordings showed that the majority of IEDs are traveling waves, traversing the same path as ictal discharges during seizures, and with a fixed direction relative to seizure propagation. Moreover, the majority of IEDs, like ictal discharges, were bidirectional, with one predominant and a second, less frequent antipodal direction. These results reveal a fundamental spatiotemporal similarity between IEDs and ictal discharges. These results also imply that most IEDs arise in brain tissue outside the site of seizure onset and propagate toward it, indicating that the propagation of IEDs provides useful information for localizing the seizure focus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>interictal epileptiform discharges</kwd><kwd>seizures</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>neurons</kwd><kwd>field potentials</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NINDS R21 NS113031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Elliot H</given-names></name><name><surname>Schevon</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Rolston</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NINDS K23 NS114178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rolston</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 OD018211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schevon</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS084142</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schevon</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001454</institution-id><institution>American Epilepsy Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JIA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Elliot H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Large bursts of brain activity in patients with epilepsy are geometrically related to seizure propagation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>While seizures are mostly unpredictable and rare, electrical recordings from people with epilepsy often show isolated epileptiform discharges between seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alarcon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jefferys and Avoli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tatum et al., 2016</xref>). These IEDs are far more frequent, occurring up to several times per minute, and exhibit multidien variation in their frequency that correlates with seizure likelihood, making IEDs an attractive personalized biomarker for seizure risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baud et al., 2018</xref>). Beyond such temporal information about seizure occurrence, there is some evidence for overlap between cortical areas where seizures originate and those with more IEDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alarcon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conrad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marsh et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, some retrospective studies showed that removing brain areas with more IEDs improved surgical outcomes in patients with medically refractory epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smart et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these findings, the long-debated relationship between IEDs and seizure generating tissue remains unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jefferys and Avoli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paolicchi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tonini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vakharia et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Microelectrode array recordings in epilepsy patients have revealed the spatiotemporal features of ictal self-organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eissa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martinet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schevon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). These studies reported two classes of recordings, one in which neuronal firing is recruited into the ongoing seizure, and another in which neuronal firing is relatively unaffected, despite seizure-like field potentials appearing on the same microelectrodes. These classes correspond to two dynamically evolving regions known as the ictal <italic>core</italic> and <italic>penumbra</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schevon et al., 2012</xref>). A slowly-propagating, narrow band of tonic action potential firing, the ictal wavefront (IW), delineates the transition between the core and penumbra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martinet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schevon et al., 2012</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trevelyan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trevelyan et al., 2007</xref>). These dynamic seizure regions exhibit distinct spatial features. The slowly traveling IW repetitively emits rapidly traveling ictal discharges backwards, toward the seizure core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref>). These discharges occur following the passage of the ictal wavefront and have thus been termed âpost-recruitmentâ discharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). In some patients, earlier ictal discharges, termed âpre-recruitmentâ, are also emitted outward, toward the penumbra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martinet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). To avoid confusion between ictal discharges and interictal discharges, we will from here on refer to ictal discharges as seizure discharges (SDs).</p><p>The discovery of these spatiotemporal features of human seizure activity inspired a computational model designed to explain the neuronal underpinnings of seizure dynamics from biophysical principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liou et al., 2020</xref>). After several induced seizures in this model, the network produces spontaneous seizures and IEDs with spatiotemporal dynamics. One prediction of the model is that the repeated barrages of traveling synaptic activity during SDs eventually coopt mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, biasing local tissue to propagate IEDs in similar directions as SDs, that is in the opposite direction of the slow propagation of seizure expansion. In this study we test the resultant hypothesis that IEDs have a predominant direction of propagation, towards the site of seizure onset; opposite the direction of seizure expansion. We found that the data supported this hypothesis, and further, that in the majority of participants, IEDs traveled bimodally on a linear axis with predominant and auxiliary sub-distributions whose directions, speeds, and proportions echoing those of SDs. Finally, we directly quantified the extent to which IED directions could be used to predict SD directions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IED detection in human microelectrode array recordings</title><p>To examine the spatiotemporal propagation of IEDs, we used a multi-institutional dataset of Utah-style microelectrode array (UEA; 10 Ã 10 microelectrodes in 4 Ã 4 mm grid, penetrating 1 mm) recordings from 10 epilepsy patients (two female, Âµ Â±Ï age: 29 Â± 5.24 years) undergoing monitoring for neurosurgical treatment of medically refractory epilepsy (clinical details in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1âtable 1</xref>). In order to capture seizures (2.2 Â± 1.6 seizures recorded per participant; 22 total), we recorded data continuously throughout the patientsâ monitoring periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; 4.3 Â± 2.4 days per participant; 43 total). Searching through weeksâ worth of microelectrode data, we detected 45,623 candidate IEDs across the 10 participants (4562.3 Â± 5171.7 per participant) using an IED detection algorithm designed for microelectrode recordings, that operated on features of IEDs based on the American Clinical Neurophysiological Societyâs definition, namely high-amplitude bursts of beta-range (20â40 Hz) local field potential (LFP) power occurring across multiple microelectrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>; Appendix1 - algorithm 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tatum et al., 2016</xref>). We evaluated the positive predictive value of the algorithm against the ratings of two clinician experts yielding a Âµ Â±Ï precision of 0.86 Â± 0.04. Interrater reliability (Cohenâs Kappa) was 44.9%, which is similar to that reported across a large multicenter study of IED ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jing et al., 2020</xref>). Interrater reliability between the algorithm and board-certified neurologist was 61.1%. Using this algorithm, we detected an average of 0.43 Â± 0.51 IEDs per minute. The UEA enabled us to record both LFP data and multiunit action potential firing (MUA) across high-density spatial grid during each IED.

IEDs with regression slopes that were significantly different from zero were classified as traveling waves (permutation test against a distribution of 1000 spatially permuted timings; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Traveling wave speeds and directions were then derived from each significant modelâs slope. Based on this operational definition, 30,278 IEDs (3027.8 Â± 3190.0 per participant) were classified as traveling waves (66.4%).

However, neither firing rates nor IED waveforms differed between IED sub-distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CâD</xref>; cluster-based permutation tests, all p &gt; 0.05), indicating that neither IED waveforms nor firing rates between the two sub-distributions could be statistically distinguished.</p><p>Differences between speeds and proportions of IED sub-distributions, corresponding to those we previously showed in SD sub-distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>), would support a learned relationship between IEDs and SDs, as predicted by the centripetal pattern of learning in the theoretical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liou et al., 2020</xref>). To address this question, we tested for differences in speed and relative size of SD and IED sub-distributions. Speeds were significantly different between IED sub-distributions within each participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; Mann-Whitney U, all p &lt; 10<sup>â4</sup>).

More pre-recruitment discharges occurred in a fifth patient with nearly equivalent proportions of IEDs across sub-distributions. Importantly, the directions of significant differences in these spatial features corresponded across IED and SD sub-distributions.

It is likely that the frequent barrages of coordinated activity seen during seizuresâSDsâpotentiate propagation pathways through neocortex that are revisited during IEDs. This conclusion is corroborated by the predictions of our theoretical work, where a computational model incorporating spike-timing dependent plasticity and realistic connectivity between inhibitory and excitatory cells self-organized to produce IWs, SDs, and IEDs that echo through the pathways potentiated by the strong, repeated barrages of SD activity, antipodal to the IW direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that IEDs originate from tissue immediately eccentric to the seizure core and propagate inwardly across the seizure onset zone, indicating their potential use for localizing the seizure source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic of how IEDs relate to ictal self-organization.</title><p>A schematic of spatial features of ictal self-organization is shown on the left.

The bidirectional propagation of IEDs is similar to the bidirectional traveling waves we have previously observed during seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). The bidirectional pattern of traveling waves during seizures emanated from a slowly expanding, motile source of ictal activityâthe IWâpassing through a fixed recording site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). The data presented here show that IEDs travel in similarly oriented, bimodal distributions, even in the absence of an IW or ictal self-organization.</p><p>The IED directions we report are not perfectly antipodal to the IW. These differences in mean angles may be due in part to error when fitting a plane to the IW, which discounts the propagating waveâs curvature, or biological variability, such as changes in brain state and arousal. Furthermore, much of the deviation in the summary statistics is driven by one participant (P3). Rigorous statistical analysis of cluster bimodality, the resulting mean angles from that analysis, and KLD between IEDs and SDs all support the major result of the paper, that IEDs and SDs travel bidirectionally along a similar path. The dominant direction of travel is largely in the opposite direction of seizure expansion.</p><p>The theoretical model predicted that the directional preferences of IEDs were learned from SDs via spike-timing dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>). While we cannot address the specific learning mechanism with this dataset, in participants whose UEAs were recruited into the seizure core from adjacent cortical tissue, we showed correspondences between several spatial properties of IEDs and SDs. The speeds, directions, and relative sizes of IED sub-distributions echoed those of SDs. Moreover, predominant IED and SD directions opposed the directions of the ictal wavefronts in ârecruitedâ UEAs. These relationships were unable to be determined from UEAs that were not recruited into the seizure core (âpenumbralâ recordings). Together, these results suggest that spatiotemporal biases exist in epileptic tissue. Whether spatiotemporal biases in IEDs arise from learning during SDs or vice versa remains to be determined. While the theoretical model indicates that several seizures must occur before IEDs begin to form, electrographic discharges, similar to IEDs, often appear before seizures in animal models of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Staley et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>While we show that the majority of IEDs are traveling waves whose directions overlap with those of SDs, it is important to recognize the small spatial scale of the recordings analyzed here. Beyond the small area of brain we recorded from, there is some sampling bias inherent in these recordings, as we sought to place the microelectrode arrays as close to the site of seizure onset as possible, and within the area of resection. Additional, more eccentric populations of IEDs could be propagating from distant areas that are connected to the seizure onset zone, though not necessarily from adjacent tissue on the cortical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gelinas et al., 2016</xref>). Higher density ECoG that spans a larger cortical territory than the UEA would be useful in gaining more context on where IEDs arise, and how IEDs propagate across the cortical surface. On the other hand, there is currently no evidence that the ictal wavefront can be detected without action potential recordings, though the time of seizure recruitment can be roughly estimated on each ECoG electrode from high-frequency LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weiss et al., 2013</xref>). Precise IED propagation patterns are also difficult to measure with the relatively low sampling density of ECoG, and minor shifts in the relative orientation of the ECoG grid and microelectrode array could impugn the accuracy of comparing traveling wave directions between the two modalities. Animal studies using calcium indicators capable of imaging neuronal activity across large cortical territories may overcome these limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wenzel et al., 2017</xref>). Such animal studies are also poised to understand how learning and plasticity contributes to the geometric relationships reported here.</p><p>While these MEA recordings inform fundamental geometric relationships between IED propagation and ictal self-organization, several MEAs flanking the seizure onset zone may be required to accurately triangulate the SOZ from traveling wave directions. Additional spatial context may also inform our understanding of âpenumbralâ tissue and its relevant spatial biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). Future work will therefore focus on translating these microelectrode array results to a more clinically relevant spatial scale. For example, using ECoG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khodagholy et al., 2015</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khodagholy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Viventi et al., 2011</xref>) with vector field or convolutional methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muller et al., 2016</xref>), or examining propagation of source-localized IEDs in stereo-EEG along white matter tracts. Such approaches will be useful for linking the micro results reported in this paper to the coarser spatial resolutions and broader coverages encountered with typical intracranial recordings. Recordings with a broader spatial scale could also inform how IEDs propagate in a larger epileptic network, including patients whose seizures have a common onset site: the mesial temporal lobe (MTL). Three of the participants in this study (P1, P2, and P3) were classified as having MTL seizure onsets from their clinical reports, yet still exhibited similar IED and SD traveling wave dynamics. Despite MTL onsets, these patientsâ seizures spread to the lateral temporal cortex, and eventually to the microelectrode array site in all three cases. We would speculate that this lateral seizure spread in neocortex could establish similar spatiotemporal biases to those in the other patients, yet a more widespread recording technology with higher resolution than ECoG may be required to full reveal the dynamics of MTL to neocortex seizure spread. It is noteworthy that two of these patients had larger differences between median IED and SD direction distributions than the others. Integrating these multi-scale geometrical understandings of how IEDs relate to the seizure onset zone could then provide an additional piece of information to inform diagnosis and treatment of medically refractory epilepsy, and potentially enable localizing the seizure source without having to directly observe seizures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR:001662</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">â</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NPMK</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/BlackrockNeurotech/NPMK">https://github.com/BlackrockNeurotech/NPMK</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Torab, 2014</xref>)<break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">â</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IED analysis code</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elliothsmith/IEDs">https://github.com/elliothsmith/IEDs</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith, 2022</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">â</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Circular statistics toollbox</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/circstat/circstat-matlab">https://github.com/circstat/circstat-matlab</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berens et al., 2019</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">â</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">fitmvmdist</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/chrschy/mvmdist">https://github.com/chrschy/mvmdist</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">â</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">hrtest</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cnuahs/hermans-rasson">https://github.com/cnuahs/hermans-rasson</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cloherty, 2020</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">â</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants, ethics statement, and data</title><p>The data for this study were acquired from Utah-style microelectrode arrays (UEAs) that were implanted in 10 human patients across two surgical sites who were undergoing neurophysiological monitoring for surgical treatment for medically refractory seizures.

For each channel on each UEA, we first resampled the data at 400 samples per second and zero-phase filtered the data between 20 and 40 Hz using a fourth-order Butterworth filter. We then detected any peaks in the absolute amplitude of this signal that were greater than eight times the standard deviation of the remainder of the recording segment (2-hr median duration; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). In order to remove redundant detections, those following any other detection by less than 250ms were discarded. Only detections that occurred within the same 250ms window across at least 10 electrodes on the UEA were retained for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>).

Algorithmic positive predictive value (precision) was defined as the ratio of the number of true positive detections to the number of total positive detections. Cohenâs Kappa was also calculated to evaluate inter-rater reliability against chance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Traveling wave measurement</title><p>In order to measure IED traveling wave speed and direction, we fit a plane to the timings of IED voltage minima, and MUA event times, using ordinary multilinear regression, regularized via the absolute deviation of the signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). This methodology is described in detail and validated for measuring traveling waves during ictal discharges in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liou et al., 2017</xref>. Briefly, the regression model for each IED yielded three coefficients, describing the best-fit plane to the timing of IEDs across the UEA in spacetime. Traveling wave direction was determined by the gradient direction of the plane and speed was defined as the inverse of that gradient norm. Each IED was operationally defined as a traveling wave if its model significantly deviated from a plane with zero slope. Statistical significance for this measure was determined by a permutation test in which the model was reevaluated 1,000 times with the microelectrode spatial locations randomly permuted. Differences in IED speed across and within participants were tested using a two-way Kruskal-Wallis Test with a participant factor (10 levels; one for each participant) and a signal factor in which the two levels were the speed measurements derived from LFP and MUA. Only MUA times from 50ms before and after the median time of the LFP negative peak were included in the regression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liou et al., 2017</xref>). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were carried out using Dunnâs test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunn, 1964</xref>).

Î¼ and 1/Îº are analogous to the mean and variance parameters that define a standard normal distribution. Directional statistics were carried out using modified functions from the circular statistics toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berens, 2009</xref>). These modifications were such that statistical significance was evaluated using permutation tests from which p-values were derived by comparing the circular test statistic with a distribution of circular test statistics from 1000 permuted datasets. As an example, testing for differences between IED and SD means would involve comparing the test statistic from the true data to a distribution of 1000 test statistics in which the measurement categories were permuted. The significance criterion was chosen to be 0.05. Hypotheses that within-participant IED propagation directions were non-uniform, were tested with Hermans-Rasson tests of circular non-uniformity, again with 1000 permutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Landler et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Bimodality and sub-distributions</title><p>In order to determine whether two, unimodal distributions better fit the ostensibly bimodal IED and SD distributions we observed, we first fit von Mises Mixture (vMM) Models to overall distributions of IED and SD directions using the Matlab function <italic>fitmvmdist</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/chrschy/mvmdist">https://github.com/chrschy/mvmdist</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schymura, 2016</xref>).

We repeated this procedure 1,000 times in order to create a permutation distribution. In this way, we were able to measure the extent to which randomly sampled IED angles deviated from theoretical circular distributions defined by the overall and vMM parameters. This is akin to cross-validating vM parameters and choosing <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> corresponding to the highest log-likelihood, yet in a model-free way. Comparing Kuiper test statistics to a permutation distribution, rather than zero (the null hypothesis of a uniform distribution), makes the tests more conservative and allows us to determine whether the distribution cannot be determined to be non-normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Louter and Koerts, 1970</xref>). We then defined our circular bimodality index as the minimum difference between the Kuiper test statistic for the overall distribution and each vMM sub-distribution. Positive bimodality indices thus indicated that overall traveling wave distributions were better modeled as two vMM sub-distributions, and negative bimodality indices indicated that overall traveling distributions were better modeled as a single von Mises distribution.

These measures have also been described in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schevon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). The ictal wavefront (IW) is the slowly expanding edge of the seizure representing the spatial signature of failure of feedforward inhibition, and therefore defines recruitment of the tissue surrounding an electrode into the ictal core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schevon et al., 2012</xref>). This biomarker of seizure recruitment and expansion has thus far only been detected with recordings of multiunit firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>), although can also be detected on single microelectrodes by observing widening of action potential waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Merricks et al., 2015</xref>). We followed methods from our previous manuscripts to generate multiunit firing rates, that is filtering the broadband data between 300 and 3000 Hz and detecting any peaks larger than the median absolute value of the signal divided by 0.6745 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Quiroga et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>To find seizures, we examined time periods in the microelectrode array recordings that corresponded to the seizure times reported in the clinical monitoring reports and confirmed that the microelectrode array LFP exhibited the characteristic high amplitude, rhythmic discharging associated with seizures. We then looked for tonic multiunit firing spreading across the array that would suggest the presence of an ictal wavefront, and phase locked multiunit bursting associated with ictal discharges. We detected the ictal wavefront feature of seizures by smoothing the firing rates on each microelectrode with a 250 ms Gaussian kernel and fitting a multilinear regression model to the peaks of these slow firing rate estimates across the UEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). We detected ictal discharges by detecting peaks in multiunit firing rates, calculated with a 25 ms Gaussian kernel, as we have previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). We quantified the propagation direction and speed of ictal discharges using the same methods used to determine IED traveling wave speeds and directions, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liou et al., 2017</xref>. IED speeds and directions were measured in a manner that was blinded to each microelectrode arrayâs recruitment classification. We defined the presence of ictal phase-locked firing with a Hermans-Rasson test of circular uniformity on MUA action potential times across microelectrodes relative to the phase of the mean LFP recorded across the UEA, similarly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schevon et al., 2012</xref>. Using these measures, we operationally defined two patterns of ictal self-organization, based on observed patterns in these fast and slow spatial features of seizures: ârecruitedâ seizures were operationally defined as those with a significant ictal wavefront multilinear regression model and significant phase-locked multiunit firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A-D</xref>). âPenumbralâ seizures were operationally defined as those seizures in which we were unable to detect an ictal wavefront on the microelectrode array (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E-H</xref>). Similar classifications of adjacent and non-adjacent recruitment have been reported by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martinet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schevon et al., 2012</xref>).

For distributions that were determined to be bimodal, we used cluster-based permutation tests to test for differences between median IED waveforms and firing rates between IEDs from the two component vMM distributions for each participant. Permutation tests consisted of carrying out t-tests on each sample in the IED waveforms and each bin in the IED firing rates. The t-statistics for each sample or bin were then compared to permutation distributions of t-statistics for each sample or bin in which the sub-distribution labels were shuffled. If any of these p-values exceeded the specified alpha value of 0.05, we considered that sample significant, and included it with adjacent significant samples in a temporal cluster. In order to control for multiple hypothesis testing, we used cluster-based correction over temporal clusters. This procedure involved finding the largest temporal clusters of significant samples or bins in the permutation distributions and comparing those clusters to the largest temporal clusters of significant samples or bins in the real data.</p><p>In order to test for different directions of overall distributions and sub-distributions of IEDs and SDs, we used Watson-Williams multi-sample tests for equal means. To test for differences in IED speed between different sub-distributions, we used within-participant Mann-Whitney U tests. In order to test differences in the proportion of IEDs from predominant and auxiliary sub-distributions we used two-sample proportion tests. We employed a significance criterion of 0.05 for all of these tests.</p><p>Finally, in order to directly quantify the reduction in uncertainty about the direction of SD travel that can be estimated from observing IED directions, we calculated the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between distributions of IED and SD directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kullback and Leibler, 1951</xref>). We estimated the KLD as the expectation of the logarithmic difference between discrete distributions of IED and SD directions on the half-closed interval between 0 and 2Ï. We interpret the KLD as measuring the information that can be gained about SD directions from observing IED directions. We also tested for whether these KLD values were significantly greater than would be expected by chance by comparing the true KLD values against a distribution of 1000 KLD values generated from directions drawn at random from both IED and SD distributions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to the Schevon and Rolston labs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is affiliated with Neurosurgical Associates, LLC.

Data from human subjects was analyzed, from which the dates of implants can potentially be reconstructed. This is especially true for a study like this one, in which chronic recordings were carried out for the full duration of the patients' hospital stays. Sharing these data widely could therefore expose private health information of participants, which is why a data use agreement is required by the IRB. Interested Researchers should contact Dr. Schevon to get the data use agreement process started with the Columbia University Medical Center IRB.

Could you report on positive predictive values for a random subset of detections?</p><p>2)You write in the abstract and discussion that IEDs traverse the same path as ictal discharges, but the angle between the SDs and IEDs was 24 degrees, and the IEDs weren't exactly opposite the ictal wavefront (150 degrees). Do you think the SDs and IEDs really follow the same path, and if so, what accounts for the sizable angle between their observed paths?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The terminology used to describe the various types of epileptiform activity described in this paper should be laid out in a clear way from the beginning. Although many of the features are defined in prior work, they are critical to understanding the results. Specifically, the introduction of SDs focuses on their propagation following the IW, but &quot;pre-recruitment&quot; SDs are a prominently analyzed group in Figure 5. It would be helpful to include a schematic figure like that at the top left of 6A earlier in the paper. It may also be useful to define two types of SDs (anterograde and retrograde?), and include them on the schematic figure. Perhaps &quot;recruited&quot; and &quot;penumbral&quot; could be illustrated here as well (or in a separate subpanel).</p><p>2. The prominent clinical relevance of the analysis presented in this manuscript is that IEDs could be used to locate the seizure focus in pre-surgical planning. As briefly indicated in the discussion, the UEA is likely too small to localize a seizure focus â it produces one vector, which at best could define the line along which the focus falls. To identify the seizure focus, greater spatial sampling is needed. The authors point out that the simultaneously recorded ECOG is insufficient to measure IW propagation as it cannot detect MUAs and its poor spatial sampling make estimation of IED propagation low-fidelity. Nevertheless, since LFP was used to record IED propagation in the UEA, it would be useful to analyze IED propagation from the ECoG array to compare the vector produced, particularly by neighboring electrodes.</p><p>3. If the ECoG analysis fails to produce a vector that match the UEA vectors, it may be necessary to implant two UEAs. The intersection of the IED propagation vectors would hypothetically localize the seizure focus (in 2D). Obviously this experiment is outside the scope of this study, but worth mentioning in the discussion.</p><p>4. Did the resulting surgical resections in recorded patients align with the axis predicted by the IED propagation at the UEA? Did the success of the surgery relate to the removal (or not) of the UEA-predicted focus?</p><p>5. Synaptic connectivity is probably important determinant of whether vector points to focus. Furthermore, UEA recordings are performed on the cortical surface. In the most straightforward application of the proposed strategy, seizures would start on cortical surface and propagate locally. However, many seizures begin in deep structures. Some discussion of the relationship between neocortical propagation and localization of a deep focus (e.g. MTLE) is warranted.</p><p>6. Were patients weaned from their AEDs during these recordings. One important advantage of analyzing IEDs vs seizures for surgical planning is that they are very common. Thus, it might be possible to perform the mapping in patients without having them in withdrawal from their AEDs, which might improve predictive value.</p><p>7. In Figure 4A-F, for the subjects with multiple seizures, the IED distribution appears to be different for each seizure. What IED distributions are plotted â only those that had occurred up to the time of that seizure? Maybe I missed it, but I couldn't find this info in the results or figure captionâ¦</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The Utah array is an excellent tool to study spatiotemporal dynamics in and around a seizure core. The strength of such a technique is unfortunately also the weakness. Since it is implanted on the cortex, the modeling of IED and seizure discharges has a potential for bias due to the location of the implant. The model can be strengthened by comparing the MUA and LFP of the model with their single-unit data of IEDs from hybrid electrodes of mesial temporal lobe implants. The authors do mention the limitation of their study, but it would help if they discuss this some more, especially since only two patients in Table S1 had mesial temporal onset and the rest were lateral or neocortical onsets. They should not generalize that this model is applicable to all seizure types.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Human interictal epileptiform discharges are bidirectional traveling waves echoing ictal discharges&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The majority of reviewer concerns have been adequately addressed. However, there remain a few points that require clarification or additional submission materials. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this concise list to facilitate your revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Multiple reviewers raised the question regarding &quot;the sizable angle betweenâ¦ SDs and IEDs&quot; and the fact that the &quot;IEDs weren't exactly opposite the ictal wavefront&quot;. You state that &quot;the angle discrepancies to which the reviewer refers are statistically insignificant and can be explained by expected biological variability&quot;. On the other hand you state that based on Smith et al. 2016, you don't expect the IED to be strictly antipodal to IW. Finally, while the KLD analysis is useful it does not seem to fully address the reviewers' questions regarding what appears to be a (statistically) significant deviation (almost 2 standard deviations) of the IED/IW angle from 180 degrees. A single paragraph in the discussion summarizing and clarifying the various points of why SD, IEDs, and IWs may not be strictly aligned or antipodal would improve the manuscript.</p><p>2) Regarding Reviewer 2, major point #7 &quot;In Figure 4A-F, for the subjects with multiple seizures, the IED distribution appears to be different for each seizure. What IED distributions are plotted â only those that had occurred up to the time of that seizure?&quot; The reviewer is asking why the shape of the distribution, and not just the rotation, of IED distribution varies for different seizures in the same patient. Are you analyzing/including a different subset of IEDs for each seizure? If so, why? If not, why does the distribution change?</p><p>3) Regarding Reviewer 2, major point #2, we strongly suggest including the figure showing the &quot;qualitative information about the location of grids, arrays, and IED vectors&quot;. We realize that there are a number of caveats and limitations in the interpretation of this qualitative figure that require further explanation, but including the figure would greatly enhance the clarity of the manuscript</p><p>4) Please refer to https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/<italic>eLife</italic>_author_instructions.html#revised for instructions on how to submit source data for each figure. There do not seem to be source data included for the majority of figure plots. Also the data repository on OSF would greatly benefit from a description of the different data file types, the different variable types within the structures, and the sampling rate for the IED traces.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73541.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) How did you validate automated IED detections? Could you report on positive predictive values for a random subset of detections?</p></disp-quote><p>We have validated the algorithm against the gold standard (board-certified neurologist) and calculated the PPV for a subset of 78 IEDs across patients. Two clinicians who were adept at identifying IEDs evaluated groups of 10 microelectrode array channels along with a raster of firing across channels for 10 s segments around each IED (CAS and JDR). We calculated the positive predictive value against the ratings of the board-certified neurologist (CAS). The PPV for the neurosurgeon was 0.83, whereas the PPV for the algorithm was 0.89. Calculating the PPVs for both clinicians in reference to the algorithm yielded 0.89 for both the neurosurgeon and neurologist. We also calculated Cohenâs Kappa to measure interrater reliability against chance performance, and report a value of 44.9%, which is similar to kappa values (48.6%) reported in a large multicenter study of IED interrater reliability (Jing et al., 2020). Cohenâs Kappa between the algorithm and Neurologist was 61.1%. These results are reported in the Results section on page 4, lines 16-20, and the method of validation is described in the methods on page 13, starting on line 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) You write in the abstract and discussion that IEDs traverse the same path as ictal discharges, but the angle between the SDs and IEDs was 24 degrees, and the IEDs weren't exactly opposite the ictal wavefront (150 degrees). Do you think the SDs and IEDs really follow the same path, and if so, what accounts for the sizable angle between their observed paths?</p></disp-quote><p>In testing the hypotheses that arose from the model predictions, we assumed that a tolerance of approximately Ï/4 would be appropriate to report that IEDs and SDs were similar directions, as we showed there is not a directly antipodal relationship between pre and post -recruitment SDs (Smith et al., 2016). However, the reviewer is correct to point out that such a heuristic is insufficient. We therefore carried out statistical tests to determine the extent to which the similarity of these directions might arise by chance. This test relied on comparing the true KLD between IED and SD distributions to a permutation distribution comprised of randomly sampled directions from both distributions. This test is described in the methods on page 16, starting on line 15. All of these tests were highly significant (all p &lt; 0.01), indicating that while the IED/SD distributional overlap is not perfect, it is significantly unlikely to occur by chance in each patient. We have reported these results on page 8, on lines 9-12.</p><p>It's also important to note that the mean angle differences the reviewer points to represent those across participants, where two patients had larger differences, but the majority had mean angle differences near zero, as well as mean IED angle differences from the IW direction near 180 (Figures 4 G-H). This many similar angle differences, across all but 2 patients (in which the angle is only slightly larger) is highly unlikely to occur by chance. The two patients with larger angles also were classified as MTL onset, which we have mentioned in the final paragraph of the discussion (Page 11, sentence starting on line 45).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

As briefly indicated in the discussion, the UEA is likely too small to localize a seizure focus â it produces one vector, which at best could define the line along which the focus falls. To identify the seizure focus, greater spatial sampling is needed. The authors point out that the simultaneously recorded ECOG is insufficient to measure IW propagation as it cannot detect MUAs and its poor spatial sampling make estimation of IED propagation low-fidelity. Nevertheless, since LFP was used to record IED propagation in the UEA, it would be useful to analyze IED propagation from the ECoG array to compare the vector produced, particularly by neighboring electrodes.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree with multiple elements of this critique, there are numerous reasons why we believe that a full analysis of IED propagation patterns in ECoG is beyond the scope of this study. A primary issue is that the brain sampled by a planar Utah array can be readily mapped to 2-dimensional space, as in this study. However, the brain beneath a grid or sampled by SEEG is not flatâthe sampling is no longer along a rigid 2-dimensional plane, given the brainâs gyri and sulci, so Euclidean distances are not an appropriate metric for relating recording locations to brain activity. We are currently working to understand mesoscale patterns in IED propagation on sEEG and ECoG using methods that are more appropriate for: (1) the larger spatial scale, (2) complex 3D patterns of IED travel involved with sEEG/ECoG (e.g. travel across Euclidean, geodesic, or axonal lengths), and (3) more complicated IED waveforms recorded on ECoG and sEEG. There are further methodological uncertainties inherent in spatiotemporal alignment between ECoG and UEA IED propagation vectors that made us uncomfortable with making claims about the correspondence between ECoG and MEA IED propagation. Temporally, alignment was not carried out similarly across all 10 participants (given the different recording locations and approximately a decade between some recordings). Spatially, it is nearly impossible to <italic>precisely</italic> align the MEA and ECoG from intraoperative photos and CT/MRI co-registration due to âbrain dropâ or potential spatial translation/rotation of ECoG grids after surgery. Physical memory in the UEA wire bundle could add systematic bias to angle estimation from CT/MR co-registration.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have included supplementary qualitative information about the location of grids, arrays, and IED vectors for reviewers to judge. Figure 4âfigure supplement 2 shows electrode localization information for each participant, a schematic of the implant around the UEA, and rotated IED distributions to match each UEA orientation. While this is all qualitative information, as we cannot precisely align IED distributions based on intraoperative photos, the axis of IED travel bisects the SOZ in most cases.</p><p>Furthermore, we have done some preliminary analysis of peri-ictal IEDs on ECoG for one of the penumbral participants, and can share one patientâs results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>For one participant whose UEA was not recruited into the seizure examined gradients in the beta phase across the ECoG grid space during the IEDs preceding seizures.</title><p>We evaluated the divergence of these gradients in order to determine sources and sinks in patterns of IED traveling waves, hypothesizing that the location of the ictal core will be a sink.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73541-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>This figure shows that there is a âsinkâ IED propagation pattern across an ECoG grid that co-locates with the SOZ.

We believe it is essential to translate the understandings in this manuscript to a clinically useful scale, and are taking steps to do just that to be reported in future publications. We have added more text to the discussion to clarify the directions that could be taken in order to improve patientsâ lives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. If the ECoG analysis fails to produce a vector that match the UEA vectors, it may be necessary to implant two UEAs. The intersection of the IED propagation vectors would hypothetically localize the seizure focus (in 2D). Obviously this experiment is outside the scope of this study, but worth mentioning in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an astute observation by the reviewer. We would refer the reviewer to the schematics on the previous page showing the axis of IED travel bisects the SOZ. We have also added text to the last paragraph of the discussion mentioning the considerations involved with estimating seizure spread from IEDs recorded on MEAs on page 11, line 28.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Did the resulting surgical resections in recorded patients align with the axis predicted by the IED propagation at the UEA? Did the success of the surgery relate to the removal (or not) of the UEA-predicted focus?</p></disp-quote><p>Appendix 1 â Table 1 shows all the clinical details for each participant. While information about outcomes is in the table there was insufficient statistical power to carry out across subjects analyses (power = 0.14 for a McNemar test). Three patients had outcomes that were Engle 3/4. Arrays in each of those patients were near the SOZ and angles of IED travel bisected the SOZ in each case, however it must be reiterated that it is difficult to infer much from these maps due to uncertainty in spatial alignment of arrays and classification of the SOZ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Synaptic connectivity is probably important determinant of whether vector points to focus. Furthermore, UEA recordings are performed on the cortical surface. In the most straightforward application of the proposed strategy, seizures would start on cortical surface and propagate locally. However, many seizures begin in deep structures. Some discussion of the relationship between neocortical propagation and localization of a deep focus (e.g. MTLE) is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>The third reviewer also suggested we discuss the implications of mesial temporal lobe onsets, so we have added text to the discussion on page 11, starting on line 36 discussing this point directly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Were patients weaned from their AEDs during these recordings. One important advantage of analyzing IEDs vs seizures for surgical planning is that they are very common. Thus, it might be possible to perform the mapping in patients without having them in withdrawal from their AEDs, which might improve predictive value.</p></disp-quote><p>Patients were weaned from their AEDs during this study, as dictated by each patientâs clinical course. The IED rate reported in this study may therefore reflect a slightly higher rate than would be expected when patients are fully on AEDs, however the analysis period also includes earlier segments of data that are within the period of IED weaning. We have added a relevant sentence to the methods on page 12, line 25.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 4A-F, for the subjects with multiple seizures, the IED distribution appears to be different for each seizure. What IED distributions are plotted â only those that had occurred up to the time of that seizure? Maybe I missed it, but I couldn't find this info in the results or figure captionâ¦</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify this point. The figure caption states that each distribution is plotted relative to the direction of the ictal wavefront (IW), which is why all of the IWs point to zero. This is to allow for comparison between IEDs and SDs for each seizure, relative to each seizureâs predominant geometrically organizing feature: the IW. Raw IED and SD distributions, and raw IW directions are plotted in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1. We have edited the figure caption for 4A-F in order to clarify both points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The Utah array is an excellent tool to study spatiotemporal dynamics in and around a seizure core. The strength of such a technique is unfortunately also the weakness. Since it is implanted on the cortex, the modeling of IED and seizure discharges has a potential for bias due to the location of the implant. The model can be strengthened by comparing the MUA and LFP of the model with their single-unit data of IEDs from hybrid electrodes of mesial temporal lobe implants. The authors do mention the limitation of their study, but it would help if they discuss this some more, especially since only two patients in Table S1 had mesial temporal onset and the rest were lateral or neocortical onsets. They should not generalize that this model is applicable to all seizure types.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the recommendations and have expanded discussion of these points in the final discussion paragraph. Another reviewer also asked us to discuss non-neocortical onset seizures, so we have discussed this on page 11, starting on line 36.</p><p>References:</p><p>Jing J, Herlopian A, Karakis I, Ng M, Halford JJ, Lam A, Maus D, Chan F, Dolatshahi M, Muniz CF, Chu C, Sacca V, Pathmanathan J, Ge W, Sun H, Dauwels J, Cole AJ, Hoch DB, Cash SS, Westover MB. 2020.

You state that &quot;the angle discrepancies to which the reviewer refers are statistically insignificant and can be explained by expected biological variability&quot;. On the other hand you state that based on Smith et al. 2016, you don't expect the IED to be strictly antipodal to IW. Finally, while the KLD analysis is useful it does not seem to fully address the reviewers' questions regarding what appears to be a (statistically) significant deviation (almost 2 standard deviations) of the IED/IW angle from 180 degrees. A single paragraph in the discussion summarizing and clarifying the various points of why SD, IEDs, and IWs may not be strictly aligned or antipodal would improve the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for engaging with this issue. We have added an additional paragraph to the discussion to address this issue directly. The new paragraph begins on page 10, line 30. and is pasted here:</p><p>âThe IED directions we report are not perfectly antipodal to the IW. These differences in mean angles may be due in part toÂ error when fitting a plane to the IW, which discounts the propagating waveâs curvature, orÂ biological variability, such as changes in brain state and arousal. [â¦] The dominant direction of travel is largely in the opposite direction of seizure expansion.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding Reviewer 2, major point #7 &quot;In Figure 4A-F, for the subjects with multiple seizures, the IED distribution appears to be different for each seizure. What IED distributions are plotted â only those that had occurred up to the time of that seizure?&quot;</p><p>The reviewer is asking why the shape of the distribution, and not just the rotation, of IED distribution varies for different seizures in the same patient. Are you analyzing/including a different subset of IEDs for each seizure? If so, why? If not, why does the distribution change?</p></disp-quote><p>The same IEDs go into each plot, but the IED directions are rotated by the ictal wavefront for each seizure. The reason they look slightly different is because all the rotated angles are fitting into the same 18 bins as the original data, so the differences in angles per bin very slightly changes the shape of the distribution. For example in figure 4E, the larger IED bin closer to zero in the right panel appears to get split into two smaller bins in the left panel. It may help the reviewer to compare the IED distributions in figure 4 to the raw distributions that are shown in the figure supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding Reviewer 2, major point #2, we strongly suggest including the figure showing the &quot;qualitative information about the location of grids, arrays, and IED vectors&quot;. We realize that there are a number of caveats and limitations in the interpretation of this qualitative figure that require further explanation, but including the figure would greatly enhance the clarity of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this figure does aid the manuscript clarity, despite its many uncertainties. We have included an edited version as Figure 4âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please refer to https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/eLife_author_instructions.html#revised for instructions on how to submit source data for each figure. There do not seem to be source data included for the majority of figure plots. Also the data repository on OSF would greatly benefit from a description of the different data file types, the different variable types within the structures, and the sampling rate for the IED traces.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this omission. We were under the impression that the uploaded code and OSF database were sufficient to reproduce figures. We have remedied this misunderstanding by uploading source data (IED directions) for figures 2 and 4, which are the main data figures in the manuscript to the github repository. We have also added a description of the data types in the OSF repository.</p></body></sub-article></article>
