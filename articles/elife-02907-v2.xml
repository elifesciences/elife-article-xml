The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) stimulates transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating Pol II and antagonizing negative elongation factors. A reservoir of P-TEFb is sequestered in the inactive 7SK snRNP where 7SK snRNA and the La-related protein LARP7 are required for the integrity of this complex. Here, we show that P-TEFb activity is important for the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and breast cancer progression. Decreased levels of LARP7 and 7SK snRNA redistribute P-TEFb to the transcriptionally active super elongation complex, resulting in P-TEFb activation and increased transcription of EMT transcription factors, including Slug, FOXC2, ZEB2, and Twist1, to promote breast cancer EMT, invasion, and metastasis. Our data provide the first demonstration that the transcription elongation machinery plays a key role in promoting breast cancer progression by directly controlling the expression of upstream EMT regulators.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02907.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02907.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02907.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To express a gene to make a protein, the gene's DNA must first be transcribed to produce molecules of messenger RNA. The start of the transcription process features two milestones. First, an enzyme called RNA Polymerase II starts the process. Shortly afterwards, however, the process pauses and only starts again when other proteins are recruited. This second step, called transcriptional elongation, is essential for gene expression in cells that are growing and specializing into specific cell types. However, it is unclear how important this second step is for the progression of human cancers, such as breast cancer.</p><p>In humans, two proteins join together to form a complex called ‘positive transcription elongation factor b’ (or P-TEFb for short). This elongation factor encourages the transcriptional elongation step by adding phosphate groups onto RNA Polymerase II and by outcompeting other proteins that act to stop the process. However, some of the P-TEFb proteins in the cell's nucleus are unable to do this because they are held within a complex, which also contains an RNA molecule and some other proteins including one called LARP7. This protein–RNA complex is thought to help to prevent a number of cancers, for example breast cancer or stomach cancer; however the effect of P-TEFb proteins on cancers in humans is not known.</p><p>Less LARP7 protein is made in breast cancer cells compared to healthy cells. And when Ji et al. reduced the levels of the LARP7 protein (or the RNA molecule involved in the complex), the P-TEFb proteins were released from the complex and were free to encourage transcriptional elongation. This led to the increased expression of other proteins that switch other genes on or off, including genes that allow breast cancer cells to spread around the body. On the other hand, Ji et al. revealed that freeing the P-TEFb proteins from the complex in the nucleus did not appear to cause new tumors to develop or existing tumors to grow.</p><p>Ji et al. suggest that the LARP7 protein normally helps to prevent the spread of breast cancers by keeping the P-TEFb proteins inactive as a part of the protein–RNA complex. One of the next challenges will be to see if drugs that can inhibit the P-TEFb proteins might be useful as new treatments for late stage breast cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02907.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02907.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>P-TEFb</kwd><kwd>LARP7</kwd><kwd>7SK snRNA</kwd><kwd>super elongation complex</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007197</institution-id><institution>U.S. Public Health Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI095057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI041757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK090347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Kunxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transcription elongation by the elongation factor P-TEFb promotes the epithelial–mesenchymal transition and metastasis of breast cancer cells, implicating inhibition of this factor as a potential treatment for the late stages of this cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer cells have fundamentally altered gene expression profiles that drive their pathogenic features. In eukaryotes, gene transcription is mainly performed by RNA polymerase (Pol) II and can be controlled at multiple stages including pre-initiation, initiation, elongation, and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shilatifard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sims et al., 2004</xref>). Transcription elongation has recently been demonstrated to play a critical role in regulating cell growth and differentiation. In Drosophila and human embryonic stem cells, a large number of genes involved in cell growth, renewal, and differentiation are found to be controlled at the elongation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guenther et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, in mammalian cells, the transcription elongation machinery has also been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou and Yik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Romano and Giordano, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Shortly after initiation of transcription, Pol II pauses near the transcription start site largely due to the actions of two negative transcription elongation factors NELF and DSIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peterlin and Price, 2006</xref>). The human positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) reverses this block and stimulates transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating the two negative elongation factors as well as the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of Pol II. These modification events antagonize the actions of the negative elongation factors and also promote co-transcriptional mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). P-TEFb is a heterodimer composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and its regulatory partner Cyclin T1 or T2 (CycT1 or T2). The activity of P-TEFb is stringently maintained in a functional equilibrium in cells to accommodate transcriptional demands for different biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou and Yik, 2006</xref>). Three P-TEFb-containing complexes have been identified, including the inhibitory 7SK snRNP complex and two active transcription complexes: the Brd4-P-TEFb complex and the super elongation complex (SEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p>Under normal growth conditions, more than half of nuclear P-TEFb is sequestered in the catalytically inactive 7SK snRNP, which also contains the 7SK snRNA, HEXIM1 (or the homologous HEXIM2), MePCE, and LARP7. This complex represents the major cellular reservoir of inactive P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou and Yik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Within 7SK snRNP, the 7SK snRNA serves as a central scaffold that coordinates key protein–protein interactions and allows HEXIM1/2 to inhibit CDK9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yik et al., 2003</xref>). The La-related protein LARP7 binds to nearly all the nuclear 7SK snRNA via the 3′-UUU-OH sequence and protects it against exonuclease cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krueger et al., 2008</xref>). Stable RNAi-mediated knockdown of LARP7 causes an almost complete depletion of 7SK snRNA, leading to disruption of 7SK snRNP and a shift of P-TEFb toward the active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2008</xref>). Considering that the 7SK snRNP is the primary source of suppressed P-TEFb, the level of LARP7 directly affects the amount of active P-TEFb, thereby playing a key role in controlling P-TEFb activity.</p><p>In response to a number of conditions/agents that globally impact growth and differentiation, P-TEFb is released from the 7SK snRNP and recruited to chromatin templates by the bromodomain protein Brd4, which binds to acetylated histones and the Mediator complex to promote transcription and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mochizuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to Brd4, P-TEFb released from 7SK snRNP can also be recruited by a number of gene-specific transcription factors such as the HIV-1 Tat protein and the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins to form the multi-subunit SEC complex to specifically and efficiently activate their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sobhian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating data have implicated the involvement of various components of P-TEFb-containing complexes in human cancer. For example, several components of the P-TEFb-containing SEC, such as AFF1, AFF4, ELL1, AF9, and ENL, are all translocation partners of MLL and are important for MLL-based leukemogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yokoyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, Brd4 has also been considered a promising therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of its ability to sustain P-TEFb-dependent <italic>c-Myc</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blobel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zuber et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, several lines of evidence have implicated the control of P-TEFb by the 7SK snRNP in human breast cancer. First of all, HEXIM1 has been proposed as an inhibitor of breast cell growth since its expression is downregulated by estrogens in breast tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wittmann et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, microsatellite instability (MSI)-induced frameshift mutations in the LARP7 gene have been detected in a significant population of gastric cancer samples, implicating a potential tumor suppressor role of LARP7 in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mori et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with this result, we have previously shown that LARP7 knockdown in the mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A disrupts cell polarity and blocks morphological differentiation when cultured in the three-dimensional laminin-rich extracellular matrix (3D IrECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite these observations, virtually nothing is known about whether P-TEFb and its associated factors may play a key role during human cancer progression. In this study, we investigated the function of the P-TEFb functional equilibrium in controlling the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and metastasis of human breast cancer. By knocking down LARP7, we released P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP and stimulated the P-TEFb-dependent transcription of EMT-related genes, resulting in breast cancer EMT and enhanced invasion and metastasis. Our analyses have revealed a strong causative relationship between the invasive phenotypes of human breast cancer and P-TEFb activation by disrupting the 7SK snRNP. Our study has thus provided the first demonstration that the transcription elongation machinery and the P-TEFb network play critical roles in regulating tumor progression, EMT, and metastasis by directly controlling the expression of EMT/metastasis-related genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LARP7 expression is downregulated in invasive human breast cancer tissues and cells</title><p>To investigate whether P-TEFb and its associated factors are involved in human breast cancer progression, we first examined their expression patterns in the publicly accessible Oncomine microarray database. Of the known components in the three major P-TEFb-containing complexes, the 7SK snRNP, the Brd4-bound complex, and the SEC, only LARP7 and HEXIM1, two signature components of the 7SK snRNP, showed consistent alteration in human breast cancer tissues.

In normal mammary tissues, LARP7 was highly expressed in the epithelial cells of the mammary lobuli and terminal ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This high expression was also observed in DCIS samples, but significantly attenuated in the invasive ductal carcinoma samples. These data confirm that LARP7 protein levels are also reduced during breast cancer progression, and thus suggest that LARP7 may play a potential tumor suppressor role in breast cancer.</p><p>The association between cancer progression and reduced LARP7 expression was also confirmed in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. LARP7 was expressed at relatively high levels in the untransformed mammary epithelial cell lines (MCF10A and EpH4) and noninvasive breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, BT474, T74D, and ZR75B), but was markedly reduced in all four invasive and metastatic cancer lines examined (MDA-MB-468, BT549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This reduction was partially due to a decrease in the LARP7 mRNA levels as shown by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with the demonstration that LARP7 is necessary for the integrity of the 7SK snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2008</xref>), the reduced LARP7 expression in invasive breast cancer cell lines was accompanied by a decrease in 7SK snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Meanwhile, phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD at Ser2 positions (pSer2) strongly increased in the invasive breast cancer cell lines, indicating an increase in the P-TEFb kinase activity. Since the variations in LARP7 expression did not affect the cellular levels of CDK9 and Cyclin T1, this increase in CDK9 kinase activity is likely due to the release of P-TEFb from the inhibitory 7SK snRNP as a result of reduced LARP7 and 7SK snRNA levels. Interestingly, HEXIM1 expression did not correlate with the malignant features of the breast cancer cell lines; it was moderately reduced in three invasive cancer lines and ZR75B non-invasive cancer line, but remained high in the metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest a model that LARP7 is downregulated in invasive human breast cancer cells, leading to a decrease in 7SK snRNA and subsequently 7SK snRNP. This results in release of P-TEFb from the inhibitory 7SK snRNP and an increase in the phosphorylation of the P-TEFb substrates.

Here, we show that in noninvasive human breast cancer cells, disruption of this complex by knocking down LARP7 releases P-TEFb, redistributing it to the transcriptionally active SEC complex. This activation of P-TEFb promotes breast cancer EMT, invasion, cancer stem cell expansion, and metastasis by directly activating the expression of genes involved in EMT and metastasis.

Our data highlight the importance of the transcription elongation machinery in regulating breast cancer EMT and metastasis and suggest a new therapeutic option to combat metastatic breast cancer through blocking P-TEFb activation. Currently, the CDK9 inhibitor flavopiridol is being evaluated in several phase I and II clinical trials for its anti-cancer effects either as a single agent or in combination with other drugs in treatment of esophageal cancer, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, endometrial carcinoma, recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and most relevantly, previously treated locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancernetwork.com/review-article/current-clinical-trials-flavopiridol/page/0/2">http://www.cancernetwork.com/review-article/current-clinical-trials-flavopiridol/page/0/2</ext-link>).

Among the four members, LARP7 is the only one that binds to 7SK snRNA and is involved in transcription elongation controlled by Pol II. The role of the LARP family proteins in human cancer is so far poorly known, and our study is the first demonstration that LARP7 functions as a potential suppressor of human breast cancer metastasis. This function of LARP7 is additionally supported by the observation that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of LARP7, multisex-combs (MXC), also acts as a tumor suppressor to inhibit cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Remillieux-Leschelle et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, the C-terminal region of LARP7, which is essential for the sequestration of P-TEFb in 7SK snRNP, is required for LARP7's suppression of breast cancer survival and is frequently deleted in human gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mori et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting that LARP7 may be a potential tumor suppressor in a broad range of human carcinomas. Finally, an inactivating mutation of LARP7 has been linked to a novel form of familial Primordial Dwarfism characterized by facial dysmorphism and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alazami et al., 2012</xref>). In these patients, the 7SK snRNA is depleted due to the defective LARP7, indicating that LARP7 and 7SK snRNA, through their ability to control P-TEFb activity, also regulate embryonic development. Although it is formally possible that the LARP7 KD may also affect other yet-to-be-identified pathways in a P-TEFb-independent manner, our observation that both flavopiridol and siCDK9s efficiently rescued the increased cell migration of LARP7 KD cells lends a strong support to the notion that the observed effects of LARP7 KD on EMT and invasion are indeed mediated by P-TEFb activation.</p><p>A key observation of our study is that among the many EMT genes whose expression is altered by P-TEFb activation, the transcription factors Slug, FOXC2, ZEB2, and Twist1 are direct targets of P-TEFb and bound by the P-TEFb-containing SEC. These four proteins are well known EMT transcription factors that function as decisive early drivers of EMT. While FOXC2 orchestrates the mesenchymal component of the EMT program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mani et al., 2007</xref>), Slug, ZEB2, and Twist1 repress E-cadherin expression, a fundamental event in EMT, as well as the expression of proteins of tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes, contributing to the de-differentiated state of tumor cells and facilitating EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peinado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez-Tillo et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, these proteins are also closely linked to breast cancer stem cell properties and implicated in resistance to drug and radio-therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Voulgari and Pintzas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Singh and Settleman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hollier et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, these EMT early drivers also activate the expression of other EMT transcription factors. For example, Twist1 can induce Snail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smit et al., 2009</xref>), and Slug can upregulate Twist2 and ZEB1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wels et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guo et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, by directly activating the expression of these EMT early drivers, P-TEFb is capable of orchestrating the EMT program to drive malignant progression. Since P-TEFb and its associated factors are expressed in most cell types, it is possible that the ability of P-TEFb to promote tumor progression may not be restricted to breast cancer but also true for other malignant tumors. Indeed, the active P-TEFb-Brd4 complex has been linked to AML and CML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mertz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zuber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herrmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Winter et al., 2012</xref>), while multiple SEC components are direct targets of MLL-fusion proteins that are linked to various forms of leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yokoyama et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We have found that in the noninvasive breast cancer cell lines, P-TEFb released from the 7SK snRNP is mainly redistributed to the SEC. The expression levels of two SEC components AF9 and ELL2 are also markedly upregulated, allowing more SEC formation. Since ELL2 is another key catalytic component of SEC besides P-TEFb, its increase is likely to further enhance transcriptional elongation of target genes. We found that the Brd4-P-TEFb complex was also increased moderately upon LARP7 KD (data not shown), suggesting the possibility that Brd4 may also play a role in facilitating the P-TEFb-dependent breast cancer progression.</p><p>Given that P-TEFb is mostly known as a general transcription factor, our observations raise two interesting questions: Why are EMT transcription factors particularly sensitive to P-TEFb activation in these cells, and how is the SEC involved in this process? Our data that P-TEFb and SEC are associated with the genes encoding decisive EMT regulators but not non-responsive genes suggest that the direct target EMT genes may contain sequences that display high affinity binding to the SEC-P-TEFb complex. For example, these genes may contain the recently discovered Super-Enhancers that render them highly sensitive to activation by the Mediator and the SEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loven et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, previous proteomic and biochemical analyses have identified the Mediator as a SEC binding partner through interaction between the Mediator subunit MED26 and the SEC components ELL-associated factor 1 (EAF1) and EAF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the Mediator may recruit the SEC to target genes and the two complexes may act together to activate genes containing the Super-Enhancers. The SEC has also been linked to the elongating Pol II on chromatin template through interaction between the SEC components ENL/AF9 and the Pol II-associated factor 1 (PAF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">He et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, SEC may be recruited to its target promoters through tissue-specific and sequence-specific DNA binding partners, such as the HIV Tat protein in HIV-infected cells, MLL-fusion proteins in leukemia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He and Zhou, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2011</xref>) or retinoic acid receptor in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). Besides the positive control exerted by P-TEFb and SEC, another possibility is that the EMT genes are strongly suppressed by negative transcription elongation factors DSIF and NELF, and thus are very sensitive to P-TEFb activation. Future studies will try to determine which of these mechanisms may be responsible for the heightened sensitivity of EMT transcription factors to the elongation control.</p><p>Taken together, our study has demonstrated that LARP7 functions as a potential tumor suppressor in human breast cancer by suppressing the activity of P-TEFb and inhibiting EMT, invasion, and metastasis. Our study also provides the first demonstration that the transcription elongation machinery and the network of P-TEFb complexes play critical roles in regulating tumor EMT, cancer stemness, and metastasis by directly controlling the expression of upstream EMT regulators. These findings will facilitate the development of new drugs that target CDK9 for anti-cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and antibodies</title><p>The MCF10A mammary epithelial cells were cultured in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/ml EGF, 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml of cholera toxin, and penicillin/streptomycin.

Your article has been evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and we invite you to submit a revised manuscript.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The Reviewers agreed that this is a very interesting paper that links downregulation of the protein LARP7 to increased cell invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells. The pioneering observation is that LARP7 is downregulated at the RNA and protein level in breast carcinomas relative to normal breast tissue, which correlates with poor prognosis. From there, the authors demonstrate that depletion of LARP7 in non-invasive breast cancer cells promotes an EMT-like phenotype, as shown by various cellular assays and molecular markers. Mechanistically, the authors show that LARP7 depletion leads to a redistribution of the transcription elongation factor P-TEFb from inactive to active nuclear complexes, concurrently with increased P-TEFb recruitment and RNAPII elongation at genes involved in EMT. The Reviewers would like to encourage submission of a revised manuscript addressing the major points below:</p><p>1) One major criticism is that the authors do not explain how increased P-TEFb activity in this system leads to selective activation of genes important for the EMT program and breast cancer progression. What makes free P-TEFb in this system selective for the genes controlling the expression of upstream EMT regulators over other RNA polymerase II protein-coding genes? Although the redistribution of free P-TEFb to the transcriptionally active SEC is well explained, it is unclear what dictates the specificity of P-TEFb recruitment to the genes involved in the EMT program. The molecular basis for the selectivity of this regulatory mechanism has to be better addressed and explained. Toward this end, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> should include gene expression and ChIP data for non-responsive genes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> should also show data for non-responsive genes. As it stands, it is unclear how specific the results of gene induction upon LARP7 knockdown are.</p><p>2) Another major concern was the lack of an <italic>in vivo</italic> assay demonstrating that mere manipulation of LARP7 expression can change the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells. The <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular phenotypes are striking and the impact the paper would rise significantly by including experiments in murine models showing that LARP7 overexpression can block the metastatic ability of MDB-231 and/or that LARP7 depletion with shRNAs increases the metastatic potential of the non-invasive lines (e.g. MCF10A, T47D). If a negative result is obtained, this should be reported as well.</p><p>3) A third major concern was the depiction throughout the manuscript of LARP7 as a tumor suppressor. The studies were all carried out in cells and cell lines, not in cancer models. Thus the conclusion that LARP7 is a tumor suppressor is premature, it would be more conventionally characterized from this type of data as a 'potential tumor suppressor', especially in the absence of data that LARP mutations give rise to specific cancer types in mice and promote tumor growth or metastasis in tumor xenografts. The identification of some LARP7 mutations in some gastric cancers does not show causality. On this topic, the existing clinical trials that have evaluated flavopiridol for efficacy in metastatic solid tumors should be mentioned.</p><p>4) The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> should be complemented with a rescue assay to test whether an shRNA-resistant LARP7 construct can rescue the phenotype and revert cell morphology, migration and the wound healing properties as in the parental cell line.</p><p>5) Experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are highly relevant but incomplete. To support the overall model, it would be important to see whether re-expression of a LARP7 mutant with impaired 7SK RNA-binding activity (or the inactivating mutation linked to a novel form of Primordial Dwarfism), also impairs survival of the metastatic breast cancer cell (like wild type LARP7). It is expected that this mutant will not assemble into the snRNP and thus may not have tumor suppressor potential.</p><p>6) The EMT genes are shown to be upregulated in cells lacking LARP7, and are shown by ChIP to bind Cdk9, however the authors need to show that the expression of these genes requires Cdk9. Because flavopiridol inactivates several Cdks, specific shRNAs should be used to make this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02907.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers agreed that this is a very interesting paper that links downregulation of the protein LARP7 to increased cell invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells.

We have taken these comments very seriously and have taken the time to perform extensive experiments in order to address the reviewers’ concerns thoroughly. We believe that the manuscript has been significantly improved with these new additions.</p><p><italic>1) One major criticism is that the authors do not explain how increased P-TEFb activity in this system leads to selective activation of genes important for the EMT program and breast cancer progression.

As it stands, it is unclear how specific the results of gene induction upon LARP7 knockdown are</italic>.</p><p>We have performed ChIP assay on two non-responsive Pol II-dependent genes, β-actin and ubiquitin C, and two non-flavopiridol-responsive EMT genes, Twist 2 and Snail, with anti-CDK9, anti-pSer2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and anti-ELL2 (SEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, these non-responsive genes do not show increased binding of P-TEFb, phosphorylated Pol II and ELL2. Thus, one mechanism underlying the selectivity of P-TEFb for the upstream EMT regulators over other Pol II-dependent genes is the more efficient or selective binding of the P-TEFb complex to the former. As for what factors determine the efficiency/selectivity of P-TEFb binding, it is one of the most actively researched questions in the field. Recruitment of P-TEFb to its target genes probably involves Brd4 via its bromodomain, or more likely in our case, the SEC complex via several possible mechanisms such as the Mediator bound to the newly discovered Super enhancers or the Pol II-associated PAF complex. Finally, certain genes that are strongly associated with negative elongation factors NELF and DSIF may become especially sensitive to P-TEFb activation. We have included a brief discussion of these possibilities in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) Another major concern was the lack of an in vivo assay demonstrating that mere manipulation of LARP7 expression can change the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells. The in vitro cellular phenotypes are striking and the impact the paper would rise significantly by including experiments in murine models showing that LARP7 overexpression can block the metastatic ability of MDB-231 and/or that LARP7 depletion with shRNAs increases the metastatic potential of the non-invasive lines (e.g. MCF10A, T47D). If a negative result is obtained, this should be reported as well</italic>.</p><p>We have performed <italic>in vivo</italic> metastasis assay by injecting T47D control and shLARP7-2 cells in the tail veins of the nude mice. 12 weeks after the injection, histological analysis was carried out to detect the presence of metastasis in the lung. Consistent with the increased EMT and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic>, the shLARP7-2 cells formed more and larger metastatic colonies in the lung compared to the control cells. Thus, LARP7 depletion increases the metastatic potential <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) A third major concern was the depiction throughout the manuscript of LARP7 as a tumor suppressor.

The identification of some LARP7 mutations in some gastric cancers does not show causality. On this topic, the existing clinical trials that have evaluated flavopiridol for efficacy in metastatic solid tumors should be mentioned</italic>.</p><p>We have revised the text regarding LARP7 as a “tumor suppressor” to a “potential tumor suppressor”. We have included the following comment on the ongoing clinical trials of flavopiridol in malignant human cancer in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Currently, the CDK9 inhibitor flavopiridol is being evaluated in several phase I and II clinical trials for its anti-cancer effects either as a single agent or in combination with other drugs in treatment of esophageal cancer, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, endometrial carcinoma, recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and most relevantly, previously treated locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.”</p><p><italic>4) The experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>should be complemented with a rescue assay to test whether an shRNA-resistant LARP7 construct can rescue the phenotype and revert cell morphology, migration and the wound healing properties as in the parental cell line</italic>.</p><p>We have performed the rescue experiment by introducing an shRNA-resistant WT LARP7 stably into the MCF10A shLARP7-2 cells. When expressed at a level comparable to that in MCF10A parental cells, this shRNA-resistant LARP7 readily restored the loss of 7SK snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>), reverted the morphology of the cells to the epithelial-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and mitigated the enhanced cell migration and motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I-2J</xref>), confirming that the increased EMT and cell migration are due to the loss of LARP7. We have incorporated these results in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-J</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) Experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>are highly relevant but incomplete.

It is expected that this mutant will not assemble into the snRNP and thus may not have tumor suppressor potential</italic>.</p><p>We have performed the experiment suggested by the reviewers by introducing a LARP7 mutant Δ2A that was originally found in microsatellite instable gastric cancer and contains a deletion of 2 adenosines from a microsatellite repeat of 8 A’s (nucleotides 1206–1213) in the LARP7 C-terminal region. This results in a frame shift deletion of the C-terminal region of LARP7. The Δ2A mutant cannot bind to 7SK snRNP and therefore fails to suppress P-TEFb activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al, 2008</xref>, Mol Cell). When introduced into the MDA-MB-231 cells, the Δ2A mutant did not induce apoptosis of these cells whereas WT LARP7 readily impaired cell survival, supporting the model that the ability of LARP7 to assemble 7SK snRNP and suppress P-TEFb is necessary for its tumor suppressor potential. We have included these data in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) The EMT genes are shown to be upregulated in cells lacking LARP7, and are shown by ChIP to bind Cdk9, however the authors need to show that the expression of these genes requires Cdk9. Because flavopiridol inactivates several Cdks, specific shRNAs should be used to make this point</italic>.</p><p>We have employed two different siRNAs against CDK9 to reduce its expression in T47D shLARP7-2 cells and examined their impacts on the expression of EMT transcription factors by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the results obtained by flavopiridol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), reducing CDK9 expression impaired the expression of 4 genes, Slug, FOXC2, ZEB2 and Twist1, but had no effect on that of other 4 genes. The new results with siCDK9s have been added to the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
