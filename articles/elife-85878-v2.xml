The sorting of one exosomal cargo RNA, miR223, is facilitated by the RNA-binding protein, YBX1 (Shurtleff et al., 2016). We found that miR223 specifically binds a ‘cold shock’ domain (CSD) of YBX1 through a 5’ proximal sequence motif UCAGU that may represent a binding site or structural feature required for sorting. Prior to sorting into exosomes, most of the cytoplasmic miR223 resides in mitochondria. An RNA-binding protein localized to the mitochondrial matrix, YBAP1, appears to serve as a negative regulator of miR223 enrichment into exosomes. miR223 levels decreased in the mitochondria and increased in exosomes after loss of YBAP1. We observed YBX1 shuttle between mitochondria and endosomes in live cells. YBX1 also partitions into P body granules in the cytoplasm (Liu et al., 2021). We propose a model in which miR223 and likely other miRNAs are stored in mitochondria and are then mobilized by YBX1 to cytoplasmic phase condensate granules for capture into invaginations in the endosome that give rise to exosomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA-binding proteins</kwd><kwd>exosome</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondria serve as a reservoir for the sorting of an miRNA into P-bodies and from there into exosomes secreted from human cultured cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) bud from the plasma membrane or are secreted when multivesicular bodies (MVB) fuse with the plasma membrane to release a population of vesicles called exosomes. EVs and their cargos are highly dependent on their membrane source. Microvesicles released by budding from the plasma membrane are a heterogeneous population of EVs ranging in size from 30 nm to 1000 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cocucci et al., 2009</xref>). Exosomes are 30 nm to 150 nm in size and originate as vesicles invaginated into the interior of an MVB to form intraluminal vesicles (ILVs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Harding et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Many RNAs are selectively sorted into EVs, especially small RNAs. Several studies have indicated that RNA binding proteins (RNPs) may be involved in the enrichment of RNAs into EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Santangelo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Teng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>). However, many of these studies used sedimentation at ~100,000 g to collect EVs, which may also collect RNP particles not enclosed within membranes which complicates the interpretation of these data. To address this question, we previously developed buoyant density-based methods to separate EVs from non-vesicular aggregates and found that EVs form two distinct populations of high and low buoyant density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Temoche-Diaz et al., 2020</xref>). We found that some miRNAs are selectively enriched in a high buoyant density vesicle fraction characterized by an enrichment in the exosomal marker protein CD63, whereas the low buoyant density EVs are fairly non-selective in the capture of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Temoche-Diaz et al., 2019</xref>). We developed a cell-free reaction to identify YBX1 as required for miR223 sorting into exosomes and demonstrated that it plays an important role in the enrichment of miR223 into exosomes in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>). We subsequently found that phase separated YBX1 condensates selectively recruit miR223 in vitro and sort it into exosomes in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we report that YBX1 directly and specifically binds miR223 by its ‘cold shock’ domain (CSD). We have identified a sequence motif, UCAGU, that facilitates the sorting of miR223 into exosomes. We also found a significant fraction of cytoplasmic miR223 localized within mitochondria, tightly associated with the mitochondrial envelope and that a mitochondrial RNA-binding protein, YBAP1, may control the transfer of miR223 from mitochondria to exosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>YBX1 directly and specifically binds miR223</title><p>We previously documented that YBX1 facilitates miR223 sorting into exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>) and that exosomal miR223 is decreased in YBX1 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).

To examine the direct interaction of YBX1 and miR223, we used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with purified recombinant YBX1, expressed in insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>), and chemically synthetic miR223 and miR190, a cytoplasmic miRNA that is not enriched in exosomes. Purified YBX1 was titrated and incubated with 5’ fluorescently labeled miR223 at 30 ℃ for 30 min. miR223-YBX1 complexes were separated by electrophoresis and detected by in-gel fluorescence. The EMSA data showed that YBX1 directly and specifically bound to miR223, but ~140 fold less well with miR190 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>). The measured Kd for YBX1:miR223 was 4.2 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>YBX1 has three major domains including an N-terminal alanine/proline-rich (A/P) domain, a central cold shock domain (CSD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). To explore which specific domain of YBX1 binds miR223, we constructed a series of fragments: the A/P domain, CSD and CTD. The YBX1 fragments were expressed in and purified from insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). EMSA data showed that the A/P domain and CTD had little or no affinity for miR223, whereas the CSD domain bound miR223 but with an affinity much reduced compared to full length YBX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). We then constructed two combined fragments of the A/P and CSD and CSD and CTD domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). The EMSA data showed that the A/P domain was dispensable, whereas binding of miR223 to CSD plus CTD was comparable to full-length YBX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>).</p><p>YBX1-F85A in the CSD domain was reported to block the YBX1-specific binding of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>). Purified YBX1-F85A protein failed to bind miR223 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). These data suggest that YBX1 directly and specifically binds miR223 via the CSD. The CTD of YBX1 did not appear to bind miR223 but may somehow facilitate a higher affinity interaction of the CSD with miR223.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A binding or structural motif on miR223 that promotes interaction with YBX1 and enrichment into exosomes</title><p>We next sought to determine the miR223 sequence motif responsible for interaction with YBX1 and enrichment into exosomes. We used an EMSA competition assay with a series of miR223 mutants. Purified YBX1 and 5’ fluorescently labeled miR223 were incubated with miR223 mutant constructs titrated in a range from 1 nM to 1 μM. miR223 variants in a binding domain should not compete for interaction of YBX1 with 5’ fluorescently tagged miR223 whereas variations in sequences irrelevant to interaction would compete. Using this EMSA competition assay to screen the miR223 binding motif, we found that the competitive binding of miR223mut (3-6) and miR223mut (4-7) were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggested that the sequence UCAGU was critical for interaction with YBX1. To test this directly, we employed a variant sequence, termed miR223mut, where the UCAGU was substituted with AGACA. As a positive control, we employed a variant of miR190, miR190sort, where the sequence AUAUG was substituted with UCAGU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). EMSA data showed a~27-fold reduced YBX1 interaction of with miR223mut, whereas the affinity of miR190sort with YBX1 was increased ~eightfold compared to wt sequences.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>miR223 sequence motif UCAGU binds YBX1.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to miR223, miR190 and versions with mutated sorting motif (miR223mut) or mutation to introduce the sorting motif (miR190sort).

Here we report the role of the RNA-binding protein YBX1 and a sorting or structural signal on one target RNA, miR223, and the indirect path miR223 may take from storage in mitochondria into exosomes.</p><p>We have identified a sequence motif on miR223, UCAGU, responsible for high-affinity interaction with YBX and for sorting into vesicles formed in a cell-free reaction as well as for secretion in exosomes by HEK293 cells. Previously we performed this in vitro packaging assay in the presence of an inhibitor (GW4869) of neutral sphingomyelinase (NS2).

The C-terminal domain (CTD) includes an intrinsically disordered domain (IDR) that promotes the formation of a liquid-liquid phase separation likely responsible for the organization of YBX1 in P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). This domain does not itself interact with RNA, but it appears to facilitate the folding or stabilization of the CSD to promote high affinity binding to miR223.</p><p>In other work using a similar approach, we identified two separate sorting signals, a 5’UGGA and a 3’UUU, on miR122 to which the RNA-binding protein La binds <italic>en route</italic> to secretion in exosomes by the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Temoche-Diaz et al., 2019</xref>).

In some cases these RNAs, such as tRNAs, serve an essential function such as in mitochondrial protein synthesis, however, for miRNAs with no obvious mitochondrial genome target, the function remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jeandard et al., 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, others have documented the localization of these miRNAs enclosed within the mitochondrion and in the case of miR223, it appears to be tightly associated with the inner membrane. The exact organization and function of miR223 in this location remains to be investigated but in the context of exosomal secretion, the mitochondrial localization appears to serve as a reservoir.</p><p>In relation to the mitochondrial localization of miR223, we found a mitochondrial RNA-binding protein, YBAP1, that copurified with a tagged form of YBX1 expressed in HEK293 cells. YBAP1 has previously been reported to interact with YBX1 and independently found associated with mitochondria where its localization is dependent on an N-terminal transit peptide sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Muta et al., 1997</xref>). The association of mitochondrial YBAP1 and cytoplasmic YBX1 was reproduced by coexpression of recombinant forms of the two proteins in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). YBAP1 binds miR223 selectively but with an affinity significantly below that of YBX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h–j</xref>). Although YBX1 does not localize to the mitochondrion, the stable interaction of the complex may suggest a transient relationship, perhaps during the biogenesis of YBAP1 as it transits from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrion.</p><p>A functional relationship between YBAP1 and YBX1 is suggested by the reduction in miR223 in mitochondria and increase in secretion of miR223 in exosomes secreted from YBAP1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, removal of mitochondria by treatment of cells with CCCP resulted in an increase in cytoplasmic miR223 at the expense of secretion in exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although YBAP1 may facilitate the retention of miR223 within mitochondria, mitochondrial RNA import and export may serve an independent role in the selective capture of miRNAs by YBX1 in cytoplasmic P-body condensates. YBX1 puncta appear to shuttle between mitochondria and endosomes at which point miR223 bound to YBX1 may be further sorted into invaginations budding into the interior of endosomes.</p><p>The highly selective nature of miRNA sorting and secretion in exosomes suggests an important role in the trafficking of miRNAs between cells.

YBX1 puncta may give rise to small particles carrying miR223 for uptake into endosomes and secretion in exosomes.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85878-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (Spodoptera frugiperda)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sf9</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell culture facility at UC Berkeley</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK 293T cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell culture facility at UC Berkeley</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK 293T-YBX1 KO cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Obtained by CRISPR-Cas9 in Schekman Lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK 293T-YBAP1 KO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Obtained by CRISPR-Cas9 in Schekman Lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK 293T-3xHA-EGFP-OMP25</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Obtained by overexpression of pLJM1-3XHA-EGFP-OMP25 in Schekman lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">U-2OS cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell culture facility at UC Berkeley</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">U-2OS Parkin-GFP cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Obtained by overexpression of Parkin-GFP in Schekman lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pFastBac His6 MBP N10 TEV LIC cloning vector (4 C)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_30116">Addgene_30116</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tom22-mCherry (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift of Dr Li Yu lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">His-MBP-YBX1 (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">To express YBX1 in insect cells.

Subsequently, PMSF was added to a final concentration of 1 mM, along with a protease inhibitor cocktail, and the sample was incubated on ice for 5 min. Next, 2.5 units of RNase ONE (Promega) was added to the sample, which was further incubated on a rotating mixer at room temperature for 15 min. For protein analysis, the sample was eluted directly in the SDS loading buffer. Alternatively, Trizol was added to the sample to stop the reaction for RNA purification.</p><p>To assess their quality, we assayed the immunoprecipitated mitochondria for the following protein markers by immunoblotting using the rabbit primary antibodies- anti-HA (1:1000), anti-COX IV (1:1000), anti-TOM20 (1:1000), anti-Citrate Synthase (1:1000), anti-RAB5 (1:1000), anti-LAMP1 (1:2000), anti-GAPDH (1:5000), and anti-GRP78 (Abcam) (1:3000).

The evidence supporting the findings is convincing and opens avenues for future studies on molecular mechanisms. This paper is a valuable addition to the cellular sorting of miRNA involving interplay with and between the organelles, interesting for miRNAs researchers, as well as cell biologists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85878.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Chacinska</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01dr6c206</institution-id><institution>IMol Polish Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Smirnov</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00pg6eq24</institution-id><institution>University of Strasbourg</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2023.01.11.523558">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.11.523558v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alexandre Smirnov (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It would be helpful to provide, in Materials and methods, the sequences of all miR mutants used in this study, including those in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1. This would permit the reader to better appreciate to what extent the sequences and the structures of these transcripts could have contributed to the observed outcomes. I would also suggest enrolling a few additional miRNA mutants that preserve a similar amount of secondary structure – to clearly dissociate these contributions and better pinpoint the potential sequence motif.</p><p>2. The in vitro RNA packaging assay is a very interesting and powerful method that strongly resembles mitochondrial RNA import assays. Does the &quot;membrane fraction&quot; used in this assay eventually contain mitochondria? Can it affect the interpretation of the data? Additionally, it is not clear how the authors establish that exosome-related vesicles are actually formed in this assay. This point deserves a more detailed explanation.</p><p>3. I would suggest adding to Materials and methods a section about miRNA labelling and the microscopy shown in Figure 3a. The inclusion of additional controls (e.g. ATTO-labelled miR190) could be useful in assessing the specificity of the observed colocalisation with mitochondria.</p><p>4. The fractionation experiments described in Figure 3b-e would benefit from additional RNA controls. U6 snRNA is a good, well-behaved nuclear marker. It would be important to include more cytoplasmic transcripts, especially small ones, and compare their enrichment in mitoplasts with that of miR223 and the COX1 mRNA. This could provide a better idea about the degree of cytosolic contamination of these preparations.</p><p>5. Could the Parkin/CCCP treatment have induced miR223 transcription? This might have contributed to its increased intracellular levels. Were the YBX1 or YBAP1 cellular levels changed during this treatment?</p><p>6. To provide further support to the existence of a YBX1-YBAP1 complex in intact cells, the authors might consider using an in situ (e.g. FLIM-FRET or proximity ligation assay) or an in vivo (fluorescence complementation, BioID or similar) approach. Similarly, crosslinking miR223 to YBAP1 could be a way to further confirm this interaction in vivo.</p><p>7. Did the authors observe the same strong phenotype in YBAP1 KO cells as was frequently described in the literature (e.g. the already mentioned paper by Yagi et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2012)? Figure 5b could be supplemented with probing for YBX1 and a few mitochondrial marker proteins (especially those expressed from the mitochondrial genome and/or involved in the respiratory chain) to reflect the physiological state of the organelles.</p><p>A few textual suggestions:</p><p>L. 59: &quot;density-based methods to separate&quot;.</p><p>Ll. 94-95: The sentence &quot;The EMSA data showed…&quot; is a bit confusing. Maybe add a comma after &quot;miR223&quot;.</p><p>Ll. 108-109: &quot;Figure 1g&quot;. The conclusion that CTD may facilitate the folding of CSD does not immediately follow from this experiment (CTD could instead provide an extension to the RNA-binding site and thereby boost the CSD affinity). Some extra context is required to draw such a conclusion (e.g. previous studies that excluded CTD from RNA binding).</p><p>L. 127: Given the setup of the experiment shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1, it would be safer to conclude that &quot;the competitive binding of miR223mut (3-6) and miR223mut (4-7) was decreased&quot;. One cannot fully disentangle thermodynamic (affinity, Kd) and kinetic (kon) factors in these experiments: these mutants might be simply slower to bind.</p><p>Ll. 133-136: This sentence could be revised for clarity and accompanied by a reference to Figure 2b, c.</p><p>Ll. 140-141: It is not clear what &quot;~4-fold dependent on the putative exosomal sorting motif&quot; means. The reference should be to &quot;Figure 2e&quot;.</p><p>Ll. 176-177: A better way to render it would be &quot;Analysis of RNA extracted from isolated membranous organelles&quot;.</p><p>Ll. 180 and 325: The term &quot;organization&quot; is not quite appropriate here. Why not &quot;localization&quot;?</p><p>Ll. 201-203: It is difficult to understand how the experiment described in the previous paragraph resulted in the conclusion that &quot;miR223 is enclosed within mitochondria&quot;. The described treatments support its partial association with mitochondrial membranes, but do not permit to establish whether miR223 was membrane-bound on the interior or the exterior side of the organelles.</p><p>L. 204: The experiment described in this section is not really looking at the &quot;cellular location of miR223 within cells&quot;. It is more about the distribution between the cell and the extracellular milieu upon mitochondrial depletion.</p><p>Ll. 583-584: Could it be &quot;hsa-miR-223-3p&quot; and &quot;hsa-miR-190-5p&quot;?</p><p>L. 664: The reference &quot;Rio et al., 2014&quot; seems to be missing.</p><p>L. 916: &quot;overexpressed in HEK293T cells&quot;.</p><p>L. 919: The formula &quot;transfected with YBAP1-GFP&quot; is potentially misleading. Were the cells transfected with a YBAP1-GFP-expressing plasmid?</p><p>Ll. 929, 953, 956: &quot;standard deviations&quot;.</p><p>The definition of the error bars and the sample sizes are missing in some figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some of the sentences within the manuscript are massive run-ons and take several reads to understand what is being said.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I detail below a few suggestions for additional experiments.</p><p>The IF images of figure 6 are only showing 2 P-bodies moving between mitochondria and enlarged endosomes. This observation does not demonstrate that such movement is instrumental in the transfer of miR223 between mitochondria and putative exosomes (Figure 6 and model in figure 7). At least repeating these experiments with a fluorescence staining of miR223 must be performed.</p><p>The experiments analysing exosomes or EVs and their content in miR223 should systematically include quantification of the actual number of vesicles released by the modified cells, to determine whether the decrease of miR223 is due to the general decrease of EVs or to the actual loading of miR in the EVs, and also with quantification of the miR190, which is not supposed to behave like miR223, both should be shown in panels of principal figures (figures 1a, 3a, 3c, 3j, 4c, 4g, 5c, 5d: miR190; figures 1a, 3i and 5a: number of vesicles, and especially of CD63-exosome enriched versus CD9 or CD81-plasma membrane-derived EV enriched, released per cell upon ko or CCCP treatment).</p><p>Also, it is unclear at several steps why the authors call the EVs they analyse &quot;exosomes&quot; since they seem to analyse a mixture of small EVs that float into a sucrose gradient at the interface of 10 and 40% sucrose. The authors have published several previous articles exploring the MVB association of YBX1 using different approaches, but it is unclear what criteria they use here to decide that the analysis shown is specific to exosomes. In their previous work on HEK293 (Shurtleff 2016), the authors had specifically isolated CD63-positive EVs from this mixture, and given the strong steady-state enrichment of CD63 in MVBs, had considered these vesicles as mainly consisting of exosomes. In a further article performed on another human cell line, MDA-MB-231 (Temoche-Diaz 2019), the authors performed a very resolutive density gradient, and showed the existence of separate populations of EVs, enriched in CD9 or CD63, but not both, and floating at different densities. Finally, in the most recent publication (Liu 2021), the authors observed YBX1 association with the high-density EVs containing CD63, however, I did not see a demonstration in this previous article that YBX1 was absent in the low-density CD9-bearing EVs. In the current work, the authors use the basic gradient, and both high and low-density EVs are most likely recovered in the 10/40% interface of the sucrose gradient used here. In fact, the Materials and methods use the term &quot;extracellular vesicles&quot; without specifying &quot;exosomes&quot;. Thus, I would suggest that the authors justify clearly why they consider their mixed EV preparation to be exosomes, if necessary they can summarize the major results of their previous work that lead them to conclude that they focus on exosomes in the current work, and if justification is not convincing, they should instead change their nomenclature to use the generic term EVs.</p><p>Another issue is that the authors make strong conclusions on MVBs and exosomes when they only analyse artificially-enlarged endosomes induced by overexpression of mutant Rab5. Although this approach has been used previously and shown CD63 in these induced enlarged compartments, it is an artificial blocking of normal endosomal trafficking. These observations of YBX1 P-bodies must be confirmed by comparing them with actual regular CD63-positive MVBs of WT (versus YBX1ko, YBAP1 ko or CCCP-treated) cells. These immunofluorescence experiments are also not quantified, and the behaviour of YBX1 in the non-P-body locations, which could be close to the plasma membrane (labeled by e.g. cd9 or CD81) and influence the miR content of EVs budding from the plasma membrane should be analysed.</p><p>Finally, all bar graphs must be replaced by representations displaying the position of the individual biological replicates, so the reader can visualize the reproducibility of the experiments.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>In the parkin-GFP cells, is miR223 also accumulated in mitochondria, and how does the CCCP treatment affect this localization? I would have expected the disappearance (degradation) of miR223 together with the disappearance of mitochondria in the CCCP condition, but the miR223 quantification in cells suggests instead an accumulation in the cytosol: can the authors document this hypothesis by immunofluorescence as in Figure 3A? Concerning the EV/exosome release, I would expect the mitochondrial absence to globally prevent the release of EVs (because of lack of energy), rather than specifically controlling miR223 targeting EVs.</p><p>Small EVs containing mitochondrial components (mitovesicles) have been recently described in the literature (D'Acunzo, Sci Adv 2021): could such vesicles be involved in the targeting of miR223 to small EVs, rather than the P-body-mediated process suggested by the authors?</p><p>Results of Figure 2 show that the UCAGU sequence of miR223 contributes to the binding to YXB1, however, it is not &quot;critical&quot; (line 154) but instead only partial since the mutated miR223 and miR190sort have the equivalent binding ability and 50 times lower than that of miR223: do the authors speculate that other parts of the miR223 sequence are involved in binding to YBX1?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85878.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Although we cannot cleanly distinguish the effects of sequence and secondary structure influences in the interaction of YBX1 and miR223, the results of our analysis of the mutant sequence variants on sorting of wt and mutant miR223 and wt and mutant miR190 were consistent in the binding assay and in the exosome secretion of mutant vs wt miRNAs expressed in transfected cells. We have modified our manuscript in reference to the sorting signal to indicate this may be a sequence or structural feature of miR223.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This point deserves a more detailed explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We too were concerned about this possibility. This issue was addressed in Shurtleff et al., (2016) where an independent assay of CD63-luciferase internalization in the cell-free reaction was used to assess a common requirement for the packaging of CD63 and miR223. We performed this in vitro packaging assay in the presence of an inhibitor (GW4869) of neutral sphingomyelinase (NS2). This inhibitor has been shown to reduce the secretion of exosomes and exosome-associated miRNAs in other studies (Li et al., 2013; Trajkovic et al., 2008; Yuyama et al., 2012). In our cell-free assay, GW4869 inhibited the protection of CD63-luciferase and miR-223 at concentrations known to inhibit the activity of NS2 in partially purified enzyme fractions (Shurtleff et al., 2016 Figure 3 and 4D). We concluded that our cell-free reaction provides a model that mimics aspects of exosome biogenesis. This published finding is now summarized in the Results and Discussion section.</p><p>Additionally, we attempted to import miR-223 into purified mitochondria under the same conditions, but we did not observe successful import (JS, data not shown). In conclusion, the in vitro packaging assay primarily mimics exosome-related vesicle biogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The inclusion of additional controls (e.g. ATTO-labelled miR190) could be useful in assessing the specificity of the observed colocalisation with mitochondria.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up the issue regarding the dye. We performed the localization experiment using transfected Atto-647N-labeled miR190 and observed fluorescence colocalized with mitochondria consistent with the reviewer suggestion that the Atto-647 dye itself may have a propensity for mitochondrial localization. We have replaced Figure 3a with a new experiment using mitochondrial immunoprecipitation to localize mi223. Immunoprecipitated mitochondria subjected to osmotic shock to generate mitoplasts confirmed that miR223, but not miR190 or U6, is highly enriched in mitoplasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This could provide a better idea about the degree of cytosolic contamination of these preparations.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, U6 is a widely used miRNA control in many studies. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that miR-1 is enriched in mitochondria, the authors also used U6 as a small RNA control (Zhang et al., 2014). In our experiments, miR190 has been used as a cytosolic small RNA marker. In our mito-IP experiment, we did not observe enrichment of miR190 in the mitochondria or mitoplasts, which suggests the absence of cytosolic contamination in these samples. Furthermore, we did not detect the presence of tubulin or GAPDH in the mitochondria or mitoplast samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Could the Parkin/CCCP treatment have induced miR223 transcription? This might have contributed to its increased intracellular levels. Were the YBX1 or YBAP1 cellular levels changed during this treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot rule out the possibility that upregulation of miR223 is directly caused by CCCP treatment. Nonetheless, our data suggests that mitochondria contribute to the secretion of miR223 into exosomes. When mitochondria are removed by mitophagy, cytosolic miR223 is not efficiently secreted, which provides an alternative explanation for the observed increase in miR223 level after mitochondrial removal.</p><p>During CCCP treatment, the level of YBX1 remained unchanged, indicating that it is not affected by mitochondrial removal. On the other hand, YBAP1 was nearly eliminated upon CCCP treatment (Author respond image1). We have now included an additional result using a CD63-luciferase marker to show that CCCP treatment did not change the level of exosome secretion (Figure 3, supplement 2)</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85878-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The authors have published several previous articles exploring the MVB association of YBX1 using different approaches, but it is unclear what criteria they use here to decide that the analysis shown is specific to exosomes. In their previous work on HEK293 (Shurtleff 2016), the authors had specifically isolated CD63-positive EVs from this mixture, and given the strong steady-state enrichment of CD63 in MVBs, had considered these vesicles as mainly consisting of exosomes. In a further article performed on another human cell line, MDA-MB-231 (Temoche-Diaz 2019), the authors performed a very resolutive density gradient, and showed the existence of separate populations of EVs, enriched in CD9 or CD63, but not both, and floating at different densities. Finally, in the most recent publication (Liu 2021), the authors observed YBX1 association with the high-density EVs containing CD63, however, I did not see a demonstration in this previous article that YBX1 was absent in the low-density CD9-bearing EVs. In the current work, the authors use the basic gradient, and both high and low-density EVs are most likely recovered in the 10/40% interface of the sucrose gradient used here. In fact, the Materials and methods use the term &quot;extracellular vesicles&quot; without specifying &quot;exosomes&quot;. Thus, I would suggest that the authors justify clearly why they consider their mixed EV preparation to be exosomes, if necessary they can summarize the major results of their previous work that lead them to conclude that they focus on exosomes in the current work, and if justification is not convincing, they should instead change their nomenclature to use the generic term EVs.</p></disp-quote><p>In our first paper on exosome secretion, we demonstrated that miR223 was highly selectively packaged into exosomes (Shurtleff et al., 2016). We detected the presence of miR223 at each stage of the exosome purification using a buoyant density flotation method. Furthermore, this conclusion was confirmed through CD63 antibody IP where exosomes from a 20%-40% sucrose interface were enriched ~5 fold in miR223 content. In another previous paper we showed that low buoyant density CD9-positive EVs do not contain enriched miRNAs (Temoche-Diaz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). Thus, considering our previous published work, we believe that vesicles floating to a 20/40% sucrose interface enrich exosomes containing miR223.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue is that the authors make strong conclusions on MVBs and exosomes when they only analyse artificially-enlarged endosomes induced by overexpression of mutant Rab5. Although this approach has been used previously and shown CD63 in these induced enlarged compartments, it is an artificial blocking of normal endosomal trafficking. These observations of YBX1 P-bodies must be confirmed by comparing them with actual regular CD63-positive MVBs of WT (versus YBX1ko, YBAP1 ko or CCCP-treated) cells. These immunofluorescence experiments are also not quantified, and the behaviour of YBX1 in the non-P-body locations, which could be close to the plasma membrane (labeled by e.g. cd9 or CD81) and influence the miR content of EVs budding from the plasma membrane should be analysed.</p></disp-quote><p>In previous work, we demonstrated that Rab5(Q79L) expression leads to the formation of enlarged multivesicular endosomes containing numerous intraluminal vesicles containing CD63 and YBX1 (Liu et al., 2021). These endosomes exhibit a mixture of early and late endocytic markers, including CD63.

Additionally, another study conducted in our lab showed that CD9-positive, lower buoyant density vesicles (EVs) do not selectively sort miRNAs (Temoche-Diaz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019).</p><p>The quantification of YBX1 positive P-bodies in relation to mitochondria and endosomes is now included in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, All bar graphs must be replaced by representations displaying the position of the individual biological replicates, so the reader can visualize the reproducibility of the experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Individual biological replicates have been added in all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>In the parkin-GFP cells, is miR223 also accumulated in mitochondria, and how does the CCCP treatment affect this localization? I would have expected the disappearance (degradation) of miR223 together with the disappearance of mitochondria in the CCCP condition, but the miR223 quantification in cells suggests instead an accumulation in the cytosol: can the authors document this hypothesis by immunofluorescence as in Figure 3A? Concerning the EV/exosome release, I would expect the mitochondrial absence to globally prevent the release of EVs (because of lack of energy), rather than specifically controlling miR223 targeting EVs.</p></disp-quote><p>In U2OS cells stably expressing Parkin-GFP, miR223 was also enriched in mitochondria (Author response 4).</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85878-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We have observed that the levels of miR223 increase upon the removal of mitochondria using CCCP treatment. There are two potential explanations for this data. Firstly, it is possible that CCCP treatment directly increases the expression level of miR223. Secondly, when mitochondria are eliminated through mitophagy, miR223 may become resistant to degradation and consequently, not efficiently secreted. Both possibilities could account for the observed increase in miR223 levels after mitochondrial removal. A distinction between these two possibilities requires further investigation.We generated a U2OS-Parkin expressing cell line with stable expression of Nluc-CD63. We observed no significant change in the number of exosomes between the control cells and cells treated with CCCP (data has been included in Figure 3-supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Small EVs containing mitochondrial components (mitovesicles) have been recently described in the literature (D'Acunzo, Sci Adv 2021): could such vesicles be involved in the targeting of miR223 to small EVs, rather than the P-body-mediated process suggested by the authors?</p></disp-quote><p>Exosomes were isolated from 293T WT and YBAP1-KO cells using a flotation method.

We have now added discussion to indicate that other sequence or structural features of miR223 and miR190 may reinforce or interfere with YBX1 binding.</p></body></sub-article></article>
