Here, we show nutrition modulates the sleep-courtship balance and identify sleep-regulatory neurons downstream of P1 neurons. Yeast-deprived males exhibited attenuated female-induced nighttime sleep loss yet normal daytime courtship, which suggests male flies consider nutritional status in deciding whether the potential benefit of pursuing female partners outweighs the cost of losing sleep. Trans-synaptic tracing and calcium imaging identified dopaminergic neurons projecting to the protocerebral bridge (DA-PB) as postsynaptic partners of P1 neurons. Activation of DA-PB neurons led to reduced sleep in normally fed but not yeast-deprived males.

A widely accepted framework for understanding sleep regulation, called the two-process model, proposes that sleep is controlled by the circadian and homeostatic processes that convey information about the time of day and sleep drive, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borbély, 1982</xref>). However, since sleep prevents the execution of other critical behaviors such as feeding and mating, sleep is also influenced by motivational factors such as hunger and sex drive. For instance, sleep is suppressed by starvation in both rats and fruit flies, likely to allow the animal to forage for food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobs and McGinty, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keene et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, female sleep is reduced upon mating, presumably for egg-laying purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garbe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Isaac et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, we and others have shown that sleep is suppressed in favor of courtship when male flies are paired with females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckwith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Machado et al., 2017</xref>), demonstrating a competition between sleep and sex drive.</p><p>In addition to sleep and sex drive, both general and nutrient-specific hunger are important modulators of behavior. For instance, yeast deprivation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> alters food choice in favor of high-protein food over the normal preference for high-carbohydrate food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>). In addition, yeast provides essential nutrients for proper larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anagnostou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robertson, 1960</xref>), and the amount of yeast in the female diet correlates with the number of eggs laid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). Although the effects of dietary yeast on male reproduction are relatively modest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zajitschek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fricke et al., 2008</xref>), we hypothesized that it may have a stronger influence on the choice between sleep and reproductive behavior in male flies.</p><p>Whereas a number of neuronal populations that regulate sleep or courtship have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artiushin and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellendersen and von Philipsborn, 2017</xref>), only a few neuronal populations regulating both behaviors (i.e. sleep and courtship) are known. Among these, P1 neurons, which express the Fruitless<sup>M</sup> (Fru<sup>M</sup>) transcription factor and play a critical role in courtship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clyne and Miesenböck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manoli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stockinger et al., 2005</xref>), are also involved in male sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckwith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Machado et al., 2017</xref>). P1 neurons are known to receive male-specific arousal signal from octopaminergic MS1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Machado et al., 2017</xref>) and act both upstream and downstream of DN1 clock neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) to regulate the sleep-courtship balance. However, how P1 neurons communicate with downstream sleep circuits remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that the sleep-courtship balance in male flies is affected by yeast deprivation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and identify the protocerebral bridge (PB) as an arousal center acting downstream of P1 neurons. Yeast-deprived male flies exhibited attenuated female-induced nighttime sleep loss relative to normally fed males. In contrast, yeast deprivation did not impair the ability of males to court during the day, suggesting that dietary yeast affects the sleep-courtship balance rather than courtship per se. Using the trans-Tango trans-synaptic tracing technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Talay et al., 2017</xref>), we identified a pair of dopaminergic neurons projecting to the protocerebral bridge (DA-PB) as neurons acting downstream of the P1 cluster. Calcium imaging confirmed a functional connection between the two groups of neurons. Furthermore, activation of DA-PB neurons led to sleep suppression in normally fed but not yeast-deprived males. Through a screen of PB-arborizing neurons, we identified additional neurons that regulate sleep specifically in males. We conclude that male sleep suppression by female cues is strongly affected by nutritional conditions and that P1, DA-PB, and additional PB-projecting neurons form a neural circuit for integrating sleep and sex drives in males.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Yeast deprivation modulates the balance between sleep and courtship</title><p>We first examined whether nutritional status affects the balance between sleep and courtship in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males. Based on previous findings that 7 days of sucrose-only diet alters the internal state of male flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>), we assessed sleep in male-male (MM) or male-female (MF) pairs after 7 days of sucrose-only diet. We fed groups of control (iso31) flies 5% sucrose food or normal food (standard food for <italic>Drosophila</italic> maintenance, see Materials and methods) for 6 days, loaded the flies into tubes containing 5% sucrose in Male-Male (MM) or Male-Female (MF) pairs, and assessed sleep the next day using the single-beam <italic>Drosophila</italic> Activity Monitor (DAM) system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckwith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Machado et al., 2017</xref>), under the normal food condition, MF pairs showed a marked reduction in sleep compared with MM pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Strikingly, yeast-deprived MF pairs showed increased nighttime sleep (i.e. reduced sleep suppression) compared with normally fed MF pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). In contrast, yeast deprivation resulted in a small decrease in sleep in MM pairs and individual males, and had little effect on sleep in individual females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Sleep in MF pairs with yeast-deprived males was independent of the nutritional status of the females in the pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the effects of nutrition on MF sleep are due to its effects on male behavior. Since the present study is focused on the effects of male nutrition on male behavior, normally fed females were used in MF pairs in subsequent experiments.</p><p>To control for the possibility that the single-beam DAM system with a single infrared detector missed small movements in yeast-deprived flies, we examined the effects of yeast deprivation using the multi-beam DAM system containing 17 infrared detectors. The multi-beam DAM system has two modes of analyzing movements: ‘moves,’ which include only inter-beam movements (i.e. movements between beams), and ‘counts,’ which also include intra-beam movements (i.e. local movements within a single beam such as feeding and grooming). The latter analysis can underestimate sleep because of twitches that occur during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garbe et al., 2015</xref>). As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garbe et al., 2015</xref>), sleep measured with multi-beam monitors was lower than that measured with single-beam monitors, especially when both inter- and intra-beam movements (counts) were analyzed. Nevertheless, the effects of nutritional condition and social context on sleep were comparable between the two monitoring systems. As with single-beam data, multi-beam moves data showed that MF pairs with yeast-deprived males exhibited more nighttime sleep than normally fed MF pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,G</xref>), while yeast-deprived MM pairs slept less than normally fed MM pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Even the highly sensitive counts analysis showed that MF pairs with yeast-deprived males slept significantly more than the normally fed counterparts during nighttime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, video analysis of nighttime behavior confirmed that in MF pairs, yeast-deprived males slept significantly more than normally fed males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). There was a corresponding reduction in the time spent performing courtship by yeast-deprived males compared with males that were kept in normal food until the behavioral assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). These results show that the single-beam DAM system can reliably measure the effects of nutritional status on sleep. Since the single-beam DAM system has higher throughput than the multi-beam DAM system or video analysis, we used the single-beam DAM system for quantifying sleep in subsequent experiments.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-60853-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Male-female pairs at ZT 20 under infrared light.</title><p>Normally fed or yeast-deprived iso31 males were paired with normally fed female partners. While most normally fed males were courting, the majority of yeast-deprived males were inactive.</p></caption></media><p>To determine whether the effects of the diet manipulation on MF sleep were attributable to yeast availability, we assayed the effects of adding yeast to the 5% sucrose diet and observed that the addition of 2.75% yeast was sufficient to restore the characteristic nighttime sleep suppression in MF pairs in the normal food condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). Yeast contains both protein and lipids, and thus we next tested the effects of adding tryptone, a mixture of peptides generated by the tryptic digestion of casein, to the 5% sucrose diet. We found that the addition of 2.75% tryptone was sufficient to restore the normal nighttime sleep suppression in MF pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). Increasing the sucrose concentration to 7.75% to match the caloric content of 5% sucrose + 2.75% tryptone did not alter nighttime sleep in MF pairs compared to 5% sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>), suggesting that protein rather than caloric content is the important factor in regulating female-induced sleep loss. These data demonstrate that the balance between sleep and courtship in male flies is modulated by protein in dietary yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The effects of yeast deprivation on male sleep develop over multiple days but can be reversed within a few hours</title><p>In the experiments reported above, flies in the normal food condition were loaded into monitor tubes with 5% sucrose instead of normal food, because a pilot experiment suggested that food during sleep assay did not alter the effects of 6-day nutritional manipulations before the sleep assay. As a result, all flies were yeast deprived to some extent: either a little over a day (normal food condition) or a little over 7 days (yeast deprived condition) by the time of nighttime sleep assay. Therefore, our data suggest that yeast deprivation takes between 1 and 7 days to significantly impact male sleep. To examine the time course of the effects of yeast deprivation on sleep in more detail, we loaded normally fed males paired with females into monitor tubes containing either normal food or 5% sucrose food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Statistically significant differences in nighttime sleep between the two conditions appeared on the third night, and the difference was more pronounced on the fourth night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), demonstrating that the effects of yeast deprivation on male sleep takes ~3 days to develop.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The effects of yeast deprivation on male sleep develop over multiple days but can be reversed within a few hours.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the experimental design for (<bold>B</bold>) and (<bold>C</bold>). Normally fed MF pairs were loaded into tubes containing 5% sucrose or normal food between ZT 1–2, and sleep was assayed for six nights, starting at ZT 12 on the loading day.

These results demonstrate that the effects of yeast deprivation on male sleep can be reversed within a day of returning to a normal diet. To examine whether a shorter exposure to normal food would suffice to reverse the effects of yeast deprivation, we first loaded yeast-deprived males paired with females into tubes containing 5% sucrose. We then transferred the MF pairs to new tubes containing either normal food or 5% sucrose (to control for the effects of handling) within the last 20 min of the light period and assayed nighttime sleep following the transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

Under a normal nutritional condition, males forgo sleep to engage in courtship at night. However, nutritional restriction, which likely results in unfavorable reproductive outcomes, may tip the balance toward sleep. Alternatively, male flies may have difficulty courting and mating after an extended period of yeast deprivation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed courtship assays between ZT 1–4, when flies are generally awake. We paired virgin males and virgin females and measured the courtship index and latency under normally fed and yeast deprived conditions. Interestingly, no difference in courtship index or latency was found between the two nutritional conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Similarly, yeast-deprived males were as successful at copulation as their normally fed counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Since yeast deprivation impacts the balance between sleep and courtship, we examined whether the sleep-suppressive effects of P1 activation are modulated by nutrition. As observed previously, activation of P1 neurons using the P1 split Gal4 driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>) and the warmth-sensitive TrpA1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) resulted in decreased sleep in normally fed males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>).

However, little is known about the sleep circuit downstream of P1 neurons. DN1 clock neurons have been shown to act both upstream and downstream of P1 neurons for sleep regulation, but the DN1-P1 connections appear to be indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). To identify candidate neurons acting directly downstream of P1 for sleep regulation, we employed the trans-Tango trans-synaptic tracing technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Talay et al., 2017</xref>). By introducing genetically engineered ligand-receptor pairs, trans-Tango allows induction of mtdTomato expression in postsynaptic partners of defined presynaptic neurons. Several neuronal clusters were revealed by trans-Tango as potential postsynaptic partners of the P1 cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). They included PB-projecting neurons with descending projections in the midline.</p><p>We selected the PB-projecting neurons for further investigation for several reasons. First, the PB is a compartment of the central complex, a set of neuropils in the center of the brain, and has extensive connections with the other central complex compartments: the fan-shaped body (FB), ellipsoid body (EB), and noduli (NO). Notably, several groups of central complex neurons projecting to the FB and EB have been implicated in sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donlea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donlea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pimentel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ueno et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it seemed likely that the PB would also be involved in sleep regulation. Second, the entire population of PB-projecting neurons have been extensively characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Young and Armstrong, 2010</xref>), and only a single pair of PB-projecting neurons, named PB.b-LAL.s-PS.s, or LPsP, have descending projections in the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>). And lastly, the LPsP neurons correspond to the only pair of dopaminergic neurons that project to the PB, previously named T1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alekseyenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nässel and Elekes, 1992</xref>). This is particularly interesting because we found that sleep suppression by P1 activation requires dopaminergic signaling. When dopamine synthesis was inhibited by 3-Iodo-L-tyrosine (3IY), activation of P1 neurons did not suppress sleep in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>). Based on these considerations, we investigated whether the dopaminergic PB-projecting neurons, which we will refer to as DA-PB neurons, act downstream of P1 to balance sleep and courtship.</p><p>To confirm the anatomical connection between P1 and DA-PB neurons, we first determined whether P1 neurons send axonal projections to the PB. We expressed the presynaptic protein Synaptotagmin (Syt) fused with GFP in P1 neurons, and found a clear presence of Syt::GFP-marked presynaptic sites in the PB region, although the signal in this structure was not as strong as in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, we asked whether DA-PB neurons have dendrites in the PB. Previous morphological analysis suggested that DA-PB neurons contain both presynaptic and postsynaptic connections in the PB region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>). To confirm this, we simultaneously expressed the postsynaptic marker DenMark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nicolaï et al., 2010</xref>) and presynaptic GFP-tagged Syt protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>) in DA-PB neurons using a specific Split-Gal4 driver line (SS52578, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>). We found that the postsynaptic DenMark signal was present in the PB region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left image), confirming that DA-PB neurons are in a position to receive inputs from P1 neurons. The DenMark signal was also present in the lateral accessory lobe (LAL), and the presynaptic Syt::GFP signal was found mainly in the PB region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similar patterns of pre- and post-synaptic markers were observed in females, suggesting that these neurons are not sexually dimorphic at the gross morphological level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data, in combination with the trans-Tango data, suggest that DA-PB neurons are direct downstream partners of P1 neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Dopaminergic neurons projecting to the protocerebral bridge (DA-PB) act downstream of male-specific P1 neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal projection of an adult male brain in which Syt::GFP was driven by P1-spG4.

Examples include sleep suppression in migrating birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rattenborg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rattenborg et al., 2004</xref>), in male arctic sandpipers during an annual 3 week mating season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lesku et al., 2012</xref>), and in flies and worms during unexpected starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goetting et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keene et al., 2010</xref>). Another example are the Mexican cavefish, who live in an environment with limited and seasonal food availability. They show increased sleep upon starvation, suggesting that they sleep more during the dry season of food scarcity to conserve energy and sleep less during the wet season of relative food abundance to forage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaggard et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, we and others have previously shown that when presented with a female partner, <italic>Drosophila</italic> males forgo nighttime sleep to engage in courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckwith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Machado et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckwith et al., 2017</xref> further showed that male flies do not exhibit rebound sleep after prolonged wakefulness in the presence of females and that female pheromone can suppress male rebound sleep after sleep deprivation by mechanical stimulation. These results suggest that male sexual arousal can inhibit sleep even when sleep drive is high. We also showed previously that increased sleep drive (due to sleep deprivation) or reduced sex drive (due to recent copulations) tilts the sleep-courtship balance toward more sleep and less courtship during the night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Machado et al., 2017</xref>). Our present results show that yeast deprivation also tilts the balance toward more nighttime sleep.</p><p>Interestingly, yeast deprivation has little effect on daytime courtship in our study. Previous research on the effects of dietary yeast on male reproductive fitness found variable results depending on the experimental design. Yeast content had little or a non-monotonic influence on the number of offspring when males competed with other males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fricke et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, the amount of dietary yeast was negatively correlated with the number of offspring when no male-male competition was involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zajitschek et al., 2013</xref>). However, these studies did not include a condition where yeast was absent, and thus do not provide insights into yeast deprivation’s effects on male sexual performance. Our current data suggest that dietary yeast influences the male fly’s willingness to stay awake to engage in courtship at night, but does not impair their ability to court during the day when they are usually awake. Since yeast provides essential nutrients for larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becher et al., 2012</xref>), our findings suggest that flies engage in a sophisticated cost-benefit analysis that takes nutritional status into account in deciding whether the potential benefit of pursuing female partners is worth the cost of losing sleep.</p><p>Dietary yeast is the primary source of protein and lipids in the standard laboratory food for flies. Our finding that tryptone can substitute for yeast demonstrates that the effects of yeast deprivation are primarily due to the lack of protein. Previous studies have identified several neuronal populations that mediate the effects of dietary protein and amino acids on adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> behavior. These include dopaminergic Wedge neurons, EB Ring5 neurons, and peptidergic neurons expressing diuretic hormone-44, insulin-like peptide-2, or leucokinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ki and Lim, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yurgel et al., 2019</xref>). It would be interesting to determine whether these neurons are involved in modulating the sleep-courtship balance by nutrition. It is noteworthy that DA-PB neurons have been shown to regulate of male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alekseyenko et al., 2013</xref>). Male flies engage in aggressive behavior to compete for resources such as food and female partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>). DA-PB neurons may be involved in integrating pheromonal cues and nutritional status to regulate the balance between sleep and aggression or courtship, depending on the context.</p><p>A number of neuronal populations that regulate sleep have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artiushin and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tomita et al., 2017</xref>), and among them are two distinct populations in the central complex: EB R5 neurons and the dorsal FB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donlea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donlea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pimentel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ueno et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ueno et al., 2012</xref> showed that activation of dopaminergic PPM3 neurons projecting to the ventral FB leads to sleep suppression, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dag et al., 2019</xref> showed that ventral FB neurons can be sleep-promoting. Our results show that the PB region in the central complex is also involved in sleep regulation. Activation of DA-PB neurons, as well as P-EG neurons acting downstream of them to convey information from the PB to the EB, suppress sleep in males. It would be interesting to determine whether P-EG neurons interact with the previously described neurons projecting to the EB. Based on the present and previous data, we propose that P1, DA-PB, and P-EG neurons, as well as previously described octopaminergic MS1 neurons and DN1 clock neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Machado et al., 2017</xref>), form a male-specific sleep circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Our finding that DA-PB activation leads to sleep suppression in normally fed, but not yeast-deprived, males suggests that information about yeast availability is conveyed to the male sleep circuit at the level of DA-PB neurons or downstream of them. The information could be transmitted in the form of inhibitory inputs from neurons encoding yeast hunger or excitatory inputs from neurons encoding yeast satiety. Further research would be required to determine how information about yeast availability is integrated into the circuit.</p><p>Sleep is strongly influenced by monoaminergic neuromodulators, including dopamine, serotonin, and octopamine and its mammalian analog norepinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffith, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joiner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nall and Sehgal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). We previously showed that octopamine is a significant mediator of sleep suppression by male sex drive upstream of P1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Machado et al., 2017</xref>). Our present data show that dopamine signaling functions downstream of P1 neurons in the process. This is reminiscent of several studies showing that octopamine/norepinephrine acts upstream of dopaminergic neurons for diverse biological processes including memory, feeding, and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goertz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Octopamine/norepinephrine may provide an arousal signal that enhances dopaminergic control of motivated behaviors. A similarly layered signaling may underlie the integration of sleep and other motivated behaviors in flies and mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Log-rank tests were used for cumulative courtship initiation and copulation success rates in mating assays. D’Agostino and Pearson tests were used to test for normality. Non-normally distributed data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney tests. All experiments were repeated on at least two separate occasions using flies from independent genetic crosses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Modulation of sleep-courtship balance by nutritional status in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Leslie Griffith as Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ravi Allada (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below address clarity, data analysis and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Animal have many needs (feeding, reproduction, sleep) and fulfilling these needs simultaneously is not always possible. How the brain makes choices between sleep/wake, feast/fast, and mate/abstinence is poorly understood. The authors tackle this problem using <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They and others previously found that reproductive drive can reduce sleep in males. They now look at the effect of nutrition on the interaction between reproductive behavior and sleep. They show that poor nutrition overwhelm the effects of females on male sleep behavior. They go on to map the neural circuitry mediating the nutritional effects on sleep/mating trade off. Combining anatomical with functional tools, they identify circuit elements downstream of courtship neurons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the figures clear and easy to interpret. Placing both main and supplementary figures at their relevant positions in the text, made reviewing a lot less of a hassle. There were two main areas of concern that the authors should deal with to improve the study, one that requires reanalysis of data and one that requires additional discussion.</p><p>1) There was concern about the analysis of data in Figure 4 and several of the supplementary figures. In Figure 4 nighttime sleep is quantified and compared at 30 C. This means that activation and genetic effects are confounded. It would be best to quantify the difference in nighttime sleep (deltaSleep) for each genotype between 22 and 30 C and then compare them. It is particularly crucial in this experiment where it appears there is some effect of the genetic background but Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2 should also be re-analyzed this way.</p><p>This reanalysis may lead to changes in conclusions. In the panel 4G, normal food condition, it is not clear what the asterisks on top of the DA-PB&gt;TrpA1 condition represent. A difference relative to both parental controls, to one of them? In either case, the parental controls are very disparate which renders the result inconclusive rather than indicating that there is no sleep loss. Should, after the re-analysis mentioned suggested above the parental controls differ from the test condition in different directions, the text should be adjusted to reflect that.</p><p>2) The reviewers felt that there should be more discussion about the specifics of the food effects. The tryptone experiment leads the authors to conclude that &quot;These data demonstrate that the balance between sleep and courtship in male flies is modulated by protein in dietary yeast&quot;. However, it is not clear they can exclude the possibility that the effect has to do with caloric density regardless of the source of calories. This should be mentioned and conclusions tempered. Reviewers were also interested in hearing more in the Discussion about the functional impact of yeast deprivation on reproduction and why the effects are modest, given the effects on sleep.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60853.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the figures clear and easy to interpret.

As the original DA-PB activation data were inconclusive when delta-sleep was analyzed, we performed further experiments. In the original data, the parental controls showed strong sleep suppression at 30ºC, potentially masking the arousing effects of DA-PB activation. Therefore, we used a lower temperature (29ºC) to activate TrpA1 and kept the flies at 29ºC for two days to compensate for the potentially lower TrpA1 activation levels. DA-PB resulted in significantly greater sleep loss on the 2<sup>nd</sup> night at 29ºC compared with both parental controls in normally fed males but not in yeast-deprived males (new Figure 6).</p><p>Regarding Figure 4G (new Figure 6G), the asterisk was meant to indicate that DA-PB females were significantly different from both parental controls. We now explicitly state that sleep in the experimental females was different from both controls, but in opposite directions (subsection “DA-PB neurons regulate male sleep in a sex- and nutrition-dependent manner”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers felt that there should be more discussion about the specifics of the food effects. The tryptone experiment leads the authors to conclude that &quot;These data demonstrate that the balance between sleep and courtship in male flies is modulated by protein in dietary yeast&quot;. However, it is not clear they can exclude the possibility that the effect has to do with caloric density regardless of the source of calories. This should be mentioned and conclusions tempered. Reviewers were also interested in hearing more in the Discussion about the functional impact of yeast deprivation on reproduction and why the effects are modest, given the effects on sleep.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concern and performed additional experiments to address it. We show that 7.75% sucrose food, which is equivalent to 5% sucrose + 2.75% tryptone in caloric content, does not alter nighttime sleep in MF pairs compared to 5% sucrose (updated Figure 1K, L). This result further supports the idea that dietary protein modulates the balance between sleep and courtship.</p><p>Regarding the impact of yeast deprivation on reproduction, we are aware of two studies that examined the effects of dietary yeast on male reproductive fitness. Zajitschek et al., 2012, and Fricke et al., 2008, tested the effects of increasing dietary yeast content on male fitness, measured as the number of lifetime offspring (Zajitschek et al.) or as the paternity share of the males when females were allowed to copulate with other males (Fricke et al.). Fricke et al. found either no effect of yeast proportion or a bell-shaped dose response, depending on the experimental design. On the other hand, Zajitschek et al. found a negative correlation between dietary yeast content and the number of offspring. However, these studies focused on varying yeast content and did not assess the effects of a yeast-free diet. In our research, yeast deprivation substantially impacted nighttime sleep and courtship, but little influence on daytime courtship and mating. These findings suggest that yeast-deprived males are willing and able to perform reproductive behavior when awake (they are generally awake between ZT 1 and ZT 4). At night, flies are generally asleep, and yeast-deprived males may choose not to sacrifice their sleep to pursue female partners since the courtship is unlikely to result in viable progeny. We revised the Discussion section to incorporate these considerations (Discussion, second paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
