Researchers regularly use a type of fruit fly called <italic>Drosophila</italic> to study development because it is small, it has a short lifespan, and its whole genome sequence is already known. The development of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo starts with the nucleus of the fertilized egg, which contains most of the cell’s genetic material, dividing 13 times in quick succession, without the cell itself splitting. These divisions are amongst the fastest known for any animal, and given the fast developmental speed, the embryo must efficiently express all genes it needs to stay alive. Because cell division is known to inhibit gene expression this raises an interesting conundrum about the way fast cell proliferation and gene expression are coordinated.</p><p>The first step of gene expression involves a length of DNA being transcribed to produce an intermediate molecule called a messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated to produce a protein. However, some mRNA molecules contain regions called ‘introns’ that are not translated and must instead be removed via a time-consuming process called ‘splicing’ before the protein is produced.</p><p>At first a <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo uses mRNA molecules that were spliced and packaged inside the egg by the mother, but later it starts to make its own mRNA molecules. The very first mRNA molecules made by the early embryo tend to be short and lack introns. The shortness of these molecules is thought to reflect the fact there is not enough time to produce longer mRNA molecules. Is the same ‘need for speed’ also responsible for the lack of introns in these molecules?</p><p>Now, Guilgur et al. have tested this hypothesis by manipulating a gene named <italic>fandango</italic>, which codes for part of the cellular machinery that removes introns from mRNA molecules, in fruit flies. These mutant fruit flies had less of the Fandango protein than wild-type flies and while they passed through the early stages of development normally, they later developed defects—such as abnormally shaped cells. Guilgur et al. revealed that <italic>fandango</italic> mutants fail to splice out the introns in the mRNA molecules that are made in the early embryo, whereas similar mRNA molecules from the mother were spliced as normal. Further experiments suggested that wild-type embryos struggled to correctly splice an untypical early gene that had multiple introns.</p><p>Together the findings of Guilgur et al. suggest that when nuclei (or cells) are dividing rapidly, there is a strong selective pressure to splice mRNA molecules quickly in the short time between the divisions. Furthermore, this pressure appears to have shaped the architecture of the earliest genes expressed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, which is why the first mRNA molecules produced by the embryo itself tend not to contain introns.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02181.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02181.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>fast development</kwd><kwd>early zygotic gene</kwd><kwd>mRNA splicing</kwd><kwd>Prp19/NTC</kwd><kwd>Syf1/Xab2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (Portugal)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/SAU-BID/111796/2009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinho</surname><given-names>Rui Gonçalo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (Portugal)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BIA-BCM/111822/ 2009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinho</surname><given-names>Rui Gonçalo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (Portugal)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BBB-BQB/0712/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinho</surname><given-names>Rui Gonçalo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (Portugal)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PEst-OE/EQB/LA0023/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinho</surname><given-names>Rui Gonçalo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (Portugal)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BPD/47957/2008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guilgur</surname><given-names>Leonardo Gastón</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (Portugal)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BPD/63869/2009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liszekova</surname><given-names>Denisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The need for efficient pre-RNA splicing during early embryonic development of Drosophila indicates that the constraints imposed by the cell cycle are a force capable of driving changes in Eukaryotic gene architecture.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Timing and coordination of biological processes is crucial for cellular homeostasis and normal development. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryonic development starts with thirteen nuclear divisions without cytokinesis (syncytial blastoderm), these divisions being among the fastest known for any animal embryonic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> syncytial blastoderm formation relies on the maternally encoded gene products loaded into the egg during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). After fertilization, as nuclei enter interphase 14, the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT) occurs in which the soma suddenly becomes transcriptionally active and many of the maternally encoded gene products are rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Lengyel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McKnight and Miller, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yasuda et al., 1991</xref>). While the major burst of zygotic transcription occurs once the nuclei arrest in interphase 14, there is an initial wave of zygotic gene expression during the syncytial nuclear divisions 8–13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pritchard and Schubiger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">ten Bosch et al., 2006</xref>). Due to the extreme speed of syncytial nuclear divisions, a limitation to the size of early zygotic transcriptional units has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McKnight and Miller, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rothe et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shermoen and O’Farrell, 1991</xref>). Consistently, approximately 70% of early zygotic genes are small in size and intronless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>). As only 20% of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes are intronless, it has been proposed that small intronless genes have an important selective advantage for transcription during the syncytial blastoderm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and human cells, pre-mRNA splicing is mostly co-transcriptional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ameur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khodor et al., 2011</xref>), with in vivo splicing rates being in the order of 30 s to approximately 3 min once the intron is transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huranova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>). As most early zygotic transcripts are intronless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>), syncytial blastoderm interphases can be as short as 4 to 5 min, and given the fact that mitosis inhibits splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shin and Manley, 2002</xref>), we hypothesized that further to the selective pressure for small transcriptional units, there is also a pressure to avoid pre-mRNA splicing during early zygotic expression. We isolated two mutant alleles for a subunit of the NTC/Prp19 complexes, known to be important for efficient spliceosome activation, which specifically impaired pre-mRNA splicing of early zygotic but not maternally encoded transcripts. We showed that the differential splicing defects were not related to any particular structure/sequence of the early zygotic transcripts or differential association of spliceosomal components to the NTC/Prp19 complexes. Ectopic maternal expression of an early zygotic transcript in a mutant background was sufficient to suppress its splicing defects, suggesting that they were dependent on the developmental context of gene expression. We reasoned that constraints on pre-mRNA splicing are present during <italic>Drosophila</italic> early embryonic development. Consistently, a small early zygotic transcript with four introns was poorly spliced in wild-type embryos. Such constraints on pre-mRNA splicing are a likely explanation why most early zygotic genes are intronless and suggest that highly proliferative tissues need coordination between cell cycle and gene architecture for correct gene expression and avoidance of abnormally processed transcripts. Our results strongly argue in favor of a developmental pre-requisite for highly efficient splicing during fast development, therefore we propose that the requirement for overall splicing efficiency is likely to vary during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Fandango/Xab2 is required for blastoderm cellularization</title><p>Previously we isolated a collection of maternal mutants defective in blastoderm cellularization and/or germ-band extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pimenta-Marques et al., 2008</xref>). Complementation group 7 contained two different mutant alleles with similar defects in blastoderm cellularization. Through deficiency mapping and a candidate gene approach we concluded that both were allelic to the uncharacterized coding gene CG6197 (Flybase). To confirm the mutants’ identity, we rescued their zygotic lethality, female sterility (germ-line clones), and blastoderm cellularization defects (maternal mutant embryos) using a genomic fragment construct that contained a wild-type copy of CG6197 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, data not shown).

Hence, splicing of two or more introns requires more time than transcription and becomes rate limiting. Consistent with the hypothesis of a temporal constraint on pre-mRNA splicing, when the <italic>4x intron kuk-LacZ</italic> construct was zygotically expressed, the splicing defects of the firstly transcribed 5′-localized introns (Int1 and Int2) were significantly weaker than those observed in the later transcribed 3′-localized introns (Int3 and Int4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Importantly, maternal expression of this construct was sufficient to significantly suppress its splicing defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Real-time qPCR analysis showed that these constructs were equivalently zygotically and maternally expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,F</xref>). This suggested that splicing did not quantitatively impair early zygotic transcription, which was consistent with the observation that the rates of transcriptional elongation proceed independently of splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brody et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We showed that in wild-type embryos pre-mRNA splicing imposed significant constraints on early zygotic expression, which is a likely explanation why most early zygotic genes are intronless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>). Although a moderate decrease in the length of syncytial blastoderm interphases (seen in <italic>grapes</italic> mutant embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sibon et al., 1997</xref>]) was not sufficient to induce splicing defects in otherwise wild-type embryos (data not shown), we hypothesize that avoidance of pre-mRNA splicing during early zygotic expression is a consequence of the extremely short interphases and frequent mitotic cycles.

This suggests that highly proliferative tissues need coordination between cell cycle and gene architecture for correct gene expression and avoidance of abnormally processed transcripts.</p><p>Our results highlight cell cycle constraints during early embryonic development as a force capable of driving changes in gene architecture of multicellular organisms. In unicellular organisms intron paucity correlates with a bias toward the 5′ ends, whereas introns from multicellular genomes are evenly distributed throughout the genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mourier and Jeffares, 2003</xref>). This suggests that similar constraints on gene architecture are also likely to exist in yeast and other fast-dividing single cell eukaryotes.</p><p>The way splicing efficiency might be regulated through changes in constitutive spliceosome factors and how it might influence differential gene expression is a new area of interest. In this study, we present experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis of a requirement for highly efficient pre-mRNA splicing during early embryonic development. Since the NTC/Prp19 complexes are known to be important for efficient spliceosome activation, and our mutant alleles specifically impaired pre-mRNA splicing of early zygotic but not maternally encoded transcripts, we propose that overall requirements for splicing efficiency are likely to vary during development, being the NTC/Prp19 complexes a key modulator of spliceosome activation rates. In agreement with this hypothesis, Prp19 expression varies during neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Urano et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In plants it was recently shown that removal of retained introns regulates translation in rapidly developing gametophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boothby et al., 2013</xref>).

Our results also suggest that the pre-requisite for highly efficient splicing during early embryonic development is paradoxically also likely to play an important regulatory role in the expression of a subset of early zygotic transcripts, which further supports the possibility that modulation of spliceosome activation per se is important for differential regulation of gene expression during development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fly work and genetics</title><p>Flies were raised using standard techniques.

These generated RNA-Seq data for two biological replicates each of wild-type and <italic>fandango</italic> mutant (<italic>fand</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>), consisting of about 150 million illumina paired-end 100 bp reads per sample.</p><p>Paired-end reads were mapped with tophat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>) version 2.0.3 against the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> BDGP5 reference genome, using Flybase gene annotations downloaded from Ensembl e66 as guide.</p><p>To analyze splicing defects, we first extracted exon–intron boundaries from gene annotations. To avoid potential confounding effects, we removed all boundaries that had overlapping exon sequence (from different genes or transcripts). Subsequent analysis used this set of ‘safe’ exon–intron boundaries.</p><p>For coverage plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, we also excluded boundaries where the intron or the exon were less than 50 b long. At each base within 50 bp either side of a splice site we count the number of reads that overlap that base, then divide by the total number of reads within the 100 bp centered around the splice site. To minimize noise, we require that at least 50 reads fall within the −50:50 window around the exon–intron boundary (reads that only partially overlap the window are also counted).</p><p>To determine the frequency of splicing defects for each boundary, we extracted all reads that overlap the 5′ splice site by at least 10 bp to either side of the boundary. We classified each read as correctly spliced (if the read is split from the 5′ to the 3′ splice site), unspliced (if the read is not split) or mis-spliced (if the read is split but not matching the expected 5′ or/and 3′ sites). To reduce noise, we only include an exon–intron boundary if at least 10 fragments overlap that boundary.</p><p>To determine the exon–intron gene structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>), each gene was divided in 1000 equal segments. For each segment of each gene, we checked for the presence (or absence) of an exon in that segment. For each segment, we then plotted the frequency of exon presence in all genes. If an exon randomly appears in a given segment, it appears in ∼50% of genes. For example, a set of intronless genes would produce a plot that would be always at 100%.</p><p>To determine the splice site motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), sequences around exon–intron boundaries were extracted and motifs drawn using Weblogo.</p><p>Early zygotic and maternal genes were defined using RNA-Seq developmental gene expression data from Flybase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Graveley et al., 2011</xref>).

Maternal genes are those genes that are not early zygotic and have high expression (more than 50 expression units) at 0–2 hr. To avoid potential artifacts, genes that have an extremely high expression (more than 1000 expression units) were not considered.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Elisa Izaurralde, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Guilgur et al. identifies and characterizes mutations in Drosophila genes encoding components of the spliceosomal NTC/Prp19 complexes, a critical component of spliceosome activation. Interestingly, the authors describe a differential requirement for the NTC/Prp19 components in the splicing of transcripts from maternally versus early zygotically expressed genes in the Drosophila embryo. The pre-mRNA splicing defects detected in these mutants correlate with zygotic gene expression and the rapid mitoses characteristic of cell division in early Drosophila embryos. These observations are interesting in light of two related findings. First, that mitosis inhibits pre-mRNA splicing in organisms that undergo nuclear membrane breakdown. Second, in yeast intron size is small and most genes lack introns suggesting that the genomes of rapidly dividing cells were selected for intron loss.</p><p>Additionally, the manuscript reveals a feedback or coordination between the time required to complete nuclear division and architecture of expressed genes. The mechanism remains unclear, but this study opens new research avenues. For example, what happens with pre-mRNAs that have “no time” to be spliced. Do they accumulate in the nucleus for later splicing or are they degraded by nuclear quality control (NQC) mechanisms. Another interesting question is how splicing efficiency adapts to cell cycle duration, and how a given transcript is processed in highly and non-proliferating cells.</p><p>Although there are many questions that remain unanswered, the finding that there is an evolutionary pressure for early zygotic genes to lack introns is novel. Additionally, the proposed coordination between the time to complete nuclear division and splicing efficiency provides an interesting mechanism to regulate gene expression and forms the basis for future studies.</p><p>Overall, the paper is interesting, the data and observations support the conclusions drawn and should be published with minor revisions, outlined below.</p><p>1) There is almost too much data in this paper, including a lot in the supplemental materials. Even the main figures often have multiple panels, some of which could be moved to the supplemental materials to simplify presentation of the main and seminal points.</p><p>2) There are numerous grammatical or typographical errors that need to be fixed before publication.</p><p>3) Finally, although the authors imply this, they should state explicitly the connections between the small or no intron containing zygotic genes, rapid cell divisions in the early embryo and intron loss in yeast and single cell eukaryotes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02181.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) There is almost too much data in this paper, including a lot in the supplemental materials. Even the main figures often have multiple panels, some of which could be moved to the supplemental materials to simplify presentation of the main and seminal points</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers. In order to simplify the presentation of the main points of the manuscript and increase its sharpness, the manuscript now has only six figures, instead of the original seven. Although none of the originally presented results were excluded, some were moved (according to reviewers suggestion) to Figure supplements.</p><p>More specifically, a) “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>” is now “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>”. b) Panel B of “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>” (now: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), was moved to “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>”</p><p><italic>2) There are numerous grammatical or typographical errors that need to be fixed before publication</italic>.</p><p>With the help of an English native speaker we have extensively edited the manuscript. This editing has in no way altered the scientific content of this manuscript and its main conclusions.</p><p><italic>3) Finally, although the authors imply this, they should state explicitly the connections between the small or no intron containing zygotic genes, rapid cell divisions in the early embryo and intron loss in yeast and single cell eukaryotes</italic>.</p><p>We include a new paragraph and additional citation in the Discussion where we suggest that, similarly to the early embryo, rapid cell divisions can also potentially act as driving force for changes in gene architecture in unicellular organisms:</p><p>“Our results highlight cell cycle constraints during early embryo development as a force capable of driving changes in gene architecture of multicellular organisms. In unicellular organisms intron paucity correlates with a bias toward the 5’ ends, whereas introns from multicellular genomes are evenly distributed throughout the genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mourier and Jeffares, 2003</xref>). This suggests that similar constraints on gene architecture are also likely to exist in yeast and other fast-dividing single cell eukaryotes.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
