into tissues. Rigorous control over this process is important to prevent unwanted inflammation and organ damage. Protein L-isoaspartyl O-methyltransferase (PIMT) converts isoaspartyl residues to conventional methylated forms in cells undergoing stress-induced protein damage. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of PIMT in vascular homeostasis. PIMT is abundantly expressed in mouse lung endothelium and PIMT deficiency in mice exacerbated pulmonary inflammation and vascular leakage to LPS(lipopolysaccharide). Furthermore, we found that PIMT inhibited LPS-induced toll-like receptor signaling through its interaction with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and its ability to methylate asparagine residues in the coiled-coil domain. This interaction was found to inhibit TRAF6 oligomerization and autoubiquitination, which prevented NF-κB transactivation and subsequent expression of endothelial adhesion molecules. Separately, PIMT also suppressed ICAM-1 expression by inhibiting its N-glycosylation, causing effects on protein stability that ultimately translated into reduced EC(endothelial cell)-leukocyte interactions. Our study has identified PIMT as a novel and potent suppressor of endothelial activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of PIMT may be effective in limiting organ injury in inflammatory vascular diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>acute lung injury</kwd><kwd>endothelium</kwd><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16EIA27710023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jianxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL159168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jianxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL152703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jianxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Protein repairing enzyme PIMT maintains vascular endothelium in a quiescent state, thus preventing the development of inflammatory vascular diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung endothelium serves as a physical barrier to blood constituents and acts as a gate keeper of organ inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galley and Webster, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pries and Kuebler, 2006</xref>). Although largely quiescent in the healthy lungs, endothelial cells are an early participant in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory conditions, such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). For instance, endothelial cells produce many of the factors that recruit leukocytes to the lung after injury and critically control immune cell entry through the expression of membrane adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maniatis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Millar et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, tight control over endothelial responses is critical for limiting organ damage to most inflammatory insults, and interventions that attenuate activation of these cells have emerged as a new paradigm in the treatment of inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orfanos et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Canonical NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa enhancer binding protein) signaling plays a pivotal role in endothelial cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baeuerle, 1998</xref>). Binding of proinflammatory cytokines to receptors, such as members of interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)/toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily, leads to the activation of the IKK (IκB [NF-κB inhibitor] kinase) complex via recruiting cytoplasmic adaptors, including TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs). The activation of the IKK complex causes phosphorylation of IκBα, which leads to polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. The liberated NF-κB dimer then translocates to the nucleus wherein it binds to specific DNA sequences to promote the expression of cytokines and endothelial adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunne and O’Neill, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szmitko et al., 2003</xref>). TRAF6 is a RING-domain cognate ubiquitin ligase (E3) associated with the intracellular domain of the IL-1R/TLR that mediates immune responses through lysine 63 (K63)-linked ubiquitination of diverse signaling intermediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2000</xref>). Negative regulators of TRAF6 have been shown to suppress cellular inflammation, suggesting clinical potential in the treatment of inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lv et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>As another hallmark of the vascular inflammatory process, leukocyte-endothelial adhesion is mediated by interactions between endothelial adhesion molecules and cognate receptors on immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szmitko et al., 2003</xref>). Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1; CD54) is an inducible transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, with known roles in leukocyte adhesion and transmigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Springer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Staunton et al., 1988</xref>). In addition, ligand-induced ICAM-1 cross-linking acts as a signal transducer to promote proinflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawson and Wolf, 2009</xref>). ICAM-1 is heavily N-linked glycosylated on extracellular Ig-like domains, and previous studies have demonstrated that this post-translational modification (PTM) is indispensable for the proper conformation and biological function of ICAM-1 during inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ICAM-1 glycosylation remain largely unknown.</p><p>As a conserved protein repair enzyme, PIMT utilizes S-adenosyl methionine (SAM/AdoMet) to form methyl esters on carboxyl positions of isoaspartyl (isoAsp) residues. IsoAsp is generated from asparagine (Asn) deamidation or aspartate (Asp) dehydration via succinimide intermediate under physiological or stressed conditions and usually disrupts protein structure and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geiger and Clarke, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reissner and Aswad, 2003</xref>). The methylated intermediate then releases a methyl group to reform succinimide through spontaneous decomposition, which converts isoAsp to Asp in order to restore protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Desrosiers and Fanélus, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mishra and Mahawar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reissner and Aswad, 2003</xref>). It is increasingly recognized that Asn deamidation is significantly engaged in diverse biological functions such as cell apoptosis and the control of metabolic responses under inflammatory and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deverman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). PIMT-mediated protein carboxyl methylation (O-methylation) was recently reported to be critically important for cells, indicating it may functionally rival other types of protein PTMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sprung et al., 2008</xref>). For instance, overexpression of PIMT has been shown to extend longevity of bacteria, fruit flies, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chavous et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ogé et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pesingi et al., 2017</xref>). PIMT deficient mice exhibit increased isoAsp residual deposition and early neurological death due to grand mal seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, we and others have shown that PIMT plays an important role in angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte survival under oxidative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ouanouki and Desrosiers, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that PIMT is a potent negative regulator of endothelial activation and vascular inflammation. Mechanistically, we show that PIMT acts by inhibiting LPS-induced NF-κB activation through methylation of TRAF6 in ECs and by physically interacting with ICAM-1 to impact N-glycosylation and its functional interactions with immune cells. In summary, our findings suggest that PIMT-mediated protein O-methylation plays a central role in controlling vascular inflammation in the lung.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PIMT mitigates LPS-induced mouse pulmonary vascular inflammation and lung injury</title><p>Lung infection sustained by various pathogens, such as bacteria and the COVID-19, is the leading cause of ALI(acute lung injury)/ARDS, and its severity and morbidity are markedly increased in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akbar and Gilroy, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang and Jung, 2020</xref>).

To define the role of PIMT in lung endothelial activation, we examined the effect of PIMT overexpression on NF-κB promoter activity at the transcriptional level. EA.hy926 endothelial cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid containing a heterologous promoter driven by NF-κB elements upstream of the luciferase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 1995</xref>), and overexpression of PIMT markedly reduced the NF-κB driven luciferase activity under both basal and LPS-stimulated conditions. By contrast, ectopic expression of an inactive PIMT mutant, which has a deleted catalytic motif I (PIMT-Del; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kagan and Clarke, 1994</xref>), had limited effect on LPS-induced NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), suggesting the enzymatic activity is indispensable for inhibitory function.

The decision to focus on these molecules was because they are considered major control points in the inflammatory cascade. Consistent with this, we found that IKKβ and IκBα phosphorylation levels were significantly attenuated by PIMT overexpression at different time points after LPS stimulation compared with control adenovirus (Ad-LacZ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Interestingly, in addition to methylation, N350 deamination was abundantly detected in both PIMT expressing and knockdown cells, suggesting that the N350 deamination is naturally present regardless of the level of PIMT in cells. Since N350 is followed by a glycine, which is a typical ‘hot spot’ for deamidation and subsequent O-methylation by PIMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reissner and Aswad, 2003</xref>), we speculated that deamination of N350 can be further methylated in PIMT expressing cells.</p><p>D339 and N350 sites are conserved among species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). To determine their functional significance, we generated two methylation-dead TRAF6 mutants (D339A and N350A) and found that overexpression of D339A and N350A mutants in EA.hy926 cells significantly activated NF-κB to the similar extent as WT TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Importantly, co-overexpression of PIMT markedly inhibited both WT TRAF6- and D339A mutant-induced NF-κB transactivation but minimally affected N350A-induced NF-κB transactivation, suggesting that N350 O-methylation is involved in the PIMT-mediated suppression of NF-κB activation. Furthermore, N350A mutation also specifically attenuated PIMT-mediated inhibition of TRAF6 oligomerization and autoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that O-methylation of TRAF6 at N350 is critically involved in the regulation of TRAF6 function and subsequent NF-κB activation by PIMT.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PIMT impedes ICAM-1 expression and glycosylation in ECs</title><p>Activation of NF-κB has been implicated in the cytokine-induced expression of adhesion molecules, such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which mediate the adhesion of monocytes to inflamed ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pober and Sessa, 2007</xref>).

Together, these results suggest that PIMT functions as a negative regulator of the cytokine-induced inflammatory responses in vascular ECs, at least in part, through inhibiting expression and glycosylation of adhesion molecules in vascular ECs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>PIMT (encoded by Protein-L-Isoaspartate [D-Aspartate] O-Methyltransferase [<italic>Pcmt1</italic>] gene) is a protein carboxyl methyltransferase that specifically recognizes structurally altered carboxylic acids at aspartyl residues, and its role in monitoring protein homeostasis has been defined as ‘housekeeping’ function in a wide variety of cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Desrosiers and Fanélus, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mishra and Mahawar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reissner and Aswad, 2003</xref>). In this study, we identified a novel function of PIMT in suppressing endothelial activation and acute inflammatory responses. Specifically, we found that PIMT attenuates LPS-stimulated endothelial activation and acute lung injury by inhibiting NF-κB signaling through methylation of TRAF6 and inhibition of N-glycosylation of the cell surface adhesion molecule ICAM-1.</p><p>TRAF6 plays key roles in eliciting IL-1R/TLR-mediated inflammatory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2000</xref>). TRAF6 consists of an N-terminal RING domain, followed by four ZnF domains, a CC domain, and a TRAF-C domain at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2002</xref>). The RING domain, in association with ZnF domains, interacts with Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2) for Ub transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yin et al., 2009</xref>). The TRAF-C domain is a binding scaffold mediating TRAF6 interaction with various effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ye et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, the CC domain has also been shown to be indispensable for TRAF6 oligomerization and subsequent activation of TAK1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, the CC domain has been shown to enhance TRAF6 activation through interacting with E2 Ubc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). However, little is known about how the function of TRAF6 CC domain is regulated under inflammatory conditions. Herein, we provide compelling evidence that PIMT-mediated methylation of TRAF6 in the CC-domain represents a novel mechanism in the regulation of TRAF6/NF-κB signaling in vascular ECs. Overexpression of PIMT markedly impeded TRAF6 oligomerization and autoubiquitination, which is known to be a key process in the initiation of NF-κB activation in ECs. Furthermore, we identified Asn residue 350 in the CC domain of TRAF6 as the site of TRAF6 methylation by PIMT in ECs. Whether PIMT affects TRAF6 function through acting on Asn/Asp residues in other domains remains unknown and needs to be further investigated.</p><p>Deamidation of Asn is the first step in the formation of PIMT recognizable intermediates, such as isoAsp, succinimide, and methyl-isoAsp, and represents an important mechanism by which cells recognize deranged proteins during development and/or aging of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mishra and Mahawar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reissner and Aswad, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Our data demonstrated that Asn substitution with Ala impaired TRAF6 susceptibility to PIMT-mediated inhibition but did not alter intrinsic functions, strongly suggesting that PIMT catalyzed methylation, rather than deamidated end product repair, is the primary mechanism coordinating TRAF6 homeostasis. Interestingly, we found that the N350 residue in the CC domain is localized in a loop site adjacent to TRAF-C domain, which is exposed to the protein surface and susceptible to deamidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ye et al., 2002</xref>). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PIMT-mediated N350 methylation serves as an intrinsic negative regulator of TRAF6 biological activity. It is worth noting that our study primarily focused on functional interactions of PIMT1 and TRAF6 because TRAF6 is critically implicated in LPS-induced endothelial activation and acute lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin and Wurfel, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, our data also demonstrated a weak interaction between PIMT and TRAF2. Since a conservative deamidation susceptible Asn site is identified in the TRAF-C domain of TRAF2, we cannot rule out the possibility that PIMT1-mediated O-methylation is involved in inhibiting TRAF2 activation. Furthermore, whether PIMT affects TRAF6 function through modification of Asn/Asp residues in other domains remains unknown and warrants further investigation.</p><p>ECs are regarded as sentinels for sensing invading pathogens and triggering innate immune system activation; however, hyperactive inflammatory responses by ECs can have detrimental effects on the host. Hence, confining inflammatory reactions is imperative for governing the magnitude and duration of endothelial activation and immune responses. Indeed, several molecules, such as IκBs, deubiquitinase A20, transcriptional co-factor CITED2, and protein chaperone cyclophilin J, have been identified as critical negative regulators of inflammatory signals under various conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boone et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O’Dea and Hoffmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sheng et al., 2018</xref>). LPS treatment should cause TRAF6 to become more prone to spontaneous modifications. This is because LPS is known to trigger production of reactive oxygen species (ROS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu and Wen, 2002</xref>), and ROS is known to induce isoAsp generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Angelo et al., 2001</xref>). In addition to altering the backbone, isoAsp modifications will have effects on protein conformation and PTMs, thus having either positive (e.g. p53) or negative (e.g. tubulin) downstream effects on protein functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biterge et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, we found that PIMT knockdown enhances TRAF6/NF-κB activation, suggesting that isoAsp modifications serve to overactivate TRAF6 function. IsoAsp repair is traditionally recognized as a spontaneous process. However, recent studies show that O-methylation of isoAsp occurs in nature, including on proteins such as p53 and histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biterge et al., 2014</xref>), and is important for exerting biological functions. Notably, a recent publication demonstrated that O-methylation of p53 is not a transient event and is maintained on this protein for at least 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). LPS treatment did not alter PIMT levels under either in vitro or in vivo conditions but significantly augmented its interaction with TRAF6 in different EC types, suggesting that the dynamic formation of PIMT/TRAF6 protein complexes constitutes an important negative feedback mechanism in resolving LPS inflammation. It should be noted that in addition to ECs, PIMT is also expressed in other type of cells, such as macrophage and epithelial cells in the lung. Future studies using tissue specific PIMT knockout mice will help to determine the relative contribution of PIMT in different cell types to ALI.</p><p>As a hallmark of endothelial activation, cell-surface expression of adhesion molecules mediates the interaction of circulating leukocytes with endothelium in response to proinflammatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunt and Jurd, 1998</xref>). Adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, are heavily N-glycosylated, and N-glycosylation defects have been shown to impair expression and membrane localization of adhesion molecules and subsequent intracellular, cell–cell, and cell–matrix recognition events in inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scott and Patel, 2013</xref>). N-glycan attaches only to Asn and presents in an N-x-S/T consensus sequence. At this time, little is known about how N-glycosylation of adhesion molecules is regulated under inflammatory conditions in ECs. Here, we show that PIMT affects inflammatory responses through modulating its N-glycosylation of ICAM-1. We found that PIMT differentially regulates the N-glycosylation of ICAM-1 without altering the global endothelial glycocalyx. To further investigate molecular mechanisms underlying inhibition of adhesion molecule N-glycosylation by PIMT, we chose to determine the structure of the N-glycans of ICAM-1 using mass spectrometry. ICAM-1 possesses eight N-glycosylation sites. We found that PIMT inhibits ICAM-1 N-glycosylation at four specific Asn sites (N145, N183, N267, and N385). Furthermore, our mass spectrometric data show that Asn residues at these sites are switched to Asp residues by PIMT, thus preventing N-glycosylation. Our results also suggest that the enzymatic activity of PIMT may be necessary for the O-methylation of isoAsp derived from Asn to form Asp in ICAM-1. In addition to the decreasing ICAM-1 protein stability, as shown in this study, we suspect that deficiency of ICAM-1 N-glycosylation may directly impact the function of ICAM-1, despite our data showing that LMW form of ICAM-1 can still localize to the cell membrane. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, the N145 and N183 sites are localized in the hydrophilic BC and EF loops of ICAM-1 domain 2 (D2) upon structural dissection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casasnovas et al., 1998</xref>). Based on the fact that ICAM-1 D2 sustains the structural and LFA1 binding integrity of D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stanley et al., 2000</xref>), we speculate that PIMT-induced ‘site mutation’ at these sites may impair the binding capacity of ICAM-1 to its ligand, and this hypothesis was partially testified in our ICAM-1 antibody cross-linking experiments. Furthermore, lack of ICAM-1 glycosylation at N267 in the D3 domain may also affect interactions with macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diamond et al., 1993</xref>). In this regard, our study provides novel insights into how PIMT-mediated N-glycosylation regulates the functional interaction of ECs and immune cells in vascular inflammation. The reason why PIMT specifically acts on these four specific Asn sites remains elusive. It is attempted to speculate that isoAsp repair and maintenance, just like other protein modifications, may occur in a context and cell type dependent fashion. In our IP experiment, only small fractions of PIMT co-IP’d with LMW ICAM-1. Although we suspect this could be explained by a ‘hit and run’ mechanism. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that PIMT may affect any one of the many steps along the pathway to protein glycosylation, such as ERQC or glucoside attachment. Elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying PIMT-induced glycosylation of VCAM-1 in ECs is ongoing.</p><p>In summary, our work has identified novel mechanisms in the control of agonist-induced EC activation by PIMT. We demonstrate that PIMT-catalyzed methylation directly restricts TRAF6 activation to maintain TRAF6 in the default static state. Moreover, PIMT provides a ‘double check’ mechanism to avoid endothelial activation by limiting ICAM-1 membrane expression and intracellular signaling through transcriptional and post-translational controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that targeted activation of PIMT may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating a wide range of inflammatory vascular disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Mixed male and female mice aged 8–10 weeks were used in all studies. Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Thomas Jefferson University before initiation of any studies. Euthanasia was performed in accordance with recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia. A block randomization method was used to assign experimental animals to groups on a rolling basis to achieve adequate sample number for each experimental condition. Experiments were performed and analyzed with operators blinded to the genotype and treatment allocation. No exclusion criteria were pre-determined, and no animals were excluded. Sample sizes were calculated with a priori analysis by G-power 3.1.9.2 software. For a twofold change in a parameter, with an SD up to 50% of the mean, there is an 85% probability that six mice per group will be needed to detect a difference at 5% level of significance in an unpaired two-tailed Student t test or ANOVA. Thus, more than six mice were used in most of the animal studies.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;PIMT: a novel and potent suppressor of endothelial activation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form.</p><p>The consensus from the review was that although the identification of the role of PIMT in regulating vascular homeostasis is impactful, there were several major issues to be addressed to support the publication. Particularly, the reviewers felt that the premise for the role of isoAsp in pro-inflammatory function needs to be better established, the mass-spec data need to be presented more clearly, and the in vivo relevance of in vitro (over expression) results should be more clearly established (e.g., the effect on ICAM-I).</p><p>We, however, remain enthusiastic about the conceptual advancement of the work. Thus, we will be happy to consider an improved manuscript that has addressed these concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors found that impairing PIMT (KD) exacerbated inflammation and vascular leakage upon LPS challenge. They report here that this is due to the lack of repair on damaged Asn on TRAF6, which resulted in inhibition of its oligomerization and ubiquitination (consequently preventing NF-κB transactivation). The authors also found that PIMT was linked to regulating ICAM-1 expression by inhibiting N-glycosylation. This study reveals a previously unappreciated function of PIMT in regulating innate immune responses- limiting inflammatory responses thus maintaining vascular homeostasis.</p><p>I have the following questions/ concerns:</p><p>– LC/MS data is very difficult to interpret/evaluate. I have questions as to: Is there any other Asn/Asp on TRAF-6 that gets modified by PIMT at all? What is the peptide coverage? What is the confidence level on distinguishing signal from noise. What is methylated Asn?- Are authors referring to L-isoaspartyl methyl ester? I am unable to identify corresponding modification by the given data.</p><p>– I'm having a hard time understanding why TRAF-6 would be stuck at L-isoaspartyl methyl ester. It is my understanding that, after PIMT reaction, succinimide formation and subsequent hydrolysis is rather spontaneous. Also, unlike TRAF-6, why are all Asns in ICAM-I modified into Asp, instead of being just &quot;methylated?&quot;</p><p>– Is enzymatic activity necessary for PIMT to regulate ICAM-I glycosylation? Could authors use point mutants at the active site instead of deletion (please ID how much has been deleted) to ensure proper folding and to distinguish whether PIMT binding or catalysis dominates the inhibitory effect?</p><p>– Would it be possible that ICAM-I hypo-glycosylation/attenuation simply be the downstream effect since only a small amount of PIMT is co-IP'd even (and only) when overexpressed?</p><p>– I'm a bit confused about the sequence of events and targeting mechanism of PIMT. Given that PIMT targets isoAsp, would LPS treatment (activation of TLRs) cause TRAF6 and ICAM-I to become more prone to such spontaneous modifications (how)? Can authors compare the population of modified/unmodified TRAF6 and ICAM-I under normal vs inflammatory conditions? Would the data/model here imply that isoAsp modification somehow over-activates the function of TRAF6? Wouldn't it impair the activity of TRAF6 since it would generate deformed backbone? Also, without PIMT, wouldn't the glycosylation of ICAM-I be impaired anyway since the target Asn residues would be stuck at isoAsp?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors show a role for PIMT in regulating endothelial inflammatory responses, leading to reduced NFkB activation downstream of LPS and TLR4. They demonstrate that PIMT directly interacts with TRAF6 and ICAM, modifying these targets and regulating their activity. in vivo experiments suggest a role of PIMT in regulating endothelial dysfunction and inflammation downstream of lung injury. Strengths include a thorough analysis of the interactions of PIMT with TRAF6 and ICAM and a demonstration of the modification of these targets by PIMT. Weaknesses include heavy reliance on overexpression of PIMT to observe biological effects and a weak effect of PIMT heterozygosity in vivo. This study should spur further investigation into the role of PIMT not just in repair of damaged proteins, but as a possible signalling regulator of inflammatory responses.</p><p>Recommendations</p><p>– Since the paper is heavily reliant on overexpression of PIMT, strengthening the data examining endogenous PIMT would greatly strengthen the paper. A second shRNA should be used in Figures 2C, 2F, and 5D. Showing a role for endogenous PIMT in regulating LPS-induced genes as in Figure 2D would also be helpful.</p><p>– Since some of the endogenous IPs are fairly dirty and it's not always clear which band is the correct band, it would be helpful to add a knockdown of the co-IPed protein to these IP experiments.</p><p>– Knockdown ICAM to show that the lower &quot;hypo-glycosylated&quot; band is specific for ICAM.</p><p>– Can the authors show an effect of endogenous PIMT on the ubiquitination of endogenous TRAF6? In Figure 4, the authors IP Flag-TRAF6 and blot for HA-ubiquitin. It would be predicted that ubiquitinated TRAF6 would be detected similarly with HA and Flag antibodies; however, there are no higher molecular weight bands in the Flag blot. Does this suggest that the HA blot is not specific to TRAF6?</p><p>– The LCMS data is not easy to understand, particularly in Figure 5. Could the authors give a better explanation of what the labeled peaks mean? Can the authors also show data from the methylated peptide in Figure 4D does not occur in shPIMT cells? Is there evidence of Asn to Asp shift at N350 due to PIMT activity? Can the authors show that Asn to Asp shift in Figure 5 does not occur in Ad-LacZ cells? Is endogenous PIMT enough for this to occur?</p><p>– Since the authors don't show an actual analysis of the glycosylation of ICAM, they should refrain from using &quot;hypo-glycosylated&quot; and &quot;full-glycosylated&quot;. Their data strongly suggests that PIMT is changing the glycosylated residues of ICAM, but these terms are overstatements unless they directly measure glycosylation of ICAM.</p><p>– In Figure 5E, S3B, authors say that PIMT interacts only with hypoglycosylated ICAM. Since they IP only ICAM and their IP antibody does not distinguish from 100kd and 70kd bands, they cannot say this. They need to IP PIMT and show that only one ICAM band comes down in this IP. They should also use a dose of Ad-PIMT at which there is approximately equal higher and lower molecular weight ICAM bands.</p><p>– It is a little concerning that no endogenous PIMT comes down with ICAM pulldown in Figure S3B. Can the authors show that PIMT knockdown leads to increased surface localization of ICAM with or without TNF, and that PIMT knockdown leads to increased adhesion of THP1 cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors studied the regulatory role that PIMT plays in endothelial cells' response to innate stimulation. They found that PIMT modulates LPS-induced NF-κB activation by interaction with TRAF6 and methylation of Asn residues in its coiled-coil domain. Therefore, PIMT inhibits TRAF6 oligomerization and autoubiquitination. In addition, the authors found that PIMT inhibits N-glycosylation of ICAM-1 and prevents ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cell surface. In a LPS-induced acute lung injury model, the authors showed that PIMT ameliorates lung inflammation and injury. The study suggests that PIMT limits endothelial cell activation and prevents excessive tissue inflammation.</p><p>Using overexpression and knockdown methods, the authors have done elegant work in vitro to show how PIMT regulates endothelial activation. Whether it is the case in vivo needs to be tested.</p><p>There are some concerns that need to be addressed or clarified.</p><p>1. The authors focused on endothelial PIMT. It seems PIMT is expressed in many kinds of cells, such as macrophages (http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&amp;id=18537). The authors showed that PIMT is expressed in CD31+ endothelial cells in the lung using IHF. Do other cells in the lung also express PIMT? The authors may use FACS to measure PIMT expression in lung endothelial cells, epithelial cells and immune cells. Alternatively, an endothelial specific KO mice may be used.</p><p>2. The authors found that PIMT regulates endothelial activation and ICAM-1 expression in vitro. in vivo evidence is also needed in the acute lung injury model.</p><p>3. TRAF6 is an E3 ligase. Does PIMT regulate the polyubiquitination and phosphorylation of its substrate <italic>TAK1</italic>?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;PIMT: a novel and potent suppressor of endothelial activation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Carla Rothlin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved. However, we find the LC/MS data still a bit incomplete and noisy. Can authors show the degree of modification of ICAM by endogenous PIMT? Similarly, could authors show the ratio between unmodified and modified peptides by (ectopically expressed) PIMT? These data will be crucial for establishing the physiological relevance of ICAM modification by PIMT.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have largely addressed my concerns; however several issues remain:</p><p>I remain concerned about the lack of evidence for endogenous PIMT in the regulation of ICAM1. The Western blot that the authors include for shPIMT cells shows no effect on the lower molecular weight band (cropped from Figure 5C, but included in the full image). If the authors treated those cells with TNFa, IL1B, or LPS, would the increased amount of total ICAM be sufficient to see differences in low molecular weight ICAM1? The authors show that low molecular weight ICAM1 is present on the membrane of AD-LacZ cells. Is this small amount of low molecular weight ICAM reduced by knockdown of PIMT? It's worth mentioning that the ICAM1 bands in Figures 5C and 6C don't line up with the ladder in the same way as they do in other figures. Was a different ladder used for these blots?</p><p>The LC/MS data remains difficult to evaluate. Presumably, the TRAF6 analyzed is a mixture of modified and non-modified peptides. I would assume that not every single TRAF6 in the cell contains methylated asparagines and that the ~50% knockdown of PIMT would not completely abolish all of these methylations. Is there any way to represent the data that shows the relative amount of PIMT-modified to unmodified TRAF6 present in cells? This would presumably be more difficult in ICAM given the issues with glycosylation.</p><p>The authors' change of hypo- and full- glycosylated to partially and highly glycosylated misses the point. They have not analyzed glycosylation of ICAM at all. It is possible (even highly likely) that the two different bands represent different glycosylation states of ICAM, but without experimentally demonstrating this, the authors should stick to high molecular weight and low molecular weight ICAM throughout. It is fine to suggest that the effects of PIMT are likely due to differential glycosylation, but statements like &quot;we uncovered an unexpected role of PIMT in modulating N-glycosylation of adhesion molecules&quot;, &quot;PIMT specially inhibits the N-glycosylation of ICAM1 and VCAM1&quot;, and &quot;PIMT blocked ICAM1 expression by inhibiting N-glycosylation&quot; go beyond what the data show.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed my concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85754.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

I have questions as to: Is there any other Asn/Asp on TRAF-6 that gets modified by PIMT at all?</p></disp-quote><p>Great question. We focused on the CC domain because our domain mapping studies demonstrated this domain to be responsible for the binding of PIMT on TRAF6. This led us to hypothesize that PIMT may modify Asn/Asp residues in this domain. Ideally, this could be confirmed by overexpressing the CC domain but the small size (60 aa) of this region makes such a strategy almost impossible. As such, we choose to overexpresss a larger TRAF6 fragment containing the entire c-terminal domain (aa: 289-522). Doing this, we uncovered by LC/MS that both the D339 and N350 residues were modified in PIMT expressing HEK293 cells, but not in PIMT knockdown cells.</p><p>Functional studies also showed that the N350 modification is critically important in the regulation of TRAF6 by PIMT. Although we suspect that PIMT may also modify Asn/Asp residues outside of the cterminal domain we feel these experiments are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the peptide coverage? What is the confidence level on distinguishing signal from noise.</p></disp-quote><p>We have a high degree of confidence in our peptide identification. In mass spec studies, we overexpressed TRAF6 fragment in HEK293 cells and extracted immunoprecipitated TRAF6 from gels for LC/MS analysis. We then followed standard guidelines established by the proteomic research societies (https://www.mcponline.org/mass<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mcponline.org/mass-spec-guidelines">-</ext-link>spec<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mcponline.org/mass-spec-guidelines">-</ext-link>guidelines<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mcponline.org/mass-spec-guidelines">)</ext-link> for next steps. Our false discovery rate threshold for peptide identification was less than 1%. Moreover, since we used high-resolution mass spectrometry, the peptide mass tolerance was 10 ppm for identification. More importantly, the identification of peptides was further validated by manual inspection of MS/MS data to ensure accurate peptide and PTM site assignments. Using this approach, we identified clear fragment ions corresponding to methylated Asn in our MS/MS spectra. Altogether, we believe our approach utilized gold standard methods for performing PTM localization and have a high degree of confidence in our ability to distinguish signal from noise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is methylated Asn?- Are authors referring to L-isoaspartyl methyl ester? I am unable to identify corresponding modification by the given data.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion. Methylated Asn is actually L-isoaspartyl methyl ester. In the revised figure 4D, the formation of L-isoaspartyl methyl ester from Asn is now clearly depicted. Peptide mass was matched with 1.5 ppm accuracy to the theoretical mass of L-isoaspartyl methyl ester (881.4211, z=2) instead of 874.4120 for the unmodified form. Also, diagnostic fragmentation ions such as 147.08681 (N-me), 307.11740 (CN-me), 435.17598 (QCN-me) corresponding to the Asn-derived Lisoaspartyl methyl ester were observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I'm having a hard time understanding why TRAF-6 would be stuck at L-isoaspartyl methyl ester. It is my understanding that, after PIMT reaction, succinimide formation and subsequent hydrolysis is rather spontaneous.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that isoAsp repair is traditionally recognized as a spontaneous process. However, recent studies show that O-methylation of IsoAsp occurs in nature, including on proteins such as p53 (Nat Commun. 2012;3:927) and histone H4 (Sci Rep. 2014;4:6674), and exerts important biological functions. Notably, a recent publication demonstrated that O-methylation of p53 is not just a transient event and can be maintained for at least 24 hours (Nat Commun. 2012;3:927). We have added these comments into the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (page 26, from bottom, line 5-9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, unlike TRAF-6, why are all Asns in ICAM-I modified into Asp, instead of being just &quot;methylated?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Very thoughtful but challenging question. Our data show that among 8 Asns that were identified to be glycosylated in ICAM-1, only 4 Asns were modified to Asp in the presence of PIMT. Although we do not have a great answer regarding the specificity, it is likely that isoAsp repair and maintenance, just like other protein modifications, occur in a context and cell type dependent fashion. We have now modified the Discussion to address this criticism (page 28, 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph, line 8-11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is enzymatic activity necessary for PIMT to regulate ICAM-I glycosylation? Could authors use point mutants at the active site instead of deletion (please ID how much has been deleted) to ensure proper folding and to distinguish whether PIMT binding or catalysis dominates the inhibitory effect?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Yes enzymatic activity of PIMT is necessary to regulate ICAM-I glycosylation since we found that modification of 4 Asns in ICAM-I needs the interaction of PIMT with ICAM1 and a subsequent PIMT catalyzed o-methylation of IsoAsp. In our preliminary studies, we generated PIMT catalytic null mutations including G88A (Nat Commun. 2012;3:927) and D83V (Front Genet. 2021 Jan 21;11:612343) and found that they still maintain some enzymatic activity as compared with methyltransferase motif I (81-90) deleted mutant (Arch Biochem Biophys. 1994;310:417). Thus, we used an enzymatic inactive PIMT deletion mutant (deletion of aa 81-89) in our study. It seems that this small deletion (9 aa) will not significantly affect the proper protein folding, based on a previous report (Arch Biochem Biophys. 1994;310:417). Some of the comments have been added into the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (page 27, from bottom, line 5-6 ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Would it be possible that ICAM-I hypo-glycosylation/attenuation simply be the downstream effect since only a small amount of PIMT is co-IP'd even (and only) when overexpressed?</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that PIMT associates with the low MW ICAM-1 band. However, in our IP experiment, only small fractions of PIMT co-IP’d with LMW ICAM-1. Although we suspect this could be explained by a “hit and run” mechanism, we cannot exclude the possibility that PIMT affects any one of the many steps along the pathway to protein glycosylation, such as ER quality control or glucoside attachment. In future investigations we hope to further answer these questions and have added new text to the Discussion to address this concern in the revised manuscript (page 28, 1st paragraph, line 10-14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I'm a bit confused about the sequence of events and targeting mechanism of PIMT. Given that PIMT targets isoAsp, would LPS treatment (activation of TLRs) cause TRAF6 and ICAM-I to become more prone to such spontaneous modifications (how)?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we believe that LPS should cause TRAF6 and ICAM-I to undergo spontaneous modifications. This is because LPS is known to trigger production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (J Biol Chem. 2002;277(25):22131-9.), and ROS is known to induce isoAsp generation (Free Radic Biol Med. 2001 Jul 1;31(1):1-9.). This comment has been added to the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (page 26, 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph, line 8-9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can authors compare the population of modified/unmodified TRAF6 and ICAM-I under normal vs inflammatory conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, measuring O-methylation of TRAF6 by LC/MS/MS is not possible at this point. Due to the fact that antibodies against O-methylation of TRAF6 do not exist, this also limits our ability to evaluate this modification using western blot or ELISA. Finally, O-methylation of ICAM-1 seems spontaneous and rapid, which does not permit its quantification by LC/MS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would the data/model here imply that isoAsp modification somehow over-activates the function of TRAF6? Wouldn't it impair the activity of TRAF6 since it would generate deformed backbone? Also, without PIMT, wouldn't the glycosylation of ICAM-I be impaired anyway since the target Asn residues would be stuck at isoAsp?</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to altering the backbone, IsoAsp modifications will likely alter conformation and post-translational modifications, which could have positive (e.g. p53) or negative (e.g. tubulin) effects on protein function. In our study, we found that PIMT knockdown enhances TRAF6/NF-κB activation (Figure 2F), suggesting that IsoAsp modifications act to enhance TRAF6 function.</p><p>Under inflammatory conditions Asn resides in ICAM are stable and resistant to deamination (Figure 5G). Thus, without PIMT we expect elevated expression and full glycosylation of ICAM. Consistent with this, our studies indicate that targeted activation of PIMT in ECs reduces ICAM-1 expression and glycosylation and mitigates endothelial activation in ALI. These proof of concept studies support using PIMT activators in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Comments related to this have been added into the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (page 26, 2nd paragraph, line 9-13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors show a role for PIMT in regulating endothelial inflammatory responses, leading to reduced NFkB activation downstream of LPS and TLR4. They demonstrate that PIMT directly interacts with TRAF6 and ICAM, modifying these targets and regulating their activity. in vivo experiments suggest a role of PIMT in regulating endothelial dysfunction and inflammation downstream of lung injury. Strengths include a thorough analysis of the interactions of PIMT with TRAF6 and ICAM and a demonstration of the modification of these targets by PIMT. Weaknesses include heavy reliance on overexpression of PIMT to observe biological effects and a weak effect of PIMT heterozygosity in vivo. This study should spur further investigation into the role of PIMT not just in repair of damaged proteins, but as a possible signalling regulator of inflammatory responses.</p><p>Recommendations</p><p>– Since the paper is heavily reliant on overexpression of PIMT, strengthening the data examining endogenous PIMT would greatly strengthen the paper. A second shRNA should be used in Figures 2C, 2F, and 5D. Showing a role for endogenous PIMT in regulating LPS-induced genes as in Figure 2D would also be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have performed additional experiments using a second shRNA to deplete PIMT in ECs. Our new results are added into the revised figure 2C, 2F, and 5C. qPCR detection of inflammatory molecules in response to LPS in control and PIMT depleted ECs was also performed and is now shown in the revised figure 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Since some of the endogenous IPs are fairly dirty and it's not always clear which band is the correct band, it would be helpful to add a knockdown of the co-IPed protein to these IP experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. As shown in Figure 3E, the expression of TRAF6 in ECs is relatively low, which may lead to weak interactions in IP. To fully verify that TRAF6 indeed interacts with PIMT, we performed knockdown studies using TRAF6 shRNA. As shown in Figure 3E, TRAF6 with a MW of 60 kDa in control shRNA transfected cells, but not in TRAF6 shRNA transfected cells, interacts with PIMT in ECs. This interaction is further enhanced by LPS stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Knockdown ICAM to show that the lower &quot;hypo-glycosylated&quot; band is specific for ICAM.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. Although we did not perform ICAM-1 knockdown studies, we cut the lower &quot;partially-glycosylated&quot; band from the gel (Figure 5F) and submitted it for mass spectrometric analysis. Our results clearly identified peptide fragments of ICAM-1 (data not shown) in the band, supporting the notion that our lower band is derived from ICAM-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Can the authors show an effect of endogenous PIMT on the ubiquitination of endogenous TRAF6? In Figure 4, the authors IP Flag-TRAF6 and blot for HA-ubiquitin. It would be predicted that ubiquitinated TRAF6 would be detected similarly with HA and Flag antibodies; however, there are no higher molecular weight bands in the Flag blot. Does this suggest that the HA blot is not specific to TRAF6?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in many other studies, detection of endogenous ubiquitination of TRAF6 in ECs is very challenging. We speculate this relates, in large part, to the lack of high quality TRAF6 antibodies as well as the relatively low expression of TRAF6 in ECs. As shown in Figure 4A, by using protein ectopic expression, the poly-ubiquitination chain could be specifically and effectively recognized by HA antibody. Since ubiquitin is HA tagged, western blot using HA antibody only detects ubiquitinated TRAF6. After IP, western blot using Flag antibody detects the total TRAF6, which includes both ubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated TRAF6. Since the level of ubiquitinated TRAF6 is much lower compared with non-ubiquitinated TRAF6 in the immunoprecipitates we believe this explains why we normally observe a strong total TRAF6 band in western blot using anti-Flag antibody. Through increasing exposure time, we may observe higher molecular weight bands, but the quality of image would be much lower.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The LCMS data is not easy to understand, particularly in Figure 5. Could the authors give a better explanation of what the labeled peaks mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not presenting our data clearly. We now provide a better explanation of what the labelled peaks mean in the revised Figure 5G and Figure 5-supplement 2. In Figure 5G and Figure 5-supplement 2, the mass spectrometry spectra demonstrate that DHHGANFSCR is deamidated (DHHGADFSCR). Peptide mass was matched with 1.5 ppm accuracy to the theoretical mass of the Asn-methylated form (m/z 401.1649, double charge) instead of m/z 400.8370 (double charge) for the unmodified form.

Is there evidence of Asn to Asp shift at N350 due to PIMT activity? Can the authors show that Asn to Asp shift in Figure 5 does not occur in Ad-LacZ cells? Is endogenous PIMT enough for this to occur?</p></disp-quote><p>Unmethylated TRAF6 peptide from shPIMT cells was detected and shown in the revised Figure 4—figure supplement 1F. Asn to Asp shift, known as the repaired isoAsp, requires PIMT catalyzed O-methylation.

In this case, some neo-synthesized ICAM1 proteins without proper folding might escape from ER quality check. Thus, we sometimes observe weak lower MW ICAM1 bands in western blot, indicating endogenous PIMT might be functional here. Nevertheless, our data show that overexpression of PIMT markedly suppresses ICAM-1 glycosylation and provides proof of concept that targeted activation of PIMT in ECs may be beneficial for inhibition of ICAM-1 function under inflammatory conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Since the authors don't show an actual analysis of the glycosylation of ICAM, they should refrain from using &quot;hypo-glycosylated&quot; and &quot;full-glycosylated&quot;.

Since they IP only ICAM and their IP antibody does not distinguish from 100kd and 70kd bands, they cannot say this. They need to IP PIMT and show that only one ICAM band comes down in this IP. They should also use a dose of Ad-PIMT at which there is approximately equal higher and lower molecular weight ICAM bands.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now performed IP using anti-PIMT antibody and results are shown in the revised Figure 5E.

In Ad-LacZ cells, since ICAM-1 is known to be highly glycosylated, we are unable to see endogenous PIMT1 in ICAM-1 immunocomplexes (highly glycosylated). Hopefully this explanation alleviates some of this reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors show that PIMT knockdown leads to increased surface localization of ICAM with or without TNF, and that PIMT knockdown leads to increased adhesion of THP1 cells?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have performed PIMT knockdown and examined the surface localization of ICAM by flow cytometry. As shown in the revised figure 5—figure supplement 1C, we found that PIMT knockdown significantly increased cell surface ICAM-1 expression.

They found that PIMT modulates LPS-induced NF-κB activation by interaction with TRAF6 and methylation of Asn residues in its coiled-coil domain. Therefore, PIMT inhibits TRAF6 oligomerization and autoubiquitination. In addition, the authors found that PIMT inhibits N-glycosylation of ICAM-1 and prevents ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cell surface. In a LPS-induced acute lung injury model, the authors showed that PIMT ameliorates lung inflammation and injury. The study suggests that PIMT limits endothelial cell activation and prevents excessive tissue inflammation.</p><p>Using overexpression and knockdown methods, the authors have done elegant work in vitro to show how PIMT regulates endothelial activation.

The authors focused on endothelial PIMT. It seems PIMT is expressed in many kinds of cells, such as macrophages (http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&amp;id=18537). The authors showed that PIMT is expressed in CD31+ endothelial cells in the lung using IHF. Do other cells in the lung also express PIMT? The authors may use FACS to measure PIMT expression in lung endothelial cells, epithelial cells and immune cells. Alternatively, an endothelial specific KO mice may be used.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Yes, PIMT is also expressed in macrophages and epithelial cells in the lung. In this study, we did not perform FACS to determine the relative expression of PIMT in different types of cells in the lung. Data documented in the public domain of The Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000120265-PCMT1/tissue/lung) provides a single cell transcriptome analysis in human lung tissues demonstrating that PIMT is highly expressed in lung endothelial cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>. Although we did not use endothelial specific KO mice, our in vitro experiments using gain- and loss-of function strategies clearly demonstrated that PIMT is important for lung endothelial activation. Determination of relative contribution of PIMT in different cell types to ALI requires generation of various tissue specific knockout mice, which is extremely time-consuming, will need to be the subject of future studies.

The Western blot that the authors include for shPIMT cells shows no effect on the lower molecular weight band (cropped from Figure 5C, but included in the full image). If the authors treated those cells with TNFa, IL1B, or LPS, would the increased amount of total ICAM be sufficient to see differences in low molecular weight ICAM1? The authors show that low molecular weight ICAM1 is present on the membrane of AD-LacZ cells. Is this small amount of low molecular weight ICAM reduced by knockdown of PIMT? It's worth mentioning that the ICAM1 bands in Figures 5C and 6C don't line up with the ladder in the same way as they do in other figures. Was a different ladder used for these blots?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. Our results indicate that PIMT regulates ICAM-1 expression by affecting both NF-ΚB activation (transcriptional mechanism) and modifying protein glycosylation (posttranslational mechanism). Our results indicate that transcriptional mechanisms are more significant in PIMT knockdown cells since this mainly causes an increase in NF-ΚB activation without affecting N-linked glycosylation of ICAM-1. Consistent with this, we did not observe a change in the 8 ICAM-1 glycosylated sites (Asn) in shPIMT cells and we would not expect to find changes in the lower molecular weight band in Figure 5C. We also anticipate that treatment of shPIMT cells with other NF-ΚB activators, such as TNFa, IL1B, or LPS, would not significantly alter the amount of low molecular weight ICAM on gels because ICAM-1 should be highly glycosylated in this setting. However, this needs to be confirmed in future studies.</p><p>As shown in Figure 6C, the size of low molecular weight (LMW) ICAM-1 is different on the membrane of AD-LacZ and Ad-PIMT cells. Although we do not have an explanation for these findings we speculate this relates to different types of N-glycosylation or to other types of protein modifications. Further, our data indicate that ICAM-1 is highly glycosylated in PIMT knockdown cells. Based on this, we speculate that smaller amounts of LMW ICAM-1 present on the membrane of AD-LacZ cells will be shifted to HMW ICAM-1 in PIMT knockdown cells.</p><p>Yes, we used 2 types of protein ladders in this study, which were described in the Key Resources Table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The LC/MS data remains difficult to evaluate. Presumably, the TRAF6 analyzed is a mixture of modified and non-modified peptides. I would assume that not every single TRAF6 in the cell contains methylated asparagines and that the ~50% knockdown of PIMT would not completely abolish all of these methylations. Is there any way to represent the data that shows the relative amount of PIMT-modified to unmodified TRAF6 present in cells? This would presumably be more difficult in ICAM given the issues with glycosylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the valuable advice provided and completely agree with your comments. In order to investigate the degree of modification, we revisited the mass spectrometry spectra. We found that two forms of protein co-eluted in our HPLC and that both forms had a similar intensity in our analysis. As a result, the comment that &quot;the ~50% knockdown of PIMT would not completely abolish all of these methylations &quot; is absolutely correct.

They have not analyzed glycosylation of ICAM at all. It is possible (even highly likely) that the two different bands represent different glycosylation states of ICAM, but without experimentally demonstrating this, the authors should stick to high molecular weight and low molecular weight ICAM throughout. It is fine to suggest that the effects of PIMT are likely due to differential glycosylation, but statements like &quot;we uncovered an unexpected role of PIMT in modulating N-glycosylation of adhesion molecules&quot;, &quot;PIMT specially inhibits the N-glycosylation of ICAM1 and VCAM1&quot;, and &quot;PIMT blocked ICAM1 expression by inhibiting N-glycosylation&quot; go beyond what the data show.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now use the terms high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) to refer to different forms of ICAM-1 and have modified other statements in the manuscript to more clearly represent our data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
