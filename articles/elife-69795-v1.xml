Here, we establish a chemogenetic dopamine (DA) neuron ablation model in larval zebrafish with mitochondrial dysfunction and robustness suitable for high-content screening. We use this system to conduct an in vivo DA neuron imaging-based chemical screen and identify the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors as significantly neuroprotective. Knockdown of the angiotensin receptor 1 (<italic>agtr1</italic>) in DA neurons reveals a cell-autonomous mechanism of neuroprotection. DA neuron-specific RNA-seq identifies mitochondrial pathway gene expression that is significantly restored by RAAS inhibitor treatment. The neuroprotective effect of RAAS inhibitors is further observed in a zebrafish Gaucher disease model and <italic>Drosophila pink1</italic>-deficient PD model. Finally, examination of clinical data reveals a significant effect of RAAS inhibitors in delaying PD progression. Our findings reveal the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of targeting the RAAS pathway for neuroprotection and demonstrate a salient approach that bridges basic science to translational medicine.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Parkinson’s disease is caused by the slow death and deterioration of brain cells, in particular of the neurons that produce a chemical messenger known as dopamine. Certain drugs can mitigate the resulting drop in dopamine levels and help to manage symptoms, but they cause dangerous side-effects. There is no treatment that can slow down or halt the progress of the condition, which affects 0.3% of the population globally.</p><p>Many factors, both genetic and environmental, contribute to the emergence of Parkinson’s disease. For example, dysfunction of the mitochondria, the internal structures that power up cells, is a known mechanism associated with the death of dopamine-producing neurons.</p><p>Zebrafish are tiny fish which can be used to study Parkinson’s disease, as they are easy to manipulate in the lab and share many characteristics with humans. In particular, they can be helpful to test the effects of various potential drugs on the condition.</p><p>Here, Kim et al. established a new zebrafish model in which dopamine-producing brain cells die due to their mitochondria not working properly; they then used this assay to assess the impact of 1,403 different chemicals on the integrity of these cells. A group of molecules called renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) inhibitors was shown to protect dopamine-producing neurons and stopped them from dying as often. These are already used to treat high blood pressure as they help to dilate blood vessels. In the brain, however, RAAS worked by restoring certain mitochondrial processes.</p><p>Kim et al. then investigated whether these results are relevant in other, broader contexts. They were able to show that RAAS inhibitors have the same effect in other animals, and that Parkinson’s disease often progresses more slowly in patients that already take these drugs for high blood pressure.</p><p>Taken together, these findings therefore suggest that RAAS inhibitors may be useful to treat Parkinson’s disease, as well as other brain illnesses that emerge because of mitochondria not working properly. Clinical studies and new ways to improve these drugs are needed to further investigate and capitalize on these potential benefits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phenotypic screening</kwd><kwd>glucocerebrosidase (GBA)</kwd><kwd>parkin, pink1, a-synuclein, dj-1</kwd><kwd>nitroreductase (NTR)-metronidazole (MTZ)</kwd><kwd>time to Levodopa (L-dopa)</kwd><kwd>electronic health records (EHR)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS082938</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Su</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD170068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Su</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS084412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Bingwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG058742</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS120219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Su</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR074875</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vivo dopamine neuron imaging-based neuroprotective small molecule screen in larval zebrafish and mechanistic investigation using conditional CRISPR knockout and cell-type-specific RNA-seq analysis, coupled with cross-species analyses including human clinical data interrogation, uncover potential disease-modifying therapeutics for Parkinson's disease (PD).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As the most common movement disorder and the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects 0.3% of the general population, with a majority of cases being sporadic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Obeso, 2017</xref>). The hallmark of PD is a selective vulnerability of substantia nigra dopamine (DA) neurons among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>), accompanied by both motor and non-motor features, as well as prominent Lewy body pathology and mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bose and Beal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tarakad and Jankovic, 2020</xref>). As one of the world’s fastest growing neurological disorders, the economic cost of PD is estimated to be at least $51.9 billion a year in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The current drug therapies available for PD provide only symptomatic relief by enhancing the dopaminergic action, decreasing metabolism of DA, or replacing the natural form of DA with exogenous drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haddad et al., 2017</xref>). While it provides benefits in improving motor symptoms in the short term, chronic therapy can result in motor fluctuation and dyskinesia. Furthermore, many patients experience a wearing-off effect where levodopa loses its efficacy even with dosing adjustments. Despite potentially promising efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dawson and Dawson, 2019</xref>), there is yet to be a therapy that can halt or slow down disease progression.</p><p>In recent years, the drug discovery pipeline for neurological diseases has been stagnant, with a phase I to approval rate being only 8.4% from 2006 to 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wong et al., 2019</xref>) which is lower than the average approval rate of all therapeutic indications. One of the reasons for such lack of success can be attributed to the fact that conventional approach of target-based drug discovery is difficult in the setting of neurological diseases because of the complex etiology and biological pathways involved. Phenotypic screening provides a promising opportunity. In particular, the whole organism-based drug discovery has been successfully applied to model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Szabo, 2017</xref>). Larval zebrafish, being a vertebrate that can fit in 96-well plates, offers multiple advantages including genomic and anatomical conservation in addition to high throughput capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo, 2009</xref>). Screens have uncovered therapeutic leads that are currently in clinical testing and/or shed light on biological mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Macrae and Peterson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zon and Peterson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baraban et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsuda, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report a DA neuron-based neuroprotective drug discovery pipeline for PD, from assay development to small molecule screening, hit target validation, mechanisms, and ultimately, evolutionary conservation of neuroprotection across species including humans. Due to the late onset and variable phenotypic expressivity of genetic PD models and the highly toxic nature of neurotoxins (e.g. MPTP) to researchers, no good in vivo assay systems exist that are suitable for high content screening of neuro-protectives. We therefore first established an inducible chemogenetic DA neuron ablation model in larval zebrafish. This model expressed the <italic>E. coli</italic> nitroreductase (NTR) controlled by the promoter of tyrosine hydroxylase (<italic>th</italic>), a rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis. Addition of the commonly used and safe-to-handle antibiotic, metronidazole (MTZ), caused robust DA neuron loss. By showing that DA neuron loss is preceded by mitochondrial DNA damage and ensuing mitochondrial dysfunction, we demonstrated the validity and relevance of this model to PD for small molecule screening purpose. Using this model to screen &gt;1400 bioactive small molecules, we uncovered a series of compounds that protected against DA neuron loss by inhibiting different proteins in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), a pathway classically known for regulating vasoconstriction and water homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bader, 2010</xref>). Genetic validation and molecular characterization revealed that the angiotensin receptor 1 (AGTR1) acted cell autonomously in DA neurons, the inhibition of which restored the expression of mitochondrial pathway genes disrupted by neurotoxic insults. Furthermore, we showed that RAAS inhibitors were neuroprotective in a zebrafish 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model and a zebrafish model of Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder with strong comorbidity of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Riboldi and Di Fonzo, 2019</xref>). The AGTR1 inhibitor olmesartan was also protective in a <italic>Drosophila pink1</italic>-deficient PD model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, utilizing the Parkinson’s Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marek, 2018</xref>), we performed a clinical informatics analysis to uncover that RAAS inhibitors significantly slowed down PD progression. Together, our results delineate a powerful approach for neuroprotective small molecule drug discovery that leverages whole organism screening and cross-species validation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Nitroreductase-Metronidazole (NTR-MTZ) chemogenetic DA neuron ablation model shows mitochondrial damage prior to neuronal loss and is scalable for DA neuron imaging-based small molecule screening</title><p>Genetic PD models in rodents generally have weak, variable, and late onset degeneration phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dawson et al., 2010</xref>). Modeling neurodegeneration in zebrafish is a promising approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paquet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flinn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ana Lopez, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang, 2017</xref>), but neuroprotective screening based on direct imaging of DA neuron integrity has not been reported, in large part because high content screening needs assays that are sufficiently robust, sensitive, and scalable. Neurotoxins such as MPTP are highly toxic to experimenters and not scalable. We have therefore used an inducible chemogenetic DA neuron ablation model, employing the nitroreductase-metronidazole (NTR-MTZ) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williams, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pisharath and Parsons, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curado et al., 2008</xref>): NTR was expressed as a transgene in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH<sup>+</sup>) DA neurons to convert the pro-drug MTZ (a commonly used antibiotic) to the toxic nitroso radical form in vivo. Twenty-four hours (hrs) after adding MTZ to 5 days post fertilization (dpf) larval zebrafish, we observed at 6 dpf robust DA neuronal loss in the ventral forebrain region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the homologous group to mammalian substantia nigDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rink and Wullimann, 2001</xref>).

Previous reports suggest that MTZ as an antibiotic targets bacterial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edwards, 1979</xref>). In vertebrate cells, two organelles containing DNA are the nucleus and the mitochondria. A semi-quantitative PCR assay based on the notion that DNA lesions block DNA polymerase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Furda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yakes and Van Houten, 1997</xref>), was used to detect nuclear and mitochondrial DNA integrity. Total DNAs were extracted from DA neurons in DMSO control and 4.5 mM MTZ-treated transgenic larvae (8 hr after MTZ treatment, when DA neurons remain morphologically intact). Anterior brains (rostral to the mid-hindbrain boundary) were dissected and acutely dissociated. The mCherry<sup>+</sup> DA neurons were manually aspirated under a fluorescent microscope. PCR of equally long-length (~10 kb) nuclear or mitochondrial DNA products was carried out using primers as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Furda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yakes and Van Houten, 1997</xref>). This data uncovered a significant damage of mitochondrial DNA but not nuclear DNA in MTZ-exposed individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The nuclear DNA was unaffected possibly due to protection by nucleosomes; this observation also supports the notion that the time of our DNA integrity assessment precedes that of overt neurodegeneration.</p><p>We next performed in vivo time-lapse imaging, which uncovered mitochondrial dysfunction in morphologically intact DA neurons after MTZ treatment. These include reduced mitochondrial number, increased mitochondrial length, decreased motility and velocity. Interestingly, in MTZ-treated DA neurons, mobile mitochondria moved exclusively in retrograde direction toward neuronal soma, suggesting that they are targeted for repair and/or mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1 fig1video2">Figure 1—videos 1; 2</xref>). Together, mitochondrial defects are observed prior to DA neurodegeneration in the NTR-MTZ model, suggesting that mitochondrial DNA damage and ensuing mitochondrial dysfunction is likely a cause rather than a consequence of DA neuron degeneration.</p><p>Given the observed mitochondrial deficits prior to neurodegeneration in the NTR-MTZ model, we next wondered whether enhancing the activity of genes functioning in mitochondrial quality control would protect against neurodegeneration in the model. Homozygous <italic>parkin</italic> mutations account for the majority of early onset autosomal recessive PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kitada, 1998</xref>). The <italic>parkin</italic> gene encodes a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes mitochondrial quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</xref>). The zebrafish Parkin protein is approximately 80% identical to the human counterpart in functionally relevant domains. We therefore synthesized mRNAs encoding full-length human <italic>parkin</italic> gene or EGFP (control) and micro-injected them into one-cell stage <italic>Tg[fuguth:gal4-uas:GFP; uas-NTRmCherry]</italic> embryos. Expressivity of microinjected mRNAs was verified by observing the GFP fluorescent reporter following <italic>egfp</italic> mRNA injection. Because of the short-lived nature of all microinjected mRNAs, we treated control or <italic>parkin</italic> mRNA-injected embryos with MTZ at an earlier stage, 30 hr post fertilization (hpf), and subsequently imaged for mCherry at 50 hpf (rather than treatment at 5 dpf and imaging at 6 dpf as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This regimen of MTZ administration similarly led to DA neuron loss. Increased expression of Parkin significantly protected DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Moreover, increased expression of <italic>pink1</italic> and <italic>DJ-1</italic>, two other genes associated with mitochondrial quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</xref>), was also neuro-protective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–K</xref>). In the case of <italic>pink1</italic>, the kinase dead mutant form failed to show protective effects, further validating the specificity of our assay system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Human α-synuclein (either the wildtype or the A53T mutant form), associated with a dominant form of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Polymeropoulos, 1997</xref>), did not show any protection under the 9 mM MTZ treatment condition; mis-expression of the A53T mutant form of α-synuclein significantly worsened DA neuron integrity under the milder 4.5 mM MTZ treatment condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–M</xref>). This is consistent with the toxic nature of α-synuclein when mis-expressed. These results suggest that DA neuron degeneration in the NTR-MTZ model can be alleviated by enhancing the activity of mitochondrial quality control genes and aggravated by the activity of A53T mutant form of α-synuclein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A whole organism DA neuron-imaging based chemical screen identifies inhibitors of RAAS signaling as neuroprotective</title><p>We have previously described a high throughput in vivo brain imaging method in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu, 2016</xref>). Using this method and the established DA neuron ablation model as described above, we screened &gt;1400 bioactive compounds (SelleckChem) that are part of the UCSF Small Molecule Discovery Center (SMDC) bioactive screening set. Many have validated biological and pharmacological activities, with demonstrated safety and effectiveness in preclinical and clinical research, and some are FDA-approved therapeutics. A dual-flashlight plot of Brain Health Score (BHS) and strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) score were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu, 2016</xref>), in order to quantitatively document the effects of each compound on DA neuron integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition to the DMSO-positive control and MTZ-only negative control, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) was also used as a positive control. NAC is an over-the-counter available supplement that works primarily by restoring body’s natural antioxidant glutathione for proposed DA improvement in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Monti, 2019</xref>). In our screen, NAC had an SSMD score of 0.826. Around 100 out of 1403 compounds had the same or better SSMD scores than NAC (ranged from 0.826 to 6.832). Validation of these candidate hit compounds is ongoing. Among them, compounds that target different components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in particular caught our attention: First, compounds that target three different components of the RAAS signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) were all among the top 100 candidate hits [e.g. Olmesartan (angiotensin receptor 1-AGTR1 inhibitor) with the SSMD scores of 1.649 - ranked 14, aliskiren (renin inhibitor)’s SSMD score was 1.540 - ranked 20, imidapril (ACE inhibitor)’s SSMD score was 0.938 - ranked 69]. Additionally, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing all 13 RAAS pathway inhibitors from the primary screen with the entire screening library uncovered a significantly higher SSMD score for RAAS Inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Multiple hits targeting the same pathway thus built strong confidence in these compounds and in the involvement of RAAS pathway in DA neuron degeneration. Furthermore, literature search has uncovered reports of RAAS pathway inhibition for neuroprotection against PD and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grammatopoulos, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Muñoz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>). However, given the well-established role of these inhibitors in vascular remodeling and blood pressure control, it is conventionally thought that the neuroprotective effects of RAAS inhibition are due to their vascular actions, despite that RAAS pathway expression is detected in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wright and Harding, 2011</xref>). It therefore remains unclear how RAAS inhibition might be neuroprotective. Finally, since RAAS inhibitors are commonly used anti-hypertensives, it offers an opportunity to investigate their role in PD patients via retrospective clinical data analysis. Taken together, we have therefore chosen RAAS inhibitors for in-depth analysis in this study.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A high throughput in vivo imaging-based chemical screen uncovers the neuroprotective effects of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin (RAAS) pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A flow chart outlining the screening pipeline. 5dpf transgenic larvae expressing <italic>Tg[fuguth:gal4-uas:GFP;uas:NTRmCherry]</italic> were arranged in glass bottom 96-well plates and treated with MTZ (4.5 mM, 48 hrs) along with each of the 1403 bioactive compounds (n = 3 per screening compound).

As a positive control, we used levodopa, a gold standard symptomatic drug that can restore motor function in PD patients by increasing DA release from surviving neurons. Compared to vehicle controls, MTZ-treated animals showed a progressive decline of locomotive ability for the first 5 days post MTZ treatment and then reached steady low levels. Co-administration of levodopa 1 day after MTZ did not prevent initial locomotor decline, but was able to subsequently restore locomotor function, and interestingly, a hyper-locomotor state was reached at Day 14. The chronic use of levodopa leading to hyperactivity is previously reported in mouse studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gellhaar et al., 2015</xref>) also, uncontrolled involuntary muscle movement such as dyskinesia is a common side effect of chronic levodopa use in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Espay, 2018</xref>).

We therefore performed mass spectrometry after 14-day treatment of adult zebrafish with olmesartan medoxomil (the pro-drug form of olmesartan). The presence of active olmesartan was detected in the adult zebrafish brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

At present, there are no accepted progression biomarkers for PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Espay et al., 2017</xref>). The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), while widely utilized, suffers from limitations including subjectivity and ambiguities in the written text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Rating Scales for Parkinson’s Disease, 2003</xref>). Because of the wear-off and debilitating side effects of levodopa after prolonged use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Espay, 2018</xref>), clinicians delay the prescription of levodopa to PD patients until absolutely necessary for treating debilitating motor symptoms. Therefore, we used the Time-to-Levodopa as a quantifiable and objective parameter to measure disease progression. After propensity score matching between RAAS and no-RAAS cohorts (Figure S8A-C), our analysis found that the patients on RAAS inhibitors had a significantly delayed onset of levodopa therapy compared to the patients not on RAAS inhibitors (difference, –5.8; 95% CI –11.26 to –0.4254; p = 0.035) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To control for hypertension as a variable, we compared patients on RAAS inhibitors to those on other classes of anti-hypertensive medications.

The UPDRS part 2 and part 3, which examine the activities of daily living and motor function respectively, did not show significance in patients taking RAAS inhibitors when compared to other cohorts (p = 0.82) (Figure S8E-F). Taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of RAAS signaling slows down disease progression in human PD patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>For most neurodegenerative disorders, there exist no disease-modifying therapeutics. Here, we validated the NTR-MTZ-based chemogenetic DA neuron ablation model in zebrafish by showing that DA neuronal loss is preceded by preferential mitochondrial DNA damage and ensuing mitochondrial dysfunction. We then used this system to conduct a high-content DA neuron imaging-based chemical screen and identified the inhibitors of Renin-Angiotensin (RAAS) system to be significantly neuroprotective via cell-autonomous effects of the angiotensin receptor one in DA neurons. Dopamine neuron-specific RNA-seq further revealed the molecular action of RAAS signaling in mitochondrial gene regulation. Finally, inhibition of RAAS signaling was neuroprotective across species. Together, this study identifies RAAS inhibitors as promising therapeutics for slowing down PD progression and highlights a new approach composed of high content screening in zebrafish, cross-species validation, and examination of human clinical data to uncover previously unrecognized neuroprotective agents and underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Although MTZ has historically been widely prescribed as an antibiotic, the underlying mechanism of cell death in vertebrates has however remained elusive. By investigating the integrity of mitochondrial and nuclear DNAs, performing live imaging of mitochondria, and DA neuron-specific RNA-seq, we link the mode of NTR-MTZ-mediated cell death to mitochondrial dysfunction for the first time to our knowledge. This property, together with its safe and scalable nature, makes the NTR-MTZ-mediated cell ablation model in larval zebrafish a valuable small molecule discovery tool for disorders where mitochondrial dysfunction is a prevalent underlying pathophysiological mechanism.</p><p>Despite the mechanistic relevance of the NTR-MTZ model to PD in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction, this model has several limitations, including not being able to recapitulate the etiology of PD and the time course of neurodegeneration. Given these limitations, it is advisable that additional validation in etiologically relevant models as we have done in this study are to be carried out.</p><p>Our unbiased small molecule screen together with cross-species validations has revealed that inhibition of RAAS signaling is significantly neuroprotective for DA neurons in the context of animal PD models and moreover human PD patients. Hits that target different components of the RAAS pathway (e.g. renin, ACE, and <italic>agtr1</italic>) were uncovered from the primary screen and validated in secondary screening. The AGTR1 inhibitor olmesartan was further shown to be neuroprotective in adult zebrafish, in a zebrafish GD model and a MPP+ model, and <italic>Drosophila pink1</italic>-deficient model. The GD model was created by inhibiting the GBA protein with a chemical inhibitor CBE, which preferentially inhibit GBA1 but can also inhibit other related enzymes including GBA2. Despite this limitation, CBE treatment has been previously shown to recapitulate disease phenotypes in both mice and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vardi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artola, 2019</xref>). This chemically induced GD model presents several advantages over the genetic model of GD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keatinge, 2015</xref>): First, it shows significant DA neuronal loss at larval stages, whereas the genetic GD model only exhibit weak and variable deficit of DA neurons at adult stages. Second, it can be conveniently combined with transgenic lines that label DA neurons. Its conditional nature further allows us to gain temporal control over the access of DA neurons prior to degeneration.</p><p>The finding that RAAS inhibitors are also neuroprotective in the <italic>Drosophila pink1</italic>-deficient model suggests that the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms are deeply conserved across evolution. Intriguingly, literature search has uncovered reports of RAAS inhibitors’ neuroprotective effects in various animal models of neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms were not well characterized in these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grammatopoulos, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Muñoz, 2006</xref>). Our findings corroborate with these reports and further demystify the actions of RAAS inhibitors, by showing that <italic>agtr1</italic>a and 1b act cell autonomously in DA neurons beyond their conventional actions on the vasculature systems.</p><p>The DA neuron-specific RNA-seq has identified mitochondrial pathway genes and <italic>trim3</italic>, the expression of which was perturbed in the neurotoxic models and restored by RAAS inhibition. While the up-regulation of mitochondrial electron transport chain gene expression in the neurotoxic models appears counter-intuitive to the concept of neurodegeneration as a consequence of bioenergetic crisis, it is worth noting that the RNA-seq was carried out prior to overt neurodegeneration. Although upregulation of electron transport chain gene expression could be a compensatory response to mitochondrial damage or dysfunction, it could also lead to dysregulated metabolic pathways resulting in neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Area-Gomez et al., 2019</xref>). Future experiments to alter the expression of these genes either individually or in combination followed by evaluating DA neuron states will help further verify the cause-effect relationships.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that RAAS signaling via active <italic>agtr1</italic> may play a direct role in promoting neurodegeneration via disrupting mitochondrial gene regulation: First, among the pathways that are commonly altered in morphologically intact DA neurons from both neurotoxic models, those that regulate mitochondrial function have the highest significance values. The ~40 mitochondria-related genes were mostly nuclear genes that encode proteins ranging from electron transport chain subunits such as NADH ubiquinone, cytochrome-c oxidase, and ATP synthase to mitochondrial translocation machinery. The notion that olmesartan restored normalcy to a large extent suggests that AGTR1 is the culprit in mediating these gene expression changes. Second, AGTR1 expression is detected in the mitochondria of a variety of cell types including DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Valenzuela, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abadir, 2011</xref>), lending support that it may have a direct role in regulating mitochondrial function. Indeed, AGTR1 is reported to promote reactive oxygen species production and activate MAP kinase pathway that leads to the activation of transcription factors including NF-kB and AP-1, and P53 in the context of vascular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Min et al., 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, significant upregulation of AP-1 was observed in both neurotoxic models, suggesting the following possible model: Neurotoxic insults activate AGTR1, which activates kinase signaling cascades that upregulate the expression of transcription factors such as AP-1, in turn increasing the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain genes. Such altered mitochondrial gene expression is associated with increased reactive oxygen species production leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death. Future follow-up studies on the genes and pathways discovered in this cell type-specific RNA-seq dataset shall provide deeper insights into how active AGTR1 perturbs mitochondrial function and aggravates neurodegeneration.</p><p>The evolutionarily conserved actions of RAAS inhibitors together with their prevalent use for anti-hypertension in PD patients prompted us to examine and subsequently discover their significant effect in slowing down PD progression. Previous studies that interrogate electronic health records (EHR) data reported mixed results regarding the effect of RAAS inhibitors on the incidence of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Warda et al., 2019</xref>). Given the diverse and complex etiology of PD, this is not surprising. In this study, rather than evaluating the incidence of PD, we focused on PD progression using the Time-to-Levodopa therapy as an innovative criterion in addition to the commonly used UPDRS scores. A significant effect of RAAS inhibitors was detected in delaying the time to levodopa therapy. This marker for disease progression can also be applied to other EHR or clinical data where exam metrics are incomplete due to inadequate hospital protocols, or text mining is difficult due to variations in note taking practices by healthcare workers.</p><p>Our sample size of 308 PD patients is relatively modest. It would therefore be of interest to further expand this analysis to a larger patient population. It is also worth noting that the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability of currently available RAAS inhibitors in humans vary from compounds to compounds and are generally poor for compounds such as olmesartan and losartan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Michel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Unger, 2003</xref>). This may contribute to the modest neuroprotective effects observed in the clinical data (e.g., UPDRS part 2 and part three scores showing no significant improvements). With expanded patient population, it may be possible to evaluate and compare the BBB profile of RAAS inhibitors and their extent of neuroprotection. Given the cell autonomous mechanisms that we have discovered through animal studies, we postulate that RAAS inhibitors with better BBB penetrating ability will possibly have a higher neuroprotective effect. RAAS pathway components are broadly expressed in the CNS, suggesting that its inhibition could be broadly neuroprotective, not only for PD, but also for other neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec

id="s4-1"><title>Summary</title><p>This study was designed to identify neuroprotective small molecules for Parkinson’s disease (PD). A chemo-genetic DA neuron degeneration model employing the NTR-MTZ system was first characterized to uncover mitochondrial dysfunction as a plausible cause of cell death. A whole organism DA neuron imaging-based small molecule screen employing such transgenic zebrafish was then carried out. By screening 1,403 bioactive small molecule compounds, the RAAS pathway inhibitors were identified to be significantly neuroprotective. Their neuroprotective actions were further validated in multiple animal models and in human PD patients. Cell type-specific CRISPR and RNA-seq revealed a DA neuron-autonomous regulation of mitochondrial function as a mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of RAAS inhibitors. In vivo studies employing zebrafish were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Use Committee at University of California, San Francisco (Approval Number: AN179000). Use of patient data in the PPMI database was approved by the Michael J Fox Foundation PPMI Data and Publications Committee. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The sample size (<italic>n</italic>) for each experimental group was indicated in the figure legends. The compound treatment, image collection, and data analysis, for the compound screening, manual counting for secondary hit validation of RAAS inhibitors, western blot of morpholino injections, mass spectrometry of adult fish brains, and adult zebrafish behavior studies were performed in a blinded manner. For all other experiments, the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. All the experiments were replicated at least two independent times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Zebrafish husbandry and transgenic lines</title><p>Zebrafish were raised on a 14:10 hr light/dark cycle and maintained in the zebrafish facility according to the University of California San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee standards.

At 5 dpf, control and morphants were treated with 9 mM MTZ for 24 hr and confocal imaging was performed with brightfield and DsRed channel at 6dpf. Eight-bit images were cropped to isolate the diencephalic region of the brain and the DA neuron intensity was quantified with ImageJ.</p><p>For western blotting, the 6dpf larvae with DMSO or MTZ treatment were collected after performing confocal imaging. Thirty larvae for each group were homogenized in 150 uL of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 minutes at 99°C and transferred to ice. The samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 rpm and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube with 5 x SDS protein loading buffer. The samples were loaded into Mini-PROTEAN TGX Gels (cat# 4561083) and run at 180 V for 50 min. Transblotting was done using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (cat# 1704150) and washed with PBS. Primary antibodies were incubated at 4°C overnight. For the anti-rabbit <italic>agtr1</italic> antibody (Proteintech 25343–1-AP), 1:500 was used; for the anti-mouse beta actin control (Sigma A5441), 1:2000 dilution was used. Horseradish Peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies were used (Abcam ab6721 and ab6728) with 2 hr incubation. After washing off the secondary antibodies with PBS, the western blot was visualized with the iBright CL750 Imaging System (Invitrogen A44116). The expected bands of 37 kda for anti-beta actin and 50 kda for anti-AGTR1 were identified and analyzed with imageJ using the ‘Mean Grey Value’ measurement tool.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo whole organism imaging-based high-content screening assay and secondary validation</title><p>The NTR/MTZ model with NTR expressed in DA neurons was used for drug screening, secondary hit validation, and mechanistic studies of DA neuron degeneration. 4.5 mM, 9 mM, or 10 mM MTZ were used in larval zebrafish with varying time courses (ranging from 8 to 48 hr) to achieve different goals (e.g. pre-, mild, moderate, or severe DA neuron loss). Five mM MTZ was used for prolonged treatment in adult zebrafish.</p><p>Drug screening was performed in 96-well plates with the bioactive compound library from SelleckChem obtained from the UCSF Small Molecule Discovery Center (SMDC). Ten µM of compounds were dissolved in blue egg water containing 0.2% DMSO for a total volume of 200 µL. <italic>Tg[fuguth:gal4-uas:GFP; uas:NTRmCherry]</italic> were treated with 200 µM 1-phenyl 2-thiourea (PTU) on 1dpf and at 3dpf, larvae were transferred to 96-well plates containing the screening compounds or 0.2% DMSO (positive control). Four hr later, 4.5 mM MTZ was added to compound-containing wells as well as wells that serve as negative control. Treatment lasted for 48 hrs. At 5dpf, the larvae were imaged with brightfield and TexRed channels. The multi-pose method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu, 2016</xref>) was used to image DA neurons in vivo using In Cell Analyzer 2000. The images were analyzed using a custom CellProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones, 2008</xref>) pipeline that masks the eyes and auto-detects the DA neurons to calculate the Brain Health Score (BHS) and SSMD score as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu, 2016</xref>). In brief, we compared automated methods for neuronal counting vs. total fluorescence intensity measure, and have found them to be strongly correlated, with the latter revealing the most significant difference between positive control (vehicle-treated) and negative control (MTZ-treated). This is likely because neurodegeneration is often initiated at the level of neuronal processes, followed by the loss of cell bodies. Therefore, we have chosen to quantifying fluorescence intensity in our study.</p><p>For secondary hit validations, 40 µL of 1.5% agarose was added to ensure that the larvae were embedded in a dorsal down position for confocal imaging before and after MTZ treatment. The live confocal imaging was conducted using In Cell Analyzer 6000 with DsRed and FITC channels with 200 ms exposure time. For manual counting of DA neurons, experimenters were blinded to the treatment conditions. Individual larval zebrafish were mounted in 1.5% agarose. Ventral forebrain DA neurons were observed under a Zeiss epi-fluorescent microscope and counted on one side of the brain in an identical manner across all larval zebrafish. For the dose response studies, concentrations of the RAAS inhibitors were prepared from a series of fold dilutions. The RAAS pathway inhibitors used in the study including olmesartan, aliskiren, captopril, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (cat #144689-63-4, 62571-86-2, 173334-58-2). Metronidazole and NAC were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (cat# S1907, S1623). CBE was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (cat# 6090-95-5). MPP+ was purchased from Millipore Sigma (cat # 36913-39-0).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Adult and larval Zebrafish locomotor behavior assay</title><p>For all adult and larval behavior assays, animals were individualized and incubated in their home tanks in a 26°C behavior room overnight for habituation. Six-well plates were used to house individual larva in each well with 5 mL of total volume per well. The wells were placed on a lightbox and the videos were recorded from a top-down view. For the adult behavior experiments, the fish were individually housed in their home tank with 500 mL of system water. For the 2-week duration of the adult behavior test, they were fed with flakes in the morning and replaced with fresh water containing the test compounds daily. The recordings were taken from the top view for 5 min. The total distance moved for the 5-min duration was analyzed through the EthoVision XT software using the dynamic subtraction algorithm with detection limits between 10 and 100 pixels.

Afterwards, flies were dissected for DA neuron staining. At least seven individuals were examined for each condition. Dissected brain tissue samples were briefly washed with 1 x PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 1 x PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. Fixed samples were subsequently blocked with 1 x PBS containing 5% normal goat serum and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature followed by incubation with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The primary antibodies used were: chicken anti-GFP (1:5000, Abcam), and rabbit anti-TH (1:1000, Pel-Freez). After three washing steps with 1 x PBS/0.25% Triton X-100 each for 15 min at room temperature, the samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594- and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Molecular Probes) for 3 hr at room temperature and subsequently mounted in SlowFade Gold (Invitrogen).

The library was prepared using the Lexogen QuantSeq 3’ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (cat# 015). The libraries were quality controlled using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and pooled at 20 mL of 3 ng/mL concentration. The RNA-seq was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 (cat SY-401–4001), with single end 50 bp, generating 350 million reads per lane. FastQC was performed for quality check and all sequences showed high per base sequence quality with greater than 75% uniquely mapped reads aligned against GRCz11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The count normalization was performed using the DESeq2’s median of ratios method which accounts for sequencing depth and RNA composition. This normalization method allows for gene count comparisons between samples, which is suitable for comparing differential gene expression across different sample groups with high sensitivity and specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullard et al., 2010</xref>).

The data were downloaded and accessed in May 2019. Initially 423 de novo PD patients, defined as subjects with a diagnosis of PD with two years or less who are not taking any PD medications, were identified, in which 115 patients had missing information or withdrew from the study making the total included subjects to be 308 patients. Among the 308 patients, 96 patients were taking either ACE inhibitors or ARBs (RAAS group) while 212 patients were not taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs (no RAAS group). Based on the medication history, the average Time-to-Levodopa was compared between the two groups. Among the 212 patients, 42 patients had a diagnosis of hypertension (ICD code R03.0) and were taking other medications for the management of their hypertension. A total of 170 patients were neither hypertensive nor taking other blood pressure medications.

interesting. Furthermore, they felt a central finding of your study, namely that inhibition of RAAS signaling can protect dopaminergic neurons from death, provides a compelling hypothesis with potential relevance for the treatment of Parkinson's or other neurodegenerative conditions. Given the apparent conservation of RAAS inhibitor protective effects in flies, zebrafish, and possibly in humans, the findings presented in your paper are likely to be of substantial interest and stimulate additional investigation of the role of RAAS signaling in neuronal survival.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Zebrafish Screen Reveals Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors as Neuroprotective via Mitochondrial Restoration in Dopamine Neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

It can also inhibit GBA2 and 3. Please address this issue.</p><p>7) Several issues of quality in the data, organization, figure presentation, and writing are highlighted in the reviews and must be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors of this manuscript do several things very effectively. The scope of the studies is impressive, spanning characterization of mitochondrial dysfunction in the zebrafish model, a small molecule screen, mechanistic studies of hit compounds, validation in orthogonal models, and even a retrospective analysis of clinical data from PD patients. Even smaller details, like confirming drugs have crossed the blood brain barrier in zebrafish, have been performed carefully, suggesting a patient and determined commitment to understanding whether the central findings are conserved and relevant for human health. Data quality appears to be good, overall, and the thoroughness of the studies gives confidence that the findings are real and consistent.</p><p>The implications of the findings are really quite interesting, namely that RAAS inhibition may delay disease progression in PD and possibly in other related neurodegenerative disorders. This idea is not entirely new-there is some evidence for this idea in the literature, including evidence of RAAS inhibitors ameliorating animal models of PD and some evidence of a benefit to RAAS inhibition in PD patients. But this paper brings new credence and interest to the idea in two ways, first by arriving at the idea through a relatively unbiased phenotypic screen, and second by demonstrating that the effects are cell autonomous effects on the DA neurons themselves, not an indirect effect through modulating hypertension or some other physiological factor. Although the manuscript does not definitively address the mechanism of action, evidence of effects on mitochondrial structure and function are thought provoking and provide opportunity for future exploration. This manuscript is likely to stimulate further exploration of the role of the RAAS in DA neuronal survival and PD, including further mechanistic work and clinical investigation.</p><p>This excellent manuscript would be improved by attention to several issues:</p><p>1. The process for hit-calling is not described. It would be important to clarify how hits were defined, how many hits came from the screen, and how the RAAS hits compared to other hits identified by the screen.</p><p>2. Further discussion of the relevance of a NTR-MTZ model for human PD is warranted. How similar is the model to what happens in human PD. To what extent are findings relevant, and what are the limitations of this model.</p><p>3. The fact that RAAS inhibitors are also effective in Gaucher Disease is interesting. Will RAAS inhibition prevent loss of other cell types in other neurodegenerative disorders? Is it anti-apoptotic generally? What are the bounds of its ability to be neuroprotective?</p><p>4. Why doesn't RAAS inhibition show any benefit for UPDRS part 2 and 3?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors using a Transgenic Zebrafish model which destroys the DA neurons after the application of a drug in an attempt to model Parkinson's disease. This was used as an in vivo screening tool to identify neuroprotective compounds.</p><p>This highlighted inhibitors of RAAS signalling as lead hits. They subsequently tested their lead compound (olmesartan) in additional fish and fly models.</p><p>The authors show that, as these compounds (inhibitors of RAAS signalling) are routinely used to treat other conditions, by analysing PD patients who have taken them, they show that inhibitors of RAAS signalling could be slowing patient symptoms. This implies inhibitors of RAAS signalling maybe also neuroprotective in human patients.</p><p>The major strengths of this study are using the zebrafish as an in vivo model to screen potentially neuroprotective drugs against. They also confirm their top hits in other in vivo models related to neuronal health and subsequently include a small retrospective study on PD patients.</p><p>However a major weakness, are that the main models used for the screen and the validation are not related to Parkinson's. The NTR system used to destroy DA neurons/ effect their viability, would do so in any cell type it is expressed in. Therefore the screen is investigating compounds that protect against MTZ /NTR toxicity and are not related to PD.</p><p>However despite these issues, the authors show data demonstrating that the lead compounds they identify are likely working through a rescue of mitochondrial function, through RNA seq experiments from RNA directly taken form DA neurons. As mitochondrial dysfunction is a key features in PD, coupled with the retrospective PD patient study, suggests that inhibitors of RAAS signalling could have therapeutic benefit.</p><p>1. The primary model used for the screen, is not a model of PD but actually a model of MTZ/NTR cell death. The results of the screen and its relevance to PD and neuroprotection are difficult to interpret.</p><p>2. The primary assay measures total fluorescence of TH neurons as a rapid way for quantifying neuronal health in the DA system in vivo. This is fine for a large screen, but inappropriate for validation experiments. TH neurons can be counted very easily in zebrafish larvae. Quantifying fluorescence can be affected by levels of the transgene and size of individual neurons/axons. The neurons in these experiments would need to be manually counted, which should be possible from the images. Figure 2B, H for example.</p><p>3. Appropriate literature needs to be cited and referred to, as the majority of the cited sources are over 5 years old. They therefore maybe out of date with the field.</p><p>For example, the opening line of the Results section states that &quot;no currently available models are suitable for neuroprotective screening.&quot; and that &quot;genetic models have a weak and variable late onset degeneration phenotype.&quot; The review cited here is from 2010, and these statements are incorrect. Since 2010 (and even before then) many zebrafish genetic models of neurodegeneration (including PD) have been characterised which show neuronal loss and screen able phenotypes – including Lopez 2017, Paquet 2009 (Zf Tau models), Flinn et al. 2013, Zhang et al., 2017 (PINK1 linked PD). Many of these studies include successful Zebrafish neuroprotective screens.</p><p>4. The paper is written in a way that is difficult to follow. Techniques and strategies are often referred to vaguely, without proper explanation of their function and how they work. When techniques are explained fully, it often happens mid-way through the paper. For example, in the first results paragraph, it is mentioned that DA neurons are isolated, but without reference to how, or any sort of quality control. FACS is eventually mentioned, but this is several sections later.</p><p>5. Adult experiments would need to have their DA neurons quantified to confirm neurodegeneration occurs in Tg line at adult stages. Behavioural defects are not a suitable proxy.</p><p>6. It is unclear why a tissue specific Crispr was employed, conventional mutants of atgr1a and 1b could have been utilised.</p><p>7. Using additional in vivo models to confirm the efficacy of the compounds is admiral but, the models chosen are not PD models. CBE chemical model would model Gaucher's disease and not PD. Furthermore, complete loss of GBA function does produce phenotypes in larval zebrafish, but without causing neuronal loss. As the data shows that using high concentrations of CBE (Figure 4 supp 1) is lethal, the sub lethal doses used in the study likely cause neuronal loss due to off target effects, not related to GBA1 inhibition.</p><p>8. It is interesting that the RAAS inhibitors rescue PINK1 <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of Parkinson's disease. But this is the only example of a legitimate Parkinson's model. It would have been helpful to use more appropriate zebrafish models of PD such as PINK1 KO. Making mutants is time consuming, however MPP+ treatments in fish larval are very robust and rapid at producing DA neuronal loss and is routine within the PD field to test potential neuroprotective compounds.</p><p>9. Clearly a lot of data has gone into this manuscript. However, although many data sets are of interest, they seem to go off on tangents and are distracting from the wider narrative (mass spec experiments for example). I would recommend streamlining the results by only including only the most relevant data sets in order to make a more cohesive narrative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Kim et al., used a new technology, chemo-genetic nitroreductase-metronidazole (NTR-MTZ)-based dopamine (DA) neuron ablation model in larval zebrafish. They developed this assay to perform an unbiased drug screen of 1403 bioactive compounds. They discovered that multiple Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosteron-System (RAAS) inhibitors show significant neuroprotection against DA neuronal loss. They further show that these RAAS inhibitors show protective effect sin a chemical-induced zebrafish Gaucher disease model (CBE) and a <italic>Drosophila</italic> pink1-deficiecy model, arguing that the neuroprotective effect of RAAS inhibitors is evolutionary conserved. The authors further confirm their finding in animal models of PD and PD patients. RAAS inhibitors are commonly used anti-hypertension drugs. Hence, they examined the Patient Electronic Health Records to compare PD progression in patients who were on RAAS inhibitors treatment to those who were not. They found that PD patients who were on RAAS inhibitors show a longer levodopa-free period than those who were not, supporting their observations in zebrafish and fly PD models that RAAS inhibitors alleviate degenerative phenotypes.</p><p>In summary, the authors provide mechanistic evidence through model organisms (zebrafish and fly) and clinical data from PD patients to support the beneficial effect of RAAS inhibitors in PD patients. This is novel, important and of interest to the research and medical community. A major concern relates to the specificity of their fughth-gal4 usa-GFP; uas-NTRmCherry construct in the DA neurons (Concern 1). Since most of the mechanistic conclusions derived in this manuscript are built upon the use of this expression system, it is important to explore its specificity in DA versus non-DA neurons. In addition, this manuscript is not well written and the figures are poorly organized. They try to present too many data in the main figures. There are also many grammatical errors in this manuscript. The authors need to rewrite parts of the manuscript and redesign figures.</p><p>Here is a list of concerns.</p><p>1. In Figure 1A and 2C, the control images show strong mcherry signal in eyes. However, the MTZ-treated fish does not show mcherry signal in the eyes. Were these two images taken in the same focal plane? Are there TH<sup>+</sup> cells in zebrafish eyes? How specific is the expression of fughth-gal4 usa-GFP; uas-NTRmCherry construct in the DA neurons? Since most of the mechanistic conclusions made in this manuscript are built upon the use of this expression system, it is really important to determine its specificity in DA neurons. If not, they need to address these issues, and/or state why this is not an issue in their opinion.</p><p>2. Figure 1C-H is one of the poorly organized figures. It is very difficult to see the differences in mitochondrial length, as well as the movement, velocity and direction of mitos in these two images. A proper label is required. Additionally, time-lapse images or movies should be included.</p><p>3. The &quot;relative dopamine intensity&quot; of the condition &quot;GFP 9mM MTZ&quot; in Figure 1J is much smaller than the same condition in the other figures (Figure 1I, K, L and M). This level is out of the range of the error bar and hence statistically significant. The authors need to explain this discrepancy.</p><p>4. In the manuscript the authors mention that the stability of the parkin mRNA is poor. What is the stability of ectopically expressed parkin mRNA? The authors need to include a control to show the levels of parkin in their experimental time points.</p><p>5. In Figure 1L, the authors argue that a-Syn + 9mM MTZ does not affect dopamine levels. How about 4.5mM MTZ + a-Syn? In Figure 1M, 4.5mM MTZ + A53T but not 9mM MTZ + A53T show a difference. Maybe a lower concentration of MTZ (4.5mM) + a-Syn will affect dopamine levels. Moreover, the authors use several concentration of MTZ in this manuscript, 4.5mM, 5mM and 9mM. This lack of consistency questions interpretability.</p><p>6. In Figure 3B, the authors argue that the expression of the RAAS pathway genes are up-regulated in DA neurons by comparing them to the non-DA neurons. Does MTZ affect the expression of these genes?</p><p>7. In Figure 4, the specificity of CBE, the GBA1 inhibitor, is a concern. It can also inhibit GBA2 and 3. Please address this issue. Moreover, the pattern of the highlighted cells shown in Figure 4C looks different in some images. Were these images taken from the same focal plane? Furthermore, the quantification of the 5HT signals does not match the intensity of the presented images. Again, poor data quality.</p><p>8. Figure 5 is a busy and very poorly organized figure. The table should be remove from this figure and presented as an independent table. The ontology clusters (Figure 5C-D), are way too small that the authors had to remove the label of nodes. Without such labels makes these clusters are meaningless to the readers. Moreover, does any of these clusters been experimentally confirmed? Why cram so many data in a figure as there are no restrictions in <italic>eLife</italic>???</p><p>9. There are no scale bars in Figure 6. The images in Figure 6D-E are blurry. It is very difficult to see the indented thorax phenotype. The label of the y-axis in Figure 6J is wrong. Again, poor figure quality.</p><p>If these issues are addressed I am inclined to accept the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69795.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be important to clarify how hits were defined, how many hits came from the screen, and how the RAAS hits compared to other hits identified by the screen.</p></disp-quote><p>We have described the criteria for defining hits (i.e., based on the SSMD scores as we have previously described, see Liu et al., PLOS ONE, 2016, DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0164645).

We have provided a blinded manual count, which showed that RAAS inhibitors protected DA neurons compared to vehicle-treated animals (See Figure 2-supplement 2A).</p><p>As the reviewer acknowledged, such manual counting was impractical for the screening purposes. Additionally, the number of neuronal counts is also sensitive to the levels of the transgene (i.e., higher transgene expression will make more neurons become detectable and countable). In our previous paper that established the high content screening pipeline (Liu et al., PLOS ONE, 2016, DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0164645), we have compared automated methods for neuronal counting vs total fluorescence intensity measure, and have found them to be strongly correlated, with the latter revealing the most significant difference between positive control (vehicle-treated) and negative control (MTZ-treated). This is likely because neurodegeneration is often initiated at the level of neuronal processes.

One possibility is that the currently available RAAS inhibitors are not sufficient to improve all aspects of the disease, due to their inadequate capability to cross the blood-brain barrier in humans.

Depending on the nature of GBA mutations, Gaucher disease (GD) shows varying severity from early childhood neurodegeneration to PD.</p><p>Hence, GBA mutations are the most common genetic risk factor for PD (Riboldi and Di Fonzo, Cells 8, 364, 2019). Chemical inhibition of GBA has been used to model the disease in both mice (Vardi et al., J. Pathol. 239, 496, 2016) and zebrafish (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 141, 4214, 2019). Moderate DA neuronal loss is also observed in older zebrafish (12 wpf, weeks post fertilization) that are genetically deficient for GBA activity (Keatinge et al., Hum. Mol. Genet. 24, 6640, 2015).</p><p>In addition to inhibiting GBA1, CBE can also inhibit other GBAs to a less extent (See our response to the Essential Revisions point #6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. It is interesting that the RAAS inhibitors rescue PINK1 <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of Parkinson's disease. But this is the only example of a legitimate Parkinson's model. It would have been helpful to use more appropriate zebrafish models of PD such as PINK1 KO. Making mutants is time consuming, however MPP+ treatments in fish larval are very robust and rapid at producing DA neuronal loss and is routine within the PD field to test potential neuroprotective compounds.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We have provided data showing the neuroprotective effect of olmesartan in the MPP+-treated larval zebrafish (See Figure 4—figure supplement 2, page 10, line 306-313).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Clearly a lot of data has gone into this manuscript. However, although many data sets are of interest, they seem to go off on tangents and are distracting from the wider narrative (mass spec experiments for example). I would recommend streamlining the results by only including only the most relevant data sets in order to make a more cohesive narrative.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. Olmesartan reportedly has a poor capability to cross the blood brain barrier in humans. Therefore, we found it important to determine whether the drug is indeed present in the zebrafish brain. We saw reduced presence in the brain compared to the body, but the amount detected in the brain is sufficient to engage AGTR1 based on the compound Ki. This increased access to the brain in zebrafish compared to mammals is possibly due to the less tight BBB in zebrafish and/or the continuous bath delivery of the drug. These data are therefore critical to corroborate with the observed cell autonomous effect of AGTR1 inhibition in DA neuron protection. We have clarified these points in the revised manuscript (page 8, line 231-234).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Here is a list of concerns.</p><p>1. In Figure 1A and 2C, the control images show strong mcherry signal in eyes. However, the MTZ-treated fish does not show mcherry signal in the eyes. Were these two images taken in the same focal plane? Are there TH<sup>+</sup> cells in zebrafish eyes? How specific is the expression of fughth-gal4 usa-GFP; uas-NTRmCherry construct in the DA neurons? Since most of the mechanistic conclusions made in this manuscript are built upon the use of this expression system, it is really important to determine its specificity in DA neurons. If not, they need to address these issues, and/or state why this is not an issue in their opinion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. The red fluorescent signal in the eyes is due to pigment-derived autofluorescence, which, for unknown reasons, display variability across individual larval zebrafish. We have clarified this point in the Figure 1 legend (Page 27, line 599).</p><p>Regarding the specificity of this line in labeling the DA neurons of interest, please see our response to the Essential Revisions point #5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 1C-H is one of the poorly organized figures. It is very difficult to see the differences in mitochondrial length, as well as the movement, velocity and direction of mitos in these two images. A proper label is required. Additionally, time-lapse images or movies should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We have added arrowheads to demarcate the elongated mitochondria in MTZ-treated sample (Figure 1C). We have also added movies to show the dynamicity of mitochondria (Figure 1-video 1 and 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The &quot;relative dopamine intensity&quot; of the condition &quot;GFP 9mM MTZ&quot; in Figure 1J is much smaller than the same condition in the other figures (Figure 1I, K, L and M). This level is out of the range of the error bar and hence statistically significant. The authors need to explain this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. The data presented in Figure 1I-M were collected with different batches of animals and in some cases different batches of stock MTZ chemical. We do notice batch-to-batch variability in the effects of MTZ, and therefore always included all necessary controls for each set of data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In the manuscript the authors mention that the stability of the parkin mRNA is poor. What is the stability of ectopically expressed parkin mRNA? The authors need to include a control to show the levels of parkin in their experimental time points.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. What we referred to is the general stability of mRNAs after microinjection into one-cell stage zebrafish embryos. This is applicable to all mRNAs (not just parkin mRNA). Due to this consideration, we started MTZ treatment earlier and examined DA neurons at ~ 50 hours post fertilization (hpf) in this set of experiments rather than the 5 days post fertilization (dpf) used in our screen and other experiments described in the manuscript. We have clarified this point in the revised manuscript (page 5-6, line 156-160).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 1L, the authors argue that a-Syn + 9mM MTZ does not affect dopamine levels. How about 4.5mM MTZ + a-Syn? In Figure 1M, 4.5mM MTZ + A53T but not 9mM MTZ + A53T show a difference. Maybe a lower concentration of MTZ (4.5mM) + a-Syn will affect dopamine levels. Moreover, the authors use several concentration of MTZ in this manuscript, 4.5mM, 5mM and 9mM. This lack of consistency questions interpretability.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. Figure 1M showed that A53T mRNA injection significantly worsened DA neuron integrity in 4.5 mM MTZ-treated animals (milder degeneration) but not in 9 mM MTZ-treated animals, possibly due to a ceiling effect of degeneration in the latter case. We agree with the reviewer that it is highly possible that WT a-syn can also worsen DA neuron degeneration in 4.5 mM MTZ-treated animals, but we did not have that data. We have clarified these points in the revised manuscript (See page 6, line 165-172).</p><p>We used 4.5 mM, 9 or 10 mM MTZ in larval zebrafish to achieve moderate vs. severe DA neuron ablation. We used 5 mM MTZ in the prolonged treatment experiment in adult zebrafish. We have clarified these points in the revised manuscript (see Material Methods section page 20, line 598-602).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 3B, the authors argue that the expression of the RAAS pathway genes are up-regulated in DA neurons by comparing them to the non-DA neurons. Does MTZ affect the expression of these genes?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. Figure 3B showed detectable expression of RAAS pathway genes in FACs-purified DA neurons. The expression of certain genes (e.g., PRR-prorenin receptor, AGTR1a, AGTR1b, and ACE) appears to be enriched in DA neurons compared to the rest of the cells.</p><p>We have examined our DA neuron-specific RNA-seq data. By comparing control versus MTZ-treated samples, we found that prorenin receptor(<italic>atp6ap2</italic>), <italic>agtr1b</italic>, and <italic>ace2</italic> were significantly upregulated in the MTZ treated group compared to the control (padj=0.001, 0.032, and 0.015 respectively)(See page 11, line 333-339).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 4, the specificity of CBE, the GBA1 inhibitor, is a concern. It can also inhibit GBA2 and 3. Please address this issue. Moreover, the pattern of the highlighted cells shown in Figure 4C looks different in some images. Were these images taken from the same focal plane? Furthermore, the quantification of the 5HT signals does not match the intensity of the presented images. Again, poor data quality.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. Regarding the utility of CBE, see our response to the Essential Revisions point #6.</p><p>Images in Figure 4C were taken from wholemount larval zebrafish brains immuno-stained with TH (red) and 5HT (green) antibodies. The images shown were taken using the Andor Zyla sCMOS camera with a Z-stack of 10 to 14 planes depending on the sample thickness with a Z-step of 3 μm to cover the rostral region of the ventral posterior tuberculum 5HT and ventral forebrain DA neurons. Due to the thickness of the whole brain and variability in tissue flattening during the slide mounting procedure, images from different brains could appear different. In the revised manuscript, we have included the cropped images that consistently cover the same regions across all samples and highlighted the 5HT and DA neuron regions that were used for quantification (Figure 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 5 is a busy and very poorly organized figure. The table should be remove from this figure and presented as an independent table. The ontology clusters (Figure 5C-D), are way too small that the authors had to remove the label of nodes. Without such labels makes these clusters are meaningless to the readers. Moreover, does any of these clusters been experimentally confirmed? Why cram so many data in a figure as there are no restrictions in eLife???</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We have rearranged the order of Figure 5 for better flow of the paper and making it less busy. The Cytoscape network clusters figures have been enlarged with better labeling of the nodes. As suggested, we have also removed the table from Figure 5 and made it an independent Table (Table 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. There are no scale bars in Figure 6. The images in Figure 6D-E are blurry. It is very difficult to see the indented thorax phenotype. The label of the y-axis in Figure 6J is wrong. Again, poor figure quality.</p><p>If these issues are addressed I am inclined to accept the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We have added the scale bar and improved the image quality to show the indented thorax phenotype better in revised Figure 6.</p></body></sub-article></article>
