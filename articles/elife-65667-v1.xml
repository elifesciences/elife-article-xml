Here, we characterised SK/CCK-type signalling for the first time in a non-chordate deuterostome – the starfish <italic>Asterias rubens</italic> (phylum Echinodermata). In this species, two neuropeptides (ArSK/CCK1, ArSK/CCK2) derived from the precursor protein ArSK/CCKP act as ligands for an SK/CCK-type receptor (ArSK/CCKR) and these peptides/proteins are expressed in the nervous system, digestive system, tube feet, and body wall. Furthermore, ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 cause dose-dependent contraction of cardiac stomach, tube foot, and apical muscle preparations in vitro, and injection of these neuropeptides in vivo triggers cardiac stomach retraction and inhibition of the onset of feeding in <italic>A. rubens</italic>. Thus, an evolutionarily ancient role of SK/CCK-type neuropeptides as inhibitory regulators of feeding-related processes in the Bilateria has been conserved in the unusual and unique context of the extra-oral feeding behaviour and pentaradial body plan of an echinoderm.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Asterias rubens</italic></kwd><kwd>starfish</kwd><kwd>sulfakinin/cholecystokinin</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>receptors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M001644/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elphick</surname><given-names>Maurice R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M001032/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Alexandra M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2018-200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elphick</surname><given-names>Maurice R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>518612</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yañez Guerra</surname><given-names>Luis Alfonso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fund for Scientific Research - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delroisse</surname><given-names>Jérôme</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009148</institution-id><institution>Queen Mary University of London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yañez Guerra</surname><given-names>Luis Alfonso</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Starfish feed by everting their stomach out of their mouth over prey and, interestingly, this unusual feeding mechanism is inhibited by substances similar to hormones that regulate feeding in humans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The peptide hormones cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin were discovered and named on account of their effects as stimulators of gall bladder contraction and gastric secretion of pepsin/acid, respectively, in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Edkins, 1906</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ivy ACO and Goldberg, 1928</xref>). Determination of the structures of CCK and gastrin revealed that they have the same C-terminal structural motif (Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH<sub>2</sub>), indicative of a common evolutionary origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gregory et al., 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mutt and Jorpes, 1968</xref>). However, CCK and gastrin are derived from different precursor proteins, which are subject to cell/tissue-specific processing to give rise to bioactive peptides of varying length (e.g. CCK-8 and CCK-33; gastrin-17 and gastrin-34) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boel et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deschenes et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rehfeld et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, CCK and gastrin have a tyrosine residue at positions 7 and 6 from the C-terminal amide, respectively, which can be sulphated post-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rehfeld et al., 2007</xref>). The effects of CCK and gastrin in mammals are mediated by two G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), CCK-A (CCKR1) and CCK-B (CCKR2), with both sulphated and non-sulphated forms of CCK and gastrin acting as ligands for the CCK-B receptor, whilst the CCK-A receptor is selectively activated by sulphated CCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Weerth et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dufresne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kopin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Noble and Roques, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wank et al., 1992</xref>). Mediated by these receptors, gastrin and CCK have a variety of physiological/behavioural effects in mammals. Thus, in the gastrointestinal system, gastrin stimulates growth of the stomach lining, gastric contractions, and gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crean et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dockray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gregory and Tracy, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Vizi et al., 1973</xref>), whilst CCK stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion, contraction of the pyloric sphincter, and intestinal motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gutiérrez et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Harper and Raper, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rehfeld, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Shaw and Jones, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Vizi et al., 1973</xref>). Furthermore, CCK also has behavioural effects that include inhibition of food intake as a mediator of satiety and stimulation of aggression and anxiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandra and Liddle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gibbs et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Singh et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Smith et al., 1981</xref>).</p><p>Phylogenomic studies indicate that genome duplication in a common ancestor of the vertebrates gave rise to genes encoding CCK-type and gastrin-type precursor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dupré and Tostivint, 2014</xref>). Accordingly, invertebrate chordates that are the closest extant relatives of vertebrates (e.g. the urochordate <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>) have a single gene encoding a ‘hybrid’ CCK/gastrin-like peptide (e.g. cionin) with a sulphated tyrosine residue at both positions 6 and 7 from the C-terminal amide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Johnsen and Rehfeld, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Monstein et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Thorndyke and Dockray, 1986</xref>). Furthermore, CCK-type peptides stimulate gastric enzyme secretion in the sea squirt <italic>Styela clava</italic>, providing evidence of evolutionarily ancient roles as regulators of gastrointestinal physiology in chordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bevis and Thorndyke, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Thorndyke and Bevis, 1984</xref>).</p><p>Evidence that the phylogenetic distribution of CCK/gastrin-type peptides may extend beyond chordates to other phyla was first obtained with the detection of substances immunoreactive with antibodies to CCK and/or gastrin in a variety of invertebrates, including arthropods, annelids, molluscs, and cnidarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dockray et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">El-Salhy et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Grimmelikhuijzen et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kramer et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Larson and Vigna, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rzasa et al., 1982</xref>). However, molecular evidence of the evolutionary antiquity of CCK/gastrin-type signalling was obtained with the purification and sequencing of a CCK-like peptide named leucosulfakinin, which was isolated from the insect (cockroach) <italic>Leucophaea maderae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nachman et al., 1986a</xref>). Subsequently, GPCRs that are homologs of the vertebrate CCKA/CCKB-type receptors have been identified and pharmacologically characterised as receptors for sulfakinin (SK)-type peptides in a variety of insects, including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloom et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kubiak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Yu et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Yu and Smagghe, 2014b</xref>).

An evolutionarily conserved feature of SK/CCK-type neuropeptides is a tyrosine (Y) residue that is post-translationally modified by the addition of a sulphate group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dufresne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schwartz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Yu and Smagghe, 2014a</xref>) and accordingly both ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 have a sulphated tyrosine. However, non-sulphated forms of these two peptides, ArSK/CCK1(ns) and ArSK/CCK2(ns), were also detected in <italic>A. rubens</italic> nerve cord extracts. Analysis of <italic>A. rubens</italic> neural transcriptome sequence data identified a GPCR (ArSK/CCKR) that is an ortholog of SK/CCK-type receptors that have been characterised in other taxa. Furthermore, heterologous expression of ArSK/CCKR in CHO-K1 cells revealed that the sulphated forms of ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 are potent agonists for ArSK/CCKR, whereas ArSK/CCK2(ns) exhibited little or no agonist activity on this receptor. Therefore, we conclude that the sulphated neuropeptides ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 and the GPCR ArSK/CCKR comprise the SK/CCK-type neuropeptide signalling system in the starfish <italic>A. rubens</italic>. The requirement for the tyrosine residues in ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 to be sulphated in order that these peptides can act as potent ligands for ArSK/CCK-R is consistent with the properties of many SK/CCK-type peptides in other taxa, including peptides that act as ligands for CCKR1 in mammals and SK-type peptides that act as ligands for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> receptor DSK-R1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dufresne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kubiak et al., 2002</xref>). However, this is not a universal feature of SK/CCK-type signalling; for example, non-sulphated SK/CCK-type peptides act as potent ligands for CCK2R in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dufresne et al., 2006</xref>) and for CKR2a and CKR2b in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Janssen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of the sequences of ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 with the sequences of SK/CCK-type peptides that have been identified in other taxa reveal several evolutionarily conserved features, including C-terminal amidation and the aforementioned tyrosine (Y) residue. The position of the tyrosine (Y) residue with respect to the C-terminal amide is variable amongst SK/CCK-type peptides, with between five and seven intervening residues. Accordingly, in ArSK/CCK1, ArSK/CCK2, and SK/CCK-type peptides from other echinoderms and hemichordates (collectively Ambulacraria), there are six intervening residues. In ArSK/CCK1 the tyrosine (Y) residue is preceded by an aspartate (D) residue and the tyrosine (Y) residue is followed by a glycine (G) residue; accordingly, a DYG motif is also a feature of many SK/CCK-type peptides in lophotrochozoans and arthropods, suggesting that this may be an ancestral characteristic that has been lost in some bilaterian taxa (e.g. chordates, nematodes). ArSK/CCK1, but not ArSK/CCK2, has an N-terminal pyroglutamate in its mature form and this post-translational modification is also predicted or known to occur in some SK/CCK-type peptides in other taxa – for example, the SK1 and SK2 peptides from the cockroach <italic>L. maderae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Predel et al., 1999</xref>) and the SK/CCK-type peptides in the molluscs <italic>Pinctata fucata</italic> and <italic>C. gigas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schwartz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>). The C-terminal residue of ArSK/CCK2 is a phenylalanine residue (F) and in this respect ArSK/CCK2 is like most SK/CCK-type peptides that have been identified in other taxa. It is noteworthy, therefore, that the C-terminal residue of ArSK/CCK1 is a tryptophan (W) residue, which is also a feature of an SK/CCK1-like peptide in another starfish species – the crown-of-thorns starfish <italic>Acanthaster planci</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, this unusual feature of one of the two SK/CCK-type peptides that occur in starfish species appears to be unique to this class of echinoderms (the Asteroidea) because SK/CCK-type peptides that have been identified in other echinoderms all have the more typical C-terminal phenylalanine (F) residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Zandawala et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, however, it is not completely unique to starfish because in the bivalve mollusc <italic>C. gigas</italic> there are two SK/CCK-type peptides, one of which has a C-terminal phenylalanine (F) and another that has a tryptophan (W) residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schwartz et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it appears that SK/CCK-type neuropeptides with a C-terminal tryptophan (W) residue evolved independently in starfish and in the bivalve mollusc <italic>C. gigas</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional characterization of SK/CCK-type neuropeptides in an echinoderm – the starfish <italic>A. rubens</italic></title><p>Having identified the molecular components of an SK/CCK-type neuropeptide signalling system in <italic>A. rubens</italic>, comprising the sulphated neuropeptides ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 and their receptor ArSK/CCKR, our next objective was to gain insights into the physiological roles of SK/CCK-type neuropeptides in starfish. Using mRNA in situ hybridisation, we examined the anatomical expression patterns of ArSK/CCKP transcripts and using immunohistochemistry we analysed and compared the anatomical expression patterns of ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCKR. This revealed a widespread pattern of expression, including the CNS, tube feet, and other body wall associated structures and the digestive system, as discussed below. This pattern of expression can be interpreted with reference to the anatomy of the starfish nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cobb, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mashanov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Smith, 1937</xref>), digestive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 1954</xref>), and body wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blowes et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The starfish CNS consists of radial nerve cords and a circumoral nerve ring, where cells expressing ArSK/CCKP and ArSK/CCK1 were revealed in both the ectoneural and hyponeural regions. The presence of an extensive network of immunostained fibres in the neuropile of the ectoneural region is consistent with neuronal expression of ArSK/CCKP and ArSK/CCK1. Furthermore, regional variation in the density of ArSK/CCK1-ir fibres in the ectoneural neuropile was observed. The ectoneural region is thought to largely contain sensory neurons and interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mashanov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cobb, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Smith, 1937</xref>), but the functional identity of neuronal cell types and the neural circuitry are not known. Therefore, it is not possible at present to determine the functional properties of neurons expressing the ArSK/CCKP gene in the ectoneural region of the CNS. However, comparative immunohistochemical analysis of ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCKR expression revealed a ‘salt and pepper’ pattern of labelling of fibres in the ectoneural neuropile, indicative of intercellular SK/CCK-type peptidergic signalling in this region of the CNS.</p><p>The hyponeural region of the starfish CNS only comprises motoneurons and the projection pathways of the axons of these motoneurons have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Smith, 1950</xref>). Thus, the axons of hyponeural motor neurons project around the tube feet and coalesce as a fibre bundle known as the lateral motor nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Smith, 1937</xref>). Consistent, with the expression of ArSK/CCKP in hyponeural cells, ArSK/CCK1-ir fibres can be seen in the lateral motor nerves. Branches of the lateral motor nerves project into the coelomic lining of the body wall in starfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Smith, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Smith, 1950</xref>) and accordingly ArSK/CCK1-ir fibres were observed in coelomic lining of the body wall in <italic>A. rubens</italic>. Furthermore, the presence of ArSK/CCK1-ir fibres in inter-ossicular tissue of the body wall in <italic>A. rubens</italic> suggests that ArSK/CCKP-expressing hyponeural cells may include motoneurons that innervate inter-ossicular muscles and/or inter-ossicular mutable collagenous tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blowes et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, double immunofluorescence labelling indicates that there are distinct clusters of hyponeural motoneurons that express ArSK/CCK1 or ArSK/CCKR, although ArSK/CCKR appears to be co-expressed with ArSK/CCK1 in some hyponeural motoneurons. The functional significance of these findings is at present unknown, but they can be interpreted in the context of the complex patterns of neuropeptide and neuropeptide receptor expression/co-expression that have been reported in the CNS of other taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Smith et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>ArSK/CCKP and ArSK/CCK1 are widely expressed in the digestive system of <italic>A. rubens</italic>, including the oesophagus, peristomial membrane, cardiac stomach, pyloric stomach, pyloric duct, pyloric caeca, intestine, and rectal caeca. Furthermore, in vitro pharmacological experiments revealed that ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 cause concentration-dependent contraction of cardiac stomach preparations. ArSK/CCKP and ArSK/CCK1 expressing cells are present in the mucosal wall of the cardiac stomach and a dense network of ArSK/CCK1-ir fibres is present in the basiepithelial nerve plexus of the cardiac stomach, particularly in the highly folded lateral pouches of the cardiac stomach. Accordingly, analysis of ArSK/CCKR expression revealed immunostaining in the basiepithelial nerve plexus and visceral muscle layer of the pyloric and cardiac stomach and in the nodule that links the cardiac stomach to extrinsic retractor strands. Therefore, SK/CCK-type neuropeptides released by the axonal processes of mucosal neurons located in the basiepithelial nerve plexus may cause stomach contraction by acting directly on visceral muscle and/or indirectly by triggering the release of other myoactive substances from the basiepithelial nerve plexus.</p><p>Starfish exhibit one of the most remarkable feeding behaviours in the animal kingdom – they evert their stomach out of their mouth and digest large prey externally, and once the prey has been digested, the stomach is withdrawn. Extra-oral feeding in starfish requires relaxation of muscle in the wall of the cardiac stomach and in intrinsic and extrinsic retractor strands to enable stomach eversion. Then when external digestion and ingestion of prey tissue is completed, contraction of the musculature enables cardiac stomach retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 1954</xref>). Previous studies have identified neuropeptides that cause relaxation of the cardiac stomach in vitro and trigger cardiac stomach eversion when injected in vivo; for example, the SALMFamide neuropeptide S2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Melarange et al., 1999</xref>) and the vasopressin/oxytocin-type neuropeptide asterotocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Odekunle et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, NGFFYamide has been identified as a neuropeptide in <italic>A. rubens</italic> that triggers contraction of the cardiac stomach in vitro and retraction of the everted stomach when injected in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Semmens et al., 2013</xref>). The in vitro effects of ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 in causing contraction of the cardiac stomach and the presence of ArSK/CCK1-ir and ArSK/CCKR-ir in the cardiac stomach, nodule, and retractor strands suggested that SK/CCK-type peptides may participate in mechanisms of cardiac stomach retraction physiologically. Accordingly, injection of 10 nmol of ArSK/CCK1 or ArSK/CCK2 triggered partial or complete retraction of the cardiac stomach within a test period of 6 min. These experiments indicate that SK/CCK-type peptides may be involved in physiological mechanisms of cardiac stomach retraction in starfish. Furthermore, to investigate the importance of tyrosine (Y) sulphation for the bioactivity of SK/CCK-type peptides in <italic>A. rubens</italic>, we also tested the non-sulphated peptide ArSK/CCK2(ns) on cardiac stomach preparations. By comparison with ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2, ArSK/CCK2(ns) had a modest contracting effect on cardiac stomach preparations in vitro and did not trigger cardiac stomach retraction in vivo. This is consistent with the low potency of ArSK/CCK2(ns) as an agonist on ArSK/CCKR expressed in CHO cells and indicates that non-sulphated SK/CCK-type peptides are not bioactive physiologically in starfish.</p><p>The in vivo effect of SK/CCK-type neuropeptides in triggering cardiac stomach retraction is indicative of a role in physiological mechanisms that control termination of feeding behaviour in starfish. By way of comparison, the neuropeptide NGFFYamide that triggers retraction of the everted stomach of <italic>A. rubens</italic> also causes a significant delay in the onset of feeding on prey (mussels) when injected in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tinoco et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, here we observed that starfish injected with SK/CCK-type neuropeptides took longer to enclose prey compared to control animals injected with water. Furthermore, in animals injected with SK/CCK-type neuropeptides the proportion of starfish that successfully consumed prey was fewer than in control animals that were injected with water. Thus, collectively these findings indicate that SK/CCK-type signalling acts as a physiological regulator that inhibits and/or terminates feeding behaviour in starfish. Further investigation of how SK/CCK-type signalling regulates feeding-related processes in starfish may be facilitated by use of gene-knockdown methods (e.g. RNA interference; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alicea-Delgado et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, informed by detection of ArSK/CCKP, ArSK/CCK1, and ArSK/CCKR expression in the tube feet and apical muscle of <italic>A. rubens</italic>, we also tested ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 on in vitro preparations of these organs/tissues and found that both peptides cause concentration-dependent contraction. Thus, SK/CCK-type neuropeptides appear to have a general role as myoexcitatory agents in starfish.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Comparative and evolutionary physiology of SK/CCK-type neuropeptide signalling in the Bilateria</title><p>The myoexcitatory effects of SK/CCK-type neuropeptides in <italic>A. rubens</italic> are consistent with findings from previous studies on vertebrates and protostome invertebrates. For example, CCK causes pyloric and gall bladder contraction in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gutiérrez et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rehfeld, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Shaw and Jones, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Vizi et al., 1973</xref>) and gut contraction in other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tinoco et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, SK-type peptides also have myoexcitatory effects in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Alkawi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maestro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Marciniak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nachman et al., 1986b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nichols, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Predel et al., 2001</xref>). However, SK/CCK-type peptides are not exclusively myoexcitatory because, for example, CCK causes relaxation of the proximal stomach in mammals; however, this myoinhibitory effect of CCK is indirect and mediated by vagal and splanchnic afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Takahashi and Owyang, 1999</xref>). Accordingly, both inhibitory and excitatory effects of CCK-8 on the stomach of a non-mammalian vertebrate, the rainbow trout <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>, have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Olsson et al., 1999</xref>) and an SK/CCK-type peptide causes a decrease in the frequency of hindgut contraction in the mollusc <italic>C. gigas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schwartz et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, and directly relevant to this study, it has been reported that mammalian CCK-8 causes in vitro relaxation of intestine preparations from the sea cucumber of <italic>Holothuria glaberrima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">García-Arrarás et al., 1991</xref>). With the determination of the amino acid sequences of native SK/CCK-type neuropeptides in sea cucumbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Zandawala et al., 2017</xref>), it will now be possible to specifically investigate their pharmacological effects in these animals to make direct comparisons with the findings reported here for starfish.</p><p>As discussed below, SK/CCK-type neuropeptides are perhaps best known for their roles as inhibitory regulators of feeding. However, in common with other neuropeptides, they are pleiotropic in their physiological roles. Thus, linked to regulation feeding, SK/CCK-type neuropeptides stimulate secretion of gastric acid and/or digestive enzymes in mammals, insects, nematodes, ascidians, and molluscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bevis and Thorndyke, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Harper and Raper, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Harshini et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Janssen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nachman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Shaw and Jones, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Thorndyke and Bevis, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Zels et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, expression of SK/CCK-type peptides by cells in several regions of the digestive system in <italic>A. rubens</italic> may be indicative of a similar role in starfish. Furthermore, CCK precursor transcripts are detected in rat spinal motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cortés et al., 1990</xref>) and SK-type neuropeptides act as positive growth regulators for neuromuscular junction formation and promote locomotion in larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen and Ganetzky, 2012</xref>). In this context, it is noteworthy that SK/CCK-type neuropeptides cause contraction of body wall-associated muscles (apical muscle) and organs (tube feet) in starfish. Accordingly, the expression of SK/CCK-type peptides in hyponeural motoneurons, the lateral motor nerve, and inter-ossicular tissue of the body wall of <italic>A. rubens</italic> may reflect evolutionarily ancient and conserved roles of SK/CCK-type neuropeptides as regulators of skeletal muscle function. It is also noteworthy that CCK is one of the most abundantly expressed neuropeptides in the cortex of the mammalian brain, where it is expressed by sub-populations of GABAergic interneurons and acts as a multi-functional molecular switch to regulate the output of cortical neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lee and Soltesz, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, evidence that expression of CCK in GABAergic neurons is an evolutionarily ancient association was provided by a recent study reporting co-localisation of CCK-8 and GABA in several different neuronal populations in the brain of the sea lamprey <italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sobrido-Cameán et al., 2020</xref>). GABA-immunoreactive neurons have been revealed in the ectoneural region of the radial nerve cord in <italic>A. rubens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Newman and Thorndyke, 1994</xref>) and sub-populations of these neurons may correspond with cells expressing SK/CCK-type neuropeptides reported in this study.</p><p>The key functional insights from this study are our observations that in the starfish <italic>A. rubens</italic> SK/CCK-type neuropeptides trigger cardiac stomach contraction and retraction and induce a delay in the onset of feeding and a reduction in predation. These findings are of general interest because of the previously reported evidence that SK/CCK-type neuropeptides mediate physiological mechanisms of satiety and/or regulate feeding behaviour in vertebrates, insects, and the mollusc <italic>C. gigas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Alkawi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Downer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Himick and Peter, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maestro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Meyering-Vos and Müller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nachman et al., 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nachman et al., 1986b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nässel and Zandawala, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rehfeld, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Roman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schwartz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wei, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yu et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Yu and Smagghe, 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Zels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, insights into the mechanisms by which SK/CCK-type neuropeptides regulate feeding behaviour in mammals and insects have been obtained. In mammals CCK released by intestinal endocrine cells acts on vagal afferents, which is thought to then lead to activation of calcitonin gene-related peptide-expressing neurons in the parabrachial nucleus that supress feeding and inhibition of Agouti-related peptide-expressing hypothalamic neurons that promote feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Essner et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, SK-type neuropeptides are expressed by a sub-population median neurosecretory cells in the brain that also produce insulin-like peptides and results from a variety of experimental studies indicate that release of SK-type neuropeptides by these neurons induces satiety in both larval and adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nässel and Williams, 2014</xref>). Thus, an evolutionarily conserved physiological role of SK/CCK-type neuropeptides as inhibitory regulators of feeding are mediated by different mechanisms in mammals and insects, which may reflect evolutionary divergence in the anatomy of these taxa. It is interesting, therefore, that in the unique context of the evolutionary and developmental replacement of bilateral symmetry with pentaradial symmetry in adult echinoderms, an ancient role of SK/CCK-type neuropeptides as inhibitory regulators of feeding-related processes has been retained in starfish. Furthermore, because feeding in starfish is accomplished by stomach eversion, there is a direct link between the action of SK/CCK-type neuropeptides on the gastro-intestinal system and inhibition/termination of feeding behaviour. Thus, our findings from starfish reported here for SK/CCK-type neuropeptides and previously for other neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Odekunle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Tian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tinoco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) reveal how ancient roles of neuropeptide signalling systems have been preserved in spite of unique and radical evolutionary and developmental changes in the anatomy of echinoderms amongst bilaterian animals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TCGCTACTGTTTCTCTCGCA</named-content>-3’5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">AAAGGCGTCAACAACTGCTT</named-content>-3’</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Custom synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Oligonucleotide primers for cloning of ArSK/CCKP cDNA (<italic>Asterias rubens</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Zero Blunt Topo</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. no. 450,159</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pBluescript SKII (+)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Agilent Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. no. 212,205</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pcDNA 3.1+ vector with neomycin selectable marker (mammalian expression vector)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. no.

The same animals were then injected with 10 μl of 1 mM peptide (10 nmol) and video-recorded for 6 min. Static images from video recordings were captured at 30 s intervals from the time of injection. Then the two-dimensional area of everted cardiac stomach was measured from the images using the ImageJ software (version 1.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>) and normalized as a percentage of the area of cardiac stomach everted at the time of injection (T0).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>In vivo pharmacology: testing effects of ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 on feeding behaviour</title><p>Previous studies have revealed that the starfish neuropeptide NGFFYamide inhibits the onset of feeding behaviour of <italic>A. rubens</italic> on a prey species – the mussel <italic>Mytilus edulis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tinoco et al., 2018</xref>). Here, the same methods employed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tinoco et al., 2018</xref> were used to investigate if ArSK/CCK1 and/or ArSK/CCK2 affect feeding behaviour in starfish. Sixty-two adult starfish (n = 24 for ArSK/CCK1; n = 38 for ArSK/CCK2) that met the following criteria were used: (i) all five arms were intact, (ii) exhibited a normal righting response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lawrence and Cowell, 1996</xref>), and (iii) after 24 days of starvation, exhibited normal feeding behaviour on a mussel. Then, starfish were fasted for 24 days and transferred to and kept individually in Plexiglas aquaria, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tinoco et al., 2018</xref>). After 3 days of acclimation (27 days of starvation at this point) and at 10 a.m., these animals were then divided into a control group (to be injected with distilled water), with 13 animals used for the ArSK/CCK1 experiment (mean diameter of 12.4 ± 0.3 cm) and 19 animals used for the ArSK/CCK2 experiment (mean diameter of 12.9 ± 0.4 cm), and a test group (to be injected with ArSK/CCK1 or ArSK/CCK2), with 11 animals used for the ArSK/CCK1 experiment (mean diameter of 12.6 ± 0.3 cm) and 19 animals used for the ArSK/CCK2 experiment (mean diameter of 12.9 ± 0.5 cm). The starfish were then injected with 10 µl of distilled water (control group) or 10 µl of 1 mM ArSK/CCK1 or ArSK/CCK2 peptides (test group) to achieve an estimated final concentration in the perivisceral coelom of ~1 µM, which is the concentration at which ArSK/CCK peptides were found to have a maximal effect when tested on in vitro preparations of the cardiac stomach. The time taken for starfish to make first contact with a mussel (tube feet touching the mussel or time to touch the mussel), the number of attempts to touch, as well as the time to enclose the mussel (indicated by a feeding posture) were recorded. Starfish that were feeding after 24 hr were included in data analysis and any starfish in the control or test group that had not fed on a mussel after 24 hr were discarded from data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data were presented as means ± standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). The in vitro or in vivo pharmacological effects of starfish SK/CCK-type peptides on cardiac stomach, apical muscle, and tube foot preparations were analysed by two-way ANOVA, using type of substance tested and concentration/time as independent factors and Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. Apical muscle and tube foot data were transformed to logarithms to obtain a normal distribution and homogeneity of variances. The in vitro effects of ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 (1 µM) on cardiac stomach preparations were compared with the in vitro effect of NGFFYamide (100 nM) using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. The effect of ArSK/CCK1 on feeding behaviour was analysed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test (time to touch and time to enclose) because these data did not follow a normal distribution when analysed using the D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. The effect of ArSK/CCK2 on feeding behaviour was analysed by two-tailed Student’s t-test (time to touch) or Welch’s unequal variances t-test (time to enclose). Fisher’s exact test was used to analyse the percentage of successful feeding after the first touch for control and treated starfish. Statistical analyses were carried out using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA) and differences were considered statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>None</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>none</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-65667-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The sequences of cDNAs encoding ArSK/CCKP and ArSK/CCKR have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers, KT601716 and MW261740, respectively.

new insight into the evolution and comparative physiology of SK/CCK-type neuropeptide signalling in Bilateria. It is thus of interest to neuroscientists, endocrinologists and evolutionary biologists. More specifically, the paper covers detailed localization analyses based on the prepropeptide transcript, as well as the immunohistochemistry of Aru-SK/CCK1 and Aru-SK/CCKR receptor. It furthermore includes Mass Spec verification of the peptides, receptor deorphanization and functional tests that reveal an involvement in the regulation of feeding behaviors in the starfish Asterias rubens.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ancient role of cholecystokinin-type signaling in inhibitory regulation of feeding processes revealed in an echinoderm&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Simon Webster (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Major concerns to be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript:</p><p>1. Given the rather general effects of Arub-CCKs on muscle contractions, data showing the spatial and temporal expression profiles of Arub-CCKR in target tissues would be highly beneficial to interpret the presented physiological data.</p><p>If the authors have meanwhile acquired a functioning antibody against the receptor, we would ask them to add such data. If this is not the case then whole-mount in situ hybridization and qPCR would already add very valuable insight. We do understand that there may be technical difficulties for whole-mount in situs in this case, in which case, do see if qRTPCR is feasible.</p><p>2. In Figure 3, the authors used CHO-K1 cells expressing aequorin as an assay system to determine the Arub-CCK1 and Arub-CCK-induced ca<sup>2+</sup> response. What can the authors state about the ligand specificity/selectivity of Arub-CCKR in comparison with other neuropeptides from the starfish Asterias rubens and other cholecystokinin-type neuropeptides from different species?</p><p>3. There are substantial questions if naming the system &quot;CCKs&quot; is correct.</p><p>Mammals have two structurally related peptide hormones, cholecystokinin and gastrin, which can be further processed to smaller peptides of variable lengths. For these peptides to be active they need to have their C-terminal sequence GWMDFamide intact, which is, therefore, the hallmark of these gastrin/CCK peptide hormones. Also other chordates like amphibians and the tunicate <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> produce peptides (caerulein, respectively cionin) having the C-terminal GWMDFamide sequence. In addition to this C-terminal GWMDFamide hallmark, all chordate neuropeptides have a sulfated tyrosin residue located either one or two residues before the GWMDFamide sequence. Surprisingly, the GWMDFamide hallmark is absent in the two starfish peptides (none of these residues are there at corresponding positions), although a sulfated tyrosine is present at the correct position. The same situation is found in protostome invertebrates, such as insects, mollusks, and annelids. In these protostomes, however, the peptides are correctly named sulfakinins, due to a sulfated tyrosine residue located seven residues away from the C-terminus. Because the starfish peptides lack the GWMDFamide hallmark and, thus, much more resemble the protostome sulfakinins than mammalian CCKs, there is no justification to name them CCK's in the manuscrpt. Instead, they should be called sulfakinins. Sulfakinin is also a more appropriate name, because it refers to a structure, while CCK refers to a physiological action, namely the emptying of the gall bladder, which, of course, is not relevant in a starfish. Calling the starfish peptides CCK's is also leading to confusions, because it insinuates that the peptides would act like CCK and this is what is actually happening in the title of the manuscript: &quot;Ancient role of cholecystokinin-type signalling in inhibitory regulation of feeding processes revealed in an echinoderm&quot;. Figures 6 and 7 of the manuscript show that living starfish contract their stomach after injection of the Arub -CCK's. However, also isolated muscle preparations that don't have any relation to feeding, such as tube foot preparations do contract after the addition of Arub -CCKs (Figure 6). This tells the reader of the manuscript that the Arub -CCK's are myoexcitatory, or in other words that they are&quot;kinins&quot;, just like numerous other invertebrate and vertebrate neuropeptides are kinins. However, in the Discussion (line 824) the authors of this manuscript argue that the Arub -CCK's act like a human CCK. Their reasoning: Arub -CCK's in starfish fulfill the role of mammalian CCK, because both peptides are myoexitatory. But these arguments are, of course, not acceptable. In mammals , substance P, neuromedin, oxytocin, endothelin, acetylcholine, prostaglandin and many other neurohormones and transmitters activate smooth muscles. In insects about half of all isolated neuropeptides stimulate muscle contraction. Myoexcitation is a very unspecific property of neuropeptides and cannot be used as a criterium to establish a functional or evolutionary link or an evolutionarily conserved property between peptides. The conclusion that Arub-CCKs are the functional equivalents of human CCK, therefore, is not supported by the experiments from Figures 6 and 7. These experiments only show that the Arub-CCKs are kinins, which stimulate smooth muscle cells and inhibit feeding.</p><p>Therefore the following points are requested:</p><p>– re-name these peptides sulfakinins (Arub-SKs) or at least Arub-SKs/CCKs.</p><p>– Both in the Title and in the Discussion, the authors should omit suggesting a functional identity between Arub-CCKs and human CCK, because this leads to misunderstandings.</p><p>4. Resolutions of Figure 4 and 5. Make improved Figures 4 and 5, with a higher resolution. Alternatively, for Figure 5, the authors may consider improving their staining technique, for example by considering other fixation/permeabilization methods and by applying fluorescent secondary antibodies.</p><p>As the RNA localization also serves as a control that the antibody against Arub-CCK1 is likely specific, a more direct comparative juxtaposition of the whole-mount in situ images vs. antibody staining should be considered.</p><p>5. Please justify why a lot of gaps are introduced in the alignment of Figure 1. Gaps are often introduced to suggest (often in a biased way) structural similarities. For peptide ligands of GPCRs, the length of the peptides or the distance between two residues are often of crucial importance for binding to the receptor. The authors should also consider to provide an alignment with no gaps, which gives a better impression of structural relationships.</p><p>6. The Discussion is very verbose and unnecessarily narrative. Reduce it by 33% (from 9 to 6 manuscript pages) to make it more readable. For instance, the authors write that the DYG motiv seen in the Arub-CCKs is occurring in many other CCK's from other animal taxa (line 669). However, it is not present in the canonical human CCK's, gastrins, frog caerulein, and tunicate cionin. Therefore, omit this part of the Discussion.</p><p>Below are the individual reviews for your information only. There is no need to address them individually beyond what has been stated in our consensus summary above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Tinoco and colleagues describe the characterization of the cholecystokinin-type signaling system in the starfish Asterias rubens. Using bioinformatic and LC-MS-MS analysis, two neuropeptides, ArCCK1 and ArCCK2, derived from the precursor protein ArCCKP, were identified, and further experiments showed their expression in the nervous system, digestive system, tube feet and body wall. In addition, in a heterologous expression system of CHO-K1 cells, a CCK/SK-type receptor, ArCCKR, was identified as a cognate receptor for the sulphated neuropeptides, ArCCK1 and ArCCK2. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo bioassays demonstrated the biological activities of ArCCK1 and ArCCK2 to induce dose-dependent contraction of cardiac stomach, tube foot and body wall apical muscle and inhibit feeding behaviour in A. rubens.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. There is the potential that identification of a CCK/SK-type receptor for the sulphated forms of ArCCK1 and ArCCK2 from the starfish Asterias rubens may be a step forward in understanding the novel signaling mechanisms and the physiological functions of cholecystokinin-type signaling.</p><p>2. The data derived from the in vitro and in vivo bioassays showing significant effects of neuropeptides, ArCCK1 and ArCCK2, on contraction of cardiac stomach, tube foot and body wall apical muscle and feeding behaviour in A. rubens represent the novel aspect of this manuscript, providing insights into the evolution and comparative physiology of several neuropeptide signalling systems.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The same CCK/SK-type neuropeptide signalling system has been well characterized in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2009, 1163: 428-432), the mollusc C. gigas (Sci Rep. 2018, 8:16424) and the ascidian C. intestinalis (J Endocrinol. 2012, 213, 99-106), this makes the novelty of this work uncertain.</p><p>2. Figure 3: the data showed that the sulphated ArCCK1 and ArCCK2 induced ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in CHO-K1 cells co-expressing mitochondrial targeted apoaequorin (G5A) and the promiscuous human G-protein Gα16 and ArCCKR, however, more data such as binding activity and ligand specificity are necessary to substantiate the conclusions.</p><p>3. ArCCKR has been identified as a cognate receptor for the sulphated ArCCK1 and ArCCK2, it would be good to show the G protein coupling and downstream signaling cascades.</p><p>4. To understand the physiological roles of the CCK-type signalling system in A. rubens, the data showing the spatial and temporal expression profiles of ArCCKR in target tissues are more important than that of neuropeptides, ArCCK1 and ArCCK2.</p><p>5. Figure 6, 7 and 8: the in vitro and in vivo bioassays showed effects of neuropeptides, ArCCK1 and ArCCK2 on the contraction of cardiac stomach, tube foot and apical muscle, cardiac stomach retraction and feeding behavior in A. rubens, however, there is no data to show that these effects are mediated by ArCCKR.</p><p>6. In Figure 3, the authors used CHO-K1 cells expressing aequorin as an assay system to determine the ArCCK1 and ArCCK-induced ca<sup>2+</sup> response. The authors should use this same assay system to check the ligand specificity/selectivity of ArCCKR in comparison with other neuropeptides from the starfish Asterias rubens and other cholecystokinin-type neuropeptides from different species.</p><p>7. To further confirm the direct interaction between ArCCKR and neuropeptides, ArCCK1 and ArCCK, the authors should perform fluorescent-labeled ligand-based binding assay.</p><p>8. Like the data shown in Figure 4 and 5, it will be better for authors to generate antibodies against ArCCKR, and to combine with qRT-PCR to investigate the distribution and expression of ArCCKR in different tissues and different development stages. These data of ArCCKR distribution and expression will substantiate the conclusions.</p><p>9. In Figure 6, 7 and 8, the authors used in vitro and in vivo bioassays to determine effects of neuropeptides ArCCK1 and ArCCK on contraction of cardiac stomach, tube foot and apical muscle, cardiac stomach retraction and feeding behavior, however, if the authors can use siRNA-based knockdown of ArCCKR or anti-ArCCKR antibodies as controls, it will more convincing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Tinoco and colleagues investigated the occurrence of cholecystokinin type (CCK) peptides and have functionally deorphaned their cognate receptor in an invertebrate deuterostome, the starfish, Asterias rubens. Of interest are the findings that both identified CCKs activate the identified CCK-type receptor, but only in their sulfated forms, a phenomenon that is also seen in the bioassays. The work further details the wide distribution of these peptides in the nervous system and body tissues of this organism by detailed in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, techniques which are technically demanding in these animals, and often difficult to interpret, given the unusual morphology of these organisms. The morphology of CCK expressing neurons, strongly suggests further pleiotropic functions, that await discovery. Some beautifully compelling behavioral and pharmacologically-based results, have been presented in a novel way, which convincingly show that the very unusual feeding behaviors of starfish, whereby the stomach is everted, can be inhibited by these CCK-type peptides, at physiologically relevant levels and the onset of feeding can likewise be inhibited. These important results beautifully link analogous processes involved in feeding, digestion and satiety in vertebrates, thus highlighting conservation of structure with function across the Bilateria from the viewpoint of evolution of peptides and receptors. The data have been faultlessly collected, to an exceptional standard, and the work nicely integrates a variety of techniques from the molecule to whole organism- this type of comprehensive work is rarely performed or appreciated- and adds interest to a broad readership.</p><p>The paper has been faultlessly written in a comprehensive and engaging style: I very much enjoyed reading it. Whilst there are many references, I believe that these are all justified, particularly since the paper will be of broad interest to vertebrate and invertebrate neuroscientists and evolutionary biologists.</p><p>The statistical tests have been properly applied, and there is clear justification for the tests used, when, for example, criteria for normality have not been met.</p><p>I particularly liked the highly detailed and comprehensive Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting paper that identifies two peptides (Arub-CCK-1 and -2; also called arCCK1 and -2 in the paper), and one associated G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in the starfish Asterias rubens that appear to play a major role in feeding in that animal. The GPCR is functionally expressed in mammalian (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells and gets activated by nanomolar concentrations of the two peptides, thereby proving that the GPCR is indeed the intrinsic receptor for Arub-CCK-1 and -2. Based on the phylogenetic position of starfishes in the Animal Kingdom, this paper will be a valuable contribution to understanding the evolution of the neuropeptide transmitters and their receptors that control feeding.</p><p>The major strength of this paper is that it proves that the starfish GPCR (named by the authors ArCCKR) is indeed the receptor for the two peptides, Arub-CCK-1 and -2. Their dose-response curves in Figure 3 very clearly show this. Also, the phylogenetic tree given in Figure 2, nicely shows that the starfish receptor ArCCKR is an orthologue of the human receptors for cholecystokinin (CCKR1) and gastrin (CCKR2), which are classical and well-established human neuroendocrine peptide hormones involved in feeding and digestion. These data, therefore, strongly suggest that also the starfish receptor ArCCKR might be involved in feeding. This idea has subsequently been tested by physiological in vitro and in vivo studies on whole living starfish and various isolated starfish preparations, including the animal's stomach. The results (Figures 6 and 7) show that, after addition or injection of the peptides, starfishes stop eating (=retract their everted stomachs, which is a sign of feeding cessation) and stop approaching and attacking prey.</p><p>The manuscript, however, also has major weaknesses. Mammals have two structurally related peptide hormones, cholecystokinin and gastrin, which can be further processed to smaller peptides of variable lengths. For these peptides to be active they need to have their C-terminal sequence GWMDFamide intact, which is, therefore, the hallmark of these gastrin/CCK peptide hormones. Also other chordates like amphibians and the tunicate <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> produce peptides (caerulein, respectively cionin) having the C-terminal GWMDFamide sequence. In addition to this C-terminal GWMDFamide hallmark, all chordate neuropeptides have a sulfated tyrosin residue located either one or two residues before the GWMDFamide sequence. Surprisingly, the GWMDFamide hallmark is absent in the two starfish peptides (none of these residues are there at corresponding positions), although a sulfated tyrosine is present at the correct position. The same situation is found in protostome invertebrates, such as insects, mollusks, and annelids. In these protostomes, however, the peptides are correctly named sulfakinins, due to a sulfated tyrosine residue located seven residues away from the C-terminus. Because the starfish peptides lack the GWMDFamide hallmark and, thus, much more resemble the protostome sulfakinins than mammalian CCKs, there is no justification to name them CCK's in the manuscript. Instead, they should be called sulfakinins. Sulfakinin is also a more appropriate name, because it refers to a structure, while CCK refers to a physiological action, namely the emptying of the gall bladder, which, of course, is not relevant in a starfish. Calling the starfish peptides CCK's is also leading to confusions, because it insinuates that the peptides would act like CCK and this is what is actually happening in the title of the manuscript: &quot;Ancient role of cholecystokinin-type signalling in inhibitory regulation of feeding processes revealed in an echinoderm&quot;. Figures 6 and 7 of the manuscript show that living starfish contract their stomach after injection of the arub-CCK's. However, also isolated muscle preparations that don't have any relation to feeding, such as tube foot preparations do contract after addition of arub-CCKs (Figure 6). As a reader of this manuscript, this tells me that the arub-CCK's are myoexcitatory, or in other words that they are&quot;kinins&quot;, just like numerous other invertebrate and vertebrate neuropeptides are kinins. However, in the Discussion (line 824) the authors of this manuscript argue that the arub-CCK's act like a human CCK.

These experiments only tell us, that the arub-CCKs are kinins, which stimulate smooth muscle cells and inhibit feeding.</p><p>Other weaknesses concern Figure 4 and Figure 5, which have very low (pixel) resolution and are, therefore, hard to interpret. In Figure 5, which should show the immunocytochemical staining of arub-CCK-1 and -2 in the nervous system of various parts of the starfish, it is difficult for me to recognize neurons. Here, the authors have used an inappropriate method or a low-affinity (inappropriate) antibody, as immunocytochemistry is a well-established technique, normally giving excellent staining results.</p><p>I have the following recommendations for improving the submitted manuscript:</p><p>1. Because the claim by the authors that the arub-CCK's are the functional equivalents of human CCK is not supported by their data (see Public Review), I recommend to name these peptides sulfakinins (arub-SK's).</p><p>2.

Make improved Figures 4 and 5, with a higher resolution. For Figure 5, use a better primary antibody and a better staining technique, for example by applying fluorescent secondary antibodies.</p><p>6. I don't like alignments as given in Figure 1, where a lot of gaps are introduced to suggest (often in a biased way) structural similarities. For peptide ligands of GPCRs, the length of the peptides or the distance between two residues are often of crucial importance for binding to the receptor. Therefore make an alignment with no gaps, which is free of bias and, therefore, more realistic. This gives a better impression of structural relationships.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved significantly, however there is one remaining issue that we would ask you to address, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer 3 brought up the aspect of re-naming again (for detailed argumentation see their comment). In essence the request is to change the name from CCK/SKP to SK/CCK, as this request then also gained support in the discussion among reviewers/RE. We acknowledge that the name CCK had already been used in 2016, but think that the recognition won't be hampered by switching the order.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65667.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.

To accomplish this, antibodies to a C-terminal region of ArCCK/SKR generated in guinea pig (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1) were affinity-purified and used in combination with affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to ArCCK/SK1 (see lines 901-930 for details of methods). Importantly, this has revealed the expression pattern of ArCCK/SKR and its relationship to ArCCK/SK1 expression in the CNS (circumoral nerve ring and radial nerve cords) and in organs where ArCCK/SK1 exhibits myoactivity – tube feet, apical muscle and cardiac stomach. These new data are presented in Figure 6 and text describing and interpreting the functional significance of the data has been added to the results (lines 292-329) and discussion (lines 483-583).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Evidence of the specificity/selectivity of ArCCK/SKR for the sulphated peptides ArCCK/SK1 and ArCCK/SK2 is provided by our finding that the EC<sub>50</sub> for the non-sulphated form ArCCK/SK2 [ArCCK/SK29(ns)] is 48 µM, a more than 100,000 fold reduction in potency compared to the sulphated peptides (see Figure 3). Furthermore, we also tested two <italic>A. rubens</italic> neuropeptides that share some C-terminal sequence similarity with ArCCK/SK1 and ArCCK/SK2 – the SALMFamide-type neuropeptide S2 (SGPYSFNSGLTF-NH<sub>2</sub>) and an <italic>A. rubens</italic> tachykinin-like peptide GxFamide2 (GGGVPHVFQSGGIF-NH<sub>2</sub>). Importantly, neither of these peptides caused activation of ArCCK/SKR, even at concentrations as high as 10 µM (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1), providing important evidence of the selectivity/specificity of ArCCK/SKR as a receptor for ArCCK/SK1 and ArCCK/SK2. Investigation if CCK/SK-type peptides from other taxa can act as ligands for ArCCK/SKR was not investigated in this study because of its lack of physiological relevance; however, it would be of interest for a future study that specifically investigates the structure-activity relationships of CCK/SK-type peptides as ligands for CCK/SK-type receptors from different taxa from a comparative/evolutionary perspective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Therefore, we have renamed the precursor, peptides and receptor as ArCCK/SKP, ArCCK/SK1, ArCCK/SK2 and ArCCK/SKR, which accurately reflects the sequence similarity that the starfish precursor/peptides/receptor share with vertebrate CCK/gastrin-type precursors/peptides/receptors and protostome SK-type precursors/peptides/receptors, respectively. This change in nomenclature has been implemented throughout the text and in all the figures.</p><p>Accordingly, the title of the paper has been changed from:</p><p>“Ancient role of cholecystokinin-type signalling in inhibitory regulation of feeding processes revealed in an echinoderm”</p><p>To</p><p>“Ancient role of cholecystokinin/sulfakinin-type signalling in inhibitory regulation of feeding processes revealed in an echinoderm”</p><p>This change in the title makes it clear that we are not proposing that the starfish CCK/SK-type neuropeptides are functionally more closely related to CCK in humans or vertebrates than to sulfakinins (SKs) in protostomes. Sulfakinins have been shown to exert inhibitory effects on feeding behaviour in insects. Therefore, we (and others) have concluded that inhibitory regulation of feeding processes is an evolutionarily ancient role of CCK/SK-type neuropeptides that can be traced back to the common ancestor of the Bilateria. Our study provides further evidence of this for the first time in an echinoderm and in the context of a pentaradially symmetrical animal that exhibits extra-oral feeding behaviour. We agree that myoexcitatory effects of neuropeptides in vitro alone are not sufficient to infer evolutionary conservation of a physiological/behavioural role for a neuropeptide family. However, we have obtained in vivo behavioural evidence that CCK/SK-type peptides regulate feeding behaviour in starfish. Firstly, we show that CCK/SK-type peptides trigger cardiac stomach retraction in starfish, mimicking the natural process of stomach retraction that occurs when starfish terminate feeding on prey (new Figure 8). Secondly, we show that CCK/SK-type peptides have inhibitory effects on the initiation of feeding behaviour in starfish (new Figure 9). It is based on these behavioural effects that we conclude that CCK/SK-type peptides are involved in inhibitory regulation of feeding processes in starfish.</p><p>In response to this feedback we have also changed the Impact Statement that we have provided for this paper:</p><p><italic>Old Impact statement</italic>: Evolutionarily ancient role of the “satiety hormone” cholecystokinin is discovered in starfish, marine invertebrates that evert their stomach out of their mouth to feed on prey.</p><p><italic>New Impact statement</italic>: Starfish feed by everting their stomach out of their mouth over prey and, interestingly, this unusual feeding mechanism is inhibited by substances similar to hormones that regulate feeding in humans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Resolutions of Figure 4 and 5. Make improved Figures 4 and 5, with a higher resolution. Alternatively, for Figure 5, the authors may consider improving their staining technique, for example by considering other fixation/permeabilization methods and by applying fluorescent secondary antibodies.</p><p>As the RNA localization also serves as a control that the antibody against Arub-CCK1 is likely specific, a more direct comparative juxtaposition of the whole-mount in situ images vs. antibody staining should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>The poor resolution is, unfortunately, a consequence of embedding these figures within a single pdf document, as recommended for submissions to <italic>eLife</italic>. The original tif files for these figures were prepared at a resolution of 600 pixels/inch but unfortunately it appears that these were not made available to reviewers with the original submission, for which we apologise. With the revised submission, we have uploaded all the figures for the paper in their original high-resolution formats.</p><p>Regarding presentation of the in situ hybridisation data and the immunohistochemistry, we did consider presenting these side-by-side. However, we decided not to because there would be a mismatch in the number of figure panels; this is because immunohistochemistry reveals the expression of ArCCK/SK1 in the axons of motoneurons, whereas mRNA in situ hybridisation only reveals expression in the hyponeural cell bodies of motoneurons. This mismatch does not apply to neuropeptides that are only expressed in ectoneural neurons (e.g. Asterotocin – see Odekunle et al., 2019 <italic>BMC Biology</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Please justify why a lot of gaps are introduced in the alignment of Figure 1. Gaps are often introduced to suggest (often in a biased way) structural similarities. For peptide ligands of GPCRs, the length of the peptides or the distance between two residues are often of crucial importance for binding to the receptor. The authors should also consider to provide an alignment with no gaps, which gives a better impression of structural relationships.</p></disp-quote><p>Inclusion of gaps is often necessary to optimally align orthologous neuropeptides from different taxa because lineage specific deletions/insertions of amino acids are a common feature of neuropeptide evolution. Accordingly, previously publications that have compared the sequences of CCK/SK-type peptides in different bilaterian taxa have included gaps in the alignments (see, for example, Figure 3B of Schwartz et al., 2018; <italic>Sci. Rep</italic>. 8, 16424). An alignment of CCK/SK-type peptides from different bilaterian phyla without gaps would not be informative in showing those residues that are conserved between taxa.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The Discussion is very verbose and unnecessarily narrative. Reduce it by 33% (from 9 to 6 manuscript pages) to make it more readable. For instance, the authors write that the DYG motiv seen in the Arub-CCKs is occurring in many other CCK's from other animal taxa (line 669). However, it is not present in the canonical human CCK's, gastrins, frog caerulein, and tunicate cionin. Therefore, omit this part of the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the discussion was quite long and to reduce its length we have removed sections of text where we made comparisons with the expression and actions of other neuropeptides that have been functionally characterised in <italic>A. rubens</italic>, which is not essential material for this paper with its focus on CCK/SK-type neuropeptides. With removal of this text, the length of the manuscript has been substantially reduced. However, because of the change of peptide/precursor/receptor nomenclature and inclusion of discussion of new receptor expression data, in response to reviewer feedback, it was not possible to reduce the length of the discussion by as much as 33%.</p><p>Regarding the DYG motif, it does appear to be an evolutionarily ancient characteristic of CCK/SK-type peptides that has been conserved in insects, lophotrochozoans and echinoderms, but lost in chordates and nematodes. Therefore, in response to reviewer feedback we have modified the discussion text (lines 460-463): “In ArCCK/SK1 the tyrosine (Y) residue is preceded by an aspartate (D) residue and followed by a glycine (G) residue; accordingly, a DYG motif is also a feature of many CCK/SK-type peptides in lophotrochozoans and arthropods, suggesting that this may be an ancestral characteristic that has been lost in some bilaterian taxa (e.g. chordates, nematodes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved significantly, however there is one remaining issue that we would ask you to address, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer 3 brought up the aspect of re-naming again (for detailed argumentation see their comment). In essence the request is to change the name from CCK/SKP to SK/CCK, as this request then also gained support in the discussion among reviewers/RE. We acknowledge that the name CCK had already been used in 2016, but think that the recognition won't be hampered by switching the order.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the peptide/precursor/receptor names used from CCK/SK to SK/CCK throughout the manuscript and we have changed the title of the paper to “Ancient role of sulfakinin/ cholecystokinin-type signalling in inhibitory regulation of feeding processes revealed in an echinoderm.</p></body></sub-article></article>
