is known about the dissemination of HIV-1-infected cells across multiple anatomical tissues, especially the CNS. Here, we performed single-genome, near full-length HIV-1 next-generation sequencing to evaluate the proviral landscape in distinct anatomical compartments, including multiple CNS tissues, from 3 ART-treated participants at autopsy. While lymph nodes and, to a lesser extent, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tissues represented tissue hotspots for the persistence of intact proviruses, we also observed intact proviruses in CNS tissue sections, particularly in the basal ganglia. Multi-compartment dissemination of clonal intact and defective proviral sequences occurred across multiple anatomical tissues, including the CNS, and evidence for the clonal proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells was found in the basal ganglia, in the frontal lobe, in the thalamus and in periventricular white matter. Deep analysis of HIV-1 reservoirs in distinct tissues will be informative for advancing HIV-1 cure strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Approximately 39 million people in the world live with HIV infection. Currently available treatments can reduce the amount of virus to near undetectable levels. But they do not eliminate the virus. A reservoir of HIV-infected cells persists during treatment. If treatment stops, these cells can cause rebounding virus levels and a return of symptoms. As a result, patients living with HIV must remain on treatment their entire lives.</p><p>HIV reservoir cells often do not express viral proteins, making them hard for the immune system to find and destroy. Many of these reservoir cells occur in lymph nodes, which makes them difficult for researchers to access for study. Learning more about where these cells hide in the body may enable scientists to develop new treatments to help eliminate them.</p><p>Sun et al. show that HIV reservoir cells exist in many body tissues, including the brain. In the experiments, Sun et al. used single HIV genome sequencing to identify HIV genetic sequences in the brain and other body tissues from three recently deceased individuals with HIV. The individuals agreed to donate their tissues for postmortem studies before their deaths. All received antiretroviral therapy until death. The experiments identified functional HIV genetic sequences in lymph nodes and gastrointestinal tissues, known hotspots for HIV-infected cells. Sun et al. also found genetically intact HIV in brain tissue from two of the individuals. The HIV genetic sequences were identical to sequences found in other body tissues. This discovery suggests HIV-infected cells had divided into more HIV-infected cells and spread.</p><p>The results suggest that cells harboring intact HIV invade the brain and persist there for extended periods during antiretroviral therapy. To eradicate the virus, interventions targeting HIV reservoir cells must be able to reach the brain. This new information may help researchers developing HIV-reservoir targeting drugs decide which candidates will likely be the most effective. Future studies may also shed light on how HIV reaches the brain and how the infected cells escape destruction by immune cells, which may suggest more treatment strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Combination antiretroviral therapy has extended the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) to near-normal levels, but it is clear that antiretroviral therapy (ART), in its present form, does not lead to a sustained, drug-free remission of HIV-1 infection; instead, a long-lived reservoir of virally-infected cells persists despite ART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wong et al., 1997</xref>) and can effectively fuel rebound viremia in case of treatment interruptions. Hence, ART needs to be taken life-long; finding a way to eliminate HIV-1 reservoir cells remains critical to finding a cure for HIV-1 infection.</p><p>HIV-1 reservoir cells that circulate in the peripheral blood have been well-described in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Margolis et al., 2020</xref>). These circulating reservoir cells mostly consist of memory CD4 T cells that persist life-long and harbor chromosomally-integrated viral DNA, also referred to as a ‘provirus’. The pool size of HIV-1-infected cells during suppressive antiretroviral therapy is frequently maintained or replenished by clonal proliferation of viral reservoir cells, during which an identical viral DNA copy is passed on to daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosmane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Einkauf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pinzone et al., 2019</xref>). Important advances in recent technology development, including single-genome near full-length proviral sequencing, have demonstrated that the vast majority of HIV-1 DNA species encountered in ART-treated persons are defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hiener et al., 2017</xref>), mostly due to errors occurring during reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA. Such errors can lead to large deletions, premature stop codons, or defects in the viral packaging signal region; moreover, specific host proteins such as APOBEC-3G/3 F can induce lethal hypermutations into the proviral sequence. The ability of viral reservoir cells to persist indefinitely is frequently attributed to very limited or absent proviral gene transcription; this viral latency protects infected cells from host immune responses and reduces possible cytopathic effects associated with viral gene expression. However, recent studies have emphasized that proviral gene expression can be ongoing in some HIV-1-infected cells during antiretroviral therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yukl et al., 2018</xref>), typically when proviruses are integrated in immediate proximity to activating chromatin marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Einkauf et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lian et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Much less is currently known about HIV-1 reservoir cells in other body compartments that are more difficult to access for analytic purposes. Lymph nodes and lymphoid tissues in the gastrointestinal tract harbor the vast majority of all lymphocytes and are likely to represent a prime location for the persistence of virally infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Estes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baiyegunhi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kroon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckford-Vera et al., 2022</xref>); however, studies that interrogate viral reservoir cells in these tissues remain limited. Even less is known about HIV-1 persistence in other organs, and, in particular, in the CNS, although recent studies have started to explore viral reservoir cells in such specific body compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cochrane et al., 2022</xref>). In the present study, we used single-genome proviral sequencing to conduct a detailed analysis of HIV-1 proviral sequences in autopsy samples from up to n=18 different organ systems from three study participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Frequency of intact and defective proviruses in tissue compartments</title><p>To investigate the proviral landscape across multiple anatomical tissues, including the CNS, we focused on three participants from whom post-mortem tissue samples were available for HIV-1 research. Tissue samples from the CNS and other organs were collected by a rapid (&lt;24 hr) autopsy after death. The clinical and demographic characteristics of these study participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. All study participants adhered to antiretroviral treatment until death; plasma viral loads were undetectable by commercial assays in study participants 1 and 2, in whom 14 and 15 different tissue sections were sampled, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Organ-specific tissues analyzed in these two study participants included lymph node, spleen, colon, liver, pancreas, kidney, thyroid gland, and adrenal gland; in the female study participant 1, ovarian and uterus tissues were analyzed, while in the male study participant 2, prostate and testicular tissues were studied. In both of these study participants, four different CNS tissue sections (basal ganglia, thalamus, frontal lobe, and occipital lobe) were collected for investigation. In study participant 3, plasma viral load was 136 copies/ml at the time of death; 5 different tissue sections from the CNS (basal ganglia, thalamus, occipital lobe, frontal lobe, periventricular white matter) were analyzed in this person.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Clinical and demographical data of study participants.</title></caption><table

No intact proviruses were detected in the CNS tissues of study participant 2, despite analyzing 66.29 million cells.

However, the location of HIV-1 viral reservoir cells across different tissues has been difficult to assess in the past, due to the limited availability of tissue samples. Recent studies, pioneered by investigators of the ‘Last Gift Cohort’, have catalyzed investigations to characterize HIV-1 sequences in diverse organ systems, specifically in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaillon et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, we used single-genome near full-length proviral sequencing to evaluate the distribution of HIV-1 reservoir cells in multiple anatomical compartments from autopsy samples of three individuals living with HIV-1 and receiving antiretroviral therapy until the time of their decease. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuo et al., 2020</xref>), intact proviruses were readily detected in lymph nodes; moreover, we detected relatively high frequencies of intact proviruses in the colon, likely reflecting viral infection of CD4 T cells residing in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). Of note, our study is among the first investigations to identify near full-length proviral sequences from the central nervous system in two study participants, supporting the hypothesis that CNS cells can serve as reservoirs for long-term HIV-1 persistence despite antiretroviral therapy. Importantly, we noted that large clones of virally infected cells were broadly disseminated across multiple tissues, and, in selected cases, involved cells from the CNS; this suggests that HIV-1 reservoir cells seeded to the brain via hematogenous spread can proliferate in the local tissue microenvironment of the central nervous system. Together, our work suggests that HIV-1 reservoir cells harboring intact proviruses are broadly distributed across multiple anatomical locations, involving lymphoid tissues, gastrointestinal tissues, genitourinary tissues, and, importantly, central nervous system tissues.</p><p>HIV-1 can invade the CNS within days after infection, as demonstrated in animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakrabarti et al., 1991</xref>) and in human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valcour et al., 2012</xref>). Most likely, infection of CNS cells occurs as a result of transmigration of infected CD4 T cells and, possibly, macrophages across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spudich and González-Scarano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2000</xref>), a process that may be facilitated by the increased permeability of the BBB during the initial, highly replicative stage of HIV-1 infection. Infected cells that successfully enter the CNS may frequently be short-lived, however some infected CD4 T cells in the brain may persist long-term. Moreover, invading infected cells can transmit the virus to resident CNS cells via effective cell-to-cell transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2000</xref>). At least three different CNS cell types seem to be susceptible to HIV-1 infection: perivascular macrophages, microglial cells, and astrocytes, although the role of the latter as HIV-1 target cells is more controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Churchill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wallet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Woodburn et al., 2022</xref>). Yet, due to the difficulties in accessing brain tissues for analytic purposes, the role of the central nervous system in HIV-1 persistence during antiretroviral therapy remained largely unknown for a long time. Using the intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA), a ddPCR-based technique allowing to identify proviruses with a high probability of being genome-intact, previous investigators identified intact proviruses in 6 out of 9 ART-treated persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cochrane et al., 2022</xref>), although the precise proviral DNA sequence and their possible clonality was not assessed with this technology. In our study, a total of 13 CNS tissue samples from three study participants were analyzed, including specimens from the basal ganglia, thalamus, occipital lobe, frontal lobe, and periventricular white matter. In two study persons (participants 1 and 3), intact proviral sequences were detected in basal ganglia, suggesting that HIV-1 may preferentially persist in this anatomical compartment in the CNS; an additional intact provirus was detected in periventricular white matter. Notably, the intact provirus from basal ganglia in one of our study persons (participant 1) was clonal with 4 intact proviruses from the lymph node, indicating, to our knowledge for the first time, that CNS tissue can be involved in the multi-compartment dissemination of large clones of HIV-1 proviruses in ART-treated persons. Moreover, in multiple instances, we observed clones of HIV-1-infected cells that were distributed across different autologous CNS tissues, specifically in study participant 3, suggesting local spread of virally infected cells through clonal proliferation within the immune microenvironment of the CNS.</p><p>Our study did not allow to determine which cell types were infected by HIV-1 and responsible for clonal expansion of viral reservoir cells in the CNS; however, it is possible that infected microglia are involved. Microglial cells originate from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac and colonize the developing CNS during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kierdorf et al., 2013</xref>); these cells act as the main innate immune cell population of the CNS. Due to their long half-life (typically several years), their ability to divide and self-renew, and their high cell-intrinsic susceptibility to HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cenker et al., 2017</xref>), these cells may represent a primary cellular site for long-term HIV-1 persistence in the CNS. In particular, self-renewal through homeostatic proliferation in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Réu et al., 2017</xref>) may support HIV-1 persistence through clonal expansion. A recent study indeed identified HIV-1 DNA and RNA in microglia cells from autopsies from ART-treated PLWH who did not have specific (HIV or non-HIV associated) CNS pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ko et al., 2019</xref>). Evidence for HIV-1 persistence in CD68 +myeloid cells, most likely microglia cells, was also described by previous investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cochrane et al., 2022</xref>). That said, the presence of clonal proviral sequences shared between the CNS and lymphoid tissues in our study could also suggest that migrating CD4 T cells infected with R5-tropic viruses may infect the brain as ‘Trojan horses’, and then potentially clonally expand in situ in the CNS; this hypothesis is consistent with recent findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kincer et al., 2023</xref>. In the future, it may be possible to capture the phenotypic characteristics of HIV-1 reservoir cells from the CNS directly with single-cell assays that permit combined assessments of the phenotype and the proviral sequence; an example for such an assay system was recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In our study, CXCR4-tropic proviruses were exclusively detected in participant 2. Compared to the other two participants who began ART shortly after HIV-1 diagnosis, participant 2 was diagnosed with HIV-1 25 years prior to starting antiretroviral therapy and died 10 months after ART commencement; therefore, viral CXCR4 tropism most likely resulted from ‘coreceptor switch’ frequently occurring during advanced stages of immune deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Connor et al., 1997</xref>). Whether the preferential persistence of CXCR4-tropic viruses in study participant 2 was associated with our inability to detect intact proviruses in the CNS in this person is unclear; however, prior studies suggested that CCR5 can act as the principal co-receptor for HIV-1 isolates in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albright et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, rebound viremia in cerebrospinal fluid after ART interruption is mostly fueled by CCR5-tropic virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kincer et al., 2023</xref>), further supporting the assumption that R5-tropic viruses are better adjusted to persist in the brain. Another notable finding in our study was the high number of HIV-1 proviruses isolated from the prostate, which had the second highest proviral frequency among all analyzed tissues in study participant 2, second only to lymph node samples. Other studies also reported that the prostate can represent a tissue reservoir for HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaillon et al., 2020</xref>). We were unable to identify the precise cell type harboring HIV-1 in the prostate, but it is possible that myeloid cells may harbor HIV-1 in this location. A prior study indeed demonstrated that intact, replication-competent HIV-1 can persist in myeloid cells from the urethra, located in immediate anatomical proximity to the prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganor et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Importantly, this work includes only 3 participants, and brain tissues were the only samples available from participant 3. Moreover, due to limited tissue sizes available for investigation, very few cells were assayed from the terminal ileum and testes; prior studies suggested high HIV-1 DNA levels in these 2 tissues during suppressive antiretroviral therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). Another limitation was that peripheral blood samples were not available from the 3 participants, which made it impossible to study phylogenetic associations between tissue reservoirs of HIV-1 relative to viral species circulating in peripheral blood. Moreover, we cannot fully exclude contamination of tissue samples with cells from peripheral blood. However, after autopsy, the tissue samples were washed thoroughly with PBS to eliminate blood as much as possible. Notably, we failed to detect intact proviral sequences from over 100 million liver cells of 2 participants, despite the fact that the liver contains about 13% of all human blood supply at any given time point, arguing against contamination of tissues with blood cells.</p><p>In sum, this study provides a deep analysis of tissue reservoirs for HIV-1 that includes a detailed assessment of HIV-1 sequences in CNS tissues. Our work supports the persistence of genome-intact HIV-1 in many tissues, including CNS tissues, emphasizing the difficulties in finding strategies to effectively eliminate HIV-1 from the human body in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study Participants</title><p>HIV-1-infected study participants were recruited at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA.

HIV-1 DNA was analyzed by the Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA), using primers and probes described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruner et al., 2019</xref>). PCR was performed using the following program: 95 °C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 59 °C for 1 min, 98 °C for 10 min.

PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplification products were individually subjected to Illumina MiSeq sequencing at the MGH DNA Core facility. The resulting short reads were de novo assembled using Ultracycler v1.0 and aligned to HXB2 to identify large deleterious deletions (&lt;8000 bp of the amplicon aligned to HXB2), out-of-frame indels, premature/lethal stop codons, internal inversions, or 5′-LTR defect (≥15 bp insertions and/or deletions relative to HXB2), using an automated in-house pipeline written in Python scripting language (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/BWH-Lichterfeld-Lab/Intactness-Pipeline">https://github.com/BWH-Lichterfeld-Lab/Intactness-Pipeline</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). The presence/absence of APOBEC-3G/3 F–associated hypermutations were determined using the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database Hypermut 2.0 program. The sequences of individual genes were extracted by GeneCutter, and the start codons of Gag, Pol, and Env were examined and considered. Viral sequences that lacked all defects listed above were classified as “genome-intact”. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edgar, 2004</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA X, applying maximum likelihood approaches. Viral sequences were considered clonal if they had completely identical consensus sequences; single-nucleotide variations in primer binding sites were excluded for clonality analysis. When viral DNA sequences were undetectable, data were reported as LOD (limit of detection), calculated as 0.5 copies per maximum number of cells tested without target identification. The sensitivity of proviral species to broadly-neutralizing antibodies (bnAb) was estimated by calculating the number of amino acid signature sites associated with sensitivity to four bnAb classes within the env amino acid sequence from each intact provirus, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bricault et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Data are summarized as bar graphs.

The sequencing is of high quality in using end-point dilution PCR to generate individual viral genomes. There is a thoughtful discussion, although there are points that we disagree with. This is an important data set that increases the scope of how the field thinks about the latent reservoir with a new look at the potential of a reservoir within the CNS.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the comments by reviewer 2 and would like to thank them for their detailed and very knowledgeable analysis of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The participants are very different in their exposure to HIV replication and disease progression. Participant 1 appears to have been on ART for most of the time after diagnosis of infection (16 years) and died with a high CD4 T cell count. The other two participants had only one year on ART and died with relatively low CD4 T cell counts (under 200). This could lead to differences in the nature of the reservoir. In this regard, the amount of DNA per million cells appears to be about 10-fold lower across the compartments sampled for participant 1. Also, one might expect fewer intact proviruses surviving after 16 years on ART compared to only 1 year on ART. The depth of sampling may be too limited and the number of participants too few to assess if these differences are features of these participants because of their different exposures to HIV replication. On the positive side, finding similarities across these big differences in participant profiles does reinforce the generalizability of the observations.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for pointing this out. We also noticed that the total number of HIV-1 proviruses is smaller in our study participant 1 (who had been on ART for 16 years), compared to study persons 2 and 3 with more limited treatment durations (1-2 years), however, due to the small number of study persons, we think we cannot use these results for inferring how treatment duration influences viral reservoir size in tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The following analysis will be limited by sampling depth but where possible it would be interesting to compare the ratio of intact to defective DNA. A sanctuary might allow greater persistence of cells with intact viral DNA even without viral replication (i.e. reduced immune surveillance). Detecting one or two intact proviruses in a tissue sample does not lend itself to a level of precision to address this question, but statistical tests could be applied to infer when there is sampling of 5 or more intact proviruses to determine if their frequency as a ratio of total DNA in different anatomical sites is similar or different. This would allow adjustment for the different amount of viral DNA in different compartments while addressing the question of the frequency of intact versus defective proviruses. One complication in this analysis is if there was clonal expansion of a cell with an intact genome which would represent a fortuitous overrepresentation intact genomes in that compartment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the analysis suggested by reviewer 2 and included a diagram reflecting the ratio of intact/defective proviruses as a new supplemental figure (Figure S2). Unfortunately, we do not feel comfortable to draw any real conclusions from this additional analysis; the sample sizes are simply too limited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The key point of this work is that the participants were on therapy up to the time of death (&quot;enforcing&quot; viral latency). The predominance of defective genomes is consistent with this assumption. Is there data from untreated infections to compare to as a signature of whether the viral DNA population was under selective pressure from therapy or not? Presumably untreated infections contain more intact DNA relative to total DNA. This would represent independent evidence that therapy was in place.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that an analysis of autopsy samples from untreated persons living with HIV-1 would be of great interest, and are actively collaborating with neuropathologists from multiple sites to obtain such samples. Yet, we are not convinced that selection pressure on reservoir cells during ART can be appropriately identified through quantitative virological assays. Rather, we feel that the selection of proviruses can be best assessed when qualitative parameters, including proviral integration sites and their position relative to host epigenetic chromatin features, are evaluated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. There are several points in Figure 5 to raise about V3 loop sequences. The analysis includes a large number of &quot;undetermined&quot; sequences that did not have a V3 loop sequence to evaluate. We would argue it is a fair assumption that the deleted proviruses have the same distribution of X4 and R5 sequences as the ones that have a V3 sequence to evaluate. In this view it would be possible to exclude the sequences for which there is no data and just look at the ratio of X4 and R5 in the different compartments, specifically does this ratio change in a statistically significant way in different compartments? The authors use &quot;CCR5 and non-CCR5&quot; as the two entry phenotypes. The evidence is pretty strong that the &quot;other&quot; coreceptor the virus routinely uses is CXCR4, and G2P is providing the FPR for X4 viruses. Perhaps the authors are trying to create some space for other coreceptors on microglia, but we are pretty sure what they are measuring is X4 viruses, especially in this late disease state of participant 2. Finally, we have previously observed that the G2P FPR score of &lt;2 is a strong indicator of being X4, FPR scores between 2 and 10 have a 50% chance of being X4, and FPR scores above 10 are reliably R5 (PMID27226378). In addition, we observed that X4 viruses form distinct phylogenetic lineages. The authors might consider these features of X4 viruses in the evaluation of their sequences. Specifically, it would be helpful to incorporate the FPR scores of the reported X4 viruses.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for these thoughts. We have now included FPR scores for all sequences and considered sequences with FPR score &lt;2 as X4-tropic. Among 497 proviral sequences derived from all three participants, only 14 proviral sequences had FPR scores between 2 and 10 and their tropism was classified as CCR5 in the new Figure 5. We agree that viral tropism analysis of proviral sequences from the CNS would be of particular interest for study subject 2; however, most brain-derived sequences from that person had large deletions in the env region, precluding an analysis of viral tropism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. We have puzzled over the many reports of different cell types in the CNS being infected. When we examined these cell types (both as primary cells and as iPSC-derived cells), all cells could be infected with a version of HIV that had the promiscuous VSV-G protein on the virus surface as a pseudotype. However, only macrophages and microglia could be infected using the HIV Env protein, and then only if it was the M-tropic version and not the T-tropic version (PMID35975998). RNAseq analysis was consistent with this biological readout in that only macrophages and microglia expressed CD4, neurons and astrocytes do not. From the virology point of view, astrocytes are no more infectable than neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments. As described in our discussion, we agree that the role of astrocytes as target cells for HIV-1 infection is highly controversial; we look forward to future opportunities to evaluate HIV sequences in sorted astrocytes from autopsy tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The brain gets exposed to virus from the earliest stages of infection but this is not synonymous with viral replication. Most of the time there is virus in the CSF but it is present at 1-10% of the level of viral load in the blood and phylogenetically it looks like the virus in the blood, most consistent with trafficking T cells, some of which are infected (PMID25811757). The fact that the virus in the blood is almost always T cell-tropic in needing a high density of CD4 for entry makes it unlikely that monocytes are infected (with their low density of CD4) and thus are not the source of virus found in the CNS. It seems much more likely that infected T cells are the &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; carrying virus into the CNS.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s referral to Greek mythology and agree that the hypothesis of infected T cells acting as “Trojan horses” is more intuitive and better supported by available data. We have adjusted our discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. While all participants were taking antiretroviral therapy at the time of their death, they were not all suppressed when the tissues were collected. The authors are careful not to mention &quot;suppressive ART&quot; in the text, which is appreciated. However, the title should be changed to also reflect this fact.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. From our perspective, ART is never fully suppressive, as low-level viremia (below the detection threshold of commercial PCR assays) is detectable in almost all ART-treated persons. As such, it is not clear to us that “suppressive” necessarily implies suppression below the detection limits of commercial PCRs. We argue that ART can also be suppressive when plasma viral loads are in the range of 100 copies/ml, as they are in our study subject 3. Nevertheless, we have changed the title to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I encourage the authors to compare their autopsy and tissue sampling procedures to those used by The Last Gift researchers and consider including references to this ongoing study. If the authors plan to continue in this line of research, the field would greatly benefit from a collaboration that would bring together their excellent and advanced PCR technique with the larger sample size offered by The Last Gift. Lastly, is there some way to simultaneously determine cell type when NFL sequencing is performed?</p></disp-quote><p>We look forward to collaborating with investigators from the Last Gift Cohort in the future and have integrated additional references in the manuscript to acknowledge their work. At the current stage of technology development, we think that sorting of infected cells based on canonical markers of defined cell populations is the preferred approach for identifying phenotypic properties of infected cells; however, expansion of the PheP-Seq assay (Sun et al., Nature 2023), may facilitate this process in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. The authors have chosen to lump all R5 viruses together in terms of their entry phenotype, giving all viruses an equal chance of infecting all potentially susceptible cell types. This ignores the fact that normal HIV is selected to infect cells, requiring a high density of CD4 as is found on T cells. We use the term R5 T cell-tropic to describe &quot;normal&quot; HIV. The ability to efficiently enter cells that have a low density of CD4, such as macrophages and microglia, involves the evolution of a distinct phenotype, termed macrophage tropism (PMID24307580, and work of others). This happens most often in the CNS where T cells are infrequent thus potentiating evolution to infect an alternative cell type. This change in entry phenotype is dramatic and, like X4 viruses, results in phylogentically distinct lineages (PMID22007152). There are no sequence signatures for M-tropic viruses as there are for X4 viruses, but the fact that there are sequences shared between the CNS and lymphoid tissue makes it much more likely that there are T cells migrating around the body, including into the CNS, that are carrying R5 T cell-tropic virus with them, with the cells potentially clonally expanding in situ in the CNS. The persistence of a potential CNS T cell reservoir was the point we were trying to make in our recent paper (ref. 38), not only that these CSF rebound viruses were R5 viruses but they were selected for replication in T cells as seen by their dependence of a high density of CD4 for entry. This is the conclusion one would reach if clonally expanded viral sequences were shared between two lymphoid compartments. It is not necessary to ascribe properties of infection and clonal amplification to microglia cells when a more parsimonious explanation is that there are low levels of T cells in the CNS, especially in the absence of entry phenotype data showing these sequences encode an M-tropic entry phenotype. As is the authors are just adding to the unproven belief that virus in the CNS must be in myeloid cells, which in this case in particular we suspect is the wrong interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We are impressed by reviewer 2’s recent work, suggesting the viral reservoir in the CNS may primarily consist of clonally-expanded R5 T-cell tropic viruses. We have adjusted our discussion to emphasize this possibility, and to highlight that viral entry phenotyping data will be informative for better understanding viral persistence in the brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors noted that the frequency of intact proviruses is highest in the lymph nodes of 2/2 participants for which they had lymph node samples, relative to the other tissues examined. They thus conclude, &quot;Together, these results indicate that intact HIV-1 proviruses are preferentially detected in lymphoid and gastrointestinal (GI) tissues.&quot; However, an examination of Figure 2 reveals that the total HIV copy number is highest in the lymph nodes of these two people. Thus, it doesn't seem like HIV is preferentially intact in the lymph nodes as much as they sampled more provirus from that tissue and therefore were able to detect more intact proviruses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted our manuscript to indicate that the highest numbers of intact HIV-1 proviruses were present in lymph nodes, both in terms of absolute numbers and after normalization to the total numbers of cells analyzed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 1A, the legend should be changed so that &quot;PMSC&quot; is spelled out as &quot;premature stop codon&quot; for ease of reading. This is done for Figure 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this issue as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The pie charts in Figure 5 could be better labeled for ease of interpreting. In Figure 5C, instead of just labeling it as &quot;P2&quot; it could be &quot;Distribution of CXCR4-using proviruses, P2&quot;, as an example. As it stands, it is hard to know what the figure is describing without reading the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed this accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. While all participants were taking antiretroviral therapy at the time of their death, they were not all suppressed when the tissues were collected. The authors are careful not to mention &quot;suppressive ART&quot; in the text, which is appreciated. However, the title should be changed to also reflect this fact.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. From our perspective, ART is never fully suppressive, as low-level viremia (below the detection threshold of commercial PCR assays) is detectable in almost all ART-treated persons. As such, it is not clear to us that “suppressive” necessarily implies suppression below the detection limits of commercial PCRs. We argue that ART can also be suppressive when plasma viral loads are in the range of 100 copies/ml. Nevertheless, we have changed the title to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Editorial comments:</bold></p><p>In addition to the reviewers suggestion, we feel that adding more information on how you define intact proviral sequence, e.g. are only disrupted essential genes or also in accessory genes considered? Previous studies have shown that brain-derived HIV-1 strains are usually CCR5-tropic, show high affinity for the CD4 receptor and frequently contain defective vpu genes. Some information and discussion if the brainderived sequences confirm these previous finding seems of significant interest.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in our previous work (e. g. Lee et al, JCI 2017; Jiang et al, Nature 2020), accessory genes are not considered in our definition of “genome intactness”; this is consistent with approaches other investigators have chosen (e. g. Hiener et al, Cell Reports 2017). Within the genome intact sequences we identified in the CNS in our study persons, we found no evidence for deletions of vpu sequences; this has been emphasized in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
