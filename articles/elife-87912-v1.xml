During these cell separation processes, the plant induces defense-associated genes to protect against pathogen invasion. However, the molecular coordination between abscission and immunity has not been thoroughly explored. Here, we show that IDA induces a release of cytosolic calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and apoplastic production of reactive oxygen species, which are signatures of early defense responses. In addition, we find that IDA promotes late defense responses by the transcriptional upregulation of genes known to be involved in immunity. When comparing the IDA induced early immune responses to known immune responses, such as those elicited by flagellin22 treatment, we observe both similarities and differences. We propose a molecular mechanism by which IDA promotes signatures of an immune response in cells destined for separation to guard them from pathogen attack.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>peptide hormones</kwd><kwd>receptor kinase</kwd><kwd>plant development</kwd><kwd>plant immunity</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Research Council of Norway</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>230849</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lalun</surname><given-names>Vilde Olsson</given-names></name><name><surname>Butenko</surname><given-names>Melinka A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Breiden</surname><given-names>Maike</given-names></name><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Rüdiger GW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A molecular investigation on the role of the peptide ligand inflorescence deficient in abscission (IDA) in regulating immunity and development during cell separation in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All multicellular organisms require tightly regulated cell-to-cell communication during development and adaptive responses. In addition to hormones, plants use small-secreted peptide ligands to regulate these highly coordinated events of growth, development and responses to abiotic and biotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsubayashi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Olsson et al., 2019</xref>). In plants, organ separation or abscission, involves cell separation between specialized abscission zone (AZ) cells and enables the removal of unwanted or diseased organs in response to endogenous developmental signals or environmental stimuli. <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) abscise floral organs (stamen, petals, and sepals) after pollination, and this system has been used as a model to study the regulation of cell separation and abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bleecker and Patterson, 1997</xref>). Precise cell separation also occurs during the emergence of new lateral root (LR) primordia, root cap sloughing, formation of stomata and radicle emergence during germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roberts et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the inflorescence deficient in abscission (IDA) peptide-mediated signaling system ensures the correct spatial and temporal abscission of sepals, petals, and stamens. The IDA protein shares a conserved C-terminal domain with the other 7 IDA-like (IDL) members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vie et al., 2015</xref>) which is processed to a functional 12 amino acid hydroxylated peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butenko et al., 2014</xref>). The abscission process is regulated by the production and release of IDA, which binds the genetically redundant plasma membrane (PM) localized receptor kinases (RKs), HAESA (HAE), and HAESA-like 2 (HSL2). IDA binding to HAE and HSL2 promotes receptor association with members of the co-receptor somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase (SERK) family and further downstream signaling leading to cell separation events. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Santiago et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stenvik et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that IDA and IDL family members also bind and activate HSL1 in the regulation of leaf epidermal pattering, indicating subfunctionalisation within this clade of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roman et al., 2022</xref>) and opens for the possibility that HAE or HSL2 could have additional functions than regulating cell separation events.</p><p>A deficiency in the IDA signaling pathway prevents the expression of genes encoding secreted cell wall remodeling and hydrolase enzymes thus hindering floral organs to abscise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumpf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Niederhuth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stenvik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor and Walker, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, components of the IDA signaling pathway control different cell separation events during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> development. IDA signaling through HAE and HSL2 regulates cell wall remodeling genes in the endodermal, cortical, and epidermal tissues overlaying the LR primordia during LR emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumpf et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, IDL1 signals through HSL2 to regulate cell separation during root cap sloughing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Plant cell walls act as physical barriers against pathogenic invaders. The cell-wall processing and remodeling that occurs during abscission leads to exposure of previously protected tissue. This provides an entry point for phytopathogens thereby increasing the need for an effective defense system in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agustí et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that AZ cells undergoing cell separation express defense genes and it has been proposed that they function in protecting the AZ cells from infection after abscission has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai and Lashbrook, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Niederhuth et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>IDA</italic> elicits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<italic>N. benthamiana</italic>) leaves transiently expressing the HAE or HSL2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butenko et al., 2014</xref>). As a consequence of defense responses, ROS occurs in the apoplast and is involved in regulating the cell wall structure by producing cross-linking of cell wall components in the form of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or act as cell wall loosening agents in the form of hydroxyl radical (·OH) radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kärkönen and Kuchitsu, 2015</xref>). ROS may also serve as a direct defense response by their highly reactive and toxic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kärkönen and Kuchitsu, 2015</xref>). In addition, ROS may act as a secondary signaling molecule enhancing intracellular defense responses as well as contributing to the induction of defense-related genes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castro et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, apoplastic ROS is mainly produced by a family of NADPH oxidases located in the PM known as respiratory burst oxidase proteins (RBOHs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Torres and Dangl, 2005</xref>). The production of ROS is often found closely linked to an increase in the concentration of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>), where the interplay between these signaling molecules is observed in immunity across kingdoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kadota et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steinhorst and Kudla, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, ROS and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> are known signaling molecules acting downstream of several peptide ligand-receptor pairs. This includes the endogenous PAMPs elicitor peptide (PEP)1, PEP2, and PEP3 which function as elicitors of systemic responses against pathogen attack and herbivory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huffaker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qi et al., 2010</xref>), as well as the pathogen derived peptide ligands flagellin22 (flg22) and elongation factor thermo unstable (Ef-Tu) which bind and activate defense-related RKs in the PM of the plant cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Felix et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gómez-Gómez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranf et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The interplay between ROS and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> has been well studied in the flg22-induced signaling system. The flg22 peptide interacts with the extracellular domain of the flagellin sensing 2 (FLS2) receptor kinase, which rapidly leads to an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranf et al., 2011</xref>). In a resting state, the co-receptor brassinosteroid insensitive1-associated receptor kinase 1/SERK3 (BAK1) and the cytoplasmic kinase botrytis-induced kinase 1 (BIK1) form a complex with FLS2. Upon binding of flg22 to the FLS2 receptor, BIK1 is released from the receptor complex and activates intracellular signaling molecules through phosphorylation, among other, the PM localized RBOHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2014</xref>). The flg22-induced apoplastic ROS produced binds to PM localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels on neighboring cells, activating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the cytosol. The cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> may bind to calcium-dependent protein kinase5 (CDPKs) regulating RBOHD activity through phosphorylation. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylation of RBOH enhances ROS production, which in turn leads to a propagation of the ROS/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal through the plant tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dubiella et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A rapid increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> is not only observed in peptide-ligand-induced signaling. Similar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> changes are observed as responses to developmental signals, such as extracellular auxin and environmental signals, such as high-salt conditions and drought (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kudla et al., 2018</xref>). Also, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> signals are observed in single cells during pollen tube and root hair growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Monshausen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanders et al., 1999</xref>). How cells decipher the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> changes into a specific cellular response is still largely unknown, however, the cell contains a large toolkit of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor proteins that may affect cellular function through changes in protein phosphorylation and gene expression. Each Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein has specific affinities for Ca<sup>2+</sup> allowing them to respond to different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations providing a specific cellular response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scherzer et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Given our previous studies showing IDA induced apoplastic ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butenko et al., 2014</xref>), and the known link between ROS and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response observed for other ligands such as flg22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dubiella et al., 2013</xref>), we sought to investigate if IDA induces a release of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>. Here we report that IDA is able to induce an intracellular release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root tips as well as in the AZ. Pursuing the tight connection between ROS and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in other defense signaling systems, we explored if the the observed production of ROS and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the IDA-HAE/HSL2 signaling pathway could be linked to the involvement of IDA in regulating plant defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patharkar et al., 2017</xref>). We show that a range of biotic and abiotic signals can induce <italic>IDA</italic> expression and we demonstrate that the IDA signal modulates responses of plant immune signaling. We propose that, in addition to regulating cell separation, IDA plays a role in enhancing a defense response in tissues undergoing cell separation thus providing the essential need for enhanced defense responses in tissue during the cell separation event.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IDA induces apoplastic production of ROS and elevation in cytosolic calcium-ion concentration</title><p>We have previously shown that a 12 amino acid functional IDA peptide, hereby referred to as mIDA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), elicits the production of a ROS burst in <italic>N.benthamiana</italic> leaves transiently expressing <italic>HAE</italic> or <italic>HSL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butenko et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate whether mIDA could elicit a ROS burst in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a luminol-dependent ROS assay on <italic>hae hsl2</italic> mutant rosette leaves expressing the full length HAE receptor under a constitutive promoter (<italic>35 S:HAE-YFP</italic>) was performed. <italic>hae hsl2 35 S:HAE-YFP</italic> leaf discs treated with mIDA emitted extracellular ROS, whereas no response was observed in wild-type (WT) leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>).

Since rapid production of ROS is often linked to an elevation in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steinhorst and Kudla, 2013</xref>), we aimed to investigate if mIDA could induce a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response. We imaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> in 10-day-old roots expressing the cytosolic localized fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor R-GECO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keinath et al., 2015</xref>). As a positive control for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> release we added 1 mM extracellular ATP (eATP), which leads to a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> elevation in the root tip within a minute after application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breiden et al., 2021</xref>).

R-GECO1 fluorescence intensities normalized to background intensities (ΔF/F) were measured from a region of interest (ROI) covering the meristematic and elongation zone of the root and revealed that the response starts 4–5 min after application of the mIDA peptide and lasts for 7–8 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

To better understand the specificity of the mIDA induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, we aimed to compare the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in mIDA-treated roots to those treated with flg22. We observed striking differences in the onset and distribution of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Analysis of roots treated with 1 μM flg22 showed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal initiated in the root elongation zone from where it spread toward the meristematic zone as a single wave and that the signal amplitude was at a maximum within the elongation zone and decreased as the signal spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). These observations indicate differences in tissue specificity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses between mIDA and flg22, which we hypothesize depend on the cellular distribution of their cognate receptors. Indeed, when investigating the promoter activity of the <italic>HAE</italic>, <italic>HSL2,</italic> and <italic>FLS2</italic> receptors by the use of nuclear localized transcriptional reporter lines we observed a different pattern of fluorescent nuclei in the roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c, d and e</xref>). <italic>pHAE:Venus-H2B</italic> lines had fluorescent expression in the epidermis and stele of the elongation zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) and <italic>pHSL2:Venus-H2B</italic> lines in the lateral root cap, root tip and root meristem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>); while fluorescent nuclei were observed in the stele of the elongation zone in <italic>pFLS2:Venus-H2B lines</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The different patterns of fluorescent nuclei observed for the three different receptor constructs could indeed explain the differences in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures triggered by mIDA and flg22. However, the receptors promoter activity show a broader expression pattern compared to the respective ligand induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> responses, indicating additional regulating factors for the observed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response.</p><p>To further investigate the mIDA induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, we used a cytosolic localized Aequorin-based luminescence Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (Aeq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knight et al., 1991</xref>). The Aeq sensor was chosen due to the well-established use of this sensor in studies investigating peptide induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranf et al., 2011</xref>) Removing the last Asparagine of the mIDA peptide (IDAΔN69; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) renders it inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butenko et al., 2014</xref>).

LaCl<sub>3</sub> and EGTA are inhibitors that block PM localized cation channels and chelate Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular space, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knight et al., 1997</xref>).

Flowers treated with mIDA prior to cell wall loosening showed no increase in luminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the mIDA-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in flowers correlates with the onset of the abscission process and the increase in <italic>HAE</italic> and <italic>HSL2</italic> expression at the AZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai and Lashbrook, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patharkar and Walker, 2015</xref>).

We used the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucuronide (4 MUG) which is hydrolysed to the fluorochrome 4-methyl umbelliferone (4-MU) to quantify GUS-activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blázquez, 2007</xref>). A significant increase in fluorescence was observed for flg22 and chitin treated samples compared to untreated controls, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), which was not observed when exposing seedlings to IDAΔN69 indicating that increased <italic>IDA</italic> expression is not triggered simply by the application of a peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

The process of cell separation is a fast and time-restricted response where cells previously protected by outer cell layers are rapidly exposed to the environment.

Together, these data show that IDA can trigger a rapid increase in the expression of key genes involved in immunity. We next investigated if the mIDA induced transcription of defense related genes was similar to that induced by flg22. Seven days-old Col-0 WT seedlings were treated for 1 hr with mIDA, flg22 or a combination of mIDA and flg22 to explore potential additive effects. The relative increase in transcription of the genes tested is similar when seedlings are treated with mIDA and flg22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). However, when treating seedlings with both peptides the relative transcription of the genes of interest increased substantially. To our surprise, the combined enhanced transcription when seedling where co-treated with both flg22 and mIDA exceeds a simple additive effect of the two peptides. To investigate if the observed increase is specific to a combination of mIDA and flg22, we investigated if co-treatment with mIDA and PIP1, an endogenous DAMP peptide known to amplify the immune response triggered by flg22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hou et al., 2014</xref>) gave a similar effect.

It is largely unknown how molecular components regulating cell separation and how the IDA-HAE/HSL2 signaling pathway, contributes to modulation of plant immune responses. Here, we show that the mature IDA peptide, mIDA, is involved in activating known defense responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, including the production of ROS, the intracellular release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the production of callose and the transcription of genes known to be involved in defense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We suggest a role for IDA in ensuring optimal cellular responses in tissue undergoing cell separation, regulating both development and defense.</p><p>The intracellular event occurring downstream of IDA is still partially unknown. Here, we report the release of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a new signaling component. Roots and AZs expressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor R-GECO1, showed a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in response to mIDA. Moreover, the increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in response to mIDA in flowers occurred only at stages where cell separation was taking place, linking the observed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response to the temporal point of abscission and the need for an induced local defense response. During floral development the expression of the <italic>HAE</italic> and <italic>HSL2</italic> receptors increase prior to the onset of abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai and Lashbrook, 2008</xref>) and may account for the temporal mIDA induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response observed.</p><p>Based on these results, it is likely that the expression of the receptors is the limiting factor for a cells ability to respond to the mIDA peptide with a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response. However, promoter activity of the receptors are observed in a broader area of the root than the observed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response. As an example, <italic>pHSL2</italic> is found to have a localized activation in the root tip, and when HSL2 is activated by IDL1 be involved in the regulation of cell separation during root cap sloughing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). IDL1 and IDA have a high degree of similarity in the protein sequence, and <italic>IDL1</italic> expressed under the <italic>IDA</italic> promoter can fully rescue the abscission phenotype observed in the <italic>ida</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stenvik et al., 2008</xref>). We can assume that IDL1 activates similar signaling components in the root cap as those used by IDA. Despite the expression of HSL2 and the involvement of the receptor in root cap sloughing, no [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response is observed in this region when plants are treated with the IDA peptide. The absence of an observed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response in the root tip indicates that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> is most likely not involved in the cell separation process during root cap sloughing, or that cells involved in this process only are able to induce a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response at a specific developmental time point. Thus, in addition to receptor availability, other factors must be involved in regulating the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response. It is intriguing that the mIDA cellular output is similar to that of flg22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kadota et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>) yet shows some distinct differences. The spatial distribution of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave originated by mIDA differs from that of flg22. The <italic>rbohd rbohf</italic> mutant shows ROS production in the AZ, indicating that other NADPH oxidases or cell wall peroxidases expressed in the AZ may be involved in ROS production, in contrast to the importance of RBOHD RBOHF in flg22 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kadota et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that while IDA and flg22 share many components for their signal transduction, such as the BAK1 co-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chinchilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meng et al., 2016</xref>) and MAPK cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2008</xref>), there are other specific components that are likely important to provide differences in signaling. Despite the observation of the numerous defense related responses to mIDA, we cannot exclude that the mIDA induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> and rises in ROS levels may also have an intrinsic developmental role such as modulating cell wall properties and cell expansion similar to what is observed during FERONIA (FER) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2018</xref>). To further decipher the importance of the mIDA-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ROS in defense, it will be important to identify the specific signaling components responsible for this cellular output in addition to investigating the susceptibility of mutants to pathogen exposure.</p><p>Interestingly, FLS2 arrangement into nanoscale domains at the PM is dependent on FER. FLS2 becomes more disperse and mobile in <italic>fer</italic> mutants, implying a role for FER in regulating FLS2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gronnier et al., 2022</xref>). Also altering of the cell wall affects FLS2 nanoscale organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKenna et al., 2019</xref>). Formation of nanoscale domains containing the HAE and HSL2 receptors may be an important signaling step in the IDA-HAE/HSL2 signaling pathway. From our promoter analysis, we clearly see overlapping activity of the <italic>HAE</italic> and <italic>HSL2</italic> promoters with the <italic>FLS2</italic> promoter in planta, providing the possibility that the receptors are localized at the PM of the same cells and can have coordinated signaling events. An intriguing thought is a possible co-localization of HAE and HSL2 with FLS2 in nanoscale domains, making a signaling unit possible to involve multiple different receptors responsible for the signaling outcome observed. In this paper, we show that co-treatment with mIDA and flg22 induces an enhanced transcription of defense-related genes. How FLS2, HAE and HSL2 communicate at the PM of the responsive cells may give the answers to the molecular mechanisms behind the augmented transcriptional regulation observed when co-treatment of mIDA and flg22 is performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We can investigate possible interaction partners of HAE and HSL2 looking at available data from a sensitized high-throughput interaction assay between extracellular domains (ECDs) of 200 Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smakowska-Luzan et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, LRR-RLKs known to play a function in biotic or abiotic stress responses, such as receptor-like kinase 7 (RLK7), strubbelig-receptor family 3, receptor-like protein kinase 1 and FRK1, are found to interact mainly with HSL2, whereas HAE shows interaction with LRRs mainly involved in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). RLK7 has recently been identified as an additional receptor for CEP4, involved in regulating cell surface immunity and response to nitrogen starvation, indication a role of RLK7 as an additional receptor regulating defense responses in known peptide-receptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rzemieniewski et al., 2022</xref>).

It is beneficial for the plant to ensure an upregulation of defense responses in tissues undergoing cell separation as a precaution against pathogen attack.

(<bold>b</bold>) During normal conditions, IDA control floral organ abscission and emergence of lateral roots by relaying a signal through receptor complexes including HAE, HSL2, SERK1 and BAK1 to modulate the expression of cell wall remodeling (CWR) genes as well as moderately expression of defense genes. IDA activates a receptor dependent production of ROS and an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>. (<bold>b</bold>) Upon stress, such as pathogen attack, the activation of HAE and HSL2 acts in addition to activation of defense related receptors, such as FLS2, to enhance the expression of defense related genes significantly.

Indeed, this is challenging to address as many of the outputs are shared by multiple pathways. This is especially the case here as the peptide could have different effects in different tissues or cells with different expression levels of the receptors (e.g. hypothetically - no expression = no effect; weak expression - cell wall loosening and susceptibility; high expression - strong response and 'defence' response). I do however appreciate that the authors have toned down some of the conclusions regarding the defence response and also they included further reference to outputs also being from developmental pathways.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87912.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Previously, it has been shown the essential role of IDA peptide and HAESA receptor families in driving various cell separation processes such as abscission of flowers as a natural developmental process, of leaves as a defense mechanism when plants are under pathogenic attack or at the lateral root emergence and root tip cell sloughing. In this work, Olsson et al. show for the first time the possible role of IDA peptide in triggering plant innate immunity after the cell separation process occurred. Such an event has been previously proposed to take place in order to seal open remaining tissue after cell separation to avoid creating an entry point for opportunistic pathogens. The elegant experiments in this work demonstrate that IDA peptide is triggering the defense-associated marker genes together with immune specific responses including release of ROS and intracellular CA2+. Thus, the work highlights an intriguing direct link between endogenous cell wall remodeling and plant immunity. Moreover, the upregulation of IDA in response to abiotic and especially biotic stimuli are providing a valuable indication for potential involvement of HAE/IDA signalling in other processes than plant development.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>We thank the authors for addressing our previous comments.

The approach used is solid and helps to define the role of IDA in a two-step process, cell separation followed by activation of innate defenses. The main limitation of the study is the lack of direct evidence linking signaling by IDA and its HAE receptors to immunity. As such the work remains descriptive but it will nevertheless be of interest to a wide range of plant cell biologists.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for thoroughly reading our manuscript. We have used their comments and suggestions- to improve the manuscript. Below is a response to the reviewer's comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The paper titled 'A dual function of the IDA peptide in regulating cell separation and modulating plant immunity at the molecular level' by Olsson Lalun et al., 2023 aims to understand how IDAHAE/HSL2 signalling modulates immunity, a pathway that has previously been implicated in development. This is a timely question to address as conflicting reports exist within the field. IDL6/7 have previously been shown to negatively regulate immune signalling, disease resistance and stress responses in leaf tissue, however IDA has been shown to positively regulate immunity through the shedding of infected tissues. Moreover, recently the related receptor NUT/HSL3 has been shown to positively regulate immune signalling and disease resistance. This work has the potential to bring clarity to this field, however the manuscript requires some additional work to address these questions. This is especially the case as it contracts some previous work with IDL peptides which are perceived by the same receptor complexes.</p><p>Can IDA induce pathogen resistance? Does the infiltration of IDA into leaf tissue enhance or reduce pathogen growth? Previously it has been shown that IDL6 makes plants more susceptible. Is this also true for IDA? Currently cytoplasmic calcium influx and apoplastic ROS as overinterpreted as immune responses - these can also be induced by many developmental cue e.g. CLE40 induced calcium transients. Whilst gene expression is more specific is also true that treatment with synthetic peptides, which are recognised by LRR-RKs, can induce immune gene expression, especially in the short term, even when that is not there in vivo function e.g. doi.org/10.15252/embj.2019103894.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the concerns raised and agree that further experiments including pathogen assays would strengthen the link between IDA signaling and immunity and we plan for such experiments in future work. We have however, modified the discussion to include the possible role of IDA induced Ca2+ and ROS during development. We have recently published a preprint (accepted for publication in JXB) ( (Galindo-Trigo et al., 2023, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.12.557497)">https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.12.557497)</ext-link>) strengthening the link between IDA and defense by identifying WRKY transcription factors that regulate IDA expression through a Y1H assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper shows that receptors other than hae/hsl2 are genetically required to induce defense gene expression, it would have been interesting to see what phenotype would be associated with higher order mutants of closely related haesa/haesa-like receptors. Indeed recently HSL1 has been shown to function as a receptor for IDA/IDL peptides. Could the triple mutant suppress all response? Could the different receptors have distinct outputs? For example for FRK1 gene expression the hae hsl2 mutant has an enhanced response. Could defence gene expression be primarily mediated by HSL1 with subfunctionalisation within this clade?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be interesting to also include HSL1 in our studies. However, the focus of this study has been on HAE and HSL2 and we wanted to explore their role in IDA induced defense responses. Including HSL1 in these studies will require generation of multiple transgenic lines and repeating most of the experiments and are experiments we will consider in a follow up study together with pathogen assays (that would also address the main concern raised in the comment above). We have however, modified the text to include the known function of HSL1 and discuss the possibility of subfunctionalisation of this receptor clade.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One striking finding of the study is the strong additive interaction between IDA and flg22 treatment on gene expression. Do the authors also see this for co-treatment of different peptides with flg22, or is this unique function of IDA? Is this receptor dependent (HAE/HSL1/HSL2)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question. Since our study focuses on the IDA signaling pathway we preferentially tested if the additive effect observed between flg22 and mIDA was also observed when mIDA was combined with another peptide involved in defense. The endogenous peptide PIP1, has previously been shown to amplify flg22 signaling (Hou et al 2014, doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004331 ). In this study it is shown that co-treatment with flg22 and PIP1 gives increased resistance to Pseudomonas PstDC3000 compared to when plants are treated with each peptide separately. In the same study, the authors also show reduced flg22 induce transcriptional activity of two defense related genes WRKY33 and PR in the receptor like kinase7 (rlk7) mutant (the receptor perceiving PIP1) (). To investigate whether PIP1 would give the same additive effect with mIDA as that observed between flg22 and mIDA, we co-treated seedlings with PIP1 and mIDA. We observed no enhanced transcriptional activity of FRK1, MYB51 and PEP3 in tissue from plants treated with both PIP1 and mIDA peptides compared to single exposure. These results are presented in supplementary figure 11. In conclusion we do not think mIDA acts as a general amplifier of all immune elicitors in plants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is interesting how tissue specific calcium responses are in response to IDA and flg22, suggesting the cellular distribution of their cognate receptors. However, one striking observation made by the authors as well, is that the expression of promoter seems to be broader than the calcium response. Indicating that additional factors are required for the observed calcium response. Could diffusion of the peptide be a contributing factor, or are only some cells competent to induce a calcium response?</p></disp-quote><p>It is interesting that the authors look for floral abscission phenotypes in cngc and rbohd/f mutants to conclude for genetic requirement of these in floral abscission. Do the authors have a hypothesis for why they failed to see a phenotype for the rbohd/f mutant as was published previously? Do you think there might be additional players redundantly mediating these processes?</p><p>It is a possibility that diffusion of the peptide plays a role in the observed response. In a biological context we would assume that the local production of the peptides plays an important role in the cellular responses. In our experimental setup, we add the peptide externally and we can therefore assume that the overlaying cells get in contact with the peptide before cells in the inner tissues and this could be affecting the response recorded However, our results show that there is a differences between flg22 and mIDA induced responses even when the application of the peptides is performed in the same manner, indicating that the difference in the response is not primarily due to the diffusion rate of the peptides but is likely due to different factors being present in different cells. To acquire a better picture of the distribution of receptor expression in the root tissue and to investigate in which cells the receptors have an overlapping expression pattern, we have included results in figure 6 showing plant lines co-expressing transcriptional reporters of FLS2 and HAE or HSL2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can you observe callose deposition in the cotyledons of the 35S::HAE line? Are the receptors expressed in native cotyledons? This is the only phenotype tested in the cotyledons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. We have now conducted callose deposition assay on the 35S:HAE line. And Indeed, we observe callose depositions when cotyledons from a 35S:HAE line is treated with mIDA. We have included these results in figure 4 and have adjusted the text regarding the callose assay accordingly. In addition, we have analyzed the promoter activity of pHAE in cotelydons and we observe weak promoter activity. These results are included as supplementary figure 1d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are flg22-induced calcium responses affected in hae hsl2?</p></disp-quote><p>The experiment suggested by the reviewer is an important control to ensure that the hae hsl2-Aeq line can respond to a Ca2+ inducing peptide signaling through a different receptor than HAE or HSL2. One would expect to see a Ca2+ response in this line to the flg22 peptide. We performed this experiment and surprisingly we could not detect a flgg22 induced Ca2+ signal in the hae hsl2 mutnt. As it is unlikely that the Ca2+ response triggered by flg22 is dependent on HAE and HSL2 we have to assume that the lack of response is due to a malfunction of the Aeq sensor in this line. As a control to measure the amount of Aeq present in the cells we treat the Aeq seedlings with 2 M CaCl2 and measure the luminescence constantly for 180 seconds (Ranf et al., 2012, DOI10.1093/mp/ssr064). The CaCl2 treatment disrupts the cells and releases the Aeq sensor into the solution where it will react with Ca2+ and release the total possible response in the sample (Lmax) in form of a luminescent peak. When treating the hae hsl2-Aeq line with CaCl2we observe a luminescent peak, indicating the presence of the sensor, however, the response is reduced compared to WT seedlings expressing Aeq. Given the sensitivity of FLS2 to flg22 one would still expect to see a Ca2+ peak in the hae hsl2-Aeq line even if the amount of sensor is reduced. Given that this is not the case, we have to assume that localization or conformation of the sensor is somehow affected in this line or that there is another biological explanation that we cannot explain at the moment.</p><p>We have therefore opted on omitting the results using the hae hsl2 Aeq lines from the manuscript and are in the process of mutating HAE and HSL2 by CRISPR-Cas9 in the Aeq background to verify that the mIDA triggered Ca2+ response is dependent on HAE and HSL2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Lalun and co-authors investigate the signalling outputs triggered by the perception of IDA, a plant peptide regulating organs abscission. The authors observed that IDA perception leads to a transient influx of Ca2+, to the production of reactive oxygen species in the apoplast, and to an increase accumulation of transcripts which are also responsive to an immunogenic epitope of bacterial flagellin, flg22. The authors show that IDA is transcriptionally upregulated in response to several biotic and abiotic stimuli. Finally, based on the similarities in the molecular responses triggered by IDA and elicitors (such as flg22) the authors proposed that IDA has a dual function in modulating abscission and immunity. The manuscript is rather descriptive and provide little information regarding IDA signalling per se. A potential functional link between IDA signalling and immune signalling remains speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the concerns raised and agree that further experiments including pathogen assays would strengthen the link between IDA signaling and immunity and plan for such experiments in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Previously, it has been shown the essential role of IDA peptide and HAESA receptor families in driving various cell separation processes such as abscission of flowers as a natural developmental process, of leaves as a defense mechanism when plants are under pathogenic attack or at the lateral root emergence and root tip cell sloughing. In this work, Olsson et al. show for the first time the possible role of IDA peptide in triggering plant innate immunity after the cell separation process occurred. Such an event has been previously proposed to take place in order to seal open remaining tissue after cell separation to avoid creating an entry point for opportunistic pathogens.</p><p>The elegant experiments in this work demonstrate that IDA peptide is triggering the defenseassociated marker genes together with immune specific responses including release of ROS and intracellular CA2+.

Moreover, the upregulation of IDA in response to abiotic and especially biotic stimuli are providing a valuable indication for potential involvement of HAE/IDA signalling in other processes than plant development.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that the reviewer finds our findings linking IDA to defense interesting and would like to thank the reviewer for this positive feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>The various methods and different approaches chosen by the authors consolidates the additional new role for a hormone-peptide such as IDA. The involvement of IDA in triggering of the immunity complex process represents a further step in understanding what happens after cell separation occurs. The Ca2+ and ROS imaging and measurements together with using the haehsl2 and haehsl2 p35S::HAE-YFP genotypes provide a robust quantification of defense responses activation. While Ca2+ and ROS can be detected after applying the IDA treatment after the occurrence of cell separation it is adequately shown that the enzymes responsible for ROS production, RBOHD and RBOHF, are not implicated in the floral abscission.</p><p>Furthermore, IDA production is triggered by biotic and abiotic factors such as flg22, a bacterial elicitor, fungi, mannitol or salt, while the mature IDA is activating the production of FRK1, MYB51 and PEP3, genes known for being part of plant defense process.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Even though there is shown a clear involvement of IDA in activating the after-cell separation immune system, the use of p35S:HAE-YFP line represent a weak point in the scientific demonstration. The mentioned line is driving the HAE receptor by a constitutive promoter, capable of loading the plant with HAE protein without discriminating on a specific tissue. Since it is known that IDA family consist of more members distributed in various tissues, it is very difficult to fully differentiate the effects of HAE present ubiquitously.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree on this statement. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the responses we have observed are not detectable in WT plants that do not (over)express the HAE receptors. Suggesting that the ROS and callose deposition are induced by the addition of mIDA peptide and not the potential presence of the endogenous IDL peptides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The co-localization of HAE/HSL2 and FLS2 receptors is a valuable point to address since in the present work, the marker lines presented do not get activated in the same cell types of the root tissues which renders the idea of nanodomains co-localization (as hypothetically written in the discussion) rather unlikely.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising an important aspect of our study. It is true that not all cells in the root which have promoter activity for FLS2 also exhibit promoter activity for either HAE or HSL2. However, we have observed that certain cells in the roots show promoter activity for both receptors. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have included plants expression a transcriptional promoter for both FLS2 and HAE or HSL2 using different fluorescent proteins. We have investigated overlapping promoter activity both at sites of lateral roots, in the tip of the primary root and in the abscission zone. Our results show overlapping expression of the transcriptional reporters in certain cells, indicating that FLS2 and HAE or HSL2 are likely to be found in some of the same cells during plant development. We also observe cells where only one or none of the promoters are active.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Supplementary Figure 3: re-labelling of y axis; 200 than 200,00 for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary Figure 2: It would be good to include the age of the seedlings used to study calcium influx in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary Figure 1: rephrase 'IDA induces ROS production in Arabidopsis'.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of chelating agents to establish the need of calcium from extracellular space is a clear experiment supporting the calcium response phenotype specific to IDA treatment in seedlings. Removing the last asparagine (N) and using it as a peptide that fails to elicit calcium response could simply be because of the peptide is smaller in length or different chemical properties. Therefore, a scrambled sequence would have been a better control.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of using a scrambled peptide as a negative control, however we find it unlikely that mIDA∆N69 could induce any activity based on previous work. Results from crystal structure of mIDA bound to the HAE receptor and ligand-receptor interaction studies (10.7554/eLife.15075 ) show that the last asparagine in the mIDA peptide is essential for detectable binding to the HAE receptor and that a peptide lacking this amino acid does not have any activity. We will however, in future experiments also include a scrambled version of the peptide as an additional control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Please find below specific comments:</p><p>(1) Most of the molecular outputs triggered by IDA can be considered as common molecular marks of plant peptides signalling, they do not represent strong evidences of a potential function of IDA in modulating immunity. For instance, perception of CIF peptides, which control the establishment of the Casparian strips, regulate the production of reactive oxygen species, and the transcription of genes associated with immune responses (Fujita et al., The EMBO Journal 2020). It should also be considered that FRK1, whose function remains unknown, may be involved in both immunity and abscission and that the upregulation of FRK1 upon IDA treatment is not indicative of active modulation of immune signalling by IDA.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point raised by the reviewer and we now address in the manuscript that ROS and Ca2+ are hallmarks of both plant development and defense. The function of FRK1 is not known however, it is unlikely that the upregulation of FRK1 in response to mIDA plays a role in the developmental progression of abscission as it is not temporally regulated during the abscission process, thus making it an unlikely candidate in the regulation of cell separation (Cai &amp; Lashbrook, 2008, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.110908">https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.110908</ext-link>). We do however agree that further experiments including pathogen assays would strengthen the link between IDA signaling and immunity and plan for such experiments in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It remains unknown whether IDA modulate immunity. For instance, does IDA perception promote resistance to bacteria (bacterial proliferation, disease symptoms)? Is IDA genetically required for plant disease resistance immunity? Is the IDA signalling pathway genetically required for transcriptional changes induced by flg22, such as increase in FRK1 transcripts? In addition, the authors propose that the proposed function of IDA in modulating immune signalling prevents bacterial infection in tissue exposed to stress(es). Does loss of function of IDA or of its corresponding receptors leads to changes in the ability of bacteria to colonise plant root upon stress(es)?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the comment above regarding pathogen assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Several aspects of the work appear to correspond to preliminary investigation. For instance, the authors analyse loss of function mutant for genes encoding for Ca2+ permeable channels (CNGCs) which are transcriptionally active during the onset of abscission (Sup. Figure 5). None of the single mutants present an abscission defect. These observations provide no information regarding the identity of the channel(s) involved in IDA-induced calcium influx.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we have not been able to identify the channels responsible for the IDA-induced calcium influx. Given the redundancy for many of the members of this multigenic family a future approach to identify proteins responsible for the IDA triggered calcium response could be to create multiple KO mutants by CRISPR Cas9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Using H2DCF-DA, the authors observed a decrease in ROS accumulation in the abscission zone of rbohd/rbohf double KO line (Sup Figure 5c) but describe in the text that ROS production in this zone does not depend on RBOHD and RBOHF (L220). Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been clarified in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors describe that rbohd/rbohf double KO present a lower petal break-strength, which they describe as an indication of premature cell wall loosening, and that petals of rbohd/rbohf abscised one position earlier than in WT. Yet, the authors postulate that IDA-induced ROS production does not regulate abscission but may regulate additional responses. Instead the data seems to indicate that ROS production by RBOHD and RBOHF regulate the timing of abscission. In addition, it would have been interesting to test whether IDA signalling pathway regulate ROS production in the abscission zone.</p></disp-quote><p>The rbohd and rbohf double mutants show several phenotypes associated to developmental stress, the mild phenotype observed with regards to premature abscission (by one position) could be caused by the phenotype of the double mutant rather than related to ROS production. Indeed, it has been suggested that the lignified brace in the AZ dependent on ROS production by the aforementioned RBOHs in necessary for the correct concentration of cell modifying enzymes (Lee et al., 2018, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.060">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.060</ext-link>). The precocious abscission in this double mutant clearly shows this not to be the case. We have tried to do a ROS burst assay on AZ tissue/flowers with the mIDA peptide but have not been successful with this approach. A ROS sensor expressed in AZ tissue would be a valuable tool to address whether IDA signalling regulates ROS production in AZs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In Sup. Figure5a, it would be of interest to have a direct comparison of the transcript accumulation of the presented CNGCs and RBOHDs with other of these multigenic families.</p></disp-quote><p>The CNGCs and RBOH gene expression profile shown in the figure are the family members expressed during the developmental progress of floral abscission in stamen AZs. Since there is no difference in the temporal expression of the other family members (and most are either not expressed or very weakly expressed in this tissue) it is not possible to do this comparison (Cai &amp; Lashbrook, 2008, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.110908">https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.110908</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) L251-253, since IDAdeltaN69 cannot be perceived by its receptors, the absence of induction of pIDA::GUS by IDAdeltaN69 compared to flg22 cannot be seen as a sign of specificity in peptideinduced increase in IDA promotor activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephased this in the text</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Please provide quantitative and statistical analysis of the calcium measurement presented in sup figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) L339-341; This sentence is unclear to me, please rephrase.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephased this in the text</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) In order to assess the role of CNGCs in abscission process, it would be more interesting to see the effect on the Ca2+ pattern and ROS signaling after application of mIDA on cngc and rbohf rbohd mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree in this statement and the studies on mIDA induced ROS and Ca2+ on these mutants will provide valuable information to the regulation of the response. We are in the process of making the lines needed to be able to perform these experiments. However, since it requires crossing of genetically encoded sensors into each mutant, and generation of higher order mutants this is a long process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) With regard to the ROS production (Sup Fig. 1), the application of mIDA can trigger ROS in p35S::HAE:YFP lines, but not in the wild-type plant, which is according to the text &quot;most likely due to the absence of HAE expression&quot; in leaves. The experiment on callose deposition is performed in wild-type cotyledons where no callose deposition could be observed after mIDA treatment (Fig. 4a,b). The conclusion from text is that IDA &quot;is not involved in promoting deposition of callose as a long-term defence response&quot;. It appears more likely that neither ROS nor callose can be observed in wild-type plants due to the lack of HAE expression. Therefore, the callose experiment should include the p35S::HAE:YFP lines. The experiment as it is does not allow to draw any conclusion on HAE/IDA involvement in callose formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this comment, thank you for pinpointing this out.
