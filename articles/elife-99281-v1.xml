<italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, is the second most reported sexually transmitted infection worldwide. The increasing appearance of isolates that are resistant to approved therapeutics raises the concern that gonorrhea may become untreatable. Here, we serendipitously identified oxydifficidin as a potent <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> antibiotic through the observation of a <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> contaminant in a lawn of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>. Oxydifficidin is active against both wild-type and multidrug-resistant <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>. Its potent activity results from a combination of DedA-assisted uptake into the cytoplasm and the presence of an oxydifficidin-sensitive ribosomal protein L7/L12 (RplL). Our data indicate that oxydifficidin binds to the ribosome at a site that is distinct from other antibiotics and that L7/L12 is uniquely associated with its mode of action. This study opens a potential new avenue for addressing antibiotic resistant gonorrhea and underscores the possibility of identifying overlooked natural products from cultured bacteria, particularly those with activity against previously understudied pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic></kwd><kwd>cell culture</kwd><kwd>antibiotics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014261</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI116566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biais</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014261</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R35GM122559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brady</surname><given-names>Sean F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>iBio Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biais</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oxydifficidin presents potent activity against multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhea with a new mode of action, which opens a new avenue for potentially addressing antibiotic resistant gonorrhea.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gonorrhea is the second most reported sexually transmitted infection worldwide, its causative agent is the bacterium <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) approximately 82.4 million new adult gonorrhea infections occurred globally in 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">WHO, 2019</xref>). The high dose (500 mg) of the cephalosporin ceftriaxone is currently the only recommended therapy for treating gonorrhea infections in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">St Cyr et al., 2020</xref>). The growing instances of drug resistant ‘superbugs’, together with the limited clinical treatment options, underscore the urgent need for additional antibiotics that target <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Unemo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ohnishi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Day et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Derbie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sawatzky et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shaskolskiy et al., 2022</xref>). The characterization of antibacterial active natural products inspired the development of both ceftriaxone and azithromycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richards et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakheit et al., 2014</xref>). Bacterial natural products have been a key source of antibiotics with diverse modes of action and the most fruitful source of therapeutically useful antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Newman and Cragg, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lewis, 2020</xref>). Here, we describe the serendipitous identification of the natural product oxydifficidin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wilson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerman et al., 1987</xref>) as a potent <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> active antibiotic and show that this activity arises from a combination of DedA flippase-assisted uptake and ribosomal protein L7/L12 (RplL) sensitivity. Oxydifficidin provides a new therapeutic lead structure for addressing the growing problem of antibiotic resistant gonorrhea. Over the last century, bacteria were extensively examined for antibiotic production in screens that often focused on a small number of pathogens. This study suggests that reexamining cultured bacteria for antibiotics active against today’s emerging pathogens may be fruitful as metabolites with specific potent activity against historically less problematic pathogens may have been overlooked.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Oxydifficidin isomers selectively and potently inhibit <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic></title><p>In our day to day experiments, we regularly use agar plates containing lawns of pathogenic bacteria. During these experiments, we often find random environmental bacteria growing on these plates. On one lawn of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> we observed an environmental contaminant that was surrounded by a zone of growth inhibition suggesting that it produced an anti-<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> metabolite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Since antibiotics that preferentially inhibit the growth <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> are rare, we looked at this contaminant in more detail. Sequencing of the contaminant’s genome and genome clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1a</xref>) revealed that it was most closely related to <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefacien</italic>s, which is a root-colonizing bacterium that is used as a biocontrol agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ngalimat et al., 2021</xref>).

The sequencing of the non-producer strain revealed that it surprisingly contained four transposon insertions and one frame shift mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1b</xref>). The frame shift mutation and one transposon insertion were predicted to each disrupt unique BGCs. The transposon inserted into the bacillomycin (mycosubtilin) BGC, while the frame shift mutation was predicted to disrupt the (oxy)difficidin BGC. To determine which of these two BGCs was responsible for the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> activity we tested <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> strains with targeted disruptions of each BGC for activity against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koumoutsi et al., 2004</xref>). Only disruption of the (oxy)difficidin BGC eliminated the anti-<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1c</xref>). To confirm the identity of the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> active antibiotic we carried out a bioassay guided fractionation of <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK culture broth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wilson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerman et al., 1987</xref>). High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data from the major active peak we isolated were consistent with its being an oxydifficidin isomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">12</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Oxydifficidin contains a 27-carbon polyketide backbone that is cyclized through a terminal carboxylic acid and an oxidation at position 21. This hydrophobic core is phosphorylated at C16. Oxydifficidin occurs naturally as a collection of interconverting thermal isomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). As reported previously, we observed an interconversion of isomers with the compound we purified from <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wilson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerman et al., 1987</xref>). All assays were performed using the mixture of interconverting oxydifficidin isomers we obtained from <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK cultures.</p><p>We tested oxydifficidin for activity against diverse bacterial pathogens. Oxydifficidin showed only weak activity against most pathogens, however we observed potent activity against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). When we examined other <italic>Neisseria</italic> species, we found that oxydifficidin was consistently more active against <italic>Neisseria</italic> than any of the other bacteria we tested. Among <italic>Neisseria</italic> spp., oxydifficidin was most active against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> underscoring a unique narrow spectrum of potent activity. A key issue with the current treatment of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> infections is the development of resistance to existing therapeutics. Resistance to the standard of care cephalosporins is particularly problematic. Oxydifficidin was more potent against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> MS11 than most other antibiotics we tested. Notably, unlike clinically used antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin, oxydifficidin retained activity against all multidrug-resistant clinical isolates we examined (<xref

We also generated deletion mutants for two other predicted <italic>dedA</italic>-like genes, and the MIC of oxydifficidin for these mutants remained the same as for the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> MS11 wild-type (WT) strain.

DedA family members are predicted to be transmembrane proteins with still largely, poorly defined, functions. However, a few recent studies indicate that DedA homologs are flippases. They have been reported to flip phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine) or phospholipid-like structures (C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate) across prokaryotic and eukaryotic lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sit et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roney and Rudner, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Although oxydifficidin is not a phospholipid, its overall structure resembles that of reported DedA protein substrates, especially C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

Using a coupled system, it was not possible to distinguish between inhibition of RNA or protein synthesis, and therefore, to rule out inhibition of transcription, we next looked directly at RNA synthesis in vitro. In this case we saw no inhibition of RNA synthesis, even at the highest oxydifficidin concentration we tested (13.4 μg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).

Resistance occurred via mutation in the DedA flippase to influence oxydifficidin uptake. The overall mechanism of action is well described making this an <bold>important</bold> study with implications for combating clinical antibiotic resistance.

It is uninformative, as the species contains a large amount of diversity. Instead, please name the strain. From Figure 1, it looks like the authors used MS11. Since MS11 is a longstanding lab strain and likely does not reflect circulating N. gonorrhoeae, and since H041 is no longer in circulation, the authors should ideally test the compound against more representative strains of N. gonorrhoeae. This includes panels of isolates available through the CDC, for example (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/resistance-bank/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/resistance-bank/index.html</ext-link>).
