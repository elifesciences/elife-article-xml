Antiporters therefore have an important role in controlling the conditions inside a cell, such as the pH (which is a measure of acidity) and sodium content (which is a measure of saltiness). In human cells, defects in sodium/proton antiport result in heart or kidney failure and other serious diseases.</p><p>Some aspects of sodium/proton antiporters are well understood, such as the levels of saltiness and acidity that trigger the flow of charged particles in and out of bacterial cells, but the details of how sodium ions or protons activate an antiporter are unknown. Now Paulino and Kühlbrandt have used a technique called electron crystallography to study how the structure of the sodium/proton antiporter changes as the acidity or salt conditions sensed by the antiporter vary.</p><p>When the concentration of sodium ions was increased at acidic conditions (low pH), the structure of the antiporter began to change so as to increase the ion flow. However, no such changes were observed when the concentration of sodium ions was held constant at a low level while the pH was increased. These findings suggest that, contrary to previous thinking, the operation of a sodium/proton antiporter is largely determined by the concentration of sodium ions. A better understanding of the operation of sodium/proton antiporters should help with the design new treatments for faulty antiporters.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01412.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01412.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>electron crystallography</kwd><kwd>electron cryo-microscopy</kwd><kwd>membrane protein structure</kwd><kwd>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter</kwd><kwd>conformational changes</kwd><kwd>transport mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cluster of Excellence–Macromolecular Complexes, Frankfurt</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FCT PhD fellowship (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, Portugal)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulino</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sodium ions but not protons induce defined helix movements in a sodium/proton antiporter and suggest a mechanism for Na + binding and transport.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters are ubiquitous and essential secondary-active transporters found in the cell membranes of all organisms. They play crucial roles in the regulation of intracellular pH, sodium homeostasis, and cell volume. In humans, Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter dysfunction is associated with numerous serious or life-threatening diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Donowitz et al., 2013</xref>), which makes them important drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fliegel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boedtkjer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loo et al., 2012</xref>). Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters belong to the superfamily of cation/proton antiporters (CPA), which include the CPA1 and CPA2 subfamilies as main branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brett et al., 2005</xref>). CPA1 transporters are electroneutral and most likely exchange protons and Na<sup>+</sup> ions with a 1:1 stoichiometry, whereas CPA2 transporters, which mostly exchange two protons per Na<sup>+</sup>, are electrogenic. The best-known member of the CPA2 subfamily is the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter NhaA from <italic>E. coli</italic>. EcNhaA enables <italic>E. coli</italic> to survive at high salinity or alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Padan and Schuldiner, 1994</xref>), making use of the proton-motive force to extrude sodium from the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Other members of the CPA2 subfamily include the plant CHX transporters and the mammalian NHA transporters. Well-known representatives of the CPA1 subfamily include the medically important mammalian NHE exchangers and the archaeal NhaP antiporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brett et al., 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01412.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Physiological roles of EcNhaA and MjNhaP1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EcNhaA is a sodium pump driven by the proton-motive force, exchanging one sodium ion against two protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taglicht et al., 1991</xref>), enabling <italic>E. coli</italic> to survive at high sodium and alkaline pH. (<bold>B</bold>) MjNhaP1 is thought to act mainly as a proton pump driven by the sodium gradient, exchanging one proton against one sodium ion. Like the homologous NHE1 in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), MjNhaP1 plays a critical role in pH homeostasis and enables <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> to survive at low pH (4–6) and sodium concentrations up to 0.9 M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hellmer et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01412.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01412.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01412-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>The activity of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters is highly dependent on the concentration of their substrate ions, H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>. For EcNhaA, a maximum transport rate of 10<sup>5</sup> min<sup>−1</sup> at pH 8.5 has been reported, which drops by two or three orders of magnitude at pH 6.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taglicht et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rimon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Padan, 2008</xref>). This pH dependence has been attributed to a putative cytoplasmic pH sensor, which transfers the antiporter into an acidic-locked conformation at low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taglicht et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Padan, 2008</xref>). A recent study of ΔpH and ΔNa<sup>+</sup>-driven transport indicated a symmetrical bell-shaped pH dependence of EcNhaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mager et al., 2011</xref>). Transport activity was maximal at pH 8.5, and more than doubled as the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increased from 10 mM to 100 mM. These observations are consistent with a simple kinetic model whereby H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> compete for the same substrate binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mager et al., 2011</xref>), thought to include two conserved aspartates in TMH V of EcNhaA. According to this model, inactivation at low pH occurs because Na<sup>+</sup> ions cannot compete effectively against protons for the binding site. Inactivation at high pH is simply due to the depletion of H<sup>+</sup> substrate ions at the binding site, as the proton concentration becomes too low to drive transport.</p><p>The archaeal CPA1 antiporters share significant sequence homology of functionally important regions with the mammalian NHE antiporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>). A study of NHE1 in mammalian cells has shown a strong dependence of transport activity on both H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations, with activity dropping to background level at pH 8, and a strong dependence on extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuster et al., 2008</xref>). Like NHE1, but unlike EcNhaA, the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter NhaP1 from <italic>Methanocaldoccocus jannaschii</italic> (MjNhaP1) is thought to use a sodium gradient to extrude protons from the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Like NHE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuster et al., 2008</xref>), but again unlike EcNhaA, MjNhaP1 is active at pH 6, and down-regulated at pH 7.5 or above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hellmer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The first insight into the structure of a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> came from the 3D map of the EcNhaA dimer in the membrane at 7 Å resolution, obtained by electron crystallography of 2D crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Williams, 2000</xref>). The map revealed 12 transmembrane α-helices (TMHs) per protomer, referred to as TMH I-XII. The TMHs of EcNhaA were arranged in two groups: a 6-helix bundle at the tip of each protomer, and a row of 6 helices at the dimer interface. The 3.45 Å X-ray structure of monomeric EcNhaA in an inward-open conformation provided further details, including a pair of discontinuous helices (TMH IV and XI) in the 6-helix bundle that were proposed to harbor the ion translocation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hunte et al., 2005</xref>). By electron crystallography we obtained a projection structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</xref>) and, more recently, a 3D map of the MjNhaP1 dimer in the membrane at 7 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>) that indicated 13 TMHs, referred to as TMHs 1-13. While the dimer interface looked very different to that of EcNhaA, the structure of the 6-helix bundle was similar, supporting the notion of related transport mechanisms.</p><p>Two-dimensional (2D) crystals are ideal for investigating conformational changes of membrane proteins in a native-like lipid environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Subramaniam et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beroukhim and Unwin, 1995</xref>). By this approach we discovered substrate-induced changes in MjNhaP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</xref>) and in EcNhaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appel et al., 2009</xref>). In both cases, the changes occurred in the 6-helix bundle. Here, we present a detailed study of in situ conformational changes in 2D crystals of MjNhaP1 in response to pH and Na<sup>+</sup>. To separate the effects of H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>, 2D crystals were grown without NaCl and examined by electron crystallography in a wide range of carefully controlled pH and ionic conditions. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of activation and substrate binding in the CPA1 antiporters.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Electron crystallography and difference maps</title><p>For electron crystallography, MjNhaP1 was purified and crystallized under Na<sup>+</sup>-free conditions.

The three sets of strong difference peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> all map to the 6-helix bundle of MjNhaP1 and indicate significant and specific rearrangements of TMHs in this part of the protein. The changes take place in the physiological pH and Na<sup>+</sup> concentration range for <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 1983</xref>) and thus are likely to reflect the conformational changes in the transport cycle. Our model of MjNhaP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>) superposed on the projection and difference maps enables us to assign these changes to individual TMHs, in favourable cases even to the side of the membrane on which they occur.</p><p>Of the three sets of difference peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> that are common to all three pH regimes, the strongest pair (set 1) coincides with the projection of the cytoplasmic half of TMH 5 and the extracellular half of TMH 12 (helix segments 5<sub>c</sub>/12<sub>e</sub>), indicating a joint movement of these two half helices. Inspection of the corresponding peaks in the projection map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and the 3D model indicates a displacement, most likely a lateral movement, of the 5<sub>c</sub>/12<sub>e</sub> helix pair by ∼2 Å towards TMH 10 and 13.</p><p>The second-strongest pair of positive/negative difference peaks (set 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) maps to the projection of TMH 6. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the peak corresponding to TMH 6 is elongated in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> and becomes round at elevated NaCl concentration, indicating that this helix reorients in response to Na<sup>+</sup> binding. In the 3D model the extracellular half of TMH 6 is tilted, so that the entire TMH 6 becomes more straight and perpendicular to the membrane in response to Na<sup>+</sup> binding.</p><p>The third set of difference peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (set 3) coincides with the map region occupied by TMH 13 and helix 5<sub>e</sub>. This set consists of a central positive peak, between two smaller negative peaks. In principle, the positive peak could form a pair with either (or both) of the negative peaks, thus indicating a movement of the corresponding helices. Inspection of the projection map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) helps to resolve this ambiguity. The projection peak corresponding to TMH 13 is more elongated at 500 mM NaCl than in absence of sodium, indicating that this helix becomes more tilted with increasing Na<sup>+</sup> concentration. A peak for helix 5<sub>e</sub> is not evident at low Na<sup>+</sup>, but a clear peak is present at 100 mM NaCl and above in the projection maps. Therefore helix 5<sub>e</sub> is either highly tilted or disordered at low Na<sup>+</sup>, which would both make it difficult to see in projection. Upon Na<sup>+</sup> binding, it either reorients or becomes ordered and then runs more or less perpendicular to the membrane plane.</p><p>The broad difference peak to the left of the 6-helix bundle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> that appeared at pH 4 above 150 mM NaCl indicates a Na<sup>+</sup>-induced movement of the group of helices on the outside of the bundle, consisting of TMH 4, 11 and helix 12<sub>c</sub>. Again, inspection of the corresponding projection maps indicates that this part of the bundle shifts by ∼2 Å towards the dimer interface. This movement is largely absent at pH 8 or 6. The positive difference peak above 100 mM NaCl at pH 8 or 250 mM at pH 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>) indicates a gain of order in the region between the 6-helix bundle and of TMH 10, which is part of the dimer interface.

Both form dimers of similar shape and size in the membrane, and have the conserved 6-helix bundle thought to harbor the ion translocation site. In EcNhaA and other CPA2 antiporters, the ion-binding and transport site has been proposed to include two conserved aspartates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inoue et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hunte et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maes et al., 2012</xref>). In the CPA1 antiporters, one of the aspartates is replaced by an asparagine, which likewise is thought to participate in ion-binding and translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hellmer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>). In the EcNhaA X-ray structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hunte et al., 2005</xref>) the two conserved aspartates are located at the center of TMH V, which means that the corresponding residues in MjNhaP1 are in TMH 6. Our difference maps show that this helix participates prominently in Na<sup>+</sup>-induced changes.</p><p>We also found changes in helix 5<sub>e</sub> of MjNhaP1, which corresponds to the periplasmic half of TMH IV of EcNhaA. Electron crystallography of 2D crystals, side-directed tryptophan fluorescence, ion accessibility studies and MD simulations have all found conformational changes or an intrinsically high degree of flexibility in this half helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kozachkov and Padan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rimon et al., 2012</xref>), and we find that the corresponding region in MjNhaP1 also moves or rearranges upon Na<sup>+</sup> binding. The events known to occur upon ion-binding and translocation in EcNhaA are thus consistent with the conformational changes we observe in MjNhaP1.</p><p>Recently, the 3 Å X-ray structure of the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter NapA from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). TtNapA is electrogenic, and thus functionally similar to EcNhaA. However, in terms of protein structure, it resembles MjNhaP1 much more closely, as judged from a 6 Å projection map we calculated from the TtNapA coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This refers in particular to the position of the 6-helix bundle relative to the dimer interface and the number of TMHs (13 in TtNapA and MjNhaP1, only 12 in EcNhaA). Nevertheless, Lee et al. assume that the structures of TtNapA and EcNhaA show the outward-open and inward-open conformation of essentially the same antiporter. A model of TtNapA in the inward-open conformation based on the EcNhaA structure was generated, and compared it to the outward-open TtNapA structure. Not surprisingly, there were major differences between the inward-open model and the outward-open structure, in particular with respect to the position and orientation of the 6-helix bundle, which appeared to rotate by 20° within the membrane. On the basis of this comparison, they proposed a transport mechanism, which was claimed to apply to all Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters. However, such a massive domain movement is difficult to reconcile with the high turnover rates of EcNhaA and the comparatively subtle substrate-induced changes in and around the 6-helix bundle we observe experimentally in MjNhaP1.</p><p>We built an inward-open TtNapA model based on the EcNhaA structure, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al. (2013)</xref>, and calculated a projection difference map between it and the outward-open TtNapA structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The very large and strong difference peaks in the region of the 6-helix bundle bear no resemblance to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>. We conclude that a 20º in-plane rotation of the 6-helix bundle does not occur in MjNhaP1. It most likely also does not occur in EcNhaA, since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> also bears no resemblance to projection difference maps obtained under a range of physiological ion and pH conditions with this antiporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appel et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>pH dependence of sodium binding in MjNhaP1</title><p>The projection and difference maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3–5</xref> indicate two different conformations of MjNhaP1: one in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>, which looks similar at any pH between 4 and 8, and one in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> above 20 mM at pH 8 or 200 mM at pH 4. The latter shows the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound state, whereas the former shows the apo or proton-bound state of the antiporter. At elevated Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations, the pH 6 maps resemble those at pH 4 or 8, but the difference peaks are less distinct and only roughly half as strong, as would be expected if the corresponding helices were disordered. We ascribe this apparent disorder to the fact that the antiporter is fully active at pH 6, and the helices involved in ion translocation would oscillate between the sodium-free and sodium-bound state. Hence, when the 2D crystals are frozen in liquid nitrogen, the helices are trapped in a continuum of slightly different orientations. In a projection map, which takes the average of all molecules on the 2D crystal lattice, the helices would thus appear disordered, as observed.</p><p>At pH 4 and 8 MjNhaP1 is down-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</xref>) and presumably more or less rigid. Under these conditions, the effect of Na<sup>+</sup> on the structure is progressive, indicating that the maps are averages of an increasing number of molecules on the 2D crystal lattice in the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound state and a decreasing number in the apo state, as the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increases. The height of the difference peaks is then a direct measure of Na<sup>+</sup> affinity, and enables us to determine apparent binding constants for Na<sup>+</sup> in different pH regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>pH dependence of transport activity</title><p>We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hellmer et al., 2002</xref>) have shown that MjNhaP1 is down-regulated at pH 8. Down-regulation at acidic pH has not yet been shown experimentally (largely because there is no suitable pH-sensitive fluorescent dye), but follows from physiological considerations, which indicate that the antiporter must be inactive at pH 4 to prevent uncontrolled influx of Na<sup>+</sup> ions that would otherwise result from a large outward pH gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</xref>). A shutdown at acidic and basic conditions is a key feature of the simple kinetic model proposed by Mager et al. for EcNhaA. This model thus also appears to hold for MjNhaP1. At pH 4, this antiporter may be down-regulated due to competition of H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> for a common binding site, and at pH 8 due to proton depletion. Together with the activity peak around pH 6, these two effects would result in a bell-shaped pH dependence of transport activity.</p><p>The observed 10-fold increase in apparent K<sub>D</sub><sup>Na+</sup> from pH 8 to pH 4 is consistent with a competition of Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> for a common binding site, because more Na<sup>+</sup> ions are needed to displace the protons as the H<sup>+</sup> concentration rises. However, if Na<sup>+</sup> can displace H<sup>+</sup> and can arrest the antiporter in a Na<sup>+</sup>-bound state at pH 4, the question arises why this does not also happen at pH 6, where the antiporter is fully active. Apparently, in addition to substrate competition, the transport rate of MjNhaP1 is also modulated in some other way, for example by the protonation states of amino acid sidechains involved in ion-binding and translocation that render the antiporter more flexible at pH 6 than at pH 4 or pH 8. In EcNhaA and NHE1, a pH sensor is thought to transform the antiporters from an active into an acid-locked state at low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aronson et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aronson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taglicht et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wakabayashi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Padan et al., 2009</xref>). In the case of EcNhaA, this has been reported to involve a conformational switch at the level of secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diab et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schushan et al., 2012</xref>). In MjNhaP1, we see no evidence of a pH-triggered conformational switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), so that down-regulation at low pH is not associated with a significant change in secondary structure. However, it may involve the re-orientation of amino acid sidechains, which would not be visible at 6 Å resolution.</p><p>In an earlier study, Vinothkumar et al. investigated pH-induced changes in 2D crystals of MjNhaP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</xref>). The crystals had been grown in the presence of NaCl, and therefore incubating them in salt-free buffers changed both the pH and the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration simultaneously. The effect observed by Vinothkumar et al. was thus due to both Na<sup>+</sup> and pH, rather than to pH only. We were able to reproduce these differences with 2D crystals grown with or without NaCl, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>By growing 2D crystals of the archaeal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter MjNhaP1 in absence of sodium, we were able to separate effects of the two substrate ions, Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>, on its conformation. Projection difference maps at 6 Å resolution show that pH in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> has no major effect on the structure of the antiporter. This contrasts with current models of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter regulation, which postulate a significant pH-triggered conformational switch. If such a pH switch occurs in MjNhaP1, it does not affect the secondary structure but may involve sidechain movements, which are not resolved by our method. On the other hand, Na<sup>+</sup> ions cause a marked conformational change that is largely pH-independent.</p><p>At pH 8 and 4, where MjNhaP1 is down-regulated, the Na<sup>+</sup>-induced differences reflect a progressive change in the relative population of the two distinct conformational sodium-free and sodium-bound states. This enabled us to deduce apparent binding constants of MjNhaP1 for Na<sup>+</sup> under acidic and basic conditions. At pH 6, where this antiporter is fully active, the helices involved in ion translocation appear disordered, due to averaging over many slightly different conformations on the crystal lattice.</p><p>The MjNhaP1 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>) allows us to conclude that the helix movements deduced from the projection difference maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref> change the access to the proposed substrate binding site, as shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. In the apo or proton-bound state, the ion-binding site near the center of TMH 6 would be accessible from the extracellular side, making this the outward-open state. The helix movements brought about by Na<sup>+</sup> ions then convert the antiporter into the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound, inward-open state. Oscillation between the two states would result in Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport, as specified by the alternating access mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jardetzky, 1966</xref>).

In total, a combination of three different buffers (25 mM K<sup>+</sup> acetate pH 4, 50 mM MES pH 6 and 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 8) and four different salts (NaCl, LiCl, KCl, and MgCl<sub>2</sub>) at different salt concentrations were used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). 1.5 μl sample was applied to the carbon film, mixed thoroughly with excess of embedding buffer and incubated for 1 min. The grids were blotted and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec id="s5-3"><title>Data collection and image processing</title><p>Images were recorded on Kodak SO-163 film with a JEOL 3000 SFF electron microscope at a nominal temperature of 4 K, an acceleration voltage of 300 kV, a magnification of x 53,000 in spot scan mode at 0.2–1 μm defocus. Crystal quality was evaluated by optical diffraction. Well-ordered areas of 4000 × 4000 or 6000 × 6000 pixels were digitized at 7 μm step size on a Zeiss SCAI scanner. Images were processed using the 2dx software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gipson et al., 2007</xref>) and data quality was improved by synthetic unbending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arheit et al., 2012</xref>). Projection maps were calculated from at least six lattices and were of similar quality to 6 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5-4"><title>Difference maps</title><p>For calculation of difference maps scripts from the CCP4 program suite package were manually modified and used at each step as indicated in brackets. Projection phases and amplitudes for each data set were calculated (2dx software), scaled (sftools) and subtracted (overlapmap). Difference maps were plotted to reveal pH- or salt-induced conformational changes. To account for small differences in unit cell length, maps were excised (fft, mapmask, maprot, and npo) and placed into the same cell before subtraction. For an estimate of background noise level, image data collected under identical conditions were randomly divided into two sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> first column), or image data from different conditions were mixed and randomly merged into two separate data sets. These control difference maps were plotted with a stepsize of 1.5 σ between contour levels, indicating a background level of ±2 contour levels, or ∼3 σ. The background level was set to be the same in all calculated difference maps by applying the same absolute plotting parameters as used for the control difference maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3–5</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Deryck Mills for maintenance and management of the EM facility, Özkan Yildiz for computational assistance, and Klaus Fendler for helpful discussions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. We believe that the manuscript should be revised to address the comments below. The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) A striking result is the inconsistency with the concept of allosteric pH regulator. The pH dependence of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-antiporters has been attributed to an allosteric pH regulator (pH sensor) believed to transform the antiporter from an active into a acid-locked state at low pH. Because no major conformational changes are observed here upon pH shift in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>, the current results do not support this model for MjNhaP1. Instead, the observed changes appear to be a consequence of protons and substrate ions competing for the same binding site. The authors state that this minimal kinetic model proposed for NhaA by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mager et al. (2011)</xref> accounts for most of their observations, although the pH dependence of the Na<sup>+</sup> effects on the structure of MjNhaP1 is clearly not linear. If they were, changes at pH 6 would be expected to be somewhere in between those at pH 4 and pH 8, which is evidently not the case. It would be nice to detail this point a little more quantitatively. If one assumes that Na<sup>+</sup> can only bind when the carboxylate groups are deprotonated, then it seems that the apparent binding constant of Na<sup>+</sup> to the proton would depend (in a non-linear fashion) on the pH. Could the authors expand along those lines?</p><p>2) The apparent K<sub>D</sub> at pH 8 is around 30 mM, around 280 mM at pH 4. How does that compare with functional measurements of a transporter in a fluid membrane (as opposed to a 2D crystal assembly)? This also raises an interesting question concerning the conformational states underlying the present data. A conformational change is observed as a function of Na<sup>+</sup> concentration. The 2D projection thus represents an ensemble average over a large ensemble of molecules. Experimentally, the conformational changes that are observed as a progressive effect of Na<sup>+</sup> could, therefore, reflect either a progressive change in the actual protein conformation itself, or a change in relative population of the two distinct conformational sodium-bound and sodium-unbound states. The latter seems reasonable, but it would be nice to make this point clearer on the basis of the present analysis.</p><p>3) While the results seem convincing, one is left unsure about the interpretation of the results obtained at pH 6. First, the authors conclude that sodium ions bind only very weakly (K<sub>D</sub> estimated at 500 mM) to the transporter at pH 6. Interestingly, even in the absence of sodium ions, the structures of the transporter are more similar at pH 4 and 8 than at pH 6. It would be essential for the authors to propose a specific model that could account for a bell-shaped pH dependence of the transporter properties, including affinity for sodium and, perhaps, structure. It is unclear what could be the origin of such dependence. Furthermore, it seems impossible, unless more than one proton binds to the protein.</p><p>4) The authors state that the lack of large pH-dependent structural changes is inconsistent with allosteric regulation by protons. However, such regulation may not require large structural changes. There is confusion about the concept of the “substrate inhibited state”. It seems that sodium-inhibited state may only occur if the cytoplasmic sodium concentration were high (above 300 mM at pH 4 or 30 mM at pH 8). Similarly, proton-inhibited state would only occur if the outside pH were low. In contrast, high extracellular Na and low cytoplasmic pH should not lead to inhibition. Collectively, the mechanistic origin and the physiological need for the bell-shaped pH dependence of sodium affinity and structure remained unclear.</p><p>5) The authors cite a recent paper that states that the reduction in activity in NhaA due to pH is simple competition between protons and Na<sup>+</sup>. There are issues with the implications for the results on NhaA. Some may disagree with this interpretation of the paper due to two factors: how can a change in three orders of magnitude in activity be observed when the concentration of a competing agent is changed by 1.5 pH units? Why do we find very close homologues of NhaA (50% and higher) that work nicely in acidic conditions? Can we assume that they have developed an entirely new mechanism?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01412.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) A striking result is the inconsistency with the concept of allosteric pH regulator.

Could the authors expand along those lines</italic>?</p><p>The projection maps indicate two different conformational states of the antiporter: one in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>, which looks similar at any pH between 4 and 8, and represents the apo or proton-bound state. The Na<sup>+</sup>-bound state is obtained at elevated Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations, and looks similar at pH4 and 8. At pH 4 and 8 MjNhaP1 is down-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</xref>) and therefore presumably more or less rigid. The projection maps are thus averages of an increasing number of molecules on the 2D crystal lattice in the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound state and a decreasing number in the apo state, as the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increases. The height of the difference peaks is then a direct measure of Na<sup>+</sup> affinity, and enables us to determine apparent binding constants for Na<sup>+</sup> in different pH regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The projection difference maps at pH 6 at elevated Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations are essentially also similar to those at pH 4 and 8, but the difference peaks are weaker and less distinct, suggesting that the helices are disordered. We ascribe this apparent disorder to the fact that at pH 6, where the antiporter is maximally active, the helices involved in ion translocation move rapidly and are trapped in a continuum of slightly different orientations when the 2D crystals are frozen in liquid nitrogen. In a projection map, which takes the average of all molecules on the 2D crystal lattice, the helices would then appear disordered, as observed. This is now discussed in the section ‘pH dependence of sodium binding in MjNhaP1’ of the revised manuscript. Under these conditions, the height of difference peaks is not a direct measure of Na<sup>+</sup> affinity, so that we cannot deduce an apparent binding constant from the difference peaks at pH 6. Accordingly, we have omitted the estimate of the binding constant at pH 6 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>Since we cannot measure the apparent K<sub>D</sub> for Na<sup>+</sup> at pH 6, we can also not compare it to the apparent K<sub>D</sub><sup>Na</sup> obtained at pH4 and pH 8. We therefore cannot say at this stage whether the pH dependence of the Na<sup>+</sup> binding affinity of MjNhaP1 is linear or non-linear (for example, bell-shaped).</p><p>By contrast, the pH dependence of the MjNhaP1 transport activity is indeed bell-shaped. We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hellmer et al., 2002</xref>) have shown that this antiporter is essentially inactive at pH 8. Down-regulation at acidic pH has not yet been shown experimentally (largely because there is no suitable pH-sensitive fluorescent dye), but follows from considerations of cell physiology, which indicate that the antiporter has to shut down at low pH (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</xref>). A shutdown at acidic and basic conditions is also a key feature of the simple kinetic model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mager et al. (2011)</xref> for NhaA that appears to hold equally well for MjNhaP1. By this model the antiporter is down-regulated at pH 4 due to competition of H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> for a common binding site, and at pH 8 due to proton depletion. Together, these two effects result in a bell-shaped pH dependence of transport activity.</p><p>The kinetic model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mager et al. (2011)</xref> also accounts for the observed 10-fold increase of the apparent K<sub>D</sub> for Na<sup>+</sup> from pH 8 to pH 4, which means that more Na<sup>+</sup> ions are needed to displace the protons from the common ion-binding site at increasing H<sup>+</sup> concentration. However, if Na<sup>+</sup> can displace H<sup>+</sup> and arrest the antiporter in a Na<sup>+</sup>-bound state at pH 4, the question arises why this does not also happen at pH 6, where the antiporter is fully active. The simplest explanation is that, in addition to substrate competition, the transport rate of MjNhaP1 is also modulated in some other way, for example by the protonation states of amino acid sidechains involved in ion binding and translocation that render the antiporter more flexible at pH 6 than at pH 4 or pH 8 (see also response to comment 4 below). This is now explained more clearly in the section ‘pH dependence of transport activity’ of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Any more detailed understanding of the mechanistic origin of the pH dependence in MjNhaP1 and related antiporters must await further kinetic and structural analysis. In particular a high-resolution structure of a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter that resolves the bound substrate ions and the residues involved in substrate binding and translocation is needed.</p><p><italic>2) The apparent K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> <italic>at pH 8 is around 30 mM, around 280 mM at pH 4. How does that compare with functional measurements of a transporter in a fluid membrane (as opposed to a 2D crystal assembly)</italic>?</p><p>As far as we are aware, there are no published kinetic data on MjNahP1. However, in collaboration with the group of Klaus Fendler at our institute we are conducting such measurements with solid-supported membranes that will be reported elsewhere. Initial results indicate a K<sub>D</sub><sup>Na+</sup> of 14 mM at high pH (extrapolated to an effective absence of protons). Considering the very different methods by which the binding constants were determined, this is in excellent agreement with the apparent K<sub>D</sub><sup>Na+</sup> of 30 mM at pH 8 reported here.</p><p><italic>This also raises an interesting question concerning the conformational states underlying the present data.

However, such regulation may not require large structural changes</italic>.</p><p>An allosteric pH regulator, also referred to as a pH sensor or H<sup>+</sup>-modifier, has been proposed for NhaA and NHE1. This pH sensor is thought to transform the antiporters from an active into an acid-locked state at low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aronson et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aronson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taglicht et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wakabayashi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Padan et al., 2009</xref>). In the case of NhaA this has been reported to involve conformational changes at the level of secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diab et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schushan et al., 2012</xref>). In MjNhaP1, we found no evidence of pH-induced secondary structure changes in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>. Instead, we find that Na<sup>+</sup> binding induces significant changes in helix arrangements in the 6-helix bundle. This does not rule out pH regulation by side chain rearrangements, as explained in the section ‘pH dependence of transport activity’ and Conclusions section of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>There is confusion about the concept of the “substrate inhibited state”.

See also response to comment 1 above.</p><p><italic>5) The authors cite a recent paper that states that the reduction in activity in NhaA due to pH is simple competition between protons and Na</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>.

First of all, NhaA is electrogenic, with a transport stoichiometry of 2 H<sup>+</sup> per 1 Na<sup>+</sup>, whereas MjNhaP1 is not. Thus, in the case of NhaA, at least two protonation events have to be considered, which are likely to both affect transport activity, perhaps in different ways.</p><p>Second, no one, ourselves included, knows by how much the transport activity of MjNhaP1 changes in response to pH, as this requires precise measurements of the transport rate, which have not been reported. Indeed, in the absence of other factors (such as allosteric regulation), a change by one pH unit can result in a change of activity by maximally one order of magnitude, since the transport activity can maximally increase by a factor of 10 if the substrate concentration rises 10-fold.</p><p>Note that the increase in NhaA transport activity by about three orders of magnitude reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taglicht et al. (1991)</xref> occurred in response to a change in 2, not 1.5 pH units (1.2 umol/min/mg at pH 6.5 to 2210 umol/min/mg at pH 8.5). Interestingly, similar measurements for NhaA reported 7 years later by the same group using the same methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rimon et al., 1998</xref>) found an activity increase of only about 2 orders of magnitude in response to a pH change of 2 units (10.2 nmol/mg/min at pH 6.5 to 1700 nmol/mg/min at pH 8.5).

(2011)</xref> found that a change in one pH unit increases the NhaA transport activity by about one order of magnitude, in line with their kinetic model. The change in activity of EcNhaA by three orders of magnitude in response to a pH shift by 2 units may thus be an overestimate.</p><p>As for MjNhaP1, no published data on the pH dependence of its transport rate are available at all. Experiments to determine this dependence are currently under way in our laboratory, but they go well beyond the scope of our present electron crystallographic study and will be reported elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Why do we find very close homologues of NhaA (50% and higher) that work nicely in acidic conditions? Can we assume that they have developed an entirely new mechanism</italic>?</p><p>We are not sure which NhaA homologues “that work nicely in acidic conditions” the referees are thinking of. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mager et al. (2011)</xref> showed that NhaA remains active at acidic conditions down to pH 5. They found that competition of H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> for the same binding site only occurs at lower pH at the Na<sup>+</sup> uptake side, whereas a decrease in pH on the opposite, Na-release side of the antiporter does not inhibit transport, as explained by their kinetic model. A shift in the pH profile can result simply from changes in binding affinity (for Na<sup>+</sup> or H<sup>+</sup>). This is demonstrated by the NhaA mutant G338S, which has an activity profile shifted by 1.8 pH units towards the acidic range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mager et al., 2011</xref>), and evidently does not require an entirely new mechanism.</p></body></sub-article></article>
