photoreceptors to transduce and transmit single-photon responses to the visual system. Small single-photon voltage changes must therefore cause detectable reductions in glutamate release. We found that rods achieve this by employing mechanisms that enhance release regularity and its sensitivity to small voltage changes. At the resting membrane potential in darkness, mouse rods exhibit coordinated and regularly timed multivesicular release events, each consisting of ~17 vesicles and occurring two to three times more regularly than predicted by Poisson statistics. Hyperpolarizing rods to mimic the voltage change produced by a single photon abruptly reduced the probability of multivesicular release nearly to zero with a rebound increase at stimulus offset. Simulations of these release dynamics indicate that this regularly timed, multivesicular release promotes transmission of single-photon responses to post-synaptic rod-bipolar cells. Furthermore, the mechanism is efficient, requiring lower overall release rates than uniquantal release governed by Poisson statistics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>scotopic vision</kwd><kwd>rod photoreceptor cell</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle release</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY10542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thoreson</surname><given-names>Wallace B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY32396</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thoreson</surname><given-names>Wallace B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008291</institution-id><institution>UNMC College of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hays</surname><given-names>Cassandra L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>To improve the reliability of transmitting small single-photon voltage responses, rod photoreceptor cells release synaptic vesicles in regularly timed multivesicular events that are exquisitely sensitive to small voltage changes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the most impressive features of the visual system is the ability to detect single photons. Pioneering psychophysical studies showed that humans can detect flashes consisting of a few photons hitting the retina, indicating that individual rods can respond to the absorption of single photons and then reliably signal these events to post-synaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlow, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hecht et al., 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakitt, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tinsley et al., 2016</xref>). The ability of rods to respond to single photons was subsequently confirmed by electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baylor et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gross et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reingruber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rieke and Baylor, 1998</xref>). In darkness, rods maintain a relatively depolarized membrane potential of around −40 mV, and the absorption of a photon produces a small hyperpolarization, between 1 and 3.5 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cangiano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hornstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1995</xref>). Rods signal the absorption of a photon to post-synaptic rod-bipolar cells by decreasing the rate of glutamate release. However, synaptic vesicle release is an intrinsically noisy process that is typically described by Poisson statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miki, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang and Peskin, 2015</xref>), posing a problem for post-synaptic bipolar cells to distinguish a genuine decrease in vesicle release caused by the absorption of a photon from a stochastic pause in vesicle release. How does the rod transform a small voltage change into a sufficiently large and reliable change in vesicle release?</p><p>One proposed solution is for a rod to maintain a high basal rate of vesicle release. Under the assumption of Poisson release, a rod would need to maintain a basal release rate of ~100 vesicles/s to generate a sufficiently reliable signal to distinguish single-photon responses from stochastic variability in vesicle release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rao-Mirotznik et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rao et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schein and Ahmad, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Rossum and Smith, 1998</xref>). This solution requires an extremely high turnover of vesicles that is energetically and physically demanding. Furthermore, measurements from salamander, gecko, and mouse rods show basal release rates of only 10–20 vesicles/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sheng et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A second proposed solution is to make release more regular than a Poisson process. For example, implementing an Erlang process that releases vesicles at regular intervals would reduce the likelihood of mistaking a stochastic decrease in vesicle release for the absorption of a photon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schein and Ahmad, 2005</xref>). Erlang events are generated by accumulating a certain number of Poisson events, which reduces interevent variability to regularize release. While Poisson statistics accurately describe vesicle release at many central synapses, this may not necessarily be true at the ribbon-style synapses in rods. Ribbons are plate-like, pre-synaptic structures that tether multiple vesicles along the surface and it has been suggested that delivery of vesicles down a ribbon may help to make release more regular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schein and Ahmad, 2005</xref>).</p><p>To identify how single-photon responses can be signaled by changes in vesicle release from rods, we recorded pre-synaptic anion currents associated with glutamate transporter activity in mouse rod terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays et al., 2020b</xref>). The glutamate transporters in rods (largely EAAT5) are linked to an uncoupled anion conductance, so that an anion channel opens as glutamate is retrieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arriza et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). Glutamate reuptake into rods continues even after post-synaptic mGluR6 receptors in rod-bipolar cells become saturated, suggesting that transporters are not saturated during rod release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasegawa et al., 2006</xref>). In that range, glutamate anion currents (I<sub>A(glu)</sub>) vary linearly with glutamate levels in the synaptic cleft and can thus provide a pre-synaptic measure of glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasegawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Otis and Jahr, 1998</xref>). Using these techniques, we observed stochastic release of individual vesicles that obeyed Poisson statistics when rods were voltage-clamped at −70 mV. However, at the typical resting membrane potential in darkness of −40 mV, release transitioned to regularly spaced multivesicular release events of ~17 vesicles apiece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays et al., 2020b</xref>). We found that the probability of initiating multivesicular release events was nearly abolished by a small membrane hyperpolarization similar to single-photon responses. A model of the empirically determined, voltage-dependent vesicle release dynamics combined with an ideal observer analysis reproduced the detection sensitivity of mouse rod-bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Field and Rieke, 2002a</xref>). These results show that regularly timed multivesicular release events in rods can enhance post-synaptic detection of small voltage changes evoked by the absorption of individual photons. Furthermore, this strategy is efficient, achieving greater sensitivity than Poisson release while requiring fewer vesicles per second.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To study voltage-dependent vesicular glutamate release from rods, we recorded I<sub>A(glu)</sub> from rods using flatmount mouse retina preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). When rods were held for many seconds at −60 or −70 mV, similar to the membrane potential achieved in bright light, we observed occasional inward currents arising from activation of glutamate transporters on the rod terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grassmeyer et al., 2019</xref>). As described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays et al., 2020b</xref>), these inward currents had waveforms typical of quantal post-synaptic currents but with a slow time course (10–90% rise time of 9–10 ms with decay time constants of ~40 ms). Spontaneous inward currents in rods voltage-clamped at −70 mV showed a unimodal amplitude distribution suggesting they consisted entirely of uniquantal events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The overall rate of release increased at depolarized membrane potentials but achieved a rate at room temperature of only 4–5 vesicles/s at −40 mV, similar to the membrane potential in darkness. As shown previously, release rates and I<sub>Ca</sub> were doubled by increasing the bath temperature to 35°C, attaining an average rate of ~11 v/s/ribbon at −40 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays et al., 2020b</xref>). Accompanying this increased rate of vesicle release was a switch to more coordinated forms of release with semi-regular multivesicular release events dominating release in rods held at −40 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Occasional unitary events were interspersed among these multivesicular events and so the overall distribution of event amplitudes measured at −40 mV was bimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays et al., 2020b</xref>), multivesicular release events involved the rapid sequential release of 10–20 vesicles triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and derived from a pool of ribbon-associated vesicles shared with evoked release.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The quantity of glutamate released measured by I<sub>A(glu)</sub> increased with depolarization but near −40 mv, release shifted from single vesicle fusion events to multivesicular release events consisting of 10–20 vesicles apiece.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative traces from a single rod clamped at various voltages.

Spontaneous release can arise from Ca<sup>2+ </sup>independent fusion events or from chance openings of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cork et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kavalali, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kavalali, 2020</xref>). The persistence of spontaneous events in rods held at −70 mV, even after blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with extracellular Cd<sup>2+</sup> or strongly buffering intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with 10 mM BAPTA, showed evidence for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays et al., 2020b</xref>). To analyze frequency distributions, only rods in which we observed &gt;50 events were included in the data set. The frequency distributions of interevent intervals for release events detected in rods voltage-clamped at −70 mV (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) consistently exhibited a single exponential decay as predicted for a Poisson release process (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97 ± 0.04, mean ± SD, n = 9 rods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Does Poisson release persist when Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release is engaged at more depolarized potentials? At the typical resting potential in darkness (−40 mV), we observed periodic multivesicular events along with occasional unitary events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Like those observed at −70 mV, the intervals between unitary events at −40 mV were well described by a single exponential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, filled squares, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90 ± 0.07, n = 9 rods), consistent with an underlying Poisson release process. However, if we treated each multivesicular event as an individual release event, histograms of interevent intervals could not be fit by single exponentials, suggesting that multivesicular events are not released by a Poisson process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, bars). It therefore appears that single and multivesicular release events emerge independently.</p><p>We estimated the number of vesicles released in each event by dividing the total charge transfer during each multivesicular event by the average charge transfer for unitary events measured at the same potential in the same cell. Glutamate transporter currents continue to increase even after saturation of post-synaptic mGluR6 receptors, indicating that transporters are not normally saturated during release from rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasegawa et al., 2006</xref>). This implies that the charge transfer for each I<sub>A(glu)</sub> vesicle release event should sum linearly. A Poisson distribution could not describe the frequency distribution of individual vesicle release events counted in this way. During each 1 s interval, there was either a multivesicular release event or no release event and so interevent intervals were distributed bimodally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The frequency distribution could not be fit with a Poisson model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 6</xref>), yielding negative R<sup>2</sup> values (−0.7 ± 0.6, n = 9) both when λ was unconstrained (λ = 2.5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and when λ was constrained to the actual mean number of events/s (λ = 11 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus, unlike unitary event statistics, the statistics of multivesicular release were not well described by a Poisson distribution.</p><p>Fitting the interevent intervals for multivesicular events with a Gaussian function yielded better fits (mean R<sup>2</sup> = 0.84 ± 0.12) than fitting with an exponential function. Interevent intervals averaged 2.34 ± 0.64 s (N = 16) with a coefficient of variation (CV) among these cells of 0.43 ± 0.09. For a Poisson distribution where variance = mean, the average mean intervals between multivesicular events in this sample of cells predicted a CV of 0.67. Narrowing the interval distribution is a characteristic of an Erlang distribution that waits a certain number of Poisson intervals before each Erlang event. The number of Poisson intervals, k, that occur before each Erlang event is related to the CV by the formula:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">k</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The intervals between multivesicular events were consistent with Erlang factors ranging from 3 to 12 and averaged k = 6.2 ± 3.12 (n = 16).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Impact of experimental conditions on statistics of multivesicular release</title><p>The conditions of our experiments differ from dark-adapted conditions in vivo. We therefore investigated how different aspects of these experiments might have impacted the observed release dynamics. We began by examining the impact of dark adaptation. During dark adaptation, ribbons can increase in length in mouse rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dembla et al., 2020</xref>) and bursts involve release from the pool of vesicles at the base of the ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays et al., 2020b</xref>). Thus, dark adaptation might influence the statistics of vesicle release. However, when holding dark-adapted rods at −40 mV, we found that the number of vesicles in each multivesicular release event (16.7 ± 5.8, n = 7) and the intervals between multivesicular event start times (2.0 ± 0.54 s, n = 6, room temperature) did not differ significantly from those measured in retinas prepared in the light (17 ± 7 v/burst, n = 22, p=0.74, unpaired t-test; 2.3 ± 0.64 s intervals, n = 16, p=0.34, unpaired t-test) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays et al., 2020b</xref>). Thus, recording from rods in light-adapted versus dark-adapted states did not strongly alter release statistics. One caveat is that in both light- and dark-adapted retinas, we mechanically removed outer segments to expose the inner segments and cell bodies prior to recording.</p><p>Next, we examined the potential impact of physiological rundown following membrane rupture by the patch pipette for voltage-clamping the rods. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, multivesicular events increased in amplitude during the first few minutes of recording as SCN<sup>−</sup> diffused into the rod from the patch pipette. There was also a decrease in multivesicular event frequency after patch rupture, presumably due to rundown of the release mechanism. When the intervals between multivesicular events were plotted against time after patch rupture, the slopes of the linear regressions were all significantly non-zero (n = 5 rods, room temperature). The y-intercept values averaged 1.23 ± 0.45 s, whereas the overall mean interval between multivesicular events in this sample averaged 2.26 s ± 0.60 s (n = 5, room temperature). This suggests that the interevent intervals present at patch rupture were roughly half the overall average interval between multivesicular release events yielding approximately twice the release rate.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Multivesicular events increased in amplitude and declined in frequency during recording.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Example traces recorded from the same rod held at −40 mV during the first minute (<bold>A</bold>) and after 5 min (<bold>B</bold>).

Due to more rapid rundown at higher temperatures, most of our recordings were performed at room temperature (~22°C). Elevating the bath temperature also significantly shortened release intervals, from 2.3 ± 0.64 s (N = 16) at room temperature to 1.13 ± 0.67 s (n = 5) at 35°C (p&lt;0.0001, unpaired t-test). While rundown was more rapid at 35°C, if we simply assume a similar amount of rundown as seen at room temperature, this suggests interevent intervals at 35°C as short as 615 ms (i.e., a frequency of 1.6 Hz). Alternatively, if we assume that the most rapid rates measured at 35°C come from the healthiest cells and are thus more representative of genuine rates in vivo, then interevent intervals one standard deviation below the mean of ~465 ms suggest a rate of 2.2 Hz. These various lines of reasoning converge on a spontaneous rate of multivesicular release events in darkness at physiological temperatures from intact mouse rods of ~2 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Multivesicular release is sensitive to small voltage changes</title><p>We examined the impact of small voltage changes on the probability of multivesicular release events from rods. We hypothesized that multivesicular release may play a role in transmitting single-photon responses from rods because multivesicular release occurred most prominently in rods near the typical membrane potential in darkness and was not observed in cones. In mouse rods, the voltage changes evoked by single-photon absorption average ~3.5 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cangiano et al., 2012</xref>). To test the sensitivity of multivesicular release to small voltage changes, we voltage-clamped the rod at –40 mV for 30 s and then applied a hyperpolarizing step to −43.5 mV. This small hyperpolarization consistently produced an appreciable pause in release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The average interevent intervals measured over a 30 s period at −43.5 mV (3744 ± 2243, 129 intervals) were significantly longer than those measured in the same cells at −40 mV (2405 ± 1430 ms, 279 intervals, p&lt;0.0001, unpaired t-test, n = 9 rods). In addition, the interval to the first multivesicular event observed after the step to −43.5 mV (red triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> show measurements from individual trials) was consistently greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean interevent intervals measured at −40 mV. Single-photon responses of primate rods appear be smaller than those of mouse rods, averaging only ~1 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1995</xref>).

This lengthening of release intervals could potentially improve the signaling of single-photon responses to post-synaptic bipolar cells, allowing genuine reductions in release caused by a photon to be distinguished from a stochastic fluctuation in release.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Multivesicular release was sensitive to small hyperpolarizing steps.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example trace showing that multivesicular I<sub>A(glu)</sub> release events paused for several seconds immediately after hyperpolarizing the rod from −40 to −43.5 mV and the overall rate of these events remained slower for the remainder of the step.

For the 2AFC task, one response was generated by simulating a flash of strength S delivered to a population of N rods. A second response was generated with no flash. The task of the ideal observer was to identify the response containing the flash. The ideal observer was constructed by calculating the optimal linear discriminant separating flash from no-flash trials in each individual rod. The dot product between this template, and each individual response was calculated and then weighted by the likelihood it was generated by the given flash strength (see Materials and methods). This procedure instantiates an optimal linear filtering of the rod output followed by an optimal non-linear weighting that approximates the non-linear threshold performed at the rod-to-rod-bipolar synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Field and Rieke, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Field et al., 2019</xref>). The fraction of trials in which the flash response was correctly identified was calculated over 400 trials at each flash strength; flash strengths ranged from 0.001 to 1.0 photo-isomerizations (Rh*) per rod.</p><p>For a simulated population of 24 rods, the probability of detecting flashes varied smoothly with flash strength, reaching 75% correct in the 2AFC task between 0.1 and 0.2 Rh*/rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, blue curve). This performance fell short of an optimal photon detector that is limited only by Poisson variability in the number of photons absorbed from trial-to-trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, dashed curve) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Field et al., 2019</xref>). However, flash detection performance compared well to previous measurements of rod-bipolar cell sensitivity, which place their detection threshold (75% correct in the 2AFC task) between 0.1 and 0.3 Rh*/rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, vertical gray bar) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Field and Rieke, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okawa et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the performance of the simulated rod output with temporally regular multivesicular release falls within the range of flash sensitivities demanded by rod-bipolar cell measurements. This indicates that the observed rod vesicle release dynamics can account for rod-bipolar cell flash sensitivity.</p><p>We next examined how this result depended on different choices of model parameters: while the chosen parameters were taken from our measurement of rod vesicle release (biased toward the earliest portion of the recordings and the highest temperatures), our recordings allow for a range of potential values under physiological conditions. We examined how detection performance depended on the multivesicular event rate (R<sub>s</sub>), the Erlang factor (E<sub>f</sub>), the rebound amplitude (A), the suppression time (T), the decay time (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), and the number of rods in the pool (N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J–O</xref>). In general, the detection threshold was not strongly impacted over a reasonable range of these model parameters: the flash strength generating 75% correct performance was consistent with the detection threshold of rod-bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J–O</xref>, gray bars).</p><p>Two features of this multivesicular release model distinguish it from previous examinations of rod vesicle release. The first feature is multivesicular release. Each multivesicular event contains ~17 vesicles. With a release rate of ~2 multivesicular events/s, this means the rod terminal will release ~34 vesicles/s. Thus, we analyzed how performance of the multivesicular release model compared with asynchronous Poisson release of 34 vesicles/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; Poisson release model, see Materials and methods). For comparison, we also included performance of an ideal detector and that predicted from the rod photocurrent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; rod photocurrent model, see Materials and methods). The temporally regular multivesicular release model exhibited higher sensitivity than asynchronous Poisson release, given a fixed vesicle budget of 34/s. Thus, the observed statistics of vesicle release from the rod terminal appear to be efficient relative to asynchronous release, given a fixed vesicle budget.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Temporally regular multivesicular release supports flash detection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of different models in 2AFC detection task.

The idea of temporally regular release has been postulated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schein and Ahmad, 2005</xref>), but not shown experimentally or considered in the context of multivesicular release. The temporal regularity of release is modeled here by the Erlang factor (E<sub>f</sub>), which reduces variability in the intervals between multivesicular events. Our data showed a reduction in interevent variability relative to a Poisson process, consistent with Erlang factors of 3–12 (average 6; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Examining detection thresholds as a function of the Erlang factor revealed that over a range of multivesicular release rates, detection thresholds fell considerably as the Erlang factor increased to four and Erlang factors greater than nine exhibited rapidly diminishing returns on detection thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Thus, further increasing the regularity of interevent intervals (increasing the Erlang factor above 9) yields relatively small improvements to the fidelity of transmitting single-photon responses to rod-bipolar cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To better understand how responses of rods to single photons can be transmitted reliably to downstream neurons, we examined the mechanisms by which ongoing release from rods can be regulated by small changes in membrane potential. Using I<sub>A(glu)</sub> as a presynaptic assay for release, we found that at a membrane potential similar to that in darkness, rods released glutamate-filled vesicles in coordinated multivesicular release events at rates that were not well modeled by Poisson statistics. Multivesicular events occurred at more regular intervals consistent with an Erlang distribution in which events occurred after waiting 3–12 Poisson intervals. Multivesicular release events were also extremely sensitive to small voltage changes. Simulating the impact of these properties on release showed that they can improve the ability of rod-bipolar cells to discriminate suppressed release caused by absorption of a single photon from stochastic pauses in release.</p><p>The ability of the vertebrate visual system to detect single photons arises from high photon capture rates combined with high gain in the phototransduction cascade of rods. Next, the relatively small changes in membrane voltage produced by absorption of a single photon must produce an appreciable change in the rate of release at the rod synapse. At the synapse from rods to rod-bipolar cell dendrites, there is a non-linear thresholding mechanism in which only responses that exceed a certain size are transmitted, removing baseline noise along with small responses that fall below that threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berntson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Field and Rieke, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sampath and Rieke, 2004</xref>).

In rabbit retina, where 100 rods may converge onto each rod-bipolar cell, as many as 90% of the single-photon responses are removed by the thresholding mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trexler et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, as many as 100,000 rods eventually converge onto a single ganglion cell, allowing the capture of scarce single photons to produce detectable changes in retinal output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Field et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodchild et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okawa and Sampath, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takeshita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor and Smith, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The modeling presented here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) does not strongly constrain the fraction of single-photon responses that fail to traverse the synapse with rod-bipolar cells. This is because these simulations did not incorporate variability in the voltage of the single-photon voltage response or fluctuations in the membrane potential due to continuous noise in phototransduction. Instead, the model began with the estimated dynamics of transmitter release during a simulated light flash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), bypassing these upstream noise sources. To understand how this mode of transmitter release impacts the optimal location of the non-linear threshold at the rod to rod-bipolar synapse would require incorporating noise in phototransduction and determining how this noise (both single-photon response variability and continuous noise) influences the observed temporal variability in multivesicular release events.</p><p>The non-linear thresholding mechanism used at rod-bipolar synapses is thought to occur before summation of rod responses in the rod-bipolar cell soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Field and Rieke, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sampath and Rieke, 2004</xref>). A key requirement for this non-linear thresholding is that glutamate levels in the cleft must be maintained at levels high enough to keep the rod-bipolar cell glutamate receptors saturated. By relieving saturation in the receptor signaling cascade, larger reductions in glutamate release have disproportionately larger effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sampath and Rieke, 2004</xref>). In addition to improving regularity, multivesicular release by rods may help ensure that glutamate levels remain high enough at individual synapses to maintain saturation in darkness.</p><p>AII amacrine cells show synchronized membrane currents in darkness that arise from synchronous rod inputs into rod-bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimes et al., 2014</xref>). Two rod-bipolar cell dendrites terminate beneath each rod ribbon in mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrens et al., 2016</xref>). Together with electrical coupling among rods via cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin et al., 2020</xref>), shared responses of two such bipolar cells evoked by large multivesicular release events might contribute to the synchrony among AII amacrine cells.</p><p>Our previous recordings of release from a sample of mouse rods suggested an overall rate of release at −40 mV of ~11 v/s at 35°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays et al., 2020b</xref>). However, assessments of rundown in the present study suggest that the true rate in vivo prior to patch rupture may be twice this average rate. Earlier computer simulations suggested that, assuming a purely Poisson release process, post-synaptic detection by rod-bipolar cells would require rod release rates of 80–100 v/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rao et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Rossum and Smith, 1998</xref>). Consistent with this conclusion, our model indicated that Poisson release at a rate of 34 v/s would not provide the level of performance observed in rod-bipolar cells unless we employed an unusually long suppression duration of 500 ms.</p><p>A second strategy suggested to overcome noise in release rates is to make release more regular. At hyperpolarized membrane potentials, we found that glutamate release from rods followed a Poisson distribution similar to that seen at many other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miki, 2019</xref>). This nearly ubiquitous feature of neurons was established in the 1950s by Bernard Katz who modeled spontaneous release events to develop the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kavalali, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kavalali, 2018</xref>). The occasional unitary events observed in rods held at −40 mV also showed a Poisson distribution of intervals. However, the dominant feature of release at −40 mV was the appearance of multivesicular release events occurring at fairly regular intervals. The distribution of intervals between multivesicular events could not be explained by Poisson statistics and were instead more consistent with an Erlang process, having a CV narrower than expected from a Poisson process. By waiting a specific number of Poisson intervals between each Erlang event, Erlang processes effectively average the underlying Poisson intervals and thereby reduce variability. It was suggested previously that an Erlang process might play a role in transmitting single-photon responses from rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schein and Ahmad, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schein and Ahmad, 2006</xref>). Our experimental data showed a narrower distribution than expected for a Poisson process consistent with the accumulation of as many as 12 Poisson events before each multivesicular release event. The cumulative wait times for replenishment of multiple vesicles to the releasable pool at the base of the synaptic ribbon provides a possible mechanism for achieving an Erlang-like process to enhance regularity in release rates. Predictions of Schein and Ahmad suggested that achieving reliable single-photon detection with a release rate of 100 v/s/ribbon would require an Erlang process with an Erlang factor of 66 (i.e., an accumulation of 66 Poisson intervals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schein and Ahmad, 2006</xref>). Our model, which among other things differed by including a thresholding non-linearity at the rod-to-rod bipolar cell synapse, showed that even a modest increase in regularity combined with multivesicular release can improve the post-synaptic detection of single-photon events.</p><p>Another surprising characteristic of the multivesicular release in rods was its sensitivity to small voltage changes. While the overall rate of release parallels changes in I<sub>Ca</sub>, a small hyperpolarizing voltage change caused appreciable pauses in release. The average interevent interval dropped close to zero during a simulated single-photon response, rather than declining only ~20–25% as predicted from the decline in I<sub>Ca</sub>. Hyperpolarizing the membrane by only 1 mV, similar to the amplitude of single-photon responses in primate rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1995</xref>), also caused an appreciable pause in release. The mechanisms that coordinate release among vesicles to produce this exquisite sensitivity remain unclear.</p><p>Recent studies on mice in which synaptic ribbons have been eliminated by deleting the key ribbon protein, Ribeye, showed surprisingly modest deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fairless et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Okawa et al., 2019</xref>) Multivesicular release in both salamander and mouse rods involves ribbon-associated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hays et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays et al., 2020b</xref>). One role of the ribbon may thus be to help organize vesicles to promote multivesicular release, implementing an Erlang process to improve the encoding of light responses near scotopic threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schein and Ahmad, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The need to rapidly recycle vesicles is a barrier to rods maintaining high release rates. Rod spherules in mouse retina possess 5800–7500 vesicles apiece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zampighi et al., 2011</xref>) and so the entire pool of vesicles would be depleted in roughly a minute if release were maintained at 100 vesicles/s.

of multi-vesicular release from mouse rod photoreceptors support transmission of single photon responses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>All three reviewers were extremely enthusiastic about the quality of the data and the impact of the findings. You are strongly encouraged to look at the suggestions from all three reviewers for clarifications. There is one major suggestions made by Reviewer #3 that it would be great for you to implement. After discussion amongst reviewers, all three felt it was an important suggestion but they trusted you would do it and that they didn't need to see the revision. Please let me know if this additional work on the simulations cannot be done for some reason.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Hays et al. studied synaptic transmission from rod photoreceptors in the mouse retina to address a fundamental question in visual neuroscience: how is the retina able to encode the absorption of a single photon? It is well known that rod photoreceptors can generate an electrical response to the absorption of a single photon and that, remarkably, the rod output can be transmitted reliably across multiple synapses in the retinal circuit to modulate action potential firing by retinal ganglion cells, the retinal output neurons; ultimately, the responses of individual ganglion cells to just a few photons absorbed by the entire population of retinal rods can generate visual percepts in human observers and drive visually-guided behavior in experimental animals. The ability of the retinal circuit to encode the absorption of single photons requires that it possess cellular and synaptic mechanisms to amplify very small neural signals and to reject noise generated by stochastic cellular and synaptic processes. Past work by Field and Rieke (2002) and Sampath and Rieke (2004) demonstrated a thresholding mechanism in the rod bipolar cells postsynaptic to the rods that rejects noise and enhances the reliability of signaling at the rod-rod bipolar cell synapse in the mouse retina. Here, Hays et al. show that multi-vesicular release occurring at a regular interval from the rod terminal provides a reliable signal to the postsynaptic thresholding mechanism to optimize signal detection.</p><p>The strength of this study is the combination of experiment and computation. Experimentally, the authors use electrophysiological recordings of glutamate transporter currents from single rods to demonstrate that large, multivesicular release events from rod presynaptic active zones occur at regular intervals described by a an Erlang distribution and, remarkably, that hyperpolarization of the rod by just about 3 mV-the hyperpolarization induced by the absorption of a single photon-causes a reliable and periodic cessation in multivesicular release. Computationally, the authors implement an ideal observer model to demonstrate that regular multivesicular release provides an optimal input to the rod bipolar cell.</p><p>There are no significant weaknesses to this study. One must acknowledge, as the authors do, the limitations of the electrophysiological recordings: namely, time-dependent changes in the rate and size of the transporter currents reflecting recording-induced changes in the presynaptic release process. Concern about this so-called run-down is mitigated by the authors' ability to modulate release using physiological stimuli (e.g. Figures 4-6); significant degradation of presynaptic active zone function would not permit this.</p><p>In summary, this is an absolutely fantastic study that provides what should be a final answer to a long-standing and vexing question: how is transmission at the rod-rod bipolar synapse optimized to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio in the encoding of retinal responses to single photons?</p><p>I have no recommendations: this is one of the best submitted manuscripts that I have reviewed in many years. I will note that a reference to Field et al. on line 458 is missing the year. I do have some mild concerns about the run-down of the transporter currents, but this effect is unavoidable and addressed by the authors. I do wonder how sensitive the multivesicular release process is to local and global changes in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], but this is a topic for another study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors take advantage of glutamate anion currents (IA(glu)) on rod photoreceptors to monitor their neurotransmitter release kinetics. While rods can sense single photons, the synaptic mechanisms underlying this sensitivity has been poorly understood. The authors propose that while at low membrane potentials rods release glutamate tonically in a quantal manner, depolarization to near physiological potentials (~-40mV) and enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations result in an increase in propensity of multivesicular release leading to emergence of a pulsatile form of release. Under these conditions, even mild hyperpolarizations elicit rapid suppression of multivesicular release and thus robustly reflect single photon responses in the neurotransmitter release output.</p><p>The authors should provide further clarification to the following issues prior to publication:</p><p>1. The authors indicate that anionic currents associated with presynaptic glutamate transport vary linearly with glutamate levels in the synaptic cleft. However, a close examination of the cited work (Hasegawa et al., 2006; Otis and Jahr, 1998) reveal several non-linear regions in the glutamate – IA(glu) dose response. Therefore, the authors should provide further evidence for linearity and ensure that their measurements (especially the large multivesicular events) are indeed within the linear region of detection.</p><p>2. In the manuscript, it is not clearly stated whether the resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent release is independent of the multivesicular release seen at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In my reading, the data suggests that the baseline Poisson process persists even at higher membrane potentials while the multivesicular release process emerges independently. Or do the authors think the two forms of release (univesicular and multivesicular) have the same origin? Further clarification of this issue will be useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>It has long been known that dark-adapted humans can detect just a handful of photons in a small region of the retina. This finding requires low noise in synaptic transmission. This paper addresses the question on how single photons arising in rods can be transmitted with high fidelity through the first retinal synapse. There has been a major gap in our understanding on the precise nature of glutamate release dynamics in this synapse and on how this synapse allows the transmission of single-photon signals with such a high precision. This paper characterizes glutamate release statistics presynaptically by careful single-cell electrophysiological recordings and shows that high-fidelity encoding of single-photon responses arises from regularly timed multivesicular release events that lead to less variance in inter-event interval than a conventional Poisson process. This paper is the first one providing evidence that tightly controlled multi-vesicular glutamate release statistics in rod photoreceptors is the key for mediating single-photon responses. Thereby this manuscript is of high interest to a wide audience in neuroscience.</p><p>I have only one major comment for the authors.</p><p>There has been debate on the precise amount of single-photon responses eliminated by the nonlinear thresholding in between rods and rod bipolar cells in the mouse retina. This amount depends on the set point of the thresholding in this synapse and thereby the model parameters used in the analysis presented in Figure 7 in this paper. The authors explore the impact of multiple factors in their simulation model but not this important issue. It would be important to analyze the impact of the setpoint of the nonlinearity in the modeling approach.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67446.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The authors should provide further clarification to the following issues prior to publication:</p><p>1.

The thresholding nonlinearity described in previous work has been related to the (analog) amplitude of the single photon response. Some work argues that the location of the threshold is slightly above the mean single photon response, so that fewer than half of the single photon responses make it past the nonlinearity (e.g. Field and Rieke 2002). Other work has argued that it is slightly below the mean single photon response (e.g. Bernston, Smith and Taylor, 2004) indicating that a bit more than half of the single photon responses traverse the synapse. It is also worth noting, that the locations of the nonlinearity relative to the single-photon response amplitude is almost certainly very species-dependent, as different species have different signal-to-noise ratios for their single-photon responses (Field and Rieke 2002; Trexler Casti and Zhang 2011; Field, Uzzell, Chichilnisky, and Rieke 2019).</p><p>Notice, however, that our study indicates that the output of the rod synapse translates the analog photocurrent (or photovoltage) into what is effectively a digital code of multi-vesicular release events. This analog to digital conversion is certainly a part of the ‘nonlinearity’ described in previous studies but determining how much it contributes to the thresholding at this synapse is challenging. This is because it requires understand how small fluctuations in the amplitude of the photocurrent are related to temporal variability in transmitter release. This would effectively require simultaneous photocurrent (or photovoltage) measurements with measurements of the glutamate transporter currents, and/or a full biophysical model of the rod that relates noise in the membrane voltage to variability in multi-vesicular release events. Notice that the model in Figure 7 doesn’t model the photocurrent (or photovoltage); instead, it begins with a model of the dynamics of transmitter release (see Figure 7B) and only models the observed variability in transmitter release dynamics. While understanding precisely how this analog-to-digital conversion contributes to the thresholding nonlinearity between rods and rod-bipolar cells is certainly interesting, we consider this to be beyond the scope of this study. However, we now explicitly acknowledge this issue and limitation in a new paragraph in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
