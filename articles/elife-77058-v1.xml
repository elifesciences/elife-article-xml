Here, we use dotplots and dimensionality reduction to systematically define LCR type/copy relationships and create a map of LCR sequence space capable of integrating LCR features and functions. By defining LCR relationships across the proteome, we provide insight into how LCR type and copy number contribute to higher order assemblies, such as the importance of K-rich LCR copy number for assembly of the nucleolar protein RPA43 in vivo and in vitro. With LCR maps, we reveal the underlying structure of LCR sequence space, and relate differential occupancy in this space to the conservation and emergence of higher order assemblies, including the metazoan extracellular matrix and plant cell wall. Together, LCR relationships and maps uncover and identify scaffold-client relationships among E-rich LCR-containing proteins in the nucleolus, and revealed previously undescribed regions of LCR sequence space with signatures of higher order assemblies, including a teleost-specific T/H-rich sequence space. Thus, this unified view of LCRs enables discovery of how LCRs encode higher order assemblies of organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sequence space</kwd><kwd>biological assembly</kwd><kwd>multivalent proteins</kwd><kwd>proteome</kwd><kwd>low complexity region</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>C. elegans</kwd><kwd>M. musculus</kwd><kwd>L. oculatus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM142634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calo</surname><given-names>Eliezer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ludwig Center for Molecular Oncology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaberi-Lashkari</surname><given-names>Nima</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Byron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calo</surname><given-names>Eliezer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-CA14051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calo</surname><given-names>Eliezer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Disparate functions of low complexity regions of proteins can be understood through a global view of their sequences, features, and relationships across different organisms and biological contexts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Low complexity regions (LCRs) of proteins, sequences that frequently repeat the same amino acids (e.g. 'AAAAAAA' or 'LLQLLLSLL'), are abundant in proteomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DePristo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huntley and Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haerty and Golding, 2010</xref>). Yet, despite their abundance, we only understand the functions of a small fraction of these LCRs. These contiguous regions of low sequence entropy are found in proteins which play a role in many different biological processes such as transcription, stress response, and extracellular structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coletta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cascarina and Ross, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mier et al., 2020</xref>). The role of LCRs in processes across such disparate fields of biology has made it a challenge to understand how LCR features can give rise to these seemingly different functions.</p><p>More recently, some LCR-containing proteins have been shown to direct the higher order assembly of intracellular membraneless bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). In identifying features of LCRs important for these assemblies, work in this field has begun to provide more general insight into how LCRs can encode their disparate functions. Experimental approaches, such as NMR and SAXS, have found examples where specific residues are required for the intermolecular interactions responsible for higher order assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin et al., 2020</xref>). Computational identification of short linear motifs (SLiMs) have cataloged specific sub-sequences in LCRs which mediate certain interactions and post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krystkowiak and Davey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>), and biophysical predictions of LCRs have given insight into how certain physical properties may direct self-assembly of large compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das and Pappu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin et al., 2020</xref>). Valency, defined by the number of binding sites in a molecule, facilitates the formation of higher order assemblies through interactions between multivalent scaffold proteins, which recruit low-valency clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banani et al., 2016</xref>). Valency can be encoded in any type of sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banani et al., 2017</xref>), yet it has only been studied in a few LCRs.</p><p>Numerous proteins have multiple LCRs, and the sequence relationships between these LCRs can impact protein function and higher order assembly. Recent work has shown that in proteins with multiple LCRs, the contributions of individual LCRs on protein function can depend on their identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hebert and Matera, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitrea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Synthetic systems have shown that multiple copies of the same LCR can increase the valency of a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schuster et al., 2018</xref>). However, the extent to which multiple copies of compositionally similar LCRs contribute to valency in natural proteins has not been broadly studied. Furthermore, studies of proteins with compositionally distinct LCRs have shown that they can differentially contribute to the function of the protein, likely through their abilities to interact with different sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hebert and Matera, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitrea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the copy number and type of LCRs in proteins has large effects on their function for the few types of LCRs where they have been molecularly studied. The fact that copy number and type are not defined by a specific sequence means that they may have more general importance for the functions of LCR-containing proteins.</p><p>More broadly, the importance of LCR features and relationships discussed above is not restricted to proteins of intracellular higher order assemblies. Structural assemblies such as the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forgacs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rauscher and Pomès, 2017</xref>), spider silk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xu and Lewis, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hinman and Lewis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malay, 2020</xref>), and the siliceous skeleton of certain sponges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shimizu et al., 2015</xref>) are comprised of proteins which share features with proteins involved in intracellular assemblies, such as multivalent scaffolding proteins abundant in LCRs. In fact, many of the proteins comprising these assemblies are composed almost entirely of LCRs which are known to mediate multivalent interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rauscher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malay, 2020</xref>), suggesting that the contribution of LCRs to valency and hierarchical assembly also play a role in these diverse extracellular assemblies. While the functions of LCRs are disparate, these examples illustrate that many of these functions are a consequence of their ability to assemble. Thus, the features of LCRs discussed above which mediate their higher order assembly may more generally underlie the functions of LCRs across different organisms and biological contexts.</p><p>We sought to approach this hypothesis by asking if a holistic approach for studying LCRs which incorporates their sequences, features, and relationships would provide a unified view of LCR function. Given that LCRs are required for such diverse assemblies, how diverse are the sequences of natural LCRs, especially given their low sequence complexity? How do the sequences, biophysical properties, copy number and type of LCRs relate to their roles in the higher order assemblies they form? Can a unified view of LCRs reveal detailed insights into how specific LCRs contribute to higher order assemblies, and provide a broader understanding of LCR sequences and their disparate functions across species?</p><p>Here, we use systematic dotplot analysis to provide a comprehensive, unified view of LCRs which spans from single proteins to multiple proteomes. Our approach defined LCR type and copy number across the proteome, allowing us to determine the importance of LCR copy number for the higher order assembly of RPA43 in the nucleolus. Furthermore, using dimensionality reduction, we provide a complete view of LCR sequence space and highlight the continuum of sequences in which natural LCRs exist. We uncover the prevalence of E-rich LCR sequences among human nucleolar proteins and use LCR copy number analyses and LCR maps to identify E-rich LCR-containing proteins which act as scaffolds or clients in the nucleolus. To understand the relationship between LCR sequence and higher order assemblies more broadly, we applied our approach to the proteomes of several species, and found that conservation and emergence of higher order assemblies is reflected in occupancy of LCR sequence space. Together, the principles we learned allowed us to discover a teleost-specific, T/H-rich region of LCR sequence space with signatures of higher order assemblies. Through this unified view, our understanding of LCRs can expand beyond isolated features or functions, enabling further study of how LCRs, and the higher order assemblies they make up, function in organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dotplots reveal the presence and organization of LCRs in proteins</title><p>To gain a view of LCRs and their relationships, we leveraged the dotplot matrix method of sequence comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibbs, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pearson and Lipman, 1988</xref>). In self-comparison dotplots, every position in the protein sequence is compared to every other position in the protein in a 2D-matrix. Any position where the two corresponding amino acids are identical is assigned a dot, while non-matching positions are not. Self-comparison dotplots are symmetrical across the diagonal, which represents the comparison of each position in the protein to itself. Within an LCR, the frequent recurrence of amino acids leads to many dots, which appear as a dense square region centered on the diagonal. Moreover, for proteins with multiple LCRs, compositionally similar LCRs will result in dense square regions off of the diagonal in the position corresponding to the intersection of both LCRs, but different LCRs will not intersect in this way. Therefore, dotplots are capable of identifying LCRs in proteins and revealing the relationships between similar and distinct LCRs for proteins with multiple LCRs.</p><p>For example, in the dotplot of G3BP1, a protein important for stress granule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), the dense squares along the diagonal clearly distinguish between the LCRs of G3BP1 and its other regions, which include its RNA-recognition motif (RRM) and dimerization domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, dotted black outlines). Immediately apparent from the dotplot of G3BP1 is that its LCRs are not all the same type as dense squares do not occupy every intersection off the diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, green and red arrows). The dotplot reveals that G3BP1 has LCR relationships where two LCRs are similar to each other (LCR1 and 2) and distinct from a third LCR (LCR3). Previous studies have shown that the presence of these compositionally distinct LCRs are critical for the ability of G3BP1 to form stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). The acidic LCRs (LCR1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) interact with and inhibit the RGG domain (containing LCR3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) which plays a role in RNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2019a</xref>), a necessary step of stress granule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, LCR relationships, which can be identified by dotplots, can be functionally important. While the importance of the LCR relationships in G3BP1 has already been studied, dotplots can be used to identify LCR relationships for any protein. By applying dotplots broadly, we can begin to ask more general questions about how patterns of LCR relationships may contribute to protein function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A systematic dotplot approach to reveal the relationships between low complexity regions (LCRs) in proteins.</title><p>For all dotplots, the protein sequence lies from N-terminus to C-terminus from top to bottom, and left to right.

For example, ACTB and SYTC lack LCRs, which is reflected by the lack of dense squares in their respective dotplots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Other examples, such as SMN, a component of nuclear gems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu and Dreyfuss, 1996</xref>), and the nucleolar protein KNOP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grasberger and Bell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larsson et al., 1999</xref>) have more complex architectures, with multiple copies of similar LCRs, which appear with roughly equal spacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).

For example, the dotplot of SRRM2 contains multiple regions of low complexity which cover an area corresponding to hundreds of amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). SRRM2 and another LCR-containing protein SON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>) were recently found to act as essential scaffolds for formation of nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that proteins which each contain long stretches of similar LCR sequences could play important roles in certain higher order assemblies. In fact, many such proteins have been found to be essential for various higher order assemblies. These include UBP2L and PRC2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>), which were only recently discovered to be essential for the formation of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Youn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Other proteins with long stretches of similar LCR sequences included mucins (MUC5A shown, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), collagens and DSPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>), proteins which are essential to the formation of extracellular assemblies with a diverse variety of physical properties. Mucins are key components of mucus, a liquid/gel-like assembly of glycoproteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lai et al., 2009</xref>), while DSPP codes for a protein which scaffolds the mineralization of teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stetler-Stevenson and Veis, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saito et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sreenath et al., 2003</xref>). Although proteins which each contain such long stretches of similar LCRs, such as SRRM2, UBP2L, MUCIN5A, and DSPP, are involved in such diverse biological processes, a commonality among them is their scaffolding roles. The fact that these proteins exhibit similar LCR relationships and roles in their respective assemblies suggests that the LCR relationships revealed by dotplots can inform our understanding of protein functions.</p><p>The examples discussed above highlight the utility of dotplots in revealing LCR relationships, and raise the possibility that LCR type and copy number may play a broader role in influencing protein function. However, these features of LCRs have not been globally assessed. While several methods exist for identifying LCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wootton and Federhen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Promponas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alba et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison, 2017</xref>), these methods do not determine LCR relationships such as type and the respective copy numbers of these types. The ability of dotplots to both identify LCRs and provide information on LCR type and copy number presents an opportunity to develop a comprehensive and systematic tool to identify and understand these features of proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A systematic dotplot approach to identify and characterize LCRs proteome-wide</title><p>We developed a computational pipeline to extract both the positions and spatial relationships of LCRs using the 2D signature of LCRs in dotplots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, Materials and methods).</p><p>Specifically, we computationally extracted the LCRs of any protein by identifying high density regions in its dotplot through classic image processing methods, such as kernel convolution, thresholding, and segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To identify high-density regions in dotplots, we performed kernel convolution on the dotplots with a uniform 10x10 kernel, which calculates a convolved pixel intensity value from 0 to 100 based on the number of dots in that window. Regions of high density will have higher convolved pixel intensities, while regions of low density will have lower convolved pixel intensities.</p><p>In order to define LCRs in the proteome, we employed a false discovery rate (FDR)-based approach to threshold the convolved pixel intensities. For a given proteome, we generated a background model by simulating an equally sized, length-matched ‘null proteome’, whose sequences were generated from a uniform amino acid distribution (see Materials and methods and Appendix 1 for details). We compared the distribution of convolved pixel intensities across all proteins in the real proteome with those from the null proteome and identified the lowest convolved pixel intensity threshold which satisfied a stringent FDR of 0.002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). This threshold, which was chosen to maximize the number of called LCRs called while minimizing entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>), was then applied to every protein in the human proteome to segment high-density regions in all dotplots. The segmented regions along the diagonal correspond to LCRs, while segmented regions off of the diagonal correspond to compositionally similar LCRs within the same protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We illustrate this process for Coilin, a scaffolding protein of Cajal bodies in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), where dense regions in its dotplot are extracted by our systematic approach.</p><p>Across the human proteome, our approach identified 37,342 LCRs in 14,156 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), with nearly 60% of LCR-containing proteins in the human proteome containing more than one LCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). The Shannon entropy of these regions was significantly lower than that of randomly sampled sequences from the proteome, confirming that they are low complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Furthermore, we observe an inverse relationship between the convolved pixel intensity threshold used for segmentation and the resulting Shannon entropy of called LCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The tight relationship between these values shows that, in general, the density of points in dotplots is inversely related to the informational complexity of the corresponding sequence.</p><p>Finally, when compared to two commonly used LCR-callers, SEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wootton and Federhen, 1993</xref>) and fLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison, 2017</xref>), our approach achieves a comparable performance in minimizing LCR entropy while maximizing total LCR sequence in the human proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). Furthermore, we call LCRs in regions of proteins similar to those called by other methods, as can be seen for CO1A1 and ZN579 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E, F</xref>). While other approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wootton and Federhen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison, 2017</xref>) are more efficient at identifying the presence of LCRs, our approach allows for proteome-wide identification of LCRs while simultaneously extracting information about LCR type and copy number within proteins. Thus, by making 2D comparisons of LCRs within proteins across the proteome, our systematic dotplot approach provides additional information on the relationship between LCRs within proteins, allowing us to ask deeper questions about the role of these features in protein function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparison of LCRs defines type and copy number of LCRs across the proteome</title><p>The relationship between LCRs within LCR-containing proteins has not been studied on a proteome-wide scale, despite being important in the cases where it has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hebert and Matera, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitrea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). To this end, we compared all LCRs within each protein for the human proteome. The relationship between two LCRs in a protein is determined by whether or not a segmented region of the dotplot exists off the diagonal in the region corresponding to the intersection of those two LCRs. If so, we designate these two LCRs as the same ‘type’ (green boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, also see Materials and methods). The relationships between LCRs can be summarized as a graph where each LCR is a node, off-diagonal intersections between pairs of LCRs are represented as edges, and connected components are LCRs of the same type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, also see Materials and methods). This graph-based visualization is helpful for seeing complex LCR relationships within proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), and the potential valency provided by LCRs to natural proteins.</p><p>Our approach for calling LCR type and copy number is illustrated for numerous examples with a range of different types and copy numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). For Coilin, we identify 4 distinct types of LCRs, with one of the types present in two copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Of these four types, two of them have been shown to play different roles in Coilin localization to cajal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hebert and Matera, 2000</xref>), showing that our systematic dotplot approach can distinguish LCR types and that these types can have different functions.</p><p>We can see from comparing the number of total and distinct LCRs across proteins in the human proteome that the range in combinations of LCRs is diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), enabling different functions.

Since all of the LCRs for a given protein in this group are the same, this group is particularly useful for understanding the contribution of LCR copy number to the function of a protein. The multiple-distinct group lies along the diagonal, and corresponds to proteins with multiple LCRs, all of which are distinct from each other. This group allows for in-depth study of the relationships between different LCRs. Finally, the multiple-mixed group, which lies between the bounds of multiple-same and multiple-distinct groups, likely corresponds to more complex proteins which may be affected by both the copy number and type of LCRs they contain. By characterizing the copy number and type of LCRs across the proteome, our approach allows for proteins to be selected on the basis of these features for further study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>LCR copy number impacts protein function</title><p>The group of proteins which have multiple LCRs of the same type presents an opportunity to specifically understand the role of LCR copy number in natural proteins. To highlight how these groups could inform us on LCR function, we sought to study the role of LCR copy number on higher order assembly by studying a protein in the ‘multiple same’ group.</p><p>Within the 'multiple same' group, we chose to study the RNA Polymerase I component RPA43 because it localizes to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cannon et al., 2008</xref>), a multi-component higher order assembly. From our analysis, we found that RPA43 has three LCRs in its C-terminus which are all the same type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). To understand the common sequences in this LCR type, we manually checked the sequences determined by our systematic analysis. All three LCRs of RPA43 contained a 10–12 amino acid block of mostly K-residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>, bottom row), which were the primary contributor to off-diagonal intersections between these LCRs and thus defined this LCR type. We chose to focus on the sequences in its three LCRs which make them the same type, the blocks of K-residues. We will refer to these K-rich blocks as K-rich LCRs of RPA43 (K1, K2, and K3 respectively).</p><p>While GFP-fused WT RPA43 localized correctly to the fibrillar center of the nucleolus, deletion of all three of its K-rich LCRs (ΔK1,2,3) led to its exclusion from the nucleolus, confirming that these LCRs are important for its higher order assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The fact that all of the LCRs of RPA43 are the same type, and that they together are required for nucleolar integration allows us to specifically study the role of LCR copy number in RPA43 higher order assembly.</p><p>We next generated all possible RPA43 mutants lacking one or more of its LCRs. Surprisingly, RPA43 mutants with two copies of its LCRs correctly localized to the nucleolus, while those containing only one of its LCRs were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This result held true regardless of what combination of LCRs were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In fact, two of the three double mutants were strongly excluded from the nucleolus, showing that these LCRs do not uniquely contribute to RPA43 localization. Rather, it is a copy number of at least 2 of these LCRs which is required for RPA43 integration into the nucleolus.</p><p>Consistent with these results, while the recombinant GFP-fused RPA43 C-terminus phase separated into liquid droplets in vitro, the GFP-fused RPA43 C-terminus with its three K-rich LCRs specifically deleted did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, the RPA43 C-terminus contains the sequences sufficient for higher order assembly, and the K-rich LCRs are necessary for this assembly. This result suggests that the K-rich LCRs are not merely linkers between other self-interacting elements, as deletion of such linkers tends to alter the physical properties of the assembly but not its presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin et al., 2020</xref>). Rather, our results suggest that these K-rich LCRs participate in intermolecular interactions, and that K-rich LCR copy number may more generally contribute to protein valency. Moreover, the observation that in vivo nucleolar localization and in vitro phase separation of RPA43 require the same sequences suggest that the ability of K-rich LCRs to form higher order assemblies underlie both of these processes. Together, these results show that our approach allows for targeted experiments to understand how LCR copy number affects protein function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A map of LCRs</title><p>In order to understand the disparate functions of LCRs across the proteome, we wanted to understand the full breadth of LCR sequences.

These clusters serve as useful guides when referring to different regions of the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). While most clusters correspond to LCRs with large contributions from a single amino acid, these clusters still have a substantial presence of many other amino acids. For example, the serine-rich cluster has regions within it that are also enriched for other amino acids in addition to serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Nuclear speckle proteins, which are commonly localized by LCRs known as RS-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cáceres et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucher et al., 2001</xref>), primarily populated a bridge between the R and S clusters in LCR sequence space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and were significantly enriched in both of these amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). LCRs of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins were heavily concentrated in a G/P-rich region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>), reflecting the many, long collagen proteins in humans. LCRs of nucleolar proteins largely mapped to the K-rich and E-rich clusters in LCR sequence space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and G</xref>), consistent with nucleolar localization signals possessing K-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scott et al., 2010</xref>). Other higher order assemblies also had biased occupancy of specific regions in the LCR sequence space, including the centrosome and nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for each of the 20 amino acids confirmed that these spatial biases in the LCR map corresponded to actual differences in LCR composition, independent of the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E, F</xref>). Conversely, some higher order assemblies are known to not have many individual proteins which share a specific LCR composition, including stress granules for which RNA is a major contributor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>), and PML bodies which depend on SUMOylation of non-LC sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 2006</xref>). As expected for these cases, there was neither a spatial bias in the LCR map, nor statistically significant enriched amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C, D, G, H</xref>).</p><p>The ability of the map to highlight the biased LCR compositions of certain higher order assemblies demonstrates that we can capture how differences in sequence correspond to known differences in function.

Of the 319 LCR-containing nucleolar proteins, 137 had at least one E-enriched LCR. Moreover, the distribution of total vs distinct LCRs of nucleolar proteins containing E-enriched LCRs showed that many of these proteins were of the multiple-mixed type, with some even reaching 22 total LCRs across four distinct LCR types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). From this analysis, we hypothesized that the nucleolar proteins with many E-rich LCRs act as scaffolds, while those with few E-rich LCRs act as clients.</p><p>Among proteins with E-enriched LCRs, we chose TCOF as a candidate scaffold because it contained the most E-enriched LCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and was a multiple-mixed protein high in total LCRs but low in distinct LCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Two of these LCRs were K-rich LCRs in the C-terminus of TCOF, similar to the homopolymeric stretches we observed in RPA43. Moreover, TCOF has a striking pattern of several evenly spaced E-rich LCRs which make up 15/22 of its LCRs, as illustrated by its dotplot and UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). TCOF normally localizes to the nucleolus, as indicated by the nucleolar marker Fibrillarin and Hoechst-negative regions surrounded by heterochromatin (upper row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To test if TCOF is a scaffold, we wanted to assess its ability to assemble outside of the nucleolus. To attempt this, we deleted the K-rich sequences in the C-terminus of TCOF (TCOF ΔK, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). If TCOF is indeed a scaffold and this scaffolding property is mediated by its E-rich LCRs, then this region of TCOF may be sufficient for assembly in the nucleoplasm. When expressed in cells, TCOF ΔK forms assemblies similar in size and shape to WT TCOF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, green channel). However, when assessed both by Fibrillarin costaining and heterochromatin-surrounded Hoechst-negative regions, TCOF ΔK was able to form assemblies outside of the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), showing that the region of TCOF containing its E-rich LCRs is sufficient for assembly.</p><p>The observation that TCOF ΔK is sufficient to form assemblies allowed us to further test if nucleolar proteins with a low number of E-enriched LCRs are recruited to these assemblies as clients. We chose to assess UBF1 and RPA1, which from our analysis have 1 and 2 E-enriched LCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), respectively, and are both key nucleolar proteins. RPA1 (also known as POLR1A) is a core subunit of RNA polymerase I, which synthesizes rRNA, and UBF1 is a key transcription factor facilitating Pol I transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 1988</xref>). Both RPA1 and UBF1 colocalize with WT TCOF in the nucleolus (upper row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). When we assessed the localization of RPA1 and UBF1 in cells expressing TCOF ΔK, we observed that both of these proteins now colocalized with TCOF ΔK. Moreover, the enrichment of RPA1, which contains two E-rich LCRs, in TCOF ΔK assemblies appears greater than enrichment of UBF1, which contains one E-rich LCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These results show that a protein with many E-rich LCRs (TCOF) is a scaffold, and that proteins with few E-rich LCRs act as clients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>More broadly, these results suggest that there are signatures of scaffold and client proteins of higher order assemblies in their LCR copy numbers, and that by looking for these signatures, we can discover previously unappreciated scaffolds and their respective clients. Thus, a unified view of LCRs allows us to uncover the scaffold-client architecture of a higher order assembly and provides a framework for understanding of the role of LCRs in other regions of sequence space.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>An expanded map of LCRs across species</title><p>The true breadth of LCR functions is not captured in any single species. The relationship between regions of LCR space and higher order assemblies raises several questions about whether a unified view of LCRs can more generally relate the functions of LCRs across species. In species where the existence of a given assembly such as the nucleolus is conserved, is occupancy of the sequence space also conserved? Similarly, does emergence of a certain higher order assembly across evolution such as the extracellular matrix correlate with the occupancy of a certain region of sequence space? Conversely, many species have distinct higher order assemblies with different functions and physical properties from those in humans, such as plants and fungal cell walls. Do these assemblies occupy a distinct region of sequence space, or do they use a sequence space that is occupied in humans?</p><p>To answer these questions, we wanted to capture the entire breadth of LCR sequence space across species, so that we could concurrently compare how different species occupy this sequence space.

Similarly, when comparing between speckle annotations for <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, we found that the R/S-rich bridge between the R-rich and S-rich clusters was occupied for each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6C-F</xref>). In areas in which higher order assemblies are conserved between species, occupancy of LCR sequence space is generally conserved.</p><p>Furthermore, changes in the LCR sequence space corresponded to differences in higher order assemblies, such as the extracellular matrix which occupied the G/P cluster in humans. While <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> had nearly no LCRs in the G/P cluster, this cluster was much more occupied in metazoans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), corresponding with the emergence of collagens, a hallmark of the metazoan lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hynes, 2012</xref>). This difference in G/P occupancy could not be explained by differences in the total number of LCRs in these species, since <italic>A. thaliana</italic> had more LCRs than <italic>C. elegans</italic> but much lower occupancy in the G/P cluster. Within metazoans, although this cluster was occupied in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, it was more heavily occupied in vertebrates. Many LCRs existed in this cluster in <italic>D. rerio</italic>, and even more in <italic>M. musculus</italic> and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, which spanned most of the space in this G/P cluster. Again, the difference in G/P cluster occupancy could not be explained by the total number of LCRs in each species, as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> had more LCRs than all of the vertebrates, but lower G/P occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The gradual differences in occupancy of the G/P cluster between the metazoan species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) correlated with the expansion of the extracellular matrix across metazoans (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hynes, 2012</xref>), highlighting that the LCR map traces the progression of a higher order assembly across evolution.</p><p>Across longer evolutionary distances, different species-specific higher order assemblies mapped to unique regions of LCR sequence space. LCRs of cell wall proteins of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, for example, primarily mapped to the P-rich cluster and a nearby P/S/Y-rich cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6G</xref>), reflecting the set of hydroxyproline-rich cell wall proteins which include extensins, arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) and proline-rich proteins (PRPs). Extensins, which have SPPPP motifs, are known to be important scaffolds for the assembly of the cell wall, in which they are thought to form self-assembling networks to organize pectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cannon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sede et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, LCRs of cell wall proteins mapped to the S-rich and T-rich clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6H</xref>), which included flocculation proteins. These S- and T-rich LCRs are often sites for O-mannosylation in mannoproteins, which is crucial for the integrity of the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gentzsch and Tanner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">González et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Neubert et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our approach allowed us to answer several general questions about the relationships between the sequence space occupied by LCRs and their functions. Firstly, we show that when a given assembly is conserved, occupancy of the corresponding LCR sequence space is also conserved. Secondly, the emergence of a higher order assembly can correspond to the population of a previously unoccupied sequence space. Finally, higher order assemblies with different physical properties occupy different regions of sequence space, even when they fulfill similar roles in their respective species. While these principles may not always hold for every sequence space or assembly, they may guide how we interpret the spaces and assemblies which have yet to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>A teleost-specific T/H cluster contains scaffold-like proteins and evolutionary signatures of higher order assemblies</title><p>Beyond the spaces where known higher order assemblies exist, there is a vast region of LCR sequence space which is unexplored. The observation that known higher order assemblies only occupy a subset of this space raises the question of whether the other, unexplored regions of sequence space may harbor LCRs of previously unknown higher order assemblies. To this end, we searched for signatures of higher order assemblies in previously undescribed regions of sequence space which are differentially occupied across species.</p><p>Upon comparing sequence space occupancy between species, we found various species-specific regions which lacked detailed annotations, one of which was the T/H-rich cluster specific to <italic>D. rerio</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Many of the LCRs in this cluster included direct TH repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), which was of particular interest because these amino acid residues may facilitate assembly via several mechanisms, including polar interactions through threonine or cation-pi interactions of histidine. In addition to these mechanisms, they may also acquire mixed-charge properties under certain phosphorylation/pH conditions and behave like other LCRs composed of mixed charges, which are known to form higher order assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greig et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we decided to further investigate this T/H-rich cluster, which contained 97 proteins with T/H-rich LCRs. To see if there could be signatures of higher order assemblies in this cluster, we looked for proteins which may be more client or scaffold-like in terms of their LCR relationships, as we found for nucleolar E-rich LCR-containing proteins. This analysis showed that proteins with T/H-rich LCRs have a wide distribution of total and distinct LCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Of particular interest were proteins with a high number of T/H LCRs, which could be similar to scaffold proteins like TCOF or SRRM2. For example, in the plot of total vs. distinct LCRs for the T/H-rich cluster, protein A0A0G2KXX0 had 17 total LCRs and only three distinct LCR types. Of these, 15 were T/H-rich LCRs, with only 1 LCR in each of the other distinct types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, T/H LCRs and all of the properties which come with a T/H composition, exist in high copy number in some proteins, suggesting that these proteins may scaffold a higher order assembly.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A conserved, teleost-specific T/H rich cluster exhibits signatures of higher order assemblies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Close up of T/H-rich region in UMAP shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.

Given that conserved higher order assemblies tend to correspond to conserved occupancy in regions of sequence space, we tested if occupancy of this T/H sequence space was conserved in fishes. We used our dotplot and UMAP approach to identify and cluster LCRs from a range of fishes from the clade Actinopterygii (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>), to which zebrafish belongs. The six species we analyzed were zebrafish, electric eel, northern pike, Atlantic salmon, Japanese pufferfish, and spotted gar (<italic>D. rerio</italic>, <italic>E. electricus</italic>, <italic>E. luciu</italic>s, <italic>S. salar</italic>, <italic>T. rubripes</italic>, and <italic>L. oculatus</italic>, respectively). Of these fishes, all but the spotted gar substantially occupied the T/H-rich cluster. The fishes which heavily occupied the T/H-rich cluster each contained ~200 T/H LCRs, while the spotted gar was only lightly occupied with 14 LCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This difference could not be attributed to differences in total LCR count among these species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). However, this difference in occupancy of the T/H cluster correlated exactly with evolutionary relationships between these fishes. Those containing T/H-rich LCRs belonged to Teleostei, while the spotted gar, which did not, belonged to Holostei, a group which diverged from Teleostei in Actinopterygii. Moreover, the seven species we analyzed outside of Actinopterygii had a very low number of T/H-rich LCRs as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), which strongly suggests that T/H-rich LCRs are teleost specific and may form a conserved higher order assembly in these species.</p><p>Altogether, our approach was able to unearth conserved LCR compositions, with scaffold-like distributions within their parent proteins. These results not only demonstrate the existence of unexplored LCRs with signatures of higher order assemblies, but also that our understanding of LCR sequences and their corresponding functions in disparate assemblies may be connected by this unified view of LCRs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have established a systematic approach to study LCRs, providing a unified view of how the sequences, features, relationships and functions of LCRs relate to each other. This unified view enabled us to gain insight into the role of LCRs in multivalent interactions, higher order assemblies, and organismal structures. Moreover, this framework for understanding LCRs begins to answer fundamental questions about how LCRs encode their functions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>How can low complexity sequences capture the diversity of LCR function?</title><p>While the functions of proteins are encoded in their sequence, it has been difficult to assign functions to LCRs. Any mapping between LCR function and sequence space presents a question of how the many disparate functions of LCRs can exist in a space which only employs a few amino acids at a time.</p><p>In our LCR map, we find that natural LCRs distribute across a continuum of sequence space. Such nuanced differences in amino acid composition might enable similarly nuanced differences in the functions they encode. One known example of such nuanced LCR function is in the acidic LCR of G3BP1, which interacts with and inhibits its RNA-binding RGG LCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). This inhibitory activity of the acidic LCR is independent of the primary sequence of the acidic LCR, and is abolished by substitution of negatively charged glutamic acid for neutral glutamine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). These results suggest that gradual changes in the ratio of glutamine to glutamic acid may alter the inhibitory activity of such an LCR. Given that we observe a bridge connecting the E and Q clusters, such a range in activity may exist across proteins in the human proteome. We observe various other bridges, highlighting that meaningful functional differences may exist in the nuanced compositional differences of naturally occurring LCRs.</p><p>Differences in amino acid composition also imply differences in sequence. It follows that functional consequences downstream of sequence, such as post-translational modifications, can be affected by differences in composition. We have shown that several bridge-like connections exist between the clusters for serine and other amino acids in the LCR map. One well understood kinase, CK2, binds and phosphorylates serines in acidic contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rusin et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, bridge-like connections exist between both S and D, and S and E in the LCR map, raising the possibility that their physical properties can be regulated to different extents by CK2. Notably, TCOF, which has many E-rich LCRs in the bridge between S and E, has been shown to be regulated by CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Werner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Werner et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, our data suggests that TCOF is a scaffolding protein for other proteins with E-rich LCRs. Thus, the ability of TCOF to scaffold and recruit its key nucleolar clients may be modulated by phosphorylation of its LCRs. Differences in post-translational modifications may represent an additional layer by which LCRs can encode biological functions. More broadly, the functional consequences of nuanced differences in other regions of LCR space can now be systematically studied.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications of bridges between certain amino acids in LCR space</title><p>Looking more generally at the LCR maps, the presence or absence of certain bridges connecting clusters may correspond to informative relationships between pairs of amino acids. We found that various bridges exist in the map, including the bridges between L and each of I, F, and V, the K - E - D axis, and the G/P and R/S bridges.</p><p>Some of these bridges represent mixtures of similar residue properties, such as hydrophobic or negatively-charged amino acids. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that some sets of amino acids with similar physical properties may be redundant, and thus varying combinations of them are not selected against. Interestingly, while R and K are both positively charged, basic residues, the region between these clusters was poorly populated, suggesting that these residues may not always be interchangeable in LCRs. This is consistent with known differences between R and K, such as the ability of R to participate in stacking interactions. In fact, recent evidence showed that the physical properties of R and K substantially differ, while the difference between D and E is much more subtle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greig et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fossat et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, while co-occurrence of similar amino acids may not be entirely surprising, a lack of co-occurrence between seemingly similar amino acids may point towards interesting differences between them.</p><p>Likewise, while dissimilar amino acids may not often co-occur in LCRs, the presence of bridges with dissimilar amino acids may represent combinations which have emergent functions. It has not escaped our notice that R/S and G/P are combinations of dissimilar amino acids which correspond to functional, conserved higher order assemblies–the speckle and extracellular matrix. In these cases, it is known how the combinations of amino acids may enable emergent properties, such as mixed charge domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greig et al., 2020</xref>) or tight-packing polyproline helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowan and McGAVIN, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ramachandran and Kartha, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rich and Crick, 1955</xref>). However, certain combinations exist in which the properties are not well understood, such as N/S or T/H, or only beginning to be explored such as H/Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gutierrez et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that the existence of bridges between dissimilar amino acids may correspond to LCRs with specific emergent properties. These types of LCRs represent open, unexplored regions of LCR space for which the relationship between sequence and function has yet to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A unified LCR map relates disparate higher order assemblies across species</title><p>The ability of the LCR map to capture certain higher order assemblies raises questions of what the LCRs in other parts of the map may tell us about their functions. While we do not interpret that all LCRs must be involved in higher order assembly, the observation that LCRs of different higher order assemblies populated different regions of the same sequence space allows us to consider if there are similarities among the roles of LCRs which give us insight into LCR function. For example, the nucleolus is a liquid assembly of protein, RNA, and DNA essential for ribosome biogenesis, while the extracellular matrix is a solid/gel-like assembly of glycoproteins scaffolded by long collagen fibers. The K-rich LCRs of nucleolar proteins such as RPA43 are required for their higher order assembly and integration into the nucleolus, while the G-P-P motif-containing LCRs in various collagens form key assemblies in the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Timpl et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mould and Hulmes, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen and Bruckner, 2003</xref>) and the G/V/P-rich LCRs of elastin assemble to provide ECM elasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Urry et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rauscher et al., 2006</xref>). Although these examples are vastly different in physical properties, a common theme is that the LCRs enable the integration and assembly of various biomolecules in biological structures.</p><p>If this is the case, we may gain insight into the structures and organizations of species by comparing the sequence space occupied by their LCRs. One fruitful comparison was between the human extracellular matrix and plant cell wall. Each of these have taken a role in the extracellular space, yet they have different chemical compositions, structures, and proteins. The LCR spaces occupied by these proteins are unique for each extracellular assembly, corresponding to differences in the specific interactions and processes required for their formation. While human ECM and plant cell wall proteins both occupy spaces which have a substantial presence of prolines, the specific differences in the regions they occupy give insight into their unique properties. LCRs of ECM proteins occupy the G/P-rich cluster and the presence of glycines in ECM collagen proteins is crucial for tight packing of helices to form the collagen triple helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2000</xref>), which is the basis for higher order assembly of most of the tissues in the human body. On the other hand, while plant cell wall proteins also use polyproline II helices, these P-rich LCRs occupy a different region in the map from LCRs in the ECM. Moreover, plant cell wall proteins contain multiple P-rich LCR compositions which delineate between extensins and other proline-rich cell wall proteins. Such differences, in whether or not the contiguous prolines are interrupted, have been proposed to explain the origins of plant cell wall proteins with different properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kieliszewski and Lamport, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lamport et al., 2011</xref>), supporting the idea that functional divergence of LCRs can occur through relatively local differences in sequence space. This view of LCR sequence space captures key sequence determinants of LCR function in higher order assemblies and highlights that even small differences in LCR sequence space may have meaningful biological consequences.</p><p>As the functions of other regions of LCR sequence space are uncovered or mapped, such as the teleost-specific T/H-rich cluster we identified, species with different higher order assemblies and cellular organizations may be found to occupy similar or different spaces. By viewing these LCRs from the perspective of higher order assembly, we suggest that the principles of assembly may be the principles which explain the disparate functions of LCRs. For now, we can only speculate that disparate LCR functions may not be isolated processes, but different regions across a unified LCR space.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (Human, Female)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HeLa</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tested negative for Mycoplasma</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-MPHOSPH10 (MPP10) (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Novus Biologicals</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NBP1-84341</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Fibrillarin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EMD Millipore</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MABE1154</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-POLR1A (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Novus Biologicals</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NBP2-56122</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-UBTF (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Novus Biologicals</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NBP1-82545</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 647 (goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">A-27040</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-mouse IgG Alexa 594 (goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">A-11032</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RPA43 WT;

The two matrices were subtracted such that any identical amino acid matches equaled 0 and non-matches were non-zero. The final dotplot matrix was generated by replacing any 0 values with 1 and replacing any non-zero values with 0. Dotplot matrices were saved as temporary files in.npz format using the file saving and compression implementation from NumPy. For images of dotplots, matrices were plotted directly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>LCR calling (Module 2, part 1)</title><p>LCRs were called by identifying high density regions in protein dotplots through classic image processing methods, such as kernel convolution, thresholding, and segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To identify high density regions in dotplots, we performed kernel convolution on the dotplots with a uniform 10x10 kernel, which calculates a convolved pixel intensity value from 0 to 100 based on the number of dots in that window. This kernel relates to the minimum length of an LCR.</p><p>We used the convolved dotplots to determine this ‘high density’ cutoff to define LCRs. Specifically, we used a false discovery rate (FDR)-based approach to threshold the convolved pixel intensities in a way that reliably identifies high density regions and treats the same sequence similarly regardless of the proteome it comes from. For a given proteome, we generated a background model by simulating an equally sized, length-matched ‘null proteome’, whose sequences were generated from a uniform amino acid distribution. Using a uniform amino acid distribution for the null proteome minimizes proteome-specific effects on whether a sequence is considered to contribute to a region of high density in a dotplot (See Appendix 1 for a full explanation). Moreover, matching the lengths of the proteomes accounts for differences in the length distributions of proteins in different proteomes. We compared the distribution of convolved pixel intensities from all convolved dotplots of proteins in the real proteome, with those from the null proteome, and identified the lowest convolved pixel intensity which satisfied a stringent FDR of 0.002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). FDR was defined by the number of pixels from the null set which pass the threshold divided by the total number of pixels which pass the threshold (from the real and null sets combined). This threshold was then applied to every protein in the proteome to generate segmented dotplots, in which high-density regions (referred to as segmented regions) had values of 1 while other regions had values of 0. The positions from –4 and +5 of the boundaries of the segmented regions were included as the start and stop of the LCR to account for the convolution kernel size. The exception to this was LCRs which existed within that distance from the start or stop of a protein, in which the protein start or stop was designated the start or stop accordingly. Only segmented regions which intersected with the diagonal were called as LCRs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>LCR type and copy number determination (Module 2, part 2)</title><p>To computationally determine the types of LCRs and the copy number for each type, we determined the presence of segmented regions at the intersection between called LCRs in the segmented dotplot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). For each protein, we represented the LCRs as a network in which the LCRs were nodes and intersections between LCRs were edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The total number of nodes equals the total number of LCRs in the protein. The number of connected components of this network equals the number of distinct LCR types in the protein. Therefore, the number of nodes within a given connected component equals the number of LCRs of that type. NetworkX (version 2.3) was used to calculate these values, and plot the network representation of LCR relationships within proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Entropy calculation, random length-matched sequence sampling</title><p>Shannon entropy was calculated for each LCR sequence and a length-matched sequence which was randomly sampled from the respective proteome. Random length-matched sequence sampling was done by indexing the position of all proteins in the proteome from 1 to the length of the proteome (i.e. the sum of lengths of all proteins), and randomly selecting a position between 1 and the length of the proteome minus the length of the sequence of interest. The randomly sampled sequence was the sequence of the matched length, starting at the selected position. Shannon entropy for both the LCR and randomly sampled sequence was calculated using Scipy’s implementation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Other LCR calling methods (SEG/fLPS)</title><p>LCRs were called with other methods, SEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wootton and Federhen, 1993</xref>) and fLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison, 2017</xref>) for comparison.</p><p>SEG was run on the human proteome using ‘default’, ‘intermediate’, and ‘strict’ settings, as defined by the PLAtform of TOols for LOw COmplexity (PlaToLoCo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jarnot et al., 2020</xref>).

The 20-dimensional vectors of all LCRs were saved in AnnData format as an array in which rows were LCRs and columns were the amino acid frequencies. LCR maps were generated by dimensionality reduction from 20 to 2 dimensions using Scanpy’s implementation of UMAP (random_state = 73, n_components = 2; n_neighbors = 200 for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. n_neighbors = default for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McInnes and Healy, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>). Amino acid distributions on the LCR map were generated by coloring each point on a color scale corresponding to the frequency of the amino acid represented. Leiden clustering was performed using Scanpy (random_state = 73). For each Leiden cluster, the most represented amino acids in each cluster was manually, but systematically, determined by comparing to the UMAPs with the single amino acid distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) and annotating based on the highest frequency amino acid(s) in a given cluster.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title>Annotation of LCR maps (higher order assemblies, biophysical predictions)</title><p>Annotation of LCRs belonging to higher order assemblies (see table above) was done by adding annotations to the AnnData object and coloring the LCRs using Scanpy’s plotting implementation. Wilcoxon rank sum (MannWhitneyU) tests for amino acid enrichment in LCRs of higher order assemblies were performed using Scanpy. For the Wilcoxon rank sum tests comparing one annotation against all other LCRs, default settings were used. For the Wilcoxon rank sum tests comparing between two annotation sets of LCRs, one annotation set was set as the reference. Within each comparison, all tests were corrected for multiple testing of amino acids using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p><p>Biophysical predictions were calculated and mapped for all LCRs.

LCR positions identified by our dotplot approach were used to extract the corresponding ANCHOR and IUPred2A scores for each position in each LCR. The mean ANCHOR and IUPred2A scores for each LCR were calculated and used to color the UMAP plot.

frequency as null model for FDR calculations</title><p>Our approach identifies LCRs and determines their relationships within proteins by identifying high density regions in dotplots based on their convolved pixel intensity, because these high density regions will correspond to LCRs if they lie on the diagonal or intersections between similar LCRs if they lie off of the diagonal. For a given proteome, we generated a background model by simulating dotplots for an equally sized, length-matched ‘null proteome’, whose sequences are generated from a given null amino acid distribution model. Given this, it is important to note that the null model we select will determine the background density on a dotplot, which is agnostic to the identity of the amino acids being matched.</p><p>For the reasons explained below, we deem a uniform amino acid distribution more appropriate than the amino acid distribution of the given proteome in order to achieve our specific goals.</p><p>The primary goal of our dotplot analysis is to identify LCRs (sequences of low entropy) and determine their relationships within proteins, such that we can compare LCRs across species. In order to achieve this, our choice of null model must ensure that (1) we accurately identify sequences of low entropy, and (2) we can compare sequences regardless of the proteome it comes from.</p><p>A null model based on the amino acid frequencies of a given proteome will not necessarily allow for accurate identification of LCRs (low entropy sequences), nor will it allow the same sequence to be treated similarly in a different proteome. This is illustrated by considering two hypothetical proteomes with different amino acid frequency distributions:</p><p><bold>Proteome A:</bold> relatively even amino acid distribution</p><p><bold>Proteome B:</bold> almost entirely composed of a single amino acid, e.g. Alanine (A).</p><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-1"><title>Nulls derived from proteome amino acid frequencies fail to call true LCRs</title><p>Suppose we compare a null proteome generated from the amino acid frequencies in <bold>Proteome B</bold>, vs. a null proteome generated from a uniform amino acid distribution, and assess how likely a homopolymeric sequence of any amino acid (e.g. XXXXXXXXXX) is to be called an LCR given each of these null proteomes (i.e. exceed the ‘background’ signal to some degree of confidence).</p><p>While the convolved pixel intensity of the homopolymeric X sequence is constant, the background convolved pixel intensity will be much higher in the null proteome derived from <bold>Proteome B</bold> vs. the null proteome derived from a uniform amino acid distribution (since its proteins are almost entirely composed of matching amino acids). Thus, despite this homopolymeric sequence being a true LCR, it is unlikely to be called as one when using a null proteome derived from <bold>Proteome B</bold>. In general, the more skewed the amino acid frequencies of a proteome away from uniform, the less sensitive it will be to detection of any true LCRs (sequences of low entropy).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2"><title>LCRs called using nulls derived from different proteomes are not comparable</title><p>Let us now consider null proteomes derived from the amino acid frequencies of two different proteomes, <bold>Proteome B</bold>, mentioned above, and <bold>Proteome A</bold>, which has a relatively uniform amino acid distribution. Using the same reasoning presented above, a homopolymeric X sequence is much more likely to be called an LCR in <bold>Proteome A</bold>, and not in <bold>Proteome B</bold>. Thus, by defining the background model as the amino acid distribution of a given proteome, a real low complexity sequence may be called an LCR in one proteome but not in the other.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;A unified view of LCRs across species&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sreenivas Chavali (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers believe that current data needs to be reanalyzed and additional experimental data are requested. Usually, papers are rejected from <italic>eLife</italic> if a revision would take substantial experimental work. Detailed recommendations for authors are listed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper is extremely dense and difficult to read and appears focused on a relatively narrow question. One barrier is that it is poorly linked to both a clear biological background for LCRs and the linked references in the introduction don't clearly talk about the same phenomena. This needs to be expanded to help readers who are not familiar with LCRs understand why this study is important and would help establish that the work will have a deeper impact. It would also make clearer what this manuscript's novel findings are- at present, it is not clear if results add detail to existing views in the literature, or make new discoveries (for example, the arguments about LCRs and localisation/function). Additionally, terms that are not widely used, such as protein valence, need to be defined to be suitable for a broad audience.</p><p>A second issue in the writing is that the relationship between the Results sections is unclear. The broad flow of the paper as I read it is that the authors present the method, apply the method to proteomes, experimentally explore one protein, go back to considering proteomes, then compare different proteomes. Specifically, the experimental work is not well justified- it is not clear how that protein was chosen, and how the findings relate to the work presented specifically. It doesn't validate the other findings in a meaningful way and raises questions of valence that don't arise from the analysis. It should be better linked to the rest of the presented work or removed.</p><p>To test potential issues with the null the authors should repeat the testing with a null derived from the amino acid composition derived from the individual proteomes under study. This is particularly important in light of some residues apparently rarely appearing in LCRs (e.g. tryptophan).</p><p>In the comparisons of the dotplot based method with existing techniques the graphs presented in figure 1 supplement 3 are almost unreadable due to the choice of colours used, particularly in comparing SEG to dotplots (A).</p><p>To attempt to remedy issues around the link between LCR contents and function/localisation I recommend the authors:</p><p>– Include a justification for the choice of p-value, and confirm in the methods that multiple tests correct took into account both the number of amino acids and the number of function/localisation classes. A discussion of the effect size as well as the p-value would be helpful.</p><p>– Use chi-squared and/or permutation tests to test cluster membership (rather than frequency) is more than expected for random perturbation for different amino acids.</p><p>– Use a heatmap, possibly with KDEs, to plot the density of specific categories relative to the raw umap. This is particularly important for Figure 3 supp Figure 3 where the points in some categories are so sparse it is hard to see the point distribution. It may be the case that these new plots are quite flat; in this case, it may be better to limit the use of umap plots and focus more heavily on robust statistical tests as umap plots are fundamentally a visualisation technique.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although the study presents a unique approach to identify LCRs and exciting insights into LCR sequence space, there are few issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. It is not clear how the FDR threshold of 0.002, to define the LCRs was chosen. While Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 presents the relevant statistics for different thresholds, it is not intuitive why 0.002 was selected. The authors may consider different representations (distinct colors or dotted vs solid lines) to differentiate the lines corresponding to the thresholds in the supplementary figure. Moreover, the thresholding appears a bit random, as the authors reset the FDR threshold to 0.05 for <italic>E. coli</italic>. Is the threshold species/clade-specific? If so, what factors determine the thresholding. This has to be explicitly discussed for the tool to be used by other researchers in the field.</p><p>2. Figure 1: Panels D and E shall be presented first, followed by panels A, B and C. Distinct annotations should be provided for SRRM2 and MUC5A and should be discussed in the figure legends. The authors might consider presenting distinct examples with bars highlighting the similar and distinct types of LCRs in the examples as shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 4, to allow the readers to appreciate the Dot-plot approach, rightaway. Also, Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 appears to be redundant and can be removed.</p><p>3. The discussion on the comparison between SEG, fLPS and the Dot-plot methods is rather limited (lines 209-215). Does the Dot-plot method provide more false-negatives with respect to identifying LCRs?</p><p>4. LCRs have been annotated for single amino acids. What was the basis for determining the most prevalent amino acid? The annotation of LCR sequence-space by eye appears arbitrary, hampering reproducibility, should this approach be used by others. Also, the approach does not differentiate between repetitive and non-repetitive LCRs. This must be discussed as limitations in the discussion.</p><p>5. On similar lines, physicochemical properties of the amino acids in the LCRs are known to aid formation of higher order assemblies. This implies that though the type of amino acid may vary, but similar physicochemical properties across the LCRs can contribute to similar type of interactions (e.g. G3BP1). Such similarities in the physicochemical properties of the amino acid is not taken into account. Therefore, a protein with multiple LCRs composed of physicochemically similar amino acid types could be treated as &quot;multi distinct&quot; or &quot;multi mixed&quot; in the dot plot method, although the nature of the amino acid type and thereby its mode of function in terms of higher order assemblies, could fall under &quot;multi same&quot; category. The authors should at least discuss these limitations explicitly.</p><p>6. The authors may think of some in vitro experiments to test the biological importance of T/H LCRs in Teleosts. Looking into the functions of these proteins might provide insights for designing such experiments. The entire section, as provided, is a descriptive account of the observations, with limited biological insights.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I would like the authors to more fully compare and contrast their approach with a SEG-based approach that extracts LCRs and then compares their composition. I believe they already used SEG to find LCRs, so this should be pretty simple (i.e. generate UMAPS based on the composition of the LCRs identified by SEG vs. their dotplot matrix method).</p><p>2. I would like to see the role of codon bias and repeat expansions discussed (and ideally considered, perhaps as an explanation for the bridge sequences)</p><p>3. The manuscript felt rather long – I understand the desire to place as many interesting observations in as possible, but as mentioned these are unavoidably cherry-picked, inasmuch as they are interesting and compelling to the authors (and, to this reviewer, I should say – the cherry-picking is unavoidable and not a criticism!). Perhaps instead some of these could be summarized with a table that lists protein, function, LCR, and possible observation? This I think would help avoid readers needing to wade through lots of text to obtain what really amounts to very nice hypotheses, as opposed to specific observations that require open prose. The teleost-specific analysis felt sort of tacked on at the end, and I'm not sure added much (but am happy to be disagreed with). I would like to see the manuscript length reduced, ideally with some of the observations condensed into a table.</p><p>4. I would like to more concretely know what (specific) question(s) this work answers. &quot;We don't know much about LCRs&quot; is not a particularly specific motivation, so I'd like to better understand what are the knowledge gap(s) the authors are solving.</p><p>5. The authors should provide detailed annotations of all LCRs in an easy-to-access format (both Excel and text-based), and should also I think provide a way to access and make sense of the data shown in the UMAP plots (perhaps with LCRs divided by cluster).</p><p>6. Consideration of the papers mentioned on this topic by Eric Ross.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A unified view of low complexity regions (LCRs) across species&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by the original reviewwrs, Volker Dötsch (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This revised version is much improved!</p><p>The focus on claiming the dot matrix approach lets one find functionally important LCRs.</p><p>Fundamentally, I think the authors are overselling their approach as a way to easily find functionally important subregions in proteins.</p><p>I think this method is one way to find amino-acid enriched LCRs. I fundamentally do not believe this approach is somehow magically different from finding low-complexity sequences and then categorizing based on composition after the fact (as one could do with SEG or some other composition-independent metric), or by defining one (or more) residue types to extract contiguous low-complexity subregions enriched for a specific residue (as done by Gutierrez et al).</p><p>However, I think this issue can be addressed simply by scaling back the language and making less strong claims regarding what can/cannot currently be done. I recognize these changes were made to address previous critiques, but on my reading of the current version the setup feels like a straw man.</p><p>I think the actual way the new intro sets things up is great – I just think the implication that dot matrices are essential for this investigation is unsupported.</p><p>To specifically support this suggestion, I have provided some analysis below.</p><p>G31BP focus</p><p>The initial example focusses on G3BP1, and highlights the fact that there are two flavors of LCRs in G3BP1. The authors then relate those different LCRs back to previously published work to make the point that the dot-plot method can identify functionally distinct subdomains. The authors then state,</p><p>&quot;The presence of these compositionally distinct LCRs are critical for the ability of G3BP1 to form stress granules, as the acidic LCRs interact with and inhibit the RGG domain, preventing it from interacting with RNA, a necessary step of stress granule assembly. Thus, by highlighting the relationships between different LCRs, dot plots can provide key insights relevant to protein function.&quot;</p><p>But the functional insight here didn't come from the dotplots – the functional insight here came from prior work, in which acidic rich and arginine rich subregions were already identified and characterized. The dotplots didn't identify that these regions could interact, nor did it provide any inference regarding the putative functions of these regions. With this in mind I really find the logic here hard to follow; my reading is that the setup is:</p><p>1. LCRs are important for biology.</p><p>2. Here we provide a new way to find LCRs.</p><p>3. By highlighting the relationships between different LCRs, dotplots can provide key insights relevant to protein function.</p><p>But this last point really is not what happened – the fact these LCRs are 'different' was not what was used to highlight them as important – instead relating them to prior literature was used to highlight functional roles, and the fact they are 'different' comes from prior work. The chemical logical behind this difference is not explicitly encoded by the dotplot matrix, so (for example) and Arg-rich and Lys-rich LCR would appear equally different.</p><p>LCR3 (as the authors define it) is not even particularly arginine rich (4/23 Arg residues) (LRGPGGPRGGLGGGMRGPPRGGM), the RGG domain of G3BP1 contains 11 arginine residues, so most of the arginine's that drive RNA binding actually fall outside of the &quot;arginine-rich LCR3&quot;.</p><p>In sum, it's unclear to me how the authors' approach relates to the functional investigation of proteins beyond highlighting the low complexity domains that have been previously shown to be important. Does this mean that all 37,342 LCRs in the human proteome should point to functionally-important features? And if not, how is one meant to discriminate between functional vs. non-functional LCRs?</p><p>Not to belabor a point, but later the authors then state:</p><p>&quot;The examples of dot plots make clear that functional information about LCR type and copy number can be extracted from dot plot matrices &quot;</p><p>I still feel like there is a critical step completely missing here; HOW do we extract &quot;functional information&quot; from the dotplots? Are the authors saying that every LCR is functionally important? If yes, in what way? How are we (readers/users) meant to use information for dotplots on previously unstudied proteins to infer functionally important features beyond &quot;If there's an LCR remove it and see if it matters&quot;.</p><p>The authors go on to say:</p><p>&quot;The examples of dot plots make clear that functional information about LCR type and copy number can be extracted from dot plot matrices. However, there currently is not an approach to globally assess these features of LCRs and their functions. While several methods exist for identifying LCRs these methods are unable to determine LCR relationships such as type and copy number&quot;</p><p>The way one determines the type and copy number is looking at (1) the amino acid composition of LCRs identified by these other methods and (2) the number of LCRs identified. This is precisely what the authors are doing with their own method.</p><p>For example, using SEG on G3BP1 and setting an arbitrary threshold here of 0.45 we find 3 SEG-derived LCRs (highlighted in blue here) which correspond to 144-160 ('PQEESEEEVEEPEERQ'), 192-205 ('EPEPDPEPEPEQE'), and 430-448 ('PGGPRGGLGGGMRGPPRG').</p><p>The authors' approach identifies basically the same three regions:</p><p>SEG: PQEESEEEVEEPEERQ</p><p>DotMatrix: TEPQEESEEEVEEPEERQQ</p><p>SEG: EPEPDPEPEPEQE</p><p>DotMatrix: AEPEPDPEPEPEQEPVS</p><p>SEG: PGGPRGGLGGGMRGPPRG</p><p>DotMatrix: LRGPGGPRGGLGGGMRGPPRGGM</p><p>Now I want to be clear – I have no particular love for SEG, but my point is simply that to claim there is no way to characterize LCRs that takes type and copy number is demonstrably false.</p><p>I would encourage the authors to not oversell the method as some magic bullet, and not pretend one could not do what they have done here with another method. You could. The big difference is people haven't and the actual analysis of proteomes is interesting and I think well written and well-explored.</p><p>Codon bias remains undiscussed</p><p>When the authors discuss biases and bridging among distinct classes of LCRs, I would, again, STRONGLY encourage them to consider codon biases – can overlapping/related enrichments for specific residues be explained based on codon distance in repetitive and slippy sequences? I recognize the authors state that 'this is out of scope' but… it's not. If the authors are going to find LCRs with specific compositional biases and comment on bridges between distinct classes of LCRs, ignoring a codon-based explanation for these bridges is most definitely within scope.</p><p>LCRs are short</p><p>One thing I had not appreciated in the original manuscript is that the LCRs are short. In the human proteome, 87% of LCRs are 20 residues or shorter. This to me makes me wonder if LCR is really the right term. The LCRs identified previously have generally been large domains, while here LCRs are functionally of the same length as motifs, should these perhaps be defined as LCMs (low complexity motifs) more</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77058.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

To improve readability, we have changed the figures to not rely only on the color of the lines.

All of the data (including those with p-values that do not satisfy this threshold) are clearly presented in the same figures, and exact p-values are provided as a supplemental table.</p><p>Test correction:</p><p>For each annotation set (e.g. nucleolus, nuclear speckle, ECM, etc), a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction took into account the number of amino acids (20). In response to this concern, we have updated the Methods section titled ‘Annotation of LCR maps (higher order assemblies, biophysical predictions)’ to make this explicit.</p><p>With respect to correcting based on annotations, we did not perform these tests for an exhaustive list of annotation sets. We have not corrected for the number of annotation sets we tested throughout different sections of the manuscript, which was fourteen in total (see Lee_Jaberi_pvalues.xls). Even a stringent Bonferroni correction would affect these p-values by about one order of magnitude. In the most conservative case where something had a p-value of 10<sup>-3</sup> before this correction (most had p-values much lower than this), its corrected p-value would be ~10<sup>-2</sup>, which we still deem acceptable.</p><p>We should also note that some of these amino acid frequency biases have been documented and experimentally validated by other groups, as we mention and reference in the manuscript.</p><p>Effect size:</p><p>With respect to the effect size, we would like to provide an example to demonstrate why apparently small effect sizes in average frequency do not affect our conclusions. As we mentioned in one of our earlier responses, many of the proteins in nucleoli have multiple LCRs. While K-rich ones are enriched in nucleolar proteins, not every LCR of every nucleolar protein will be K-rich. Thus, the distribution of K frequency is not unimodal. The many LCRs that have few or no K’s will result in a low mean K frequency in nucleolar LCRs, even though a subset of nucleolar LCRs have very high K frequencies. This is illustrated by looking at the K-rich LCR frequency among all true nucleolar LCRs vs the K frequencies of an equally sized random sample of LCRs. While the means of these two samples may not be incredibly different (giving the illusion of a small effect size), the difference in their distributions is very apparent. Real nucleolar proteins contain many more LCRs with a high K frequency.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77058-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Use chi-squared and/or permutation tests to test cluster membership (rather than frequency) is more than expected for random perturbation for different amino acids.</p></disp-quote><p>While we do assign labels to clusters based on the dominant amino acid/s in each cluster, these clusters are only intended to serve as guides when we refer to different regions of the map (as we have stated in the text).

Instead, we chose to keep our analyses to intrinsic features of the LCRs themselves (e.g. amino acid frequency), such that our conclusions would be robust.</p><p>2) In the case of this UMAP (as opposed to UMAPs based on single-cell sequencing data for example), cluster membership has no additional meaning beyond the amino acid frequencies of the LCRs within it. This is in contrast to UMAPs generated from single-cell sequencing data, where clusters may correspond to certain cell types. Thus, it is unclear what would be gained by performing analyses using clusters.</p><p>Thus, while we don’t believe that performing these tests on Leiden clusters would be particularly informative, we instead attempted to address the reviewer’s concern by performing permutation tests to test the probability of obtaining amino acid frequencies greater than the unpermuted set by chance. We did this by randomly assigning the same number of nucleolar ‘labels’ to LCRs, and determining the mean frequency of specific amino acids in the assigned nucleolar group. We did this resampling 10,000 times, and plotted the results below in grey, and indicated the unpermuted amino acid frequency with a vertical red line.</p><p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, the permutation test results match well with the results from the Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for enrichment of certain amino acids in LCRs. The example shown is a permutation test for methionine (M) and lysine (K) for LCRs of proteins in the nucleolus. From these permutation tests, it is quite likely that the distribution of methionine frequency of nucleolar LCRs could be arrived at by chance (p = 0.0945), which is consistent with the lack of methionine enrichment observed by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. On the other hand, the lysine frequency distribution seen in LCRs of nucleolar proteins is incredibly unlikely to occur by chance (p &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>; note this is limited by n permutations), which is also consistent with the lysine enrichment we observe by Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Permutation Tests.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77058-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We hope that these results illustrate the robustness of the enrichments we observe by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests presented throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Use a heatmap, possibly with KDEs, to plot the density of specific categories relative to the raw umap. This is particularly important for Figure 3 supp Figure 3 where the points in some categories are so sparse it is hard to see the point distribution. It may be the case that these new plots are quite flat; in this case, it may be better to limit the use of umap plots and focus more heavily on robust statistical tests as umap plots are fundamentally a visualisation technique.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We wish to clarify that any claims we make about enrichment of specific amino acids in LCRs of certain higher order assemblies are based on Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and not a visual interpretation of the UMAPs. These UMAPs are only provided to help see where LCRs lie in the sequence space. The calculations for the statistical tests are independent of the UMAPs. Given that we do not make conclusions based on the UMAP, we believe that the use of statistical tests are more appropriate in demonstrating the enrichments we observe, than a heatmap.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Although the study presents a unique approach to identify LCRs and exciting insights into LCR sequence space, there are few issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. It is not clear how the FDR threshold of 0.002, to define the LCRs was chosen. While Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 presents the relevant statistics for different thresholds, it is not intuitive why 0.002 was selected. The authors may consider different representations (distinct colors or dotted vs solid lines) to differentiate the lines corresponding to the thresholds in the supplementary figure. Moreover, the thresholding appears a bit random, as the authors reset the FDR threshold to 0.05 for <italic>E. coli</italic>. Is the threshold species/clade-specific? If so, what factors determine the thresholding. This has to be explicitly discussed for the tool to be used by other researchers in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Indeed, our intent is for our approach to be widely accessible to the broader scientific community.</p><p>Our choice of FDR threshold was chosen to ensure that the sequences identified were truly LCRs (i.e. low entropy sequences) and that we could maximally identify the LCRs in the proteome. These goals have an inherent tradeoff in that minimizing entropy will be more stringent and therefore reduce the number of LCRs identified. For this reason, out of the thresholds we tested, the FDR of 0.002 was chosen. This can be seen by comparing to the more stringent threshold, 0.001, which identified ~8900 fewer LCRs (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1C), while having little effect on the entropy of the sequences (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1D).</p><p>We would also like to note that while this was our reasoning for selecting an FDR of 0.002, the FDR threshold can be set depending on the purpose of the analysis. For example, a researcher who is interested in the lowest entropy sequences, but does not need a large number of them for their analysis may decide to be more stringent with the FDR threshold.</p><p>Similar reasoning can be used regarding the <italic>E. coli</italic> threshold, in which we relaxed the FDR threshold. As can be seen in Figure 5 —figure supplement 1C, the sequences identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> at an FDR of 0.05 were still low in entropy, and this less stringent threshold contained LCRs such that further analysis was possible. However, given this difference in FDR, we intentionally do not make strong claims about LCRs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, but included this to be as transparent about the process as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 1: Panels D and E shall be presented first, followed by panels A, B and C. Distinct annotations should be provided for SRRM2 and MUC5A and should be discussed in the figure legends. The authors might consider presenting distinct examples with bars highlighting the similar and distinct types of LCRs in the examples as shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 4, to allow the readers to appreciate the Dot-plot approach, rightaway. Also, Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 appears to be redundant and can be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason we chose to present Figure 1A, B, and C before Figure 1D and E, is that Figure 1A, B, and C are images of raw dotplots, and have not been processed by our computational pipeline. We realized after reading this comment that our annotations on the dotplot could be incorrectly interpreted as automated annotations by the pipeline. This is not the case. We sought to simply point out that the information we are interested in for this manuscript (LCR sequences, type, and copy number) are all found in a dotplot representation of a sequence. To help avoid this misunderstanding, we have removed the colored-box annotations on the dotplot, and instead simply point to regions that we refer to in the text. Similarly, we have added arrows to annotate SRRM2 and MUC5A, such that readers can appreciate the information found in dotplots, even without the use of the pipeline. Because these dotplots were not processed with the pipeline, we do not believe the bars showing similar and distinct LCR calls (which are an output of the pipeline) are appropriate here. Hopefully these changes help make clear the message we want to convey in these panels.</p><p>We believe that Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 is required to give a reasonable survey of the information which can be found in dotplots, which we attempt to communicate in the section &quot;Dotplots reveal the presence and organization of low complexity regions (LCRs) in proteins&quot;. These observations were the motivation for us to make an automated pipeline to generate dotplots and extract this information from dotplots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The discussion on the comparison between SEG, fLPS and the Dot-plot methods is rather limited (lines 209-215). Does the Dot-plot method provide more false-negatives with respect to identifying LCRs?</p></disp-quote><p>When considering what to discuss about these methods, we decided to evaluate certain metrics relevant for our downstream analyses: (1) sequence complexity of called LCRs, (2) total number of amino acids in called LCRs, and (3) the ability to determine LCR type and copy number. We have limited our discussion to these criteria because our only claim is that our method is able to determine LCR type and copy number, while being comparable in (1) identifying LCRs of low sequence complexity and (2) a similar number of amino acids in called LCRs. We use these metrics to assess our approach, because in the absence of a 'ground truth' for what is an LCR, it is not clear how to define false negatives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. LCRs have been annotated for single amino acids. What was the basis for determining the most prevalent amino acid? The annotation of LCR sequence-space by eye appears arbitrary, hampering reproducibility, should this approach be used by others. Also, the approach does not differentiate between repetitive and non-repetitive LCRs. This must be discussed as limitations in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We realize the wording &quot;by eye&quot; was a confusing choice in the text. These annotations were done manually, but systematically, by comparing the human and species UMAP(s) to Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 and Figure 5 —figure supplement 2, respectively. These supplements were generated by plotting the frequency of each amino acid for each point on the UMAP. The regions with the highest frequency for a given amino acid was designated the &quot;most prevalent amino acid&quot;. We have updated the text in the Methods section titled ‘Generation of LCR maps (UMAP dimensionality reduction, Leiden clustering)’ to make this explicit.</p><p>Regarding repetitiveness, we do not see this as a limitation of the approach because if one can assign a score for ‘repetitiveness’, this can be plotted on the UMAP as we did with biophysical scores in Figure 4 —figure supplement 2 (in the revised version) or Figure 5 —figure supplement 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. On similar lines, physicochemical properties of the amino acids in the LCRs are known to aid formation of higher order assemblies. This implies that though the type of amino acid may vary, but similar physicochemical properties across the LCRs can contribute to similar type of interactions (e.g. G3BP1). Such similarities in the physicochemical properties of the amino acid is not taken into account. Therefore, a protein with multiple LCRs composed of physicochemically similar amino acid types could be treated as &quot;multi distinct&quot; or &quot;multi mixed&quot; in the dot plot method, although the nature of the amino acid type and thereby its mode of function in terms of higher order assemblies, could fall under &quot;multi same&quot; category. The authors should at least discuss these limitations explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer mentions, there are examples where amino acids with similar physical properties are interchangeable. However, given that this equivalence may not generalize to every LCR (e.g. lysines and arginines), we therefore tried to make as few assumptions as possible. If researchers are specifically interested in assigning ‘matches’ in the dotplot to certain sets of similar but non-identical amino acids, our code is publically available and can be modified to achieve this, and the corresponding output of the pipeline would have this equivalence taken into account.</p><p>Occasionally, we observe fusion when two hollow spheres make contact, as can be seen in . We also observe spheres which are nested within each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. I would like the authors to more fully compare and contrast their approach with a SEG-based approach that extracts LCRs and then compares their composition. I believe they already used SEG to find LCRs, so this should be pretty simple (i.e. generate UMAPS based on the composition of the LCRs identified by SEG vs. their dotplot matrix method).</p></disp-quote><p>We have done downstream UMAP analysis with LCRs called from SEG. We found that although certain aspects of the dotplot-based LCR UMAP are reflected in the SEG-based LCR UMAP, there is overall worse resolution with default settings, which is likely due to fused LCRs of different compositions. Attempting to improve resolution using more stringent settings comes at the cost of the number of LCRs assessed. We maintain that this comparison is not really the focus of our manuscript. We do not make strong claims about the dotplot matrices being better than SEG, or any other method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I would like to see the role of codon bias and repeat expansions discussed (and ideally considered, perhaps as an explanation for the bridge sequences)</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer bringing up these topics on the potential origins of LCRs, such as codon bias and repeat expansions. As we noted in the response above, we believe this discussion is related, but out of the scope of what the paper covers.

For a more detailed explanation, please see our response to the more general comment about repeat expansions above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The manuscript felt rather long – I understand the desire to place as many interesting observations in as possible, but as mentioned these are unavoidably cherry-picked, inasmuch as they are interesting and compelling to the authors (and, to this reviewer, I should say – the cherry-picking is unavoidable and not a criticism!). Perhaps instead some of these could be summarized with a table that lists protein, function, LCR, and possible observation? This I think would help avoid readers needing to wade through lots of text to obtain what really amounts to very nice hypotheses, as opposed to specific observations that require open prose. The teleost-specific analysis felt sort of tacked on at the end, and I'm not sure added much (but am happy to be disagreed with). I would like to see the manuscript length reduced, ideally with some of the observations condensed into a table.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment and those of other reviewers, we have attempted to streamline the manuscript by making changes to several sections. We hope that these changes help make the paper easier to read.</p><p>With respect to the section on T/H rich LCRs (Figure 6), we acknowledge that the role of this section could have been made more clear in the text.

We gain further insight by making use of our ability to easily compare sequence space occupancy across species (as we did in Figure 5), and demonstrate that occupancy of this sequence space is conserved among teleosts, akin to the conservation of G/P rich LCRs in metazoans. Our observation that this region of sequence space exhibits biochemical and evolutionary signatures of higher order assemblies argues for its biological importance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

I fundamentally do not believe this approach is somehow magically different from finding low-complexity sequences and then categorizing based on composition after the fact (as one could do with SEG or some other composition-independent metric), or by defining one (or more) residue types to extract contiguous low-complexity subregions enriched for a specific residue (as done by Gutierrez et al).</p><p>However, I think this issue can be addressed simply by scaling back the language and making less strong claims regarding what can/cannot currently be done.

The authors then relate those different LCRs back to previously published work to make the point that the dot-plot method can identify functionally distinct subdomains. The authors then state,</p><p>&quot;The presence of these compositionally distinct LCRs are critical for the ability of G3BP1 to form stress granules, as the acidic LCRs interact with and inhibit the RGG domain, preventing it from interacting with RNA, a necessary step of stress granule assembly. Thus, by highlighting the relationships between different LCRs, dot plots can provide key insights relevant to protein function.&quot;</p><p>But the functional insight here didn't come from the dotplots – the functional insight here came from prior work, in which acidic rich and arginine rich subregions were already identified and characterized. The dotplots didn't identify that these regions could interact, nor did it provide any inference regarding the putative functions of these regions. With this in mind I really find the logic here hard to follow; my reading is that the setup is:</p><p>1. LCRs are important for biology.</p><p>2. Here we provide a new way to find LCRs.</p><p>3. By highlighting the relationships between different LCRs, dotplots can provide key insights relevant to protein function.</p><p>But this last point really is not what happened – the fact these LCRs are 'different' was not what was used to highlight them as important – instead relating them to prior literature was used to highlight functional roles, and the fact they are 'different' comes from prior work. The chemical logical behind this difference is not explicitly encoded by the dotplot matrix, so (for example) and Arg-rich and Lys-rich LCR would appear equally different.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments, which have been very helpful in understanding how this section may have led to confusion about our logic and claims here. We would like to clarify that the goal of this section (&quot;Dotplots reveal the presence and organization of LCRs in proteins&quot;) is to make the argument that developing a systematic approach using dotplots is likely to be fruitful. To make this argument, we use existing literature and single dotplots (not the output of a systematic analysis, which we develop in the next section).</p><p>The logic of the argument presented in this section is the following:</p><p>1) LCRs are important for biology</p><p>2) LCR types and their respective copy numbers can be important for their biological function</p><p>→ e.g. LCR types of G3BP1</p><p>→ an interesting trend of proteins with many similar LCRs playing scaffolding roles across diverse assemblies</p><p>3) Dotplots can identify LCR types and their respective copy numbers.</p><p>4) Given points 1, 2, and 3 above, performing a systematic dotplot approach to identify LCR type and copy relationships may provide biological insights. These include, but are not limited to newly identifying proteins which have LCR relationships like known ones such as G3BP1 and may function similarly, identifying potential scaffold proteins on the basis of many similar LCRs (as we do in Figure 4 and 6), or learning more general patterns of LCR type and copy number. This line of reasoning serves as the motivation to develop and implement the systematic approach which we use in the rest of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>LCR3 (as the authors define it) is not even particularly arginine rich (4/23 Arg residues) (LRGPGGPRGGLGGGMRGPPRGGM), the RGG domain of G3BP1 contains 11 arginine residues, so most of the arginine's that drive RNA binding actually fall outside of the &quot;arginine-rich LCR3&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not refer to LCR3 as ‘arginine-rich’.

We acknowledge that we may be missing something, but we ask the reviewer to consider our reasoning for why we believe it is outside the scope, as follows:</p><p>The hypothesis that the reviewer is proposing, as we understand it, is that</p><p>1) If the amino acids which make up certain LCR bridges are encoded by codons close in codon distance (i.e. 'AGT' for Serine to 'AGA' for Arginine), then</p><p>2) this may be a sufficient explanation for the existence of these bridges,</p><p>and so</p><p>3) the sequences in the bridge are unlikely to be functional.</p><p>While we agree that conceptually this line of reasoning is valid and that it is often used in the absence of functional information, we believe that functional information can be used to test this hypothesis with the following logic: if bridges which correspond to amino acids which are close in codon distance are indeed functional, then these codon similarities do not point to a lack of function. Instead, they may point to interesting hypotheses about how these LCRs arose from ancestral sequences.</p><p>As we mention in the section corresponding to Figure 3 and the discussion, there are sequence bridges which are functional (e.g. RS domains for nuclear speckles). This is despite their codons being similar in sequence (Serine – AGT/AGC, Arginine – AGA/AGG). Thus, even if points 1 and 2 are true in the reasoning above (as is the case for RS domains), point 3 does not necessarily follow.</p><p>Based on this interpretation of the reviewer's comment, this concern only applies to the question of how LCRs originate, which is not within the scope of the paper. This is not to say that we don't find the question fascinating–these questions were a topic of much discussion when pursuing this project–we just think it would be better suited for further studies which can give this topic a more focused and comprehensive treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>LCRs are short</p><p>One thing I had not appreciated in the original manuscript is that the LCRs are short. In the human proteome, 87% of LCRs are 20 residues or shorter. This to me makes me wonder if LCR is really the right term. The LCRs identified previously have generally been large domains, while here LCRs are functionally of the same length as motifs, should these perhaps be defined as LCMs (low complexity motifs) more</p></disp-quote><p>It is unclear to us which previously identified LCRs the reviewer is referring to here. In the absence of that, we compared the length distribution of our LCR calls with that of SEG to evaluate the reviewer comment. Based on the results of this comparison, which can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>, we believe our approach calls LCRs of reasonable length.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77058-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>For SEG, 75% of LCRs called are 20 residues or shorter, and the 87th percentile is only at 26 residues in length (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). We do not find this different enough from the LCR lengths called using dotplots to justify a different classification for the sequences identified with our approach, especially given that SEG fuses LCRs in proximity to each other and as such may result in a length distribution shifted toward longer sequences (as we discussed in our response to the previous round of review).</p></body></sub-article></article>
