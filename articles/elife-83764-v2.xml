diagnoses and treatment, presenting challenges and uncertainties for both patients and physicians. We conducted a nationwide online survey to investigate the effects of the pandemic and capture modifications, prompted by pandemic-related control measures, on cervical cancer screening-related activities from mid-March to mid-August 2020, across Canada.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>The survey consisted of 61 questions related to the continuum of care in cervical cancer screening and treatment: appointment scheduling, tests, colposcopy, follow-up, treatment of pre-cancerous lesions/cancer, and telemedicine. We piloted the survey with 21 Canadian experts in cervical cancer prevention and care. We partnered with the Society of Canadian Colposcopists, Society of Gynecologic Oncology of Canada, Canadian Association of Pathologists, and Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, which distributed the survey to their members via email. We reached out to family physicians and nurse practitioners via MDBriefCase. The survey was also posted on McGill Channels (Department of Family Medicine News and Events) and social media platforms. The data were analyzed descriptively.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Unique responses were collected from 510 participants (November 16, 2020, to February 28, 2021), representing 418 fully and 92 partially completed surveys. Responses were from Ontario (41.0%), British Columbia (21.0%), and Alberta (12.8%), and mostly comprised family physicians/general practitioners (43.7%), and gynecologist/obstetrician professionals (21.6%). Cancelled screening appointments were mainly reported by family physicians/general practitioners (28.3%), followed by gynecologist/obstetrician professionals (19.8%), and primarily occurred in private clinics (30.5%). Decreases in the number of screening Pap tests and colposcopy procedures were consistently observed across Canadian provinces. About 90% reported that their practice/institution adopted telemedicine to communicate with patients.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The area most severely impacted by the pandemic was appointment scheduling, with an important level of cancellations reported. Survey results may inform resumptions of various fronts in cervical cancer screening and management.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>The present work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (operating grant COVID-19 May 2020 Rapid Research Funding Opportunity VR5-172666 Rapid Research competition and foundation grant 143347 to Eduardo L Franco). Eliya Farah and Rami Ali each received an MSc stipend from the Department of Oncology, McGill University.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cervical cancer is a common cancer among women caused by infections with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Nearly four in five people are infected with HPV during their lifetime, making it the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Vaccination against the virus can prevent infections and routine screening for precancerous lesions can enable early diagnosis and treatment, improving outcomes.</p><p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine cervical cancer screening programs in several countries. This has caused delays in screening, which could result in more women being diagnosed with advanced-stage cancers.</p><p>El-Zein et al. showed that despite the interrupted screening programmes, about half of practices in Canada were able to catch up on delayed screening by February 2021. Between November 2020 and February 2021, El-Zein et al. surveyed 510 Canadian healthcare professionals involved in cervical cancer screening and treatment. About 64%-75% of the respondents reported canceled or postponed screening appointments. Most appointment delays were less than four months. Fewer than one in ten delays were longer than six months.</p><p>Most survey respondents said their practices pivoted to using telemedicine for some patient visits, such as cervical cancer screening follow-ups. About 40% of respondents suggested that the pandemic provided support to alternative screening options, such as HPV self-sampling at home. The survey results may help healthcare professionals and policymakers to develop plans that mitigate disruptions to cervical cancer screening during future emergencies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>COVID-19 pandemic</kwd><kwd>cervical cancer screening</kwd><kwd>survey</kwd><kwd>healthcare practitioners</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VR5-172666</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>Eduardo L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Decline in cervical cancer screening and challenges faced by healthcare professionals and patients when the pandemic was declared emphasize the importance of implementing human papillomavirus (HPV) primary screening, HPV self-sampling, and telemedicine to continue cervical cancer screening and care.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Following the announcement of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by the World Health Organization in mid-March 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghebreyesus, 2020</xref>), the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe, resulting in enough severe illness to overwhelm the healthcare system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blumenthal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McMahon et al., 2020</xref>). The immediate, preventive measures taken in response have adversely affected an entire range of activities, specifically those related to cancer control, prevention, and care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farah et al., 2021</xref>). As a result, cancer screening and treatment services have been scaled back to conserve resources, increase capacity for managing COVID-19 patients, and lower the risk of infections among cancer patients worldwide, particularly during full and partial lockdown periods. Elective surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy procedures have been postponed or modified, which necessitated rapid adaptation by the medical community and adjustment in health services, including the use of telehealth. About one-third of family medicine physicians in North America reported delaying cancer screening in the early phase of the pandemic and while some physicians reported high use of telehealth, most reported that reductions in cancer screenings would lead to increased incidence of late-stage cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Price et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Significant decreases in cancer diagnoses have been reported in multiple affected countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dinmohamed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cancer Australia, 2020</xref>), alongside challenges in delivering timely cancer care to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gourd, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wilkinson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maringe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen-See, 2020</xref>). According to a survey carried out between May 22 and June 10, 2020, by the Canadian Cancer Survivor Network, 54% of patients reported that their cancer care-related appointments were cancelled, postponed, or rescheduled due to the pandemic, and 71% expressed concerns about their ability to receive proper care, testing, and follow-up appointments in a timely fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Canadian Cancer Survivor Network, 2020</xref>). A stochastic microsimulation model using data from the Canadian Cancer Registry predicted that pandemic-related cancer care disruptions (March 2020 to June 2021) could lead to 21,247 (2.0%) more cancer deaths in Canada between 2020 and 2030, if treatment capacity in 2021 were to recover to 2019 pre-pandemic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Malagón et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Breast and cervical cancer screening tests in the United States declined by 87% and 84%, respectively, during April 2020 compared with the previous 5-year averages for the month of April (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeGroff et al., 2021</xref>). In Ontario, Canada, there were 41% fewer screening tests delivered in 2020 for breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer than in 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Walker et al., 2021</xref>). A population-based study in Ontario, Canada, found that, between March and August 2020, the average monthly number of cytology tests, colposcopies, and treatments decreased by 63.8%, 39.7%, and 31.1%, respectively, compared to the same months in 2019 and that on average there were 292 fewer high-grade cytological abnormalities (decrease by 51.0%) detected each month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meggetto et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We conducted a national cross-sectional survey-based descriptive study among healthcare professionals to (1) assess and portray the early impact of the pandemic on cervical cancer screening, diagnosis, management, and treatment services across Canada, (2) identify actionable approaches used by experts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on their practice, and (3) identify windows of opportunity that were created by the pandemic and pinpoint positive aspects that could potentially enable the transformation of cervical cancer screening.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Target population</title><p>The survey questions were formulated to gather the opinions and firsthand experiences of colposcopists, colposcopy registered nurses, registered practical nurses, cytopathologists, technologists, general practitioners, family physicians, obstetrician and gynecology staff, gynecological oncologists, gynecology nurses, pathologists, and physician assistants working in private and public health institutions in Canada.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Survey design, development, and validation</title><p>We used the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) to guide survey development and reporting of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eysenbach, 2004</xref>). The survey (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), designed by members of the research team, consisted of 61 questions including informed e-consent and occupational demographics (questions Q2-Q5) such as attributes of the specialty, provider type, and affiliations of respondents. It was constructed around five themes related to screening practice (Q6-Q37), treatment of pre-cancerous lesions and cancer (Q38-Q42), telemedicine (Q43-Q47), over- and under-screening in the pre-COVID-19 era (Q48-Q51), and resumption of in-person practice (Q52-Q61). The first two themes covered a range of questions that reflected the continuum of care in cervical cancer screening and management. The screening practice theme included sub-sections focusing on appointment scheduling (Q6-Q13), screening tests (Q14-Q21), human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling (Q22-Q23), colposcopy (Q24-Q29), and screening follow-up (Q30-Q37). Questions 6 through 47 were designed to collect data during the early COVID-19 period spanning from mid-March until mid-August 2020. For questions pertaining to the ‘resumption of in-person practice’, the period of interest was from mid-August 2020 until the date of survey completion. We also collected data on sex and age of the respondents. Respondents were asked to provide their impressions and best estimates when completing the survey, without necessarily confirming the proportions that they reported with their institution’s statistics.</p><p>For content validation and to determine question suitability and flow prior to the launch of the online survey, we conducted three iterative rounds of pilot testing by distributing the initial survey questionnaire to members of the Survey Study Group, consisting of 21 leading cervical cancer specialists and physicians in Canada who were not involved in study conception or design. Collective feedback in terms of relevance, appropriateness, and clarity of theme-related questions, as well as questionnaire length, was incorporated into the survey after each round; it was also used to refine the wording, type, and order of questions. Most were closed-ended (nominal, ordinal, and Likert-type questions), with few free-text questions and sub-questions that required elaborated responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Survey administration and data management</title><p>The survey, constructed as a web-based questionnaire (originally developed in English and translated to French), was administered using LimeSurvey, an online-based survey tool hosted by McGill University. It was pretested by our research team and the panel of experts to ensure experiential functionality and valid data collection.</p><p>Several professional societies advertised and disseminated the survey via their email newsletter to respective members. These included the Society of Canadian Colposcopists (SCC; first email sent on November 18, 2020), Society of Gynecologic Oncology of Canada (GOC; first email sent on November 27, 2020), Canadian Association of Pathologists (CAP; first email sent on November 18, 2020), and Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC; first email sent on January 18, 2021). We reached out to primary care providers (i.e., family physicians, as well as general and nurse practitioners) via MDBriefCase (first email sent on February 7, 2021), which provides online continuing professional development to healthcare practitioners. Other platforms were also utilized to reach our targeted population, including posting a link to participate on the McGill Department of Family Medicine website, sending a request for participation letter containing the link to the listserv of the Chairs of Departments of Family Medicine across Canada, and social media platforms (LinkedIn and Twitter). The bilingual invitations to voluntary participate contained an email link to the web-based questionnaire survey. Two reminder emails – reiterating the objectives of the survey, inclusion criteria, and the survey link – were sent periodically (every 3–4 weeks).</p><p>Upon first entry to the survey portal, an informed e-consent form included a description of the survey, its objectives, and assurance of confidentiality of survey responses. Respondents who did not provide e-consent were unable to proceed to the survey questions. The platform allowed respondents to navigate between the different themes to revise their answers, if needed. Respondents received a $5 Starbucks gift card incentive upon completion of the survey, conditional on providing a valid email address.</p><p>The survey data, collected anonymously (no personal identifiers or IP addresses), were imported from LimeSurvey and curated in Excel (data cleaning and validation). We applied a two-step process to determine inclusion, the first based on eligibility criteria (target population) and the second on quality checks by flagging suspicious responses in open-ended questions. These questions entailed providing justification in Q22 and Q23 (if yes, no, or maybe, briefly justify); specification in Q47, Q54 (if other, specify), and Q61; description in Q60 (if yes, briefly describe); and any additional comments at the end of the survey.</p><p>Analyses included descriptive statistics and summaries of responses by province/territory (Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, all other provinces, and territories), profession (primary care [i.e., general practitioners, family physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants]; secondary care involving clinical diagnosis [i.e., colposcopists and colposcopy registered nurses/register nurse practitioners]; secondary care involving cytopathological diagnosis [i.e., cytopathologists and pathologists]; and tertiary care involving gynecology and related activities [i.e., gynecological oncologists, gynecologists, obstetrician-gynecologists, and gynecology nurses]), and place of practice (university-affiliated hospital, community hospital, public clinic, private clinic, community health center, and other). When responses to a given question were incomplete, we used the total number of complete responses as the denominator. Open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis. Excel and SAS version 9.4 were used for data cleaning/visualization and analysis, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Survey administration and responses</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, 778 potentially eligible respondents clicked on the survey link.

Several topics were discerned among the diverse raw responses for each open question. Around 40% of respondents mentioned that the pandemic would facilitate HPV self-sampling and is a favorable approach to implement in cervical cancer screening. Several challenges were described including operational, implementation, and evaluation considerations as well as healthcare system considerations. Of the 206 responses to Q22, 30 survey respondents stated that they were not familiar with HPV self-sampling, whether it be with the mechanism or validity of the test. The vast majority of those who were not familiar with HPV self-sampling were primary care providers (90.0%), and the largest proportion were in Ontario (43.3%) and worked in private clinics (56.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>). Similarly, 60 of the 197 respondents to Q23 explained that they were not familiar enough with HPV self-sampling to express a favorable or unfavorable opinion about its implementation as an alternative screening method. Of those, most were in Ontario (56.7%), were primary care providers (75.0%), and worked in private clinics (40.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>). Not surprisingly, of those who responded that they were ‘maybe’ in favor of implementing HPV self-sampling as an alternative screening procedure, 47.1% (49/104) reported that they were not familiar enough with this screening modality to express their view. Respondents identified additional interactions deemed appropriate to convert to telemedicine, such as counselling services, follow-up with the patient, discussion of treatment options, and research-related activities. A substantial portion (36.2%) stated that no measures were implemented by their practice/institution to catch up with cancellations, postponements, and ongoing delays. Almost one-quarter of respondents to Q52 (24.7%) were forced to interrupt the services at their practice or institution for between 2 and 4 months due to the pandemic, and 13.1% reported interruptions of over 6 months. Many of those who did not experience interruptions to their practice (11.2%) described severely reduced services, deferral of patients with lower risk or lower grade disease, and use of telemedicine. Respondents had different interpretations of Q60; whereas a few reported the continuation of regular practice (10.3%) and use of personal protective equipment (4.4%) to screen COVID-19-positive patients, most (54.4%) reported that appointments were deferred until after the patient’s isolation period. When asked about which cervical cancer screening guidelines the respondent’s practice/institution has been following, 63.5% answered governmental and 17.3% answered professional association/society.</p><table-wrap id="table6" position="float"><label>Table 6.</label><caption><title>Content analysis of open-ended questions.</title></caption><table frame="hsides"

Overall responses were reflective of the decline in cervical cancer screening and the challenges healthcare professionals faced when the pandemic was declared.</p><p>The pandemic’s negative consequences and collateral damage have been consistently observed on an international level in relation to the pauses/postponed cancer screening programs. Screening rates in the United States had dropped 35% below averages of previous years (2017–2019) in the period of January to June 2020, with an estimated 40,000 missing screening tests through March to June (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cox et al., 2021</xref>).

A modeling study in the United Kingdom found that a 2-month delay in the 2-week-wait investigatory referrals for suspected cancer can lead to an estimated loss of 0–0.7 life-years per patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sud et al., 2020</xref>). In the Netherlands, a notable decrease in cancer diagnoses between February 24, 2020, and April 12, 2020, was also reported compared with the period before the COVID-19 outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dinmohamed et al., 2020</xref>). Decreases were observed in another study conducted in Hong Kong, where weekly colorectal cancer diagnoses had fallen by 54% during the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lui et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Particularly for cervical cancer, a 2-month screening lockdown between March 12, and May 8, 2020, in Slovenia resulted in a rapid decline in screening (–92%), follow-up (–70%), and HPV triage tests (–68%), in addition to invasive diagnostic (–47%) and treatment (–15%) of cervical lesions, compared to a 3-year average of years 2017–2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ivanuš et al., 2021</xref>). An 83% decrease in the number of Pap tests was seen in Manitoba, Canada, in April 2020, most likely related to limited accessibility to primary healthcare providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decker et al., 2022</xref>). During the first 6 months of the pandemic in Ontario, Canada, there was a decrease in the monthly average number of Pap tests (–63.8%), colposcopies (–39.7%), and treatments (–31.1%), compared with the corresponding months in 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meggetto et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, modeling data have consistently predicted an excess of cervical cancer cases and deaths caused by the scaling down of cervical screening and treatment services due to COVID-19 disruptions and resource constraints. Under a cytology-based screening model, suspensions of 6 and 24 months in the screening continuum in the United States were estimated to yield an additional 5–7 and an additional 25–27 cases of cervical cancer, respectively, by 2027. The numbers of increased cases were greater for women previously screened with cytology compared with co-testing (cytology plus HPV testing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burger et al., 2021</xref>). A 25.7% decrease in diagnosis of low stage cervical cancer was observed in the North of England during the pandemic compared to 2019 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2022</xref>). The authors estimated a total of 919 cases of cervical cancer will by 2023, compared to 233 cases pre-COVID (May to October 2019), caused by a lack of diagnosis of established cases and an excess of cases caused by lack of screening. In India, delays in diagnoses and treatment were estimated to result in a 2.5% (n=795) to 3.8% (n=2160) lifetime increase in the deaths caused by cervical cancer, compared to no delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gupta et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our survey results pointed to a potential for the use of self-collected samples for HPV-based screening and the need for adaptability. The World Health Organization’s call to eliminate cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>) has motivated efforts across the globe to scale up screening services and introduce a paradigm shift in cervical screening by implementing HPV-based programs. HPV self-sampling addresses the challenges of COVID-19 (need for social distance and a possibility of at-home sample collection) and women’s empowerment (samples collected by women themselves), thus offering a socially distanced approach that will substantially reduce the need for clinic appointments. Along the same lines, our results highlight the important role that telemedicine has played in mitigating the effects of delays in cervical cancer screening and follow-up and reducing the backlog faced upon the resumption of in-person practice.</p><p>There are some limitations to our purely descriptive study that need to be acknowledged. First, we were unable to fully reach out to general practitioners and family physicians who are mostly involved at the forefront of cervical cancer screening processes. The College of Family Physicians of Canada did not approve circulating the survey to their members to avoid inconveniencing them with external activities. However, we commissioned MDBriefCase to publicize the survey to community primary care providers. We also reached out to family physicians in academic medicine within university networks. Second, the non-response rate cannot be calculated due to the recruitment methods used (including advertisement of the survey on social media) and lack of information on the population of interest (number of professionals approached). However, our survey and findings should be considered on their merits; the target population was involved in the survey design to ensure the validity of coverage of the questions along the continuum of care in cervical cancer screening and treatment. Finally, 34% of surveys were excluded. Most often, this was because we did not include a screening question to ensure respondents were eligible to participate. Less often, there were multiple entries by the same respondent which could have resulted from the use of a snowball method (particularly via social media) and the lack of unique IP addresses. Our survey collection strategy did not enable validation of the respondent’s eligibility to participate in the survey. However, we used the answers to the demographic and open-ended questions to determine eligibility and legitimacy of the responses and verified that there were no duplicate surveys submitted. In all, most respondents carefully answered and provided candid views.</p><p>The strengths of this survey study are its Pan-Canadian scope and design querying five themes of the cervical cancer screening and treatment continuum, the widely publicized approach and endorsements by professional societies and organizations, and the participation of multiple health professional disciplines. Although the survey only provides a snapshot of the extent of the harms to key cervical cancer screening and follow-up services at the beginning of the pandemic, further research and ongoing monitoring of health services utilization are needed to understand the full impact. However, our findings identified several key lessons for future response efforts and highlight the need for (1) properly formulated recommendations and strategies that would help mitigate the negative outcomes of the pandemic, (2) development of potential recovery strategies (i.e., risk-based triage systems as well as awareness campaigns on the importance and value of cervical cancer screening) for resuming routine cervical cancer screening, and (3) help building resilience in screening processes. Our survey provides evidence to support the implementation of HPV-based programs and the use of telemedicine to continue cervical cancer screening, treatment, and follow-ups and reduce backlogs while mitigating inconveniences to both patients and healthcare professionals. In addition, insights from the survey could inform epidemiological modeling studies of the long-term effects of the interruptions and delays in screening activities on cervical cancer morbidity and mortality.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>received an MSc. stipend from the Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology, McGill University</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Senior editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Provided feedback on the relevance, appropriateness, and clarity of theme-related survey questions, and on questionnaire length</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The Faculty of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB) of McGill University granted ethical approval for this work on October 27, 2020 (IRB Internal Study Number: A10-B84-20A).
