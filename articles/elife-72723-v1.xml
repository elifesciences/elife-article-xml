The mechanisms regulating the end of neural crest ontogeny are poorly understood. Whereas early crest development is stimulated by mesoderm-derived retinoic acid, we report that the end of the neural crest period is regulated by retinoic acid synthesized in the dorsal neural tube. Inhibition of retinoic acid signaling in the neural tube prevents the normal upregulation of BMP inhibitors in the nascent roof plate and prolongs the period of BMP responsiveness which otherwise ceases close to roof plate establishment. Consequently, neural crest production and emigration are extended well into the roof plate stage. In turn, extending the activity of neural crest-specific genes inhibits the onset of retinoic acid synthesis in roof plate suggesting a mutual repressive interaction between neural crest and roof plate traits. Although several roof plate-specific genes are normally expressed in the absence of retinoic acid signaling, roof plate and crest markers are co-expressed in single cells and this domain also contains dorsal interneurons. Hence, the cellular and molecular architecture of the roof plate is compromised. Collectively, our results demonstrate that neural tube-derived retinoic acid, via inhibition of BMP signaling, is an essential factor responsible for the end of neural crest generation and the proper segregation of dorsal neural lineages.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The division between the central nervous system – formed by the brain and spinal cord – and the peripheral nervous system – which consists of the neurons that sense and relay information to and from the body – takes place early during embryonic development. Initially, the nervous system consists of a tube of cells called the neural tube. From the top region of this tube, some cells change their shape, exit the tube and migrate to different places in the developing body. These cells are called the ‘neural crest’, and they form many different structures, including the peripheral nervous system.</p><p>Neural crest cells keep leaving the neural tube for a period of time, but after that, the neural tube stops producing them. At this point, the region of the neural tube that had been producing neural crest cells becomes the ‘roof plate’ of the central nervous system, a structure that is essential for the development of specific groups of neurons in the brain and spinal cord.</p><p>In bird embryos, a protein called bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) is essential for neural crest production because it triggers the migration of these cells away from the neural tube. Before the roof plate is formed, the activity of BMP is blocked by proteins known as BMP inhibitors, which stop more cells from leaving the neural tube. Around the time when neural crest formation stops, another molecule called retinoic acid begins to be synthesized in the top region of the neural tube. Rekler and Kalcheim asked whether retinoic acid is involved in the transition from neural crest to roof plate.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, Rekler and Kalcheim blocked the activity of retinoic acid in the neural tube of quail embryos at the time when they should stop producing neural crest cells. This resulted in embryos in which the neural tube keeps producing neural crest cells after the roof plate has formed. In these embryos, individual cells in the resulting ‘roof plate’ produced both proteins that are normally only found in neural crest cells, and proteins typically exclusive to the roof plate. This suggests that, in the absence of retinoic acid activity, the segregation of neural crest identity from roof plate identity is compromised.</p><p>Rekler and Kalcheim also found that, in the embryos where retinoic acid activity had been blocked, the cells in the area where the roof plate should be produced virtually no BMP inhibitors, and exhibited extended BMP activity. This allowed neural crest cells to continue forming and migrating away from the neural tube well after the period when they would stop in a normal embryo. These results indicate that retinoic acid stops the production of neural crest cells by repressing BMP activity in the roof plate of the neural tube.</p><p>Rekler and Kalcheim’s experiments shed light on the mechanisms that allow the central and peripheral nervous systems to become segregated. This could increase our understanding of the origin of several neurodevelopmental disorders, potentially providing insights into their treatment or prevention. Additionally, the process of neural crest production and exit from the neural tube is highly similar to the process of metastasis in many invasive cancers. Thus, by understanding how the production of neural crest cells is terminated, it may be possible to learn how to prevent malignant cancer cells from spreading through the body.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>quail</kwd><kwd>neural crest</kwd><kwd>roof plate</kwd><kwd>retinoic acid</kwd><kwd>bmp</kwd><kwd>somite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Japanese Quail</kwd><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>209/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kalcheim</surname><given-names>Chaya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ines Mandl Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kalcheim</surname><given-names>Chaya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>BMP-dependent retinoic acid signaling is responsible for the separation of central from peripheral lineages during neural development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The generation of cell type diversity during normal development takes place in a stereotypic sequence and a spatially regulated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holguera and Desplan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</xref>). An example of such a precision is the development of the central and peripheral subdivisions of the nervous system (CNS and PNS), that arise from a common domain in the dorsal neural tube (NT). This domain sequentially generates neural crest cells (NC), progenitors of the peripheral nervous system (PNS)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bronner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le Douarin and Kalcheim, 1999</xref>), followed by the definitive roof plate (RP) of the CNS, which is flanked ventrally by dorsal interneuron populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chizhikov and Millen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helms and Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kalcheim and Kumar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krispin et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>At trunk levels of the avian axis, NC progenitors sequentially emigrate from the NT for a period of about two days while actively proliferating before and after delamination and largely synchronizing to the S-phase of the cell cycle during the emigration event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burstyn-Cohen and Kalcheim, 2002</xref>). Lineage-tracing experiments showed that RP progenitors originate ventral to the cohort of premigratory NC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krispin et al., 2010b</xref>). As a result of continuous cell emigration, RP precursors undergo a ventro-dorsal shift and, upon completion of NC departure, they reach the dorsal midline of the NT and form the definitive RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krispin et al., 2010b</xref>). RP progenitors gradually exit the cell cycle to become post-mitotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kahane and Kalcheim, 1998</xref>), and function primarily as a dorsal organizer, providing a gradient of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) and Wnt activity which is crucial for development of dorsal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chizhikov and Millen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Le Dréau and Martí, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muroyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zechner et al., 2007</xref>) and for proliferation of ependymal cells at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shinozuka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xing et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Many aspects of early NC ontogeny were extensively studied, from induction to specification, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and emigration. Yet, virtually nothing is known about the mechanisms underlying the end of NC production and transition to definitive RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rekler and Kalcheim, 2021</xref>).</p><p>BMP has been found to regulate several aspects of NC development. In the early neurula, BMP is derived from the non-neural ectoderm and participates in NC induction at the neural plate border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Endo et al., 2002</xref>). Upon closure of the NT, cells of the dorsal domain synthesize and secrete BMP, which acts in a graded rostro-caudal fashion to activate Wnt signaling and a network of downstream genes that altogether promote NC EMT and emigration (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalcheim, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Theveneau and Mayor, 2012a</xref>).</p><p>A first step toward understanding the segregation between NC and RP, was the finding that approaching the end of the NC production in the avian embryo, the dorsal NT becomes insensitive to BMP, even though this factor continues to be produced by nascent RP cells. This suggested that local downregulation of BMP signaling is necessary for the end of NC stage, a conclusion further illustrated by a premature cessation of NC proliferation and delamination upon early inhibition of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>). These events were mediated by the transcription factor HES1/Hairy1, as early misexpression of <italic>hes1/hairy1</italic> in the dorsal NT led to a downregulation of the <italic>Alk3</italic> BMP receptor and of pSmad activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>However, the factors that orchestrate these BMP-dependent processes, leading to cessation of NC production, segregation of NC and RP lineages, and formation of the definitive RP, remain unknown. Along this line, whether cessation of NC production and RP development are regulated by the same or by independent mechanisms is yet to be elucidated.</p><p>A recent RNA-seq analysis revealed transcriptional heterogeneity between premigratory NC and definitive RP cells, uncovering a set of genes expressed specifically at the onset of the RP stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ofek et al., 2021</xref>). One of these genes is <italic>Raldh2/Aldh1a2</italic>, that encodes an enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the morphogen retinoic acid (RA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haselbeck et al., 1999</xref>), central to multiple neurodevelopmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diez del Corral and Morales, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lara-Ramírez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>). RA derived from the <italic>Raldh2</italic>-expressing somitic mesoderm has been described as a key factor in NT development, including control of motoneuron specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Novitch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>) and initiation but not maintenance of NC EMT and emigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martínez-Morales et al., 2011</xref>). Although expression of <italic>Raldh2</italic> in the dorsal NT was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berggren et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blentic et al., 2003</xref>), its precise temporal dynamics vis-à-vis NC/RP phases and function/s have not been characterized. Hence, the discovery of local RA production in the dorsal NT only by the end of the NC stage prompted us to hypothesize a role for RA in events concerning the late NC.</p><p>In this study, we unravel a fundamental role of dorsal NT-derived RA in controlling the end of NC production. Using two separate tools to inhibit RA signaling in the quail embryo, we demonstrate that RA is responsible for downregulation of BMP signaling in the dorsal NT. In the absence of RA signaling, cells in the dorsal NT retain expression of NC markers well into the RP stage which also displays additional NC traits such as a high mitotic rate and impaired epithelial properties. Furthermore, we show that lack of RA signaling prolongs cell delamination into the RP stage. The latter effect is abrogated by concomitant inhibition of BMP signaling, suggesting that the RA-dependent extension of NC EMT is also mediated by BMP. Whereas RA signaling represses expression of NC genes such as <italic>foxd3, snai2,</italic> and <italic>sox9</italic>, extending the activity of the latter beyond the NC stage inhibits transcription of <italic>Raldh2</italic> in the RP, suggesting that NC and RP traits stand in a mutual cross-repressive interaction. Remarkably, maintenance of NC traits in the dorsal NT does not prevent the advent of RP traits, or RP-dependent specification of dorsal interneurons. Rather, in the absence of RA activity, the spatial and temporal segregation of dorsal lineages, as well as the structural integrity of this signaling center, are compromised.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RA is both produced and active in the nascent RP</title><p>The spatio-temporal dynamics of RA, including synthesis, degradation, and activity, was examined in the trunk of quail embryos from stages corresponding to NC production until formation of the nascent RP. RA is produced from retinol via two consecutive reactions: first, retinol is converted to retinaldehyde by RDH enzymes, then it is oxidized to RA by RALDH/ALDH1; additionally, CYP1B1 catalyzes both reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chambers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reijntjes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rhinn and Dollé, 2012</xref>).

Subsequently, when approaching the RP stage, although BMP is still produced by the nascent RP, the latter becomes refractory to it, likely via downregulation of BMP receptor 1 A (<italic>Alk3</italic>), and upregulation of BMP inhibitory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ofek et al., 2021</xref>). The onset of <italic>Raldh2</italic> synthesis close to RP development prompted us to hypothesize that RA, locally produced in the dorsal NT, regulates this dynamic cellular behavior vis-a-vis BMP. To this end, we implemented two independent means to inhibit RA activity in vivo: (1) RARα403 - a truncated human RA receptor that lacks the transactivation domain and therefore acts in a dominant-negative fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gupta and Sen, 2015</xref>), and (2) Cyp26A1 which encodes a RA-degrading enzyme.</p><p>First, the efficacy of these constructs was tested by co-electroporation with RARE-RFP. RFP intensity was significantly reduced by 79% and 88% in Cyp26A1- and RARα403-electroporated embryos, respectively, when compared to GFP-only controls. Similarly, RARα403 almost completely abolished the RARE-AP signal observed in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, both RARα403 and Cyp26A1 can be effectively used to examine the consequences of RA signaling inhibition.</p><p>Next, we investigated the effect of RA on the dynamics of BMP signaling. First, we monitored pSmad 1/5/9 expression, a readout of BMP activity, at the NC stage. Control GFP was delivered to embryos aged 27 somite pairs followed by fixation 12 hr later. pSmad was strongly expressed in the dorsal NT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and A’</xref>), corroborating previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>). In parallel, NTs were electroporated at E2.5 (27 somite pairs at the level of epithelial somites, NC stage) with either RARα403 or Cyp26A1 and analyzed 2 days later (E4, RP stage). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>), the RP of control embryos was already devoid of BMP activity at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and B’</xref>, arrows). In contrast, the RP domain of embryos treated with either RARα403 or Cyp26A1 was pSmad-positive, indicating a failure to normally downregulate BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D’</xref>, arrowheads). The dI1 progenitor population of dorsal interneurons, located ventral to the RP, was also pSmad-positive, consistent with its dependency on BMP for proper development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duval et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tozer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wine-Lee et al., 2004</xref>). Quantification of pSmad intensity confirmed a significant increase in Cyp26A1 and RARα403-treated embryos compared to controls. This was apparent even if measurement of pSmad intensity comprised the dorsal NT from its midline to the ventral border of pSmad<sup>+</sup> staining, that included dI1 progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Furthermore <italic>hairy1/qHes4</italic>, and the known BMP inhibitors <italic>BAMBI</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brazil et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Grem1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2006</xref>), were unraveled as specific RP markers in a recent RNA-seq analysis comparing dorsal NT cells at both premigratory NC and RP stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ofek et al., 2021</xref>).

These results show that the downregulation of BMP signaling by RA is accounted for, at least partially, by upregulation of BMP inhibitory genes.</p><p>In a previous study, we reported that BMP-dependent emigration of NC cells is mediated by Wnt activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2004</xref>). A dynamic behavior of Wnt pathway genes between NC and RP stages was also evident in a RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This raised the possibility that, in the absence of RA, extended BMP signaling at the RP stage would be associated with enhanced Wnt activity. To this end, we assessed Wnt signaling in NC and RP by electroporating a destabilized Wnt reporter, 12XTopFlashd2GFP, together with control RFP. Whereas significant activity of the Wnt pathway was observed in the early dorsal NT and emigrating NC cells, a substantial decrease in 12XTopFlashd2GFP expression was apparent in the normal RP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-B'</xref>, D). In contrast, a significantly enhanced expression was measured in the RP of RARα403-transfected NTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C-D</xref>). These results show that inhibition of RA signaling extends Wnt activity into the RP stage by preventing its normal downregulation during the transition from NC to RP.

If that were true, then inhibition of BMP with Smad6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>), should be without effect on cell emigration induced by RARα403 at the RP stage.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, embryos aged E2 were bilaterally electroporated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom) with either control GFP, RARα403 to induce late NC delamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>), with Smad6, or with both RARα403 and Smad6. At E3.5, control GFP was bilaterally delivered to all embryos and the outcome was analyzed at E4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In all cases, RFP-labeled cells that indicate the efficiency of early transfections, successfully delaminated from the NT. In contrast, under control conditions, few or no GFP-labeled cells delaminated from the NT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–E’1</xref>), consistent with the second electroporation being done following the end of NC emigration. As also shown above, in RARα403-treated embryos, a substantial number of GFP-labeled cells had emigrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–F’1</xref> and see also D). As expected from late electroporations, treatment with Smad6 alone resembled the control situation with few delaminated GFP<sup>+</sup> cells at the RP stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–G’1</xref>). Co-transfection of Smad6 and RARα403 inhibited the RARα403-dependent extension of cellular EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–H’1</xref>). Together, these results suggest that late RA signaling ends the period of cell emigration in a BMP-dependent manner.</p><p>Next, we examined whether the late-delaminating cells exhibit a NC identity. For this purpose, embryos double-electroporated as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> were immunostained for the NC marker HNK1. While in control embryos no GFP-labeled cells were apparent outside the NT, and HNK1 stained only NC derivatives such as dorsal ganglia and ventral roots, in RARα403-treated embryos a considerable number of GFP<sup>+</sup>HNK1<sup>+</sup> cells was also detected in the mesenchyme near the NT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B''</xref>, arrowheads in B-B”). Remarkably, 95% ± 0.8% of the late-delaminating GFP-labeled cells were HNK1<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), confirming their NC nature.</p><p>In addition, we examined the pattern of <italic>foxd3</italic>, which is expressed both in premigratory and migrating NC cells. Embryos were electroporated with RARα403 along with GFP at E2.5 and analyzed at E4.

Likewise, RA activity is also apparent in NT at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>), suggesting that NC production and emigration are compatible with the endogenous level of RA signaling observed. Since repressing intrinsic RA activity prolongs NC-specific behaviors, we examined whether gain of RA function beyond the normal level of activity could inhibit prematurely the occurrence of NC traits. To this end, we electroporated a constitutively active form of human RAR-alpha fused to the transcriptional activator domain of VP16 (VP16-RARα) that activates RA target genes in a ligand-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Novitch et al., 2003</xref>). VP16-RARα significantly enhanced RA signaling, as measured with a short-lived RARE reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). Next, we monitored BMP activity (pSmad1/5/9), expression of Sox9 protein and <italic>foxd3</italic> mRNA in embryos fixed at advanced stages of NC production prior to the normal downregulation of the above. The number of sections or segments with pSmad, Sox9, or <italic>foxd3</italic> expression did not differ between control and VP16-RARα-treated cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D-N</xref>, see details in legend). Next, the extent of NC emigration was reduced by 19% (p = 0.065, not significant) in VP16-RARα compared to control GFP-transfected NTs. Although this could reflect a tendency to a premature end of NC EMT, this limited effect could also be accounted for by death of some VP16-RARα−transfected cells, frequently observed in the lumen of the experimental cases, but not in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together, whereas RA signaling is necessary for the end of NC EMT and associated events, it is not sufficient to prematurely end these processes. This could suggest that it is not the sole activity of RA in the NT that causes the end of NC EMT but rather an interplay between RA signaling in the context of a gene network that changes between NC and nascent RP stages.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Inhibition of RA signaling downregulates only a subset of RP markers</title><p>A major question that remains to be addressed is whether the end of the NC stage is sufficient for signaling the formation of the definitive RP, or whether these are two independently regulated processes. Given that RA deficiency delays the end of the NC stage, we asked whether this occurs at the expense of timely RP development.</p><p>As recently shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ofek et al., 2021</xref>), there are differences in the gene expression profile between premigratory NC cells and definitive RP cells. We selected a number of RP-specific genes that are not expressed in the dorsal NT during the NC stage and examined the effect of RA downregulation on their expression. As described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, expression of RP-specific BMP inhibitors was strongly reduced. Likewise, mRNA encoding <italic>Slit1</italic>, a chemorepellent of post-floor plate commissural axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>) was also decreased under experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, additional RP markers, such as <italic>Rspo1, NDP (norrin</italic>), or <italic>draxin</italic>, were normally expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that development of a number of RP traits is independent of RA signaling.</p><p>Since both NC and RP markers are present at the RP stage upon inhibition of RA signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), we proceeded to clarify whether NC and RP markers are expressed in the same cells, or, alternatively, whether there is a mix of different cell types in the RP of RARα403-treated embryos.

Yet, at the same time, RA is still produced in the adjacent paraxial mesoderm. To begin addressing whether the latter tissue accounts for the effects observed, we separated the paraxial mesoderm from the NT with an impermeable membrane and assessed the development of the RP.

To exclude the possibility that RA from the mesoderm of the non-separated side is sufficient to induce normal RP development, a slit was made along the dorsal midline of the NT following insertion of the barrier, thus opening the NT and creating a physical gap between both halves of the neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

Following a process of EMT, NC cells delaminate from the NT through a discontinuous basement membrane (dashed line) to migrate away. At the NC stage, RA is supplied to the NT from the paraxial mesoderm, where it is produced by Raldh2 (blue). (A, middle panel) Under normal conditions, upon cessation of NC production and emigration, a definitive RP forms. RP cells (purple) are refractory to BMP signaling, and exhibit a different gene expression profile when compared to NC cells: they downregulate <italic>foxd3</italic>, <italic>snai2,</italic> and <italic>sox9</italic> and upregulate RP-specific genes (purple), among which are known inhibitors of BMP signaling. RP cells gradually exit the cell cycle and do not delaminate, regenerating a continuous basement membrane and epithelial traits. During the transition between NC and RP stages, <italic>Raldh2</italic> expression begins in the dorsal NT (blue in RP), in addition to RA still produced in somites. The RP functions as a signaling center, regulating specification and/or differentiation of dorsal interneurons (red, dI1 progenitors) that localize ventral to the RP. (A, right panel) In the present study we demonstrate that inhibition of RA signaling in the dorsal NT, impairs the end of NC production and consequently, the normal transition between NC and RP stages. First, under experimental conditions, dorsal NT cells at the RP stage retain active BMP signaling likely via downregulation of BMP antagonists (<italic>BAMBI, hairy1, Grem1</italic>) otherwise selectively expressed in RP. Second, they express both NC and RP markers (illustrated as green/purple cells), Third, they functionally behave as NC cells, maintaining mitotic activity, impaired epithelial traits (such as a discontinuous basement membrane, dashed line), and continuous emigration from the NT. Fourth, although the advent of several RP-specific markers is normal (e.g; <italic>Rspo1, NDP, draxin</italic>) and the number of dI1 progenitors (red circles) is unchanged, the spatial segregation between NC, RP, and dI1 interneuron lineages is compromised. (<bold>B</bold>) A proposed model for the transition between NC (green) and RP (purple) stages. At early stages, reciprocal gradients of RA and FGF in the paraxial mesoderm result in downregulation of the BMP inhibitor Noggin in the dorsal NT. This allows for the activation of BMP and Wnt signaling pathways, which promote cell proliferation and induce NC EMT. As NC cells delaminate and leave the NT, NC-specific genes (<italic>foxd3, sox9,</italic> and <italic>snai2</italic>) are downregulated. Since the latter genes inhibit the synthesis of <italic>Raldh2</italic> in the nascent RP, their disappearance enables the onset of <italic>Raldh2</italic> expression allowing for the local synthesis of RA in RP. RA in turn inhibits BMP and consequently, Wnt signaling, either directly or via upregulation of BMP inhibitors (<italic>BAMBI, hairy1, Grem1</italic>). We propose the existence of mutual cross-inhibitory interactions between RA-responsive genes that characterize NC and RP stages, respectively, in the temporal sequence leading to the formation of the definitive RP and its segregation from NC.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72723-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we show that dorsal NT-derived RA controls the end of NC production and emigration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This effect is mediated through BMP signaling, at least via the upregulation of BMP inhibitors in the nascent RP, which prevents persistent BMP activity and ensures the timely cessation of NC production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>). We previously reported that BMP produced in the dorsal NT is an essential inducer of NC EMT and emigration; a graded activity of BMP is created along the rostro-caudal axis of the embryo thanks to a counter-gradient of its inhibitor noggin. By the time of initial somite dissociation, noggin expression is downregulated by somite derived factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sela-Donenfeld and Kalcheim, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sela-Donenfeld and Kalcheim, 2002</xref>), later found to be accounted for by an interplay between mesodermal RA and Fgf8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martínez-Morales et al., 2011</xref>). This group reported that during gastrulation, RA is required for NC specification, as revealed by analysis of VAD quail embryos. Next, during somite formation, somite-derived RA is necessary for the onset of emigration of specified NC progenitors but at advanced somite stages it is dispensable for the subsequent maintenance of cellular EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martínez-Morales et al., 2011</xref>). Together, these and the present results highlight a rather complex behavior of RA at four sequential stages of NC ontogeny, specification, onset, maintenance and completion of EMT.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with previous results reporting that RA repressed BMP signal in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells; in vivo, RA antagonized BMP-regulated differentiation and proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the NT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sheng et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, RA was also found to inhibit Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shaker et al., 2020</xref>), that in the present context acts downstream of BMP and whose activity was extended in RP by loss of RA signaling.</p><p>In normal development, the end of NC emigration is followed by the advent of the definitive RP of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rekler and Kalcheim, 2021</xref>). This is associated with a progressive withdrawal from the cell cycle, the regeneration of a complete basal lamina overlying the dorsal NT, of apico-basal properties of the RP epithelium and the corresponding downregulation and upregulation, respectively, of NC and RP-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ofek et al., 2021</xref>). We report that, in the absence of RA activity, there is a continuity of several molecular and cellular properties of the NC well into the RP stage, including the presence of a subset of RP cells that co-expresses NC markers. Together, lack of local RA activity blurs the spatial and temporal segregation between NC and RP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).</p><p>Despite these phenotypes, it is notable that RP-specific markers such as <italic>Rspo1</italic>, <italic>NDP,</italic> or <italic>draxin</italic>, were not affected, suggesting that a RP is able to develop even if RA activity is inhibited. This raises the fundamental question whether the end of NC formation and the ensuing development of a RP are regulated by the same or by independent mechanisms. Our results would suggest that the mechanisms accounting for the cessation of NC phase are necessary but not sufficient to explain all aspects of RP development. Consistent with this notion, spatio-temporal lineage tracings revealed that RP segregate from neural progenitors of the NC before the latter complete emigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krispin et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nitzan et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, gain and loss of Notch function in avians and mice, respectively, resulted in changes in RP formation with no apparent effects on NC cell behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ofek et al., 2021</xref>). This would indicate that although NC and RP lineages arise from common progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nitzan et al., 2013</xref>) by different exposure times and/or levels of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Timmer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tozer et al., 2013</xref>), they segregate rather early from each other.</p><p>Among the RP genes whose expression is perturbed in the absence of RA signaling, we found <italic>BAMBI, HES/hairy1</italic> and <italic>Grem1</italic>, none of which is expressed in the dorsal NT at NC stages. These genes, whose transcription was prevented by treatment with RARα403 and/or Cyp26, encode inhibitors of BMP signaling. Furthermore, HES represses BMP activity and subsequent NC emigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, RA-sensitive aspects of RP development are linked to its regulation of BMP activity. Moreover, since RA-dependent downregulation of BMP activity accounts for only selected facets of RP ontogeny, we posit that RP development comprises both RA-dependent and RA-independent mechanisms.</p><p>We observed that maintenance of NC traits in RARα403-treated NTs did not interfere with differentiation of a normal number of RP-dependent dorsal interneurons of type 1, suggesting that the role of the RP as an interneuron inducer center was not altered. However, their topographical dorsoventral distribution was abnormal as instead of organizing into discrete nuclei, interneurons redistributed along the basal surface of the NT comprising the RP itself, further demonstrating that the structural integrity of this signaling center and/or of its boundaries is compromised. This is consistent with the observed local changes in epithelial architecture, cell cycle properties and basal lamina deposition and might be partially accounted for by the continued emigration of NC cells driving a dorsal shift of interneurons. Along this line, cell shape changes associated with continuous mitosis were reported to impact tissue architecture, including epithelial polarity and cellular EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Despin-Guitard and Migeotte, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In addition, since dI1 interneurons are also specified by BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chesnutt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hegarty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Timmer et al., 2002</xref>), it is conceivable to speculate that maintenance of BMP responsiveness in the RP of RARα403-treated NTs affects the normal dorso-ventral gradient of BMP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tozer et al., 2013</xref>), perhaps eliciting indirectly an attractive function that enables dI1 interneurons to migrate into the RP domain. In this context, RP-derived BMP exhibits at a later stage chemorepellent properties vis-à-vis commissural axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augsburger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Dodd, 2003</xref>), putting forward the additional possibility of guidance functions for this morphogen under the present experimental conditions. One of the genes downregulated upon abrogation of RA function is <italic>Slit1</italic>, a known repellent of axonal guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>), as well as of cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halperin-Barlev and Kalcheim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Theveneau and Mayor, 2012b</xref>). This is consistent with recent data pointing to an indirect role for RA in axonal guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Isabella et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of <italic>Slit1</italic> in the absence of RA activity could also account for the dorsal shift of dI1 interneurons into the RP domain, and possible interactions between the three factors in this context remain to be explored.</p><p>As discussed precedently, the NT is sensitive to RA throughout development, with RA playing various functions at different stages [this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diez del Corral and Morales, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martínez-Morales et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>]. Hence, it is plausible that the mechanisms mediating these effects differ as a function of time and context. Here we report that precisely before the end of NC delamination, RA begins to be synthesized in the dorsal NT (e.g; <italic>Raldh2</italic> expression) in addition to the paraxial mesoderm, raising the notion that this new, local source of RA accounts for the end of NC development. Notably, <italic>Raldh2</italic> is also synthesized in the RP of mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ofek et al., 2021</xref>). Unfortunately, available mutants of <italic>Raldh2</italic> are embryonic lethal at about E8.75 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niederreither et al., 1999</xref>), precluding a focal analysis of the transition from NC to RP. In this sense, the avian embryo provides an excellent model to address events restricted both in time and space. The first is the activity of somite vs. RP-derived RA. Two methods we implemented to abrogate RA signaling in the dorsal NT that act primarily in a cell autonomous fashion. However, it is still possible that given the secreted nature of the ligand, Cyp26A1 and/or RARα403 misexpression in the dorsal NT also provide a sink for somitic RA. Despite robust separation of the mesoderm from the NT, expression of <italic>BAMBI</italic>, a most sensitive and significant readout of RA activity, was not altered, suggesting that mesodermal RA is dispensable. What accounts for this shift in responsiveness from a mesodermal towards a neural source of factor? First, local RA could provide a more efficient signal to target progenitors given the increasing size of the embryo and the development of a continuous basement membrane dorsal to the NT. Second, cofactors of RA such as <italic>CRABP1</italic>, could change the nature of the cellular response as it only appears at the RP stage. Together, changes in the molecular landscape between NC and RP stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ofek et al., 2021</xref>), that partly depend on local RA activity, may alter the nature of the interactions between RA and BMP/Wnt to signal a timely cessation of NC production.</p><p>Second, we asked what restricts the synthesis of <italic>Raldh2</italic> to the dorsal NT at the RP stage. Whereas RP-derived RA inhibits NC-specific traits including transcription of <italic>foxd3, sox9,</italic> and <italic>snai2</italic>, each of these factors in turn represses the onset of <italic>Raldh2</italic> transcription in the nascent RP. Thus, as long as NC genes are expressed in the early dorsal NT (NC stage), local <italic>Raldh2</italic> and consequent RA synthesis does not take place. Hence, a cross-repressive interaction exists between NC and RP-specific genes downstream of RA, an emerging temporal property of the network that determines the segregation of sequential cell lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).</p><p>Our study thoroughly documents a role of local RA activity on the end of NC production and ensuing RP architecture. A comprehensive elucidation of the molecular mechanism/s responsible for inhibition of BMP signaling by local RA is the next obligatory step. In this regard, different RA enhancers might be expressed at either stage and be regulated by separate factors. For example, a specific enhancer driving expression of <italic>Raldh2</italic> is activated only at the definitive RP stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castillo et al., 2010</xref>). This enhancer contains Tcf binding sites and thus may be activated by Wnt signaling. In turn, RP-derived Raldh2 and resulting RA could negatively feedback on Wnt signaling in the formed RP either directly or through BMP acting upstream of Wnt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, we presently report that RP-derived RA signaling induces expression of the BMP inhibitors <italic>BAMBI, Grem1</italic> and <italic>hairy/hes</italic> specifically in RP, and this can be one mechanism whereby RA represses BMP signaling. Along this line, we previously showed that misexpression of <italic>Hes1</italic> at the NC stage downregulates BMP activity and represses NC EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, RA could repress BMP signaling by inactivating Smad proteins via ubiquitination, as shown to be the case in selected cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sheng et al., 2010</xref>). Altogether, the present study provides an initial mechanistic explanation for the completion of NC production and separation between PNS (NC) and CNS (RP and dI1) lineages during development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Japanese quail)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Coturnix coturnix japonica</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Moshav Mata</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NCBI taxon: 93,934</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-GFP (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen, Thermo-Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#A6455;

obtained from commercial sources (Moshav Mata), kept at 15 °C and then incubated at 38 °C to desired stages. Embryos were staged by the number of somite pairs formed (somite stage – ss). All experiments were conducted at the flank level of the axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Expression vectors and in ovo electroporation</title><p>The following expression vectors were used as controls: pCAGG, pCAGGS-EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krispin et al., 2010b</xref>), pCAG-mGFP (Addgene #14757), pCAGGS-RFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ofek et al., 2021</xref>). PCAGGS-RARα403 and PCAGGS-Cyp26A1 subcloned from PCAGGS-RARα403-IRES-eGFP and PCAGGS-Cyp26A1-IRES-eGFP, respectively, from S. Sockanathan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Novitch et al., 2003</xref>), were applied to inhibit RA activity. pCAB-cSmad6 was implemented to inhibit BMP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>). pCAG-VP16-RARα-IRES-eGFP was used to activate RA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Novitch et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>To monitor RA activity, we used the pGL3-RARE-SV40-AP reporter [from J. Sen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gupta and Sen, 2015</xref>]. Fluorescent versions of this reporter were prepared by replacing the AP tag with either RFP or with a destabilized version of GFP pGL3-RARE-SV40-RFP and pGL3-RARE-SV40-d2EGFP, respectively (Clontech). Wnt activity was measured with 12XTOPFLASH‐d2EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rios et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Unilateral, bilateral and/or double electroporations to the NT were performed as detailed under Results. To this end, DNA (4 ug/ul) was mixed with Fast Green and microinjected into the lumen of the NT at the flank level of the axis. Five mm tungsten electrodes were placed on either side of the embryo. A square wave electroporator (BTX, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to deliver one pulse of current at 17–25 V for 6ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mechanical separation of the paraxial mesoderm from the NT</title><p>A unilateral slit between epithelial somites and NT comprising an approximate length of 8 segments was performed. A piece of aluminum foil was then inserted that extended beyond the dorsal border of the tissues to provide a continuous barrier despite embryo growth. In some cases, the dorsal NT was additionally opened to separate between both halves of the neuroepithelium. Following microsurgery, embryos were reincubated for 48 hr prior to fixation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For immunostaining, embryos were fixed overnight at 4 °C with 4% formaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), embedded in paraffin wax and serially sectioned at 8 μm.

Cell nuclei were visualized with 125 ng/ml Hoechst 33,258 (Sigma Israel, 14530) diluted in PBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In situ Hybridization</title><p>For in situ hybridization (ISH), embryos were fixed with Fornoy (60% ethanol, 30% formaldehyde and 10% acetic acid) for 1 hr at room temperature, embedded in paraffin wax and serially sectioned at 10 μm. ISH was performed on sections. In brief, sections were treated with 1 µg/ml proteinase K, refixed in 4% PFA, then hybridized overnight at 65 °C with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes (Roche, 11277073910). The probes were detected with AP coupled with anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments (Roche, 11093274910). AP reaction was developed with 4-Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT, Roche, 11383213001) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3’-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt (BCIP, Sigma Israel, B8503). In the <italic>foxd3/Rspo1</italic> ISH experiment, the AP reaction of <italic>Rspo1</italic> was developed with Fast Red (Sigma Israel, F4648) for 2 hr at room temperature. Importantly, all hybridizations, whether done on intact embryos at NC vs. RP stages, or in control vs. experimental embryos, were always developed for the same time per given probe and experiment. The RNA probes used are described in the Key Resources Table. Several probes were produced by PCR amplification (KAPA2G Fast ReadyMix PCR kit, Sigma Israel, KK5101). cDNA templates were synthesized by RNA precipitation followed by reverse transcription PCR. RNAs were produced from 20ss-E4 quail embryos. Tissue samples were homogenized with TriFast reagent, and RNA was separated with chloroform and isopropanol. The primers used are depicted in Key Resources Table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data acquisition and statistical analysis</title><p>Measurement of the intensity of immunofluorescence and ISH signals: Intensities were measured using FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schindelin et al., 2009</xref>). In most cases, the RP was selected as the region of interest (ROI); mean intensity was measured and background intensity was then subtracted. Average intensity of all sections was calculated per embryo, and values were normalized with a control mean set as 1.</p><p>For measurement of phospho-Smad1/5/9 intensity, the ROI was selected as the dorsal domain of the NT from the dorsal midline to the ventral border of dI1 progenitors.</p><p>To monitor intensity of laminin immunostaining in the RP basal lamina, a segmented line of width four was drawn along the basal aspect of the RP, and mean intensity was measured within that area. Average intensity was calculated for each embryo and expressed relative to a control value set as 1.</p><p>To measure the relative position of cell nuclei across the apico-basal extent of the RP, the latter was divided into basal and apical halves, and Hoechst-stained nuclei were manually counted in both domains.</p><p>The distance of BarHL1<sup>+</sup> cells from the dorsal midline of the NT was measured for each cell manually using FIJI, and histograms were generated using R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.R-project.org/">https://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>) in Rstudio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rstudio.com/">http://www.rstudio.com/</ext-link>).</p><p>Images were photographed using a DP73 (Olympus) cooled CCD digital camera mounted on a BX51 microscope (Olympus) with Uplan FL-N 20 x/0.5 and 40 x/0.75 dry objectives (Olympus). Confocal sections encompassing their entire thickness were photographed using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope with a Plan Apo 40 x/1.3 or 100 x/1.4 objectives (Nikon) and a D-Eclipse c1 confocal system (Nikon) at 1.0 μm increments through the z-axis. Images were z-stacked with FIJI software.</p><p>For quantification, images of control and treated sections were photographed under the same conditions. For figure preparation, images were exported into Photoshop CS6 (Adobe). If necessary, the levels of brightness and contrast were adjusted to the entire image and images were cropped without color correction adjustments or γ adjustments. Graphics were generated using Graphpad Prism 7.0, and figures were prepared using Photoshop and InDesign CS6.</p><p>Results were processed with Graphpad Prism seven and presented as scatter plots with mean ± SEM. Data were subjected to statistical analysis using either of the following tests, as described in the respective legends to Figures: Student’s t-test, Welch’s t-test, Mann-Whitney test, one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test, Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc Dunn’s test and Wilcoxon signed ranks test. All tests applied were two-tailed and a p-value  ≤  0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72723-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript, figure supplements and source data files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to all the researchers whose names are mentioned along the text for generously providing reagents.

in avian embryos. The authors propose that local production of retinoic acid signaling activates the expression of BMP inhibitors in the dorsal neural tube. Disruption of BMP signaling results in the termination of neural crest migration and the establishment of the definite roof plate. In the absence of RA signaling cells in the dorsal neural tube continue to express neural crest markers well into the roof plate stage, and neural crest delamination is prolonged, but interestingly this does not prevent roof plate-mediated specification of dorsal interneurons.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72723.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>LaBonne</surname><given-names>Carole</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/000e0be47</institution-id><institution>Northwestern University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kerosuo</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.02.454731">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.02.454731v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Laura Kerosuo (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers felt that in principle the finding that RA produced by the DNT is a key regulator of the transition of the dorsal neural tube to the definite roof plate is novel and of interest, however, they felt that showing just the expression pattern of RA associated genes and the one phenotype with prolonged NC features during RP stage caused by inhibition of RA signaling is not sufficient for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>; more details on the molecular mechanism are needed. In particular it was felt that experiments were needed to address whether RA is sufficient to turn the RP switch on prematurely if activated earlier in the DNT, and to clarify the reciprocal relationship and molecular mechanisms behind the crosstalk of RA and BMP inhibition. Moreover, since the early influence of RA produced by the somites (Martinez-Morales, 2011) seems to have an opposite effect than the RA shown here expressed in the DNT, it is important to provide mechanistic insights as to why that is.

The fact that smad6 alone doesn't cause a phenotype is understandable given the timing when it's injected along the endogenous BMP inhibitors and extra Smad6 thus has no job to do in the embryo at that stage, (unless it causes a premature ending of NC emigration which we don't see with the current analysis time point.) So, the fact that co-expression of RA inhibitor together with a BMP inhibitor prevents the prolonged emigration caused by RARa403 does not prove RA is upstream of BMP but rather only confirms that the ectopic Smad6 is able to do its job as a reducer of NC stage also on RARa403-manipulated prolonged NC after its endogenous expression time window has closed. These experiments don't prove the reciprocal relationship or even a linkage between the two signalling pathways.

In the original manuscript we reported that neural tubederived RA acts 1) to upregulate expression of BMP inhibitors, 2) to inhibit NC-specific genes, 3) to abrogate BMP signaling and 4) consequently to end the period of NC production/emigration. 5) In addition, that RA is not necessary for RP or dorsal interneuron (dI1) formation, but it is required for proper lineage segregation of NC/RP and separation of all the above cell types both in time and space. 6) that somite-derived RA is dispensable for expression of RAdependent traits in RP.</p><p>We have now addressed to the best of our ability the three main issues raised during the review process.</p><p>First, we find that premature gain of RA function is not sufficient to promote an earlier termination of BMP signaling, NC gene expression or NC emigration, or to cause a premature appearance of RP genes, meaning that dorsal NTderived RA is necessary but not sufficient for these processes. Further elaboration of this issue is detailed below. Second, we further clarify the reciprocal relationship behind the cross talk between RA and BMP. We find that both pathways stand in a mutual repressive interaction that ensures the correct temporal progression of events in the dorsal NT.</p><p>Third, we clarify that the effects of RA during NC and RP development are not simply of an opposite binary nature, they are much more complex and context dependent. In this article, we show for the first time the molecular nature of the differential activities and propose several mechanisms to explain them, yet believe that demonstration of direct mechanistic interactions, while being the next step, is beyond the scope of this study. Below, we address each comment, as follows:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors must include additional experiments to examine the effects of early/ectopic activation of RA in the dorsal neural tube during premigratory stage to determine if it's sufficient to prematurely shut down neural crest production /delamination and switch to formation of RP.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have now examined the effect of gain of RA function on the above processes. To note is that RA is active in the dorsal NT at the NC stage, where BMP is also active, premigratory cells express specific NC genes and NC EMT takes place. Hence, these NC-related events are fully compatible with the presence of RA activity in the NT. So, the gain of function experiments requested only add extra-RA signaling to the system.</p><p>We performed careful serial section analyses using VP16-RAR-α to activate RA signaling (corroborated to work in our system by destabilized RARE-GFP) at very precise stages. As shown in new Figure 5, Supp.2, Figure 5. Supp.3, and Figure 6, Supp.2, we found no significant differences in the timing of decline of BMP signaling, <italic>Sox9</italic> or <italic>foxd3</italic></p><p>expressions or on NC EMT, showing that excess RA activity does not cause a premature cessation of NC-specific traits. Reciprocally, we examined whether gain of RA function is able to advance the onset of expression of selected RP traits and we also found no effect on the first appearance of <italic>BAMBI</italic> or <italic>Rspo1.</italic> The latter data confirm additional results suggesting that the end of NC and advent of RP are mostly regulated by independent factors.</p><p>Together, our results show that RA is necessary but not sufficient for the end of NC production. Thus it is not the sole activity of RA in the NT that causes the end of NC EMT but rather a time-specific interplay between RA signaling in the context of a gene network that changes between NC and nascent RP stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Further examination of the proposed linkage between inhibition of BMP signaling and activation of RA is needed.</p><p>The authors should examine changes in expression of BMP and its inhibitors in the dorsal neural tube following up and down regulation of RA.

The referee requests we address changes in BMP expression- to note is that all BMP proteins are produced in the dNT across both stages albeit at changing levels (see Figure 1 Supp.1), while the responsiveness to BMP signaling is the process that is downregulated in the transition to definitive RP.</p><p>As to quantification by qPCR- the referee may notice that most genes examined are not restricted solely to the dorsal NT/RP domains. Since it is technically not accurate to isolate only the regions of interest for qPCR analysis, collecting entire NTs following unilateral or bilateral electroporations for qPCR would be highly imprecise. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry provide precise tools to assess the spatial localization of the transcripts/proteins of interest. To note is that in all cases examined, development of the color reactions was for the same length of time for control and experimental cases and photography was performed under identical conditions. Furthermore, in most cases, effects between treatments were dramatic, readily apparent at a qualitative level and easily quantifiable from ISH or fluorescent images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It might also be useful to include heatmaps generated from the existing RNaseq data comparing NC and RP showing expression changes of genes associated with RA, BMP and wnt signalling.</p></disp-quote><p>A new figure, supplementary 1 to Figure 1, presents data of our transcriptome analysis focusing on differentially expressed genes between NC and RP stages regarding RA, BMP and Wnt pathways, as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiment in figure 2 A-C needs an earlier time point to confirm that inhibition of RA indeed inhibits downregulation of pSMAD activity (and doesn't activate it, which could be another interpretation based on the current figure).

This is depicted now in revised Figure 2, panels A-D’. Because at the RP stage both RP and interneurons continue expressing pSMAD when compared to the NC stage where a homogeneous expression is detected in the dorsal NT, we inferred that a comparative quantification of both stages would not be appropriate. Therefore, quantification in Figure 2E compares control and treated conditions at the RP stage exclusively. Having said that, the intensities at both stages are very similar, as shown in panels A,C, and D which were photographed at exactly the same conditions. Hence, inhibition of RA signaling prolongs BMP activity into the RP stage by preventing its downregulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The logic behind the interpretation of results in figure 5 is unclear.

If so, we reasoned that inhibiting BMP by Smad6 would not prevent RARa403 from stimulating the “late” NC emigration. This was not the case, as Smad6, which inhibits BMP at early stages (Nitzan et al., 2016), also prevented the extended/late emigration elicited by lack of RA activity. In our view, this finding provides a clear link between both pathways. We have now modified the text and hope this clarifies this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3)The role of wnt activation in response to changes in RA activation levels and timing should also be analyzed in more detail to understand the order of events. How is Wnt signaling impacted by premature activation of RA?

As requested, an earlier time point showing significant Wnt activity in the dorsal NT at the NC stage was added. Since most activity at the RP stage in RA-repressed conditions was detected in the RP domain (Revised Figure 2 Supplem. 2), we could also quantitatively compare NC and RP stages. Clearly, under normal conditions, Wnt activity in RP is greatly reduced when compared to premigratory NC, and this reduction is prevented to a significant extent by inhibiting RA signaling (panel D). Hence, similar to the situation regarding BMP activity, inhibition of RA signaling prolongs Wnt activity into the RP stage by preventing its downregulation rather than by de novo activating it. The similar effects of RA deprivation on both BMP and Wnt activities is expected, as at the NC stage, we previously showed that the order of events is such that Wnt acts downstream of BMP in the control of NC EMT (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2004).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the current manuscript the mechanisms resulting in the opposing functions of RA starting or terminating neural crest production are only speculated upon. A revised manuscript should include experiments that shed light on how these distinct outcomes are manifested. Experiments that lend mechanistic insights into How RA inhibits RA signaling at RP stages are probably the key here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referees for this comment. We think that a key question is understanding how RA signaling is differentially interpreted over time given its multistage activity in dorsal NT development.</p><p>This notion is based on the following findings: Years ago, we uncovered that the balance between activities of BMP/Wnt and noggin in the dorsal NT triggers the onset of NC EMT (Sela-Donenfeld and Kalcheim, Burstyn- Cohen et al.,). Martinez-Morales et al., strengthened our findings by reporting that a balance between somitic RA and FGF works on the reported BMP/Wnt modules to initiate the process. This group found that at gastrulation stages, RA is required for NC specification, as revealed by analysis of VAD quail embryos. Next, during somite formation, somitic RA is necessary for the onset of emigration of specified NC progenitors but at advanced somite stages it is dispensable for the subsequent maintenance of cell emigration. Presently, we find that RP-derived RA ends NC production. Together, this highlights a dynamic behavior of RA at 4 sequential stages of NC ontogeny. Clearly enough, the two first effects are mediated by an influence of RA dorso-ventral patterning of the early NT, as distribution of ventral NT markers was strongly affected. In our case, RA from the nascent RP has no such effects suggesting that RP-derived RA acts at a post-patterning phase to specifically affect the dorsal NT.</p><p>All things considered, we think that the problem is not simply a binary question of “opposing functions of RA signaling in starting or terminating NC production”. Instead, it is the understanding of a differential interpretation to the same morphogen by progenitor cells with changing states and at sequential stages.</p><p>To the referee’s request, we begun addressing the question of how does RA inhibit BMP signaling close to the RP stage. To this end, it was first necessary to examine the temporal regulation of <italic>Raldh2</italic> expression that is restricted to the RP stage, and is therefore a prerequisite for the late activity of RA. Whereas repressing RA activity extends the NC phase including the continuous transcription of Foxd3, <italic>Sox9</italic> and Snail2 (Figure 3), we now found that preventing the normal downregulation of these factors by extending their activity into the RP stage, represses the onset of <italic>Raldh2</italic> transcription in the nascent RP (new Figure 9). We interpret these results to mean that as long as NC genes are active in the dorsal NT (NC stage), local Raldh2 and consequent RA synthesis in the NT does not take place, so Raldh2 in RP is repressed by NC-specific traits.</p><p>The significance of these data is twofold: first, they explain how the onset of Raldh2 production is restricted to the RP stage. Second, since we also report the reciprocal result, e.g; that RA represses NC genes (Figure 3), we conclude that a cross-repressive interaction exists between NC and RP-specific genes downstream of RA, being an emerging temporal property of the network. These data further indicate that the changing roles of RA throughout development of the dorsal neural primordium, largely depend on a different interpretation of the signal mediated by changing and mutually repressive codes.</p><p>We have now presented these data in new Figure 9. To clarify our thoughts further, we now provide a working model summarizing the effects of RA in NC to RP transition (Figure 10B).</p><p>Our article uncovers for the first time and thoroughly documents, a role of local RA activity on the end of NC production and ensuing RP architecture. We believe that a comprehensive elucidation of the molecular mechanism responsible for inhibition of BMP signaling by local RA is the next obligatory step. We show in this study the selective activation of BMP inhibitors by endogenous RA and previously found that one of them, Hes/hairy, indeed inhibits BMP signaling and NC EMT (Nitzan et al., 2016). Therefore we propose (not only speculate) that upregulation of BMP inhibitors by RA is a possible mechanism. However, we also predict that this is not the only one, and a deeper understanding of this problem is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>Additional possibilities that fit with our data were now discussed: RA expression in somites vs. RP can be regulated by different enhancers and thus have distinct functions. For example, a specific enhancer driving expression of Raldh2 was found to be activated only at the definitive RP stage (Castillo et al., 2010). This enhancer contains Tcf binding sites and thus may be activated by Wnt signaling. In turn, as we show, RP-derived Raldh2 and resulting RA could negatively feed-back on Wnt signaling in the formed RP either directly or through BMP acting upstream of Wnt (now summaized in Figure 10B).</p><p>Another possible scenario is that RA represses BMP signaling by inactivating Smad proteins via ubiquitination, as shown to be the case in selected cell lines (Sheng et al., 2010). These possibilities were now discussed and await to be explored systematically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are these outcomes of RA signaling not seen in response to early RA produced by the somites?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now examined BMP and Wnt activities in the dorsal NT at early stages, when RA is only provided from the somites, and found that both factors are clearly active at this stage (Revised Figure 2 and Revised Figure 2 Supp.2, and see also Nitzan 2016). Hence, somitic RA is compatible at the NC stage with BMP/Wnt activities in the NT. In contrast, no significant BMP or Wnt signals are detected at the RP stage when RA is locally produced (our original findings). Furthermore, separation of somites from the NT to prevent access of somitic RA to the NT (and of other factors as well), has no effect on expression of <italic>BAMBI</italic>, a direct readout of RA activity in the RP (Figure 8). In fact, many studies demonstrated that emigration of NC cells takes place even in the absence of somites when NTs are explanted on plain fibronectin. The role of the somites is, therefore, to impose a timer on initiation of the process (Sela-Donenfeld and Kalcheim, 1998), and this was corroborated by Diez del Corral et al., who found that only the onset, but not the maintenance of sequential NC EMT is dependent on somitic RA. Thus, for these reasons and those elaborated in the item above, we can say that the end of NC EMT and additional phenotypes here described are not seen in response to mesodermal RA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the staging of the embryos and the axial levels analyzed in different experiments are loosely defined.

The NC panels in Figure 1 S2 were deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should demonstrate that the RARE construct is not active during the &quot;Early NC&quot; stages, which would allow for upregulation of BAMBI and the production of neural crest cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in the original version of the manuscript (Figure 1,N,N’, O,O’), the RARE construct is active both at NC and RP stages. This is consistent with data by others (Rossant et al., 1991, Olivera- Martinez and Storey, 2007) which also found RA activity in the early NT of mice and chick, respectively. The difference is that the early NT responds to RA but does not synthesize it, whereas the late NT both produces and also responds to the factor. Hence, selective expression of <italic>BAMBI</italic> at the RP stage associated with the completion of NC production cannot be solely explained by activity of lack of local activity of RA. Rather, by a differential interpretation of the signal by premigratory NC cells vs. nascent RP cells. As discussed, this may be accounted for by changes in efficiency of local RA activity, in the changing transcriptional profile of the cells, etc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The illustration of the model in figure 9C should have no blue in the dorsal NT (to show the absence of RA).</p></disp-quote><p>The blue color represents Raldh2 expression. The reagents we used selectively repress RA activity, not Raldh2. We have now clarified this in the scheme. “RA synthesis (Raldh2)” was changed to “Raldh2 expression” (now Figure 10A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 7 did the position of dl1 interneurons change because cells delaminated and migrated out? Is there a change in the number of cells that occupy the roof plate?</p></disp-quote><p>Most probably, dI1 interneurons invaded the roof plate because its cellular architecture is altered in the absence of RA signaling (see Figure 4) altogether compromising the integrity of this domain (e.g, lack of segregation between NC and RP fates , Figure 6), thus enabling mislocalization of interneurons otherwise located immediately ventral to the RP. As discussed originally, this may result from a change in the D-V gradient of BMP and synthesis of Slit1, both factors involved in axonal/cellular guidance, which are altered under experimental conditions and may affect cellular integrity and interneuron localization. Having said that, we cannot rule out the possibility raised by the referee that continuous NC cell emigration may also act as a driving force for more ventral cell types to undergo a dorsal shift, and this was now discussed.</p><p>To address the referee’s question on RP size, we now measured the area of the Rspo1-positive roof plate (which is a faithful representation of cell number, see Kahane and Kalcheim, 2020), and found no significant difference in its size between control and treated embryos. Results were added to the text (control: 1672 ± 121.3 µm<sup>2</sup> [mean ± SEM, n = 8]; compared to RARa403: 1790 ± 146.1 µm<sup>2</sup> [mean ± SEM, n=8], p = 0.544 [non-significant], student's t-test).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 5b' it looks like the control embryo also has GFP positive nuclei migrating from the tube in a row mostly on the right side but some on the left as well indicting emigration has not ceased in the controls either.</p></disp-quote><p>A single fluorescent cell is seen in the right side of the image. The others represent weak autofluorescence of erythrocytes. We aimed at performing the second electroporation at a post-EMT stage to monitor only the late emigration occurring at the RP stage. Occasionally, because analysis comprises a certain length of the axis, one observes at more caudal levels very few delaminating cells in controls. The referee may look at panels D and I showing the low values of cell emigration in controls; the enhancement observed upon repression of RA signaling is, however, dramatic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Supplementary Figure 1 is not convincing.

In this regard, we have looked at other studies and noticed, that RARs and RXRs also display a rather even distribution in the neural tube of early avian embryos (Diez del Corral et al., 2003). To meet the referee’s request, we decided to omit the images of the NC stage while acknowledging the reference by the Storey team. If acceptable, we would like to present the images depicting the RP stage where patterns look clearer and show the presence of RAR-α and RAR-β and RXR-γ (but not of RAR-γ or RXR-α) transcripts in the RP itself (Figure 1 Supp.2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The Sox9 immunostaining in figure 3G looks backgroundy – it looks as though the mesenchyme and the epidermis are also positive, which don't express Sox9 RNA according to 3E and F.

As discussed originally, this may result from a change in the D-V gradient of BMP and synthesis of Slit1, both factors involved in axonal/cellular guidance, which are altered under experimental conditions and may affect cellular integrity and interneuron localization. Having said that, we cannot rule out the possibility raised by the referee that continuous NC cell emigration may also act as a driving force for more ventral cell types to undergo a dorsal shift, and this was now discussed.</p><p>To address the referee’s question on RP size, we now measured the area of the Rspo1-positive roof plate (which is a faithful representation of cell number, see Kahane and Kalcheim, 2020), and found no significant difference in its size between control and treated embryos. Results were added to the text (control: 1672 ± 121.3 µm<sup>2</sup> [mean ± SEM, n = 8]; compared to RARa403: 1790 ± 146.1 µm<sup>2</sup> [mean ± SEM, n=8], p = 0.544 [non-significant], student's t-test).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should demonstrate that the RARE construct is not active during the &quot;Early NC&quot; stages, which would allow for upregulation of BAMBI and the production of neural crest cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in the original version of the manuscript (Figure 1,N,N’, O,O’), the RARE construct is active both at NC and RP stages. This is consistent with data by others (Rossant et al., 1991, Olivera- Martinez and Storey, 2007) which also found RA activity in the early NT of mice and chick, respectively. The difference is that the early NT responds to RA but does not synthesize it, whereas the late NT both produces and also responds to the factor. Hence, selective expression of <italic>Bambi</italic> at the RP stage associated with the completion of NC production cannot be solely explained by activity of lack of local activity of RA. Rather, by a differential interpretation of the signal by premigratory NC cells vs. nascent RP cells. As discussed in the revised manuscript, this may be accounted for by changes in local RA levels, in the changing transcriptional profile of the cells, etc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The illustration of the model in figure 9C should have no blue in the dorsal NT (to show the absence of RA).</p></disp-quote><p>The blue color represents Raldh2 expression, which it is not affected by our treatments. The reagents we used selectively repress RA activity. We have now clarified this in the scheme. “RA synthesis (Raldh2)” was changed to “Raldh2 expression” (now Figure 10A).</p></body></sub-article></article>
