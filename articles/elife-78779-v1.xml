(NuMa), Gαi, and Dynein, which interacts with astral microtubules to rotate the spindle. Cortical Pins/LGN recruitment serves as a critical step in this process. Here, we identify Pins-mediated planar cell polarized divisions in several of the mitotic domains of the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. We found that neither planar cell polarity pathways nor planar polarized myosin localization determined division orientation; instead, our findings strongly suggest that Pins planar polarity and force generated from mesoderm invagination are important. Disrupting Pins polarity via overexpression of a myristoylated version of Pins caused randomized division angles. We found that disrupting forces through chemical inhibitors, depletion of an adherens junction protein, or blocking mesoderm invagination disrupted Pins planar polarity and spindle orientation. Furthermore, directional ablations that separated mesoderm from mitotic domains disrupted spindle orientation, suggesting that forces transmitted from mesoderm to mitotic domains can polarize Pins and orient division during gastrulation. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo example where mechanical force has been shown to polarize Pins to mediate division orientation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spindle orientation</kwd><kwd>mechanics</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>adherens junctions</kwd><kwd>Pins/LGN</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM144115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Adam C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1GM105984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Adam C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Morphogenetic forces from tissue invagination orient cell division through a previously undescribed mechanism of force-dependent LGN/Pins polarization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelial morphogenesis and homeostasis are influenced by cell division orientation, which can occur along specific axes relative to both the epithelial plane and the polarity of an organ/organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena-López et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kulukian and Fuchs, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Morin and Bellaïche, 2011</xref>). Epithelia are tissues composed of cells that are organized in a sheet and held together by junctions, which maintain the integrity of the tissue as well as the apical-basal polarity of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Classen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cox et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gumbiner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harris and Peifer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tepass, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang and Margolis, 2007</xref>). Asymmetric cell divisions, in which cellular components, such as existing adherens junctions, are distributed unequally to daughter cells can result in one daughter cell leaving the epithelium. In contrast, symmetric divisions in epithelia divide cellular components equally, and usually results in both daughter cells remaining in the tissue. Orientation of the mitotic spindle is what determines whether a division is symmetric or not, as spindle orientation determines division orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabernard and Doe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gönczy and Rose, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nakajima et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the spindle orientation with respect to organ/organism axis can promote directional growth and/or stress dissipation in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campinho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Legoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wyatt et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Spindle orientation is often achieved by a complex of Partner of Inscuteable (Pins)/LGN, Mushroom Body Defect (Mud)/Nuclear Mitotic Apparatus (NuMa), Gαi, and Dynein. In this complex, Pins/LGN acts as a linker between Gαi and Mud, which is also bound to a Dynein-Dynactin complex. Dynein’s motor activity provides the force to rotate the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergstralh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fielmich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grill and Hyman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Siller and Doe, 2008</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, asymmetric division and spindle orientation is dependent on Pins/LGN recruitment to the apical cortex. Apical proteins recruit Inscuteable (Insc), which in turn recruits Pins/LGN and the spindle rotation complex. Pins null mutants exhibit defects in spindle orientation in neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabernard and Doe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schaefer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Siller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). In symmetric epithelial cell divisions, spindle orientation also depends on Pins, which is recruited to the lateral cortex by the lateral domain protein, Discs large (Dlg). In other cell types, cell intrinsic signals can localize Pins/LGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). Loss of Pins, Dlg, or disrupted recruitment of Pins by Dlg causes aberrant asymmetric cell divisions in epithelia and cell loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergstralh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carvalho et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, in planar cell polarized divisions of the sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> dorsal thorax, asymmetric determinant segregation and spindle orientation depend on planar polarized Pins and E-cadherin localization, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellaïche et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Le Borgne et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In addition to molecular cues, mechanical cues also orient cell division. For example, in isolated cell cultures, cell division orientation has been shown to directly respond to stress by aligning with applied forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Matsumura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Théry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Théry et al., 2005</xref>). Cells also respond to force through its influence on cell shape. The connection between cell shape and division axis is known as the long axis rule or Hertwig’s rule and was first observed over 100 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hertwig, 1884</xref>). However, the mechanisms through which force, cell shape, and molecular cues are interconnected to influence cell division remain an active area of research. In epithelial tissues, cell division/spindle orientation occurs along the tension axis, which can dissipate tension and influence cell packing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campinho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gibson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Godard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Scarpa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wyatt et al., 2015</xref>). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal notum and <italic>Xenopus,</italic> cell shape has been shown to affect the spindle angle through the influence of molecular cues localized at tricellular junctions, which provide a ‘memory’ for interphase cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosveld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nestor-Bergmann et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte, follicular epithelium, and parasegmental boundaries and cultured MDCK cells, molecular cues, like Pins/LGN and Mud/NUMA, do not localize to tricellular junctions, implying that cells use additional strategies to promote force-oriented spindle rotation, in some contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Finegan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gloerich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Scarpa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). For example, mechanical cues have been shown to recruit the Pins/LGN machinery to adherens junctions in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hart et al., 2017</xref>). Mitotic rounding forces have also been shown to be important for proper spindle orientation and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chanet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kunda et al., 2012</xref>). The combinatorial action of mechanical and molecular cues used to orient spindles is incompletely understood. Here, we use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo as a powerful model organism that is uniquely tractable – exhibiting mirror-symmetric domains that undergo highly stereotyped oriented divisions – to uncover the relationship between mechanical and molecular cues that coordinate division orientation and morphogenetic movements in an embryo.</p><p>During development, the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo undergoes 13 cycles of synchronous nuclear divisions with no intervening gap phases. After these 13 cycles of nuclear division, embryonic cells arrest in G2. Cycle 14 divisions occur in a highly stereotyped pattern defined by <italic>string</italic> (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Cdc25 homologue) expression in pockets of cells across the embryo. These pockets of cells that divide together are termed mitotic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edgar and O’Farrell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Foe, 1989</xref>). Some of these domains have been observed to have oriented divisions, but the mechanism underlying division orientation is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">da Silva and Vincent, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hartenstein and Campos-Ortega, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hartenstein et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stern et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). We found that spindle orientation is a dynamic process in which spindles are not assembled in position, but rather rotate to achieve orientation in mitotic domains 1, 3, and 5 (MDs 1, 3, and 5) in the dorsal ‘head’ and are oriented in the direction of eventual tissue movement/elongation. We discovered that these oriented symmetric divisions and those of MD14, which had previously been shown to exhibit force-dependent oriented symmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), require planar polarized Pins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Early mitotic domains in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> head exhibit spindle rotation and planar polarized division</title><p>Located on the dorsal side of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo ‘head’, MDs 1, 3, and 5 undergo division during gastrulation, 200 min after egg deposition (AED).

Cytokinetic rings form perpendicular to the division axis. In MDs 1, 3, and 5, cytokinetic rings are oriented roughly perpendicular to the anterior-posterior (AP) axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To further visualize the division process and assess dynamics during division, we used embryos expressing fluorescently tagged CLIP170 to mark the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). For this paper, we will display all head images with the anterior pole toward the top. To quantify the alignment of the divisions with the AP axis, we measured the angle between the spindle and the AP axis, where an angle of 0 indicates perfect alignment with the AP axis and an angle of 90 indicates alignment with the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Spindles were measured after anaphase, when spindle position becomes fixed. MDs 1, 3, and 5 divisions occur almost entirely within 30° of the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). Markedly in MD1, the majority of spindles were slightly tilted relative to the AP axis and mirror symmetric, such that spindles on the left side divided within 0 to 30° of the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and I</xref>) and spindles on the right side divided within 0 to –30° of the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and J</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we found that mitotic spindles are not initially oriented with the AP axis and form with no preferential orientation. Spindles then rotated up to 90° to achieve a final orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Despite dividing with a mirror-symmetric tilt away from the AP axis, we observed no chirality in spindle rotation; on the left side of MD1 53% of measured spindles rotated counterclockwise and 47% rotated clockwise, on the right side 46% rotated counterclockwise and 54% clockwise. Together these data show that MDs 1, 3, and 5 exhibited oriented divisions and this orientation is achieved by spindle rotation toward an angle ~30° from the AP axis. We next asked what cue(s) could coordinate the spindle rotation and division orientation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Planar polarized divisions require polarized Pins localization</title><p>Because spindles exhibited a pronounced rotation after assembly, we examined components of the spindle rotation machinery, Pins and Mud. We discovered that MDs 1, 3, and 5 all exhibit planar cell polarity of Pins. The Pins planar cell polarity is dependent on cell cycle state: mitotic cells exhibit planar polarized Pins, whereas Pins is uniformly distributed along lateral membranes of interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). We quantified Pins polarization by modifying previously described polarization quantifications of mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besson et al., 2015</xref>). We used embryos expressing fluorescently labeled Pins and fluorescent membrane marker Gap43::mCherry, and measured the intensity of Pins::YFP and Gap43::mCherry around the membrane. We found that in MD1, the Pins intensity is highest on the posterior side of the cells and the crescent of Pins intensity peaks just past the posterior-most point of the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and C’</xref>). The ratio of the point of greatest Pins intensity to the average of the two adjacent troughs averaged over three embryos was significantly greater than the same ratio calculated from the Gap43::mCherry signal (peak-to-trough ratio Pins, 1.39±0.1017 and Gap43::mCherry, 1.04±0.0406, mean and SD, p=1.7057e-08), demonstrating that this polarity was not caused by membrane inhomogeneity. Gap43::mCherry also had a more uniform labeling along the membrane in MD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, D and D’</xref>). Though our imaging resolution is not sufficient to determine whether Pins is localized solely on the posterior side of MD1 cells or both the posterior and anterior sides when groups of cells round up together, we find that cells on the boundary of MD1 display Pins crescents enriched on the posterior side.

We found that similar to Pins::YFP, endogenous Pins was planar polarized in mitotic MD1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). We also looked at components of the spindle rotation machinery complex downstream of Pins, namely Mud. It appears that Mud follows a similar localization pattern as Pins and is polarized in crescents in mitotic cells of MD1, although Mud also strongly labels spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Based on our live and fixed imaging, we conclude that MDs 1, 3, and 5 cells exhibit planar polarized Pins localization during mitosis.</p><p>In addition to MDs 1, 3, and 5, we examined MD14, which has previously been shown to exhibit force-dependent planar polarized divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Mitotic cells within MD14 exhibited planar polarized Pins, similar to what we saw for MD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Posterior crescents of Pins form in the mitotic cells of MD14, though the crescent is broader than in MDs 1, 3, and 5. The peak-to-trough ratio for Pins in MD14 was significantly different from control Gap43::mCherry (1.22±0.0914 and 1.04±0.1115, respectively, mean and SD, p=3.1726e-06) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–K’</xref>). Thus, MD14 cells also exhibit planar polarized Pins localization.</p><p>We next sought to establish whether there was a connection between Pins polarity and spindle orientation. Using embryos expressing fluorescently tagged tubulin and fluorescently tagged Pins, we monitored the timing of Pins polarization and spindle rotation. We found that Pins polarization preceded spindle rotation and is abolished shortly after anaphase, when the spindle position is finalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). The correlated timing between Pins polarization and spindle rotation suggests that Pins is responsible for the spindle achieving its polarized orientation. To determine the relationship between Pins polarity and spindle rotation we compared the angle of maximum Pins intensity to the division angle. We found that there was a strong correlation between angular position of maximum Pins intensity and the anaphase spindle angle in MD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Previous studies have shown division orientation often follows the long axis of the interphase cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hertwig, 1884</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Minc et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tsou et al., 2003</xref>). To determine whether division angle in the MD1 could also be related to cell shape, we compared the interphase cell long axis angle to the division angle. In contrast to Pins polarity, there was no correlation between interphase cell shape and division angle, indicating the divisions of MD1 do not follow the long axis rule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together these data show that division orientation correlates with Pins localization, but not interphase cell shape. We also analyzed Pins and tubulin within MD14, which is located at the ventral midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Myristoylation covalently attaches a myristoyl group to a protein so the protein associates with the plasma membrane in an unregulated manner. Overexpression of myristoylated Pins, but not wild-type Pins, caused Pins to be uniformly distributed along the membrane during mitosis and abolished Pins planar polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C'</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, perturbation using myr-Pins did not obviously disrupt other morphogenetic events during gastrulation. Mesoderm invagination, cephalic furrow invagination, and germ band extension all occur in embryos expressing myr-Pins. Further, expression of myr-Pins does not impact the number, timing, or position of cells dividing within the mitotic domains. We overexpressed the myristoylated version of Pins instead of using a Pins null mutant because we and others have previously shown that the Pins null mutant causes aberrant out-of-plane divisions and our goal was to disrupt Pins polarity while keeping the divisions in-plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chanet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Izumi et al., 2004</xref>). We have previously shown myristoylated Pins is functional and able to rescue off-axis divisions that occur after Dlg-RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chanet et al., 2017</xref>). Despite occurring in-plane, spindles in embryos expressing myristoylated Pins fail to orient along the AP axis. Instead, division angles are evenly distributed, occurring with seemingly no preference between the DV and AP axes for cells within MD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>). In comparison, spindles in embryos expressing control Pins orient along the AP axis, with most divisions occurring within 30° of the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). Myr-Pins expressing embryos had an average division angle within MD1 that was significantly different from controls (42.7 and 20.1, respectively, p=0.000103). Results for MDs 3 and 5 are consistent with MD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Myristoylated Pins expression also disrupted division orientation in MD14. Myr-Pins expressing embryos had an average division angle within MD14 that was significantly different from controls (41.2 and 18.1, respectively, p=0.0079) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–N</xref>). These data suggest that Pins polarity is necessary for mitotic spindle orientation and planar polarity of divisions within MDs 1, 3, 5, and 14. Next, we investigated what mechanisms establish Pins planar polarity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Adherens junctions, but not Toll-like receptors or other PCP pathways, are required for division orientation</title><p>We hypothesized that Pins polarity could require an upstream planar cell polarity pathway and/or a mechanical cue. We first tested the requirement of planar cell polarity pathways. Some well-known planar polarity pathways include the Fat-Dachsous, the core PCP, and the PAR pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hale and Strutt, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Strutt and Strutt, 2009</xref>). The Fat-Dachsous and core PCP pathways were not good candidates for orienting divisions within MDs 1, 3, and, 5 because previous work has shown the components of these pathways are not expressed early enough and/or in the MDs to be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tomancak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tomancak et al., 2007</xref>). The PAR pathway was also not a good candidate because the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of Par 3, Bazooka (Baz), did not exhibit planar cell polarity in the MDs, despite retaining apical localization during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we explored the possible involvement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which act downstream of even-skipped (Eve) and have been shown to be necessary for the planar polarity of non-muscle Myo II and Baz in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> trunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lavalou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). We investigated whether TLRs were involved in division orientation by injecting live embryos with dsRNA of TLRs 2, 6, and 8 and control 0.1× TE buffer. Furthermore, we analyzed fixed embryos that were triple mutants for these TLRs. Injection of dsRNA of TLRs 2, 6, and 8 did not have a significant impact on division orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). The triple TLR mutant perturbation was significantly different from controls but did not randomize division orientation to the extent of expressing Myr-Pins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>). Finally, Myo II and Baz were not planar polarized in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chanet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ko et al., 2020</xref>), leading us to conclude that TLRs are not solely responsible for division orientation in MDs 1, 3, 5.</p><p>We next tested the function of AJs. AJs mechanically couple epithelial cells, serve as platforms for protein assembly, and are composed of cadherin-catenin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hinck et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kovacs and Yap, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leckband and Prakasam, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Oda et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rimm et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Takeichi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yap et al., 1997</xref>). AJs are connected to F-actin, which is required for force transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Desai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rimm et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>). Junctional proteins, such as Canoe/Afadin (cno), have been implicated in spindle positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carminati et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Speicher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wee et al., 2011</xref>). Previous work has shown that E-cadherin is able to recruit Pins in a tension-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hart et al., 2017</xref>). While AJs are not required for in-plane divisions in certain tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergstralh et al., 2013</xref>), they could serve as platforms for Pins to cue division orientation. To perturb AJs, we maternally depleted α-catenin (αcat) using RNAi. We have shown that αcat depletion is the most severe way to disrupt adherens junctions, totally uncoupling mesoderm cell actomyosin from the junctions, preventing their apical constriction, and lowering adherens junction levels throughout the entire embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denk-Lobnig et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yevick et al., 2019</xref>). We crossed the RNAi (hairpin) stock to flies expressing a maternal GAL4 and fluorescently labeled tubulin to visualize spindles. When compared to a control RNAi (Rh3), embryos expressing the αcat RNAi had an even distribution of division angles in MD1, occurring with seemingly no preference between the DV and AP axes. αcat-depleted embryos exhibited an average division angle that was significantly different from controls (36.7 and 26.4, respectively; p=0.000583) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>). αcat RNAi also disrupted spindle orientations in MD3 and MD5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Perturbation using αcat RNAi does not recapitulate the complete disruption of division orientation seen in embryos expressing myr-Pins. This is likely due to the inherent variability in the RNAi knockdown. We observed embryos that had severe disruption of division orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and embryos that had minor disruption and appeared more similar to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

To further test the role of force, we injected embryos expressing fluorescently labeled Pins and tubulin with a low dose of cytochalasin D (CytoD) that we have shown to inhibit force transmission without globally depolymerizing F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jodoin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mason et al., 2013</xref>). Actomyosin is also necessary for cell rounding, which is necessary for planar divisions for MD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chanet et al., 2017</xref>). As we were interested in the orientation of planar divisions, we focused our analysis on divisions that occurred within the plane of the epithelium.

In DMSO injected embryos, nearly all cells round and divide simultaneously. This division timing disruption did not disrupt division orientation or Pins polarization.

We focused on MD1 and performed a series of four cuts to isolate the domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). We were unable to look at the effect on Pins polarization because the ablation bleached the Pins::YFP signal. Using embryos that expressed fluorescently labeled tubulin, we analyzed the effect of mechanical isolation on spindle orientation. Cells that divide within the mechanically isolated region fail to orient along the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and M</xref>). As an internal control, we utilized the mirrored spatial pattern of MD1 and cut one side of the domain and left the other side uncut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). In the same embryo, we were able to observe spindles within the cut region fail to orient and neighboring cells outside the cut region orient correctly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J-M</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). As a further control, and to compensate for the difficulty in acquiring images that permitted visualization of both sides of the domain, we performed sham ablations, where we irradiated the region with a level of light below the cutting threshold. In sham ablated control embryos, spindles oriented with preference toward the AP axis and had an average division angle that was significantly different from cells within the cut region (20.0 and 58.0, respectively; p=0.0286) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J-M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>To test whether forces transmitted from either cephalic furrow invagination (posterior to MDs) or ventral furrow (ventral to MDs) – mesoderm invagination – are required for oriented divisions, we made directional incisions to separate MD1 from these morphogenetic movements. The cephalic furrow is closest to MDs 1, 3, and 5 and could be expected to pull the MD cells along the AP axis. We made DV oriented (horizontal) laser ablations in the posterior part of MD5 to separate the dorsal head from the cephalic furrow and found that cells exhibited oriented divisions, occurring with an average division angle similar to control sham ablations (18.3 and 20.0, respectively; p=1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C D E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>). In contrast, we found that AP oriented line ablations ventral to the head MDs, which separated them from putative pulling forces from the mesoderm, resulted in a random distribution of division angles, similar to complete isolation of the MD (40.0 and 20.0, respectively; p=0.0286) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A B E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mesoderm invagination polarizes Pins and division orientation in the embryonic head</title><p>The divisions in MDs 1, 3, and 5 occur during gastrulation, ventral furrow formation pulls ectoderm cells around the circumference of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rauzi et al., 2015</xref>), and separation of the MDs from the ventral region disrupts division orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that forces from mesoderm invagination, which occurs ~10 min before division, could cue Pins polarization and division orientation. To perturb mesoderm invagination, we disrupted the transcription factor Snail because Snail depletion most severely depletes apical actomyosin activity, and thus pulling forces, in the ventral furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mason et al., 2013</xref>).

Beyond division orientation and Pins polarity, injections of Snail dsRNA disrupted the patterning of MDs 1, 3, and 5. Instead of three distinct domains, a single group of anterior cells divide. Taken together, these data indicate that morphogenetic forces play a role in Pins polarity and division orientation within MDs 1, 3, and 5. A role for morphogenetic forces is consistent with our observation that disruption of αcat, actomyosin (with CytoD), or laser ablation disrupt division orientation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Snail depletion disrupts Pins polarization and spindle orientation.</title><p>(<bold>A,E</bold>) Disrupting ventral furrow formation disrupts Pins polarity.

We demonstrated that Pins polarity is required for spindle orientation by overexpressing a myristoylated version of Pins that exhibits unregulated cortical localization and disrupts spindle orientation. We found that Pins planar cell polarity and AP spindle orientation depend on adherens junctions. This and our finding that actomyosin disruption also prevents Pins planar cell polarity led us to hypothesize that force transmission through the tissue orients Pins and cell divisions. We showed that forces from ventral furrow formation were critical for spindle orientation, by (1) mechanically isolating MD1 cells from all surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, purple lines), (2) mechanically isolating MD1 cells specifically from the ventral furrow via directional laser ablations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, red lines), and (3) showing that disrupting ventral furrow formation via Snail depletion abrogates proper spindle orientation and Pins localization.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Other mechanisms of division orientation</title><p>Several other mechanisms of planar polarized division orientation have been identified. Previous works have shown that planar cell polarity pathways, namely the Fat/Dachsous, the core PCP, and the PAR pathways, coordinate divisions of the fly wing disc, during zebrafish gastrulation, and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> SOP cells, among other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena-López et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Concha and Adams, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gho and Schweisguth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mao et al., 2006</xref>). We ruled out the Fat/Dachsous and core PCP pathways because previous studies indicated that the components of these pathways are not expressed early enough in development to play a role in orienting the divisions of the dorsal head or ventral midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tomancak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tomancak et al., 2007</xref>). We further confirmed this by examining fluorescently tagged versions of proteins within these pathways. As was reported, we found no evidence of appreciable expression of these proteins (data not shown). Further, we ruled out the PAR pathway because we saw no evidence of planar polarity in Bazooka/Par 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). The TLR planar polarity pathway that polarizes myosin in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> trunk was a candidate for involvement in the mitotic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). We ruled out this pathway for two reasons, first the TLR pathway in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> trunk results in polarized Myosin and Bazooka/Par3. Observation of these proteins in the dorsal head showed no strong polarization of either protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chanet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). Second, we generated a triple mutant of the TLRs identified and performed injections of dsRNA of these TLRs. In each case, spindle orientation was not affected to the extent of the myristoylated Pins perturbation, indicating TLRs cannot be solely responsible for spindle orientation in MDs 1, 3, and 5.</p><p>Hertwig’s rule or the long axis rule is perhaps one of the most established mechanisms of division orientation. More recent studies have shown that tricellular junctions are predictors of division orientation. Mud localizes to tricellular junctions which cues spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosveld et al., 2016</xref>). We did not observe Mud localization to tricellular junctions within the dorsal head mitotic domains and along the ventral midline. Furthermore, we find no correlation between cell long axis and division orientation within these domains, while we find a strong correlation between Pins polarity and cell division angle.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Myosin-dependent tension and division orientation</title><p>Myosin-dependent tension has been shown to cue the orientation of the mitotic spindle. A growing body of work suggests a role for tension in division orientation, with notable examples in fly development. In the fly notum, it was shown that cells rely on isotropic myosin-dependent tension to sense cell shape and divide along the cell long axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lam et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike the cells of the fly notum, cells within MDs 1, 3, 5, and 14 do not follow the long axis rule. However, isotropic myosin-dependent tension is required for cell rounding and for symmetric cell divisions in MD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chanet et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Tension has also been shown to overrule the long axis rule and orient divisions with the axis of tension rather than the cell long axis. In the follicular epithelium, cortical tension at the apical surface cues planar divisions in a Canoe-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Finegan et al., 2019</xref>). In this case, Pins and Mud were not planar polarized but rather localized around the entire cell cortex and did not play a role in the planar divisions within the follicular epithelium. Similarly, in parasegmental boundaries, local anisotropy in myosin-dependent tension overrides cell shape. In this context it was shown that tension is both necessary and sufficient to cue division orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Scarpa et al., 2018</xref>). Pins and Mud were shown to not be involved in division orientation but were necessary for planar divisions. In the head MDs, we did not observe anisotropic myosin-dependent tension. Instead, we observe a uniform distribution of actin and myosin along interfaces of cells. While myosin-dependent tension plays an important role in division orientation in different contexts within fly development, we found no evidence for anisotropic myosin orienting dorsal head divisions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Adherens junctions and division orientation</title><p>Prior work suggested that adherens junctions are involved in division orientation.

The adherens junction component, E-cadherin, is localized asymmetrically and coordinates the asymmetric divisions within these cells and perturbation of E-cadherin results in misorientation of the mitotic spindle. Interestingly, in SOP cells it was also shown that perturbation of E-cadherin disrupted the Pins localization, although Pins still appears as a crescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Le Borgne et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>E-cadherin also has a demonstrated role in symmetric divisions. In MDCK cells E-cadherin recruits Pins in a tension-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hart et al., 2017</xref>). It was previously known that Pins/LGN localizes to junctions, but this study first showed a role for force in Pins’ junctional localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hart et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings are consistent with these results. While we did not find a role for Cno in oriented cell division, we were unable to analyze division orientation in a <italic>cno</italic> null mutant, because these mutants also disrupt mesoderm invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sawyer et al., 2009</xref>). As seen in the MDCK cells, in cells within the dorsal head mitotic domains and ventral midline, adherens junctions may sense anisotropic force or shear forces within the tissue and recruit spindle rotation machinery in a polarized fashion to cue division orientation.

To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo example where mechanical force has been shown to polarize Pins to mediate division orientation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of divisions in morphogenesis</title><p>Whole-embryo light-sheet imaging has revealed a connection between mesoderm invagination and posterior, mediolateral flows in the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stern et al., 2022</xref>). These flows could explain how large-scale tissue movements on the ventral side of the embryo are connected to oriented division in the dorsal head. An important question that remains is the function of the oriented divisions of the dorsal head during morphogenesis. The oriented divisions of the ventral midline (MD14) have been shown to alleviate tissue strain and promote tissue elongation by promoting an increase in surface area of the mesectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). This agrees with other studies which suggest that oriented division facilitate tissue elongation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena-López et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). Perturbation using myr-Pins did not affect the number of dividing cells within the domains or the timing of onset of divisions but could possibly affect the elongation of the head epithelium. A recent study followed all the cell intercalations, movements, and divisions during gastrulation, showing cell divisions compensate for the cell loss due to various invaginations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stern et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, past work has shown that cell division can lead to oriented pushing forces that could contribute to morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gupta et al., 2021</xref>). In the embryo, apical relaxation that results from mitotic entry and the following oriented division has been shown to give rise to ectopic tissue folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the oriented division of the dorsal head facilitates tissue elongation and compensates for cell loss from mesoderm and endoderm invagination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Study limitations and future directions</title><p>While the evidence in this study supports the hypothesis that morphogenic forces polarize Pins which is required for division orientation, the interpretation of this evidence is limited by certain aspects of the study. First, in describing Pins crescents in mitotic cells, we argue that Pins is on the posterior side for MDs 1 and 3 and anterior side for MD5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result is based on the observation of cells on the boundary of mitotic domains that are not surrounded by other mitotic cells. We do not have the resolution to determine whether Pins is on one or both sides of cells within the domains. One question that arises from this observation is: how does a junction that is under tension recruit Pins to just one side? It will be of future interest to understand the sidedness of Pins in the mitotic domains and what causes this sidedness.</p><p>A broader question is how Pins is specifically recruited along the AP axis. While we show that mesoderm invagination is necessary for division orientation, what provides the directionality of the divisions remains unknown. Previous work has shown tissue flows that correspond to the division orientations we observe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Streichan et al., 2018</xref>). More work is needed to determine the nature of the forces generated at the ventral midline that orient divisions in the dorsal head.</p><p>Finally, we can only speculate on the significance of these oriented divisions during morphogenesis. Planar, oriented division has been shown to be involved in tissue elongation and folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena-López et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kulukian and Fuchs, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Morin and Bellaïche, 2011</xref>). Given that the divisions of MDs 1, 3, 5, and 14 take place during gastrulation, we hypothesize that the divisions may aid in morphogenic movements such as germ-band extension and cephalic furrow invagination, but we have not directly seen this. These questions will form the basis for future work on the relationship between mechanical and molecular cues in division orientation and the contribution of division orientation during development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and genetics</title><p>Fly stocks and crosses used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

They find that cells in the head mitotic domains rotate and align their spindles within 30 degrees of the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. The Pins protein, implicated in spindle orientation in other systems, is planar polarized in mitotic cells. Pins polarization precedes spindle rotation and is correlated with the division angle (but cell shape is not, violating Hertwig's rule). Overexpression of myristoylated Pins results in uniform Pins distribution on the membrane and affects spindle orientation. α-catenin RNAi (but not canoe RNAi) disrupts Pins polarity and spindle orientation in MDs 1, 3 and 5. Low dose CytoD injections (which should disrupt force transmission) also result in defective Pins polarity and spindle orientations. Finally, mechanical isolation by laser ablation also disrupts spindle orientation. The authors find that preventing mesoderm invagination by snail dsRNA disrupts Pins polarity and spindle orientation in the head.</p><p>Major</p><p>1. Is there a certain chirality in the rotation of the spindles? From Video 1, it seems like in MDs 1 and 3 at least, a majority of spindles on the right side of the embryo rotate clockwise, while spindles on the left side rotate counter-clockwise? Is that so, and in that case, are there geometric/molecular considerations that could explain that chirality?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. They are correct in that there is a tilt to the spindle orientation relative to the AP axis. To illustrate this tilt, we performed our spindle analysis separately on the right and left sides of MD1 and found that spindles on the left side align with an average division angle of about 30° from the AP axis whereas spindles on the right side align with an average division angle of -30° from the AP axis. To determine whether spindles on either side rotated with a certain chirality, we measured the fraction of times spindles rotated clockwise or counterclockwise on the left and right sides of the embryo and found there was no preference (on the left side of MD1 53% of measured spindles rotated counterclockwise and 47% rotated clockwise, on the right side 46% rotated counterclockwise and 54% clockwise). We have added this data as Figure 1I-J and discussed in the Results lines 135-147.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors are experts in mesoderm invagination, and understandably concentrate on the role that forces from that process may have in the orientation of head MD divisions. However, the cephalic furrow forms much closer to the head MDs, and in an orientation that might also explain the alignment of spindles in the head. Is cephalic furrow formation important for Pins polarity and spindle orientation in the head MDs?</p></disp-quote><p>This was certainly a possibility, but our experimental results argued that mesoderm invagination is most relevant. For example, neither α-catenin or Snail depletion block the cephalic furrow, but do block mesoderm invagination. Both α-catenin and Snail depletion strikingly disrupted spindle orientation and Pins localization, which suggests mesoderm is most important. Furthermore, light sheet imaging of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo has shown that the head region of the embryo undergoes tissue movement in the direction of the cell division and that this is associated with mesoderm invagination (Stern et al., 2022).</p><p>To further test the importance of mesoderm invagination, we performed additional ablation experiments to disrupt forces transmitted to the mitotic domains from distinct embryo regions. Consistent with our original hypothesis and previous data, we discovered that separation of MD1 from the cephalic furrow region had no effect on spindle orientation, but that separation from the ventral side of the embryo had a dramatic disruption of spindle orientation. We added this data as Figure 6O-P and included Supplemental Video 7 showing the result. We added to our summary of the data and how it led us to our conclusions in the first paragraph of the Discussion and a model figure illustrating the distinct cuts and their effects (Figure 7I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Does expression of myristoylated Pins afect mesoderm invagination (or cephalic furrow formation)? From Table S1 it seems that a maternal Gal4 driver was used to express myristoylated Pins, which could affect other tissues in the embryo. So it is in principle possible that effects of myristoylated Pins on mesoderm internalization/cephalic furrow formation could affect cell division orientation much like sna loss of function does, but in a mechanism that does not depend on Pins polarity. There is definitely an effect on mesoderm invagination in α-catenin RNAi (but not in canoe RNAi) embryos, so I wonder if the effect could be consistently through defects in mesoderm invagination (or cephalic furrow formation), and Pins polarity is really dispensable for spindle orientation. Are there head-specific Gal4 drivers that could be used to drive myristoylated Pins exclusively in the head?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that we did not clarify this in our initial submission. Maternal overexpression of myrPins does not obviously disrupt mesoderm internalization or cephalic furrow formation. But, we do see that targeted disruption of mesoderm internalization via a Snail depletion affects the orientation of division. Note that our paper demonstrates the effect of force transmission on Pins polarity and division orientation, which is new and the main conclusion.</p><p>In response to this comment we: (1) added language in the Results that states that gastrulation proceeds in myr-Pins expressing embryos (lines 208-210), and (2) Added to the Discussion of the role of these oriented divisions to morphogenesis (lines 442-458). The role of division orientation and division in general in <italic>Drosophila</italic> early embryo morphogenesis is more complicated and will require considerably more work to understand that is beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Related to the previous point, does mechanical isolation by laser ablation (Figure 6I-N) affect Pins polarity? This experiment could alleviate some of my concerns above, as it certainly does not (should not?) disrupt neither mesoderm invagination nor cephalic furrow formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be useful to look at Pins polarity in laser ablated embryos. Currently, we have been unable to analyze Pins polarity after laser ablation, because the ablation to fully isolate the mitotic domain bleaches fluorescent proteins, especially our Pins::FP signal, which is weaker that other expressed fusions. Also, we have shown that Pins polarity is disrupted by (1) α-cateninRNAi, (2) low dose CytoD injection, and (3) Snail depletion, all of which are expected to disrupt force generation and transmission through tissues.</p><p>In response to the reviewer comment, we have determined that Pins::FP still cannot be localized in directional laser ablations, but directional ablations that separate ventral from dorsal MDs cause similar spindle misorientation as Snail depletion, which we show has a striking effect on Pins polarity. Again, remember that myr-Pins does not affect mesoderm internalization and that Snail depletion affects Pins polarity, so we have shown a clear Pins requirement independent of effects on morphogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>1. Figure S5: I am a bit confused about the role of Toll 2, 6, 8 in orienting spindle orientation. In Figure S5D it seems that dsRNA treatment against these genes does not disrupt spindle orientation, but Figure S5F shows quite a significant (p=0.0057) effect in triple mutants. The authors favor the idea that Toll receptors do not affect spindle orientation, but the difference with the mutant should be addressed. Furthermore, what happens in MDs 3, 5 and 14 (if the germband extension defect does not affect those divisions)? Is there a difference between dsRNA and triple mutant embryos in these other MDs?</p></disp-quote><p>We think this is a great point. We stated in the text that TLRs are not solely responsible (line 251) for spindle orientation as they do not recapitulate the random pattern of division seen in the myr-Pins expression condition. We acknowledge the differences between the dsRNA injection and TLR triple mutant in the manuscript (lines 242-247), but our data show a greater importance for the role of force transmission. We favor the idea that other mechanisms contribute to spindle orientation because even though the TLR triple mutant had a significant effect on spindle orientation, it did not recapitulate the myristoylated Pins phenotype. In addition, we did not observe planar polarized Bazooka or myosin in the dorsal head, indicating the mechanism detailed by the Zallen lab (Pare et al., 2014) is likely not in play within the mitotic domains. Finally, as described above, we now show that isolating MD1 specifically from the ventral domain is sufficient to entirely disrupt spindle orientation (Figure 6O-P).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. No statistical analysis is provided for any of the differences in polarity between Pins and Gap43, and this should be done to demonstrate the significance of the polarization of Pins. Also, particularly for MD14, they should compare anterior vs. posterior polarity, as based on the images in Figure 2H it is not clear that there is a difference between the anterior and posterior side of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We have added the statistical comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2A-D: the authors propose that Pins localizes preferentially to the posterior end of cells (instead of both anterior and posterior ends) in MDs 1, 3 and 14 (and anterior in MD 5). How is the asymmetry in the distribution of Pins along the AP axis accomplished, and is there any significance to it? This should be discussed in a bit more detail (currently no potential mechanisms provided in the discussion, just an acknowledgment of the question).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the localization of Pins to the posterior end of cells in MDs 1, 3, and 14 and anterior end in MD 5 is of great interest. We added an acknowledgment of the question and discuss possible models that could explain the result (lines 467-469). Further investigation of the mechanism of this preferential localization will require extensive molecular and genetic studies and is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Typos</p><p>1.

We have fixed these typos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>This is the first study to my knowledge that demonstrates the role of mechanical forces in polarizing Pins, and provides a nice model to further investigate how mechanical forces generated in one tissue may affect cell division orientation in distant ones. The paper is clear, well written, and quantitative analysis is present for most results. I have some issues with the statistics (or lack thereof) for a couple of results, and potential alternative interpretations for some experiments that in my opinion should be addressed prior to publication. Specifically, it is not clear to me if Pins polarity is at all necessary for spindle orientation in any of the examined MDs.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Overview: In this manuscript, Camuglia et al. show Pins/LGN, which is understood to drive spindle orientation, can localize asymmetrically (with respect to the tissue plane) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. Experimental work (including drug treatments, laser ablation, and knockdowns) lead the authors to propose that this asymmetry is driven by tissue-level tension. The findings are quite interesting and the manuscript is well-written overall.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>The authors propose that localization is driven by tissue-level tension, but the direction of the tension isn't clear from the experimental work. For example, the laser ablation experiments cut around the entire perimeter of the mitotic domain, rather than along just one tension axis. Similarly, the finding that disruption of the ventral furrow (by Snail RNAi) interferes with spindle orientation in the head is very puzzling; the furrow is (A) outside the embryonic head and (B) runs in the parallel direction to the divisions considered. The authors need to address the directionality of tension experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agreed that better defining the direction of tension would strengthen our manuscript. We showed that blocking mesoderm invagination with Snail depletion disrupts spindle orientation, despite Snail not being required for cephalic furrow formation. Light sheet data has shown that mesoderm invagination is associated with global movements throughout the embryo (Stern et al., 2022; Rauzi et al., 2015; Lye et al., 2015). Furthermore, the ventral furrow extends into the head region just past the anterior of MD5. To address the reviewer’s comments, we: (1) Performed directional laser ablations to determine the directionality of the tension that orients the spindle, and (2) Added to our Discussion more about what is said in the literature about the movements that occur in the head during mesoderm invagination (lines 456-459).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As acknowledged in the text, the asymmetric enrichment of Pins in MD14 is fairly weak. Since the cells being examined here border a divot in the tissue, and might therefore be curving relative to the focal plane, it would be good to rule out the possibility that some of the asymmetry in Pins intensity is just a consequence of cell/tissue geometry. One way this could be achieved is by showing multiple focal planes.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. We do not think that the asymmetric Pins enrichment in MD14 is due to tissue geometry or junction tilt. (1) MD14 divides ~10-15 minutes after mesoderm invagination is completed, so the cells do not border a divot (as seen with Gap43::mCh, Figure 2I). The cells do round up, which can be seen as gaps between cells (Figure 3E). (2) We compared Pins to GapCh and only see an enrichment with Pins (Figure 2H-K). If the enrichment was due to tissue curvature or junction orientation relative to imaging axis, we would see the same enrichment in GapCh. (3) Expression of myr-Pins randomizes spindle orientation in MD14 (Figure 3M, N).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3I (and 3M?), it appears that there are fewer cell divisions in the presence of myr-Pins. Is this the case? Since cell shapes change during division, and cell shapes influence tissue tension, an increase in cell divisions could lead to a change in tissue tension. This would be important to address, since tissue tension plays an important role in the proposed model.</p></disp-quote><p>These images are not taken at the same point of MD1 division ‘wave’, there are the same number of divisions in each condition. These mitotic domains exhibit a ‘wave’ of cell division (Di Talia and Wieschaus, 2012), and so the number of divisions in each image reflect the timing at which we captured the image. Quantifications involved divisions throughout this wave, but we chose images for figures which are most representative of what we observed. We added this to the text in the final version of the manuscript (lines 207-210).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The α-catenin and Canoe results are a bit confusing:</p><p>– The rose plot in Figure 4D doesn't show a random distribution of spindle angles, but rather a modest change; most spindles still orient in the normal range. The p value in the figure legend (0.0012) is very different from the one in the figure (5.8284e-04).</p><p>– Α-catenin is the strongest way to disrupt AJs, but (A) the epithelium appears to be intact in the knockdown condition and (B) spindle orientation is impacted but not randomized. Does this mean that the knockdown is incomplete? Or is Cadherin-mediated adhesion (in which α-catenin participates) only partially responsible for force transduction?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that perturbation using αcat RNAi does not recapitulate the complete disruption of division orientation seen in embryos expressing myr-Pins. This is likely due to the variability in the strength of RNAi knockdown, which is observed for most of the RNAi lines that we use. To address the reviewer’s comment, we added rose plots for individual embryos showing extremes in the severity of division orientation disruption (Figure 4E and F). For the main plot (Figure 4D), we have included all the data because we obviously did not want to pick and choose which embryos were used for analysis. So Figure 4D includes all the variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that previous studies implicate Canoe in Pins localization, it seems important to lock down the question of whether Canoe is participating in the mechanism described in this paper. How do the authors know the extent of Canoe knockdown? As suggested by the α-catenin results (described above), is it possible that Canoe knockdown is simply not strong enough to impact spindle orientation?</p><p>Aren't there genetic nulls available?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing these points to our attention. There are certainly genetic nulls available (Sawyer et al., 2009), but the experiment suggested by the reviewer would not establish the necessity of Canoe in mitotic domain cells. This is because Canoe nulls severely disrupt mesoderm invagination more severely than RNAi (Sawyer et al., 2009; Jodoin et al., 2015), as well as affecting junctions in the ectoderm during germband extension (Sawyer et al., 2011). Therefore, we would not be able to distinguish what effect of Canoe would be responsible for the spindle orientation using a null mutation. We did better experiments, we used (1) a gene depletion that specifically compromised mesoderm invagination (<italic>snail),</italic> (2) laser ablation to show the importance of force transmission between mesoderm and mitotic domains, and (3) RNAi to deplete Canoe so that mesoderm invagination initiates and pulls on the ectoderm, but where there is clearly compromised Canoe function. This treatment did not cause any effect on spindle orientation arguing against a role of Canoe in this case. In response to the reviewers comment, we added language to the Results to indicate that it is possible that the Canoe knockdown is not strong enough and our rationale for why we did not perform the experiment in a Canoe null (lines 278-280).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>It can be difficult to interpret some of the spindle orientation data since the AP axis is vertical in the diagrams but horizontal in the rose plots. Can one of these be flipped so they go together?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have flipped the rose plots so they match the images. Note that because of the large size of the figures, we have had to consistently orient anterior towards the top, which we establish at the beginning of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S3 is important information for the reader and should be ideally moved into the main paper. – Protein localizations referred to in text should be annotated on images, as they can be hard to see.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree that S3 should be included in the main paper. The myr-Pins reagent has been used previously so the information in S3 is not new (Chanet et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are some discrepancies between figures, legends and text.</p><p>– p-values differ between figures, legends, and/or text.</p><p>– Fluorescent markers are labelled differently in figures and legend (CLIP170 in Figure 1)</p><p>– Graphs appear to show that MD3 polarizes on posterior side, but figure legend says anterior in Figure S1. Vice versa for MD5.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching these typos. We have fixed these issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ideally, multichannel image overlays should be shown along with individual channels (b/w). However, it is appreciated that the fluorescent signals are exceptionally weak in this study, presenting a challenge to presentation and to quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the overlays would be nice. However, (1) the Pins::GFP signal is weak compared to the tubulin and Gap43 signals, (2) the merge does not provide more clarity, and (3) the figures are already quite large. Therefore, we have only included the separated the images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Graph axes depicting spindle orientation would be more clear if shown in degrees, instead of normalized or in radians.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have changed the graph axes to be in degrees.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Several recent studies have demonstrated that division orientation (in the tissue plane) is governed by tissue level tension. Remarkably, it appears that diverse mechanisms link tension with spindle orientation. Here the authors provide the first in vivo evidence connecting tension to the asymmetric localization of Pins, an important and evolutionarily conserved spindle orientation factor.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This beautiful manuscript uncovers a role for planar polarized PINS/LGN in orienting the mitotic spindle in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia. In response to morphogenetic forces acting on adherens junctions, PINS/LGN localises to junctions in a planar polarized fashion to orient the spindle, and de-polarization of PINS/LGN prevents planar spindle orientation. The experiments are very well performed and the findings are robust. The conclusions are well supported by the data.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>These important findings mirror previous work in human cell culture, but crucially reveal that the same phenomenon occurs in vivo in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. Thus, the findings underscore the highly conserved nature and in vivo relevance of this phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for reading the manuscript and their encouraging words.</p></body></sub-article></article>
