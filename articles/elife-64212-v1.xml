MYC network, is mutated or deleted in a broad spectrum of malignancies. As a critical test of a tumor suppressive role, we inactivated <italic>Mga</italic> in two mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer using a CRISPR-based approach. MGA loss significantly accelerated tumor growth in both models and led to de-repression of non-canonical Polycomb ncPRC1.6 targets, including genes involved in metastasis and meiosis. Moreover, MGA deletion in human lung adenocarcinoma lines augmented invasive capabilities. We further show that MGA-MAX, E2F6, and L3MBTL2 co-occupy thousands of promoters and that MGA stabilizes these ncPRC1.6 subunits. Lastly, we report that MGA loss also induces a pro-growth effect in human colon organoids. Our studies establish MGA as a bona fide tumor suppressor in vivo and suggest a tumor suppressive mechanism in adenocarcinomas resulting from widespread transcriptional attenuation of MYC and E2F target genes mediated by MGA-MAX associated with a non-canonical Polycomb complex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tumor

de-regulation of factors that drive normal developmental programs. Given the critical role of transcription factors in the control of development and in driving cellular functions, it is not surprising that transcriptional regulators can function as potent tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Arguably, one of the most well-characterized oncogenic transcription factors is MYC, which is also essential for normal development (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dang and Eisenman, 2014</xref>). Frequently altered across a broad spectrum of malignancies, MYC orchestrates transcriptional programs promoting metabolic re-wiring and ribosome biogenesis, as well as target gene independent transcriptional processes, ultimately facilitating rampant proliferation and tumor progression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baluapuri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stine et al., 2015</xref>). A large body of evidence suggests that MYC does not function in isolation: it is part of a larger network of transcription factors that cooperate with or antagonize MYC activity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carroll et al., 2018</xref>). All members of this extended MYC network are basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZ) transcription factors that recognize E-box motifs and distinct aspects of chromatin structure in thousands of genes. Within the network MLX and MondoA can cooperate with MYC to promote tumorigenesis in MYC amplified cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, the MXD 1–4, MNT, and MGA proteins oppose MYC transcriptional activity by acting as repressors at E-boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang and Hurlin, 2017</xref>). In principle, either activation of MYC or inactivation of MXD function would stimulate expression of overlapping gene targets and potentially promote oncogenesis. Some support for this notion is provided by recent TCGA data, indicating that a subfraction of multiple tumor types are subject to deletions of MXD family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Network et al., 2018</xref>). However, most striking are the high frequency of genetic alterations sustained by the MAX dimerizing repressor, MGA (pronounced mega), across a wide range of cancers including 8% of lung adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Paoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Network et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). The majority of MGA mutations in lung adenocarcinoma are truncating mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>), and enrichment in nonsense mutations at the MGA locus across all cancers is statistically significant, suggestive of a tumor suppressive role for the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">ICGC Breast Cancer Group et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this, MGA emerged as one of the top hits in a genome-wide CRISPR screen for tumor suppressors in DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reddy et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We identified and initially characterized MGA as a factor that specifically binds the small bHLHZ protein MAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hurlin et al., 1999</xref>). MAX is the obligate dimerization partner of the MYC family of oncogenic drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amati et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackwood and Eisenman, 1991</xref>). MGA is unique in that it is a dual specificity transcription factor that contains both a TBX domain and a bHLHZ region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hurlin et al., 1999</xref>). However, MGA is among the least studied members of the network. Studies in mice and zebrafish suggest that MGA plays an important role in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rikin and Evans, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Washkowitz et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, loss of MGA leads to peri-implantation lethality due to defects in polyamine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Washkowitz et al., 2015</xref>). Much of what is known of MGA’s function in mammalian cells results from studies in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). An RNAi screen revealed that MGA and its dimerization partner MAX are both involved in repressing germ cell-related transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maeda et al., 2013</xref>) and act to prevent entry into meiosis in germline stem cells by directly repressing meiotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, a number of studies have shown that MGA interacts with non-canonical PRC1.6 complexes (herein ncPRC1.6) in ES cells and plays an integral role in recruiting ncPRC1.6 members to target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fursova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scelfo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stielow et al., 2018</xref>). Despite these advances in understanding MGA function in a developmental context, MGA’s role in tumorigenesis remains largely uncharacterized.</p><p>A recent study revealed that ectopic expression of MGA in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines retards their growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Llabata et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that MGA loss of function promotes tumorigenesis in vivo and investigate the molecular basis of its tumor suppressive activity. Given that MGA activity appears to be compromised at high frequency in lung adenocarcinoma, we utilized a lentiviral based in vivo CRISPR strategy to inactivate <italic>Mga</italic> in murine lung cancer models coupled with in vitro functional and genomic occupancy studies to elucidate the functional and molecular consequences of MGA loss. MGA is comprised of over 3000 amino acids and is the largest of the proteins within the MYC network. In addition to its N-terminal T-Box binding motif and C-terminally localized bHLHZ domain which interacts with MAX, MGA possesses a conserved segment of unidentified function (DUF4801) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blum et al., 2021</xref>) as well as extended amino acid sequences whose functional role remains a mystery. In this paper, we extend our murine model of MGA as a lung tumor suppressor by focusing on the bHLHZ region and the DUF domain to begin to characterize the role of the MGA-MAX heterodimer and its associated ncPRC1.6 complex factors in driving transcriptional repression in malignant settings. Lastly, we examined the potentially broader function of MGA as a tumor suppressor by studying the functional consequences of MGA loss in normal and malignant colorectal organoids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Mga</italic> inactivation in <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup> and <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup><italic>Trp53</italic><sup>−/−</sup>-driven mouse models of lung cancer leads to accelerated tumorigenesis</title><p>Publicly available datasets had indicated a correlation between deletion or truncating mutations of several members of the proximal MYC network and tumor progression in lung cancer.

Tumors from sgMga-treated mice exhibited a higher proliferation index as ascertained by Ki67 staining when compared to mice infected with empty vector controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

Principal component analysis suggested heterogeneity in gene expression across tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This may be due at least in part to varying levels of non-tumor cells such as immune cells and fibroblasts present within tumors in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busch et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the heterogeneity, Mga-inactivated cells exhibited a striking increase in expression of several meiotic genes, such as <italic>Stag3</italic>, <italic>Sox30</italic>, and <italic>Tdrd1</italic>, previously reported to be directly regulated by MGA-PRC1.6 in ES and germline cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>).

Interrogation of protein domain databases revealed that this region includes a conserved domain of unknown function (DUF4801, located at aa 1043–1084). To assess whether this region in MGA is required for binding to L3MBTL2 in vitro we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using HA-tagged L3MBTL2 and Flag-tagged MGA or MGA∆DUF (MGA∆1003–1304 deleting a segment encompassing DUF 4801). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows preferential association of L3MBTL2 with wild-type MGA as compared with MGA∆DUF.

First, we examined TCGA data to interrogate co-occurrence of MGA and MYC paralog alterations in a panel of LUAD patient samples. Analysis of this data indicated that amplification of MYC paralogs is rare in LUAD whether or not MGA is inactivated (e.g. 1/23 cases of MGA truncating or splice site mutations exhibited amplification of MYCL, while 7/460 cases with wild-type MGA had amplification of any MYC paralogs). Moreover, TCGA samples did not indicate significantly altered MYC family RNA levels in MGA mutant tumors compared with wild-type MGA tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This is consistent with the very modest change in genome-wide MYC association with TSSs in sgMGA-KP cells vs. controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). We also examined RNA pol2 association with MYC binding sites in sgMGA vs wild-type cells. The peak areas plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref> suggest an overall decrease in RNA polymerase II association with MYC-bound genes upon MGA loss despite the fact that MYC binding increases at a subset of loci in MGA deleted cells (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p><p>To ask whether the endogenously expressed MYC is critical for growth, we deleted <italic>MYC</italic> in sgMGA-KP and control KP tumor lines and found suppression of proliferation in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In addition, treatment of control and sgMGA A549 cells with 10058-F4, an extensively used MYC-MAX dimerization inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yin et al., 2003</xref>) revealed that MGA deficient cells are as sensitive to MYC inhibition as control vector-transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Similar to the mouse lung adenocarcinoma KP model, the expression of several EMT-related genes was elevated upon MGA loss. Strikingly, we also noted a broad upregulation of E2F regulated, cell cycle and DNA replication associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). As in the Kras tumors, inflammation and interferon signaling genes were significantly enriched amongst the downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Pathways unique to colon organoids also scored significantly. For example, several colon stemness associated genes including <italic>LGR5</italic> were upregulated upon MGA loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muñoz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Flier et al., 2009</xref>).

Moreover, in the same study, other members of the MYC network such as the presumptive MYC antagonists MXD, MNT, and MGA proteins were found to be inactivated in a subset of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Network et al., 2018</xref>). Arguably, an equilibrium between activating and repressive heterodimers within the network is likely to be critical for tissue homeostasis and can be disrupted in oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carroll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Link et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). To investigate the functions of putative MYC antagonists more deeply we focused on MGA, the largest bHLHZ protein known to heterodimerize with MAX. Intriguingly, MGA sustains a high rate of inactivating alterations across a wide range of malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Network et al., 2018</xref>). We chose to further investigate MGA function in lung cancer since a substantial percentage of lung adenocarcinoma patients (6–10%) harbor MGA alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Recent studies indicate that MGA function is consistent with it acting as a MYC antagonist and tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Llabata et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reddy et al., 2017</xref>). For example, introduction of MGA into lung adenocarcinoma cells significantly retards their growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Llabata et al., 2020</xref>). Here we demonstrate that MGA inactivation dramatically accelerates tumor progression in a murine model of lung adenocarcinoma and triggers oncogenic conversion in human-derived colon tissues. Our work furnishes in vivo evidence for MGA acting as a potent tumor suppressor, identifies genes directly regulated by MGA that are candidates for contributing to oncogenesis and provides model systems for further studies on MGA function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>MGA functions within the ncPRC1.6 complex</title><p>Cancer genome sequencing efforts reveal that in addition to mutations in growth-promoting signaling pathways such as in EGFR and KRAS, chromatin-modifying enzymes and epigenetic regulators such as KMT2D, ARID1A, and TET2 are also frequent targets of genetic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kandoth et al., 2013</xref>). Dysregulation of Polycomb repression mediated by PRC2 has been characterized in several cancers (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laugesen et al., 2016</xref>). For example, elevated levels of EZH2, a methyltransferase associated with PRC2, drives tumor progression in mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma through the establishment of a unique super-enhancer landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, studies have established a context-dependent function for canonical PRC1 complex members in malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koppens and van Lohuizen, 2016</xref>). However, the role of non-canonical PRC1 complexes in malignant cells is poorly understood. Recent reports indicate that the four distinct ncPRC1 complexes (PRC1.1; PRC2/4; PRC3/5; and PRC1.6) function in normal development through interaction with genomic DNA and recruitment of histone modifying enzymes, including histone methyltransferases, and ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trojer et al., 2011</xref>). ncPRC1.6 is the only ncPRC1 complex reported to include MAX and MGA. In terms of gene expression, ncPRC1.6 binding has been associated with both permissive transcription and repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scelfo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stielow et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, the ncPRC1.6 complex, through its MGA-MAX mediated DNA binding activity, has been demonstrated to critically control the repression of meiotic genes during both male and female murine germ cell development and to suppress differentiation of embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endoh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hishida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>). In line with these observations, our expression profiling studies in MGA-deficient tumors and cell lines revealed a significant upregulation of known germ cell related transcripts such as <italic>Stag3</italic>, <italic>Tdrkh</italic>, and <italic>Zcwpw1</italic>. Furthermore, these genes, together with <italic>Podxl2</italic> and <italic>Nhlrc</italic>, comprise a group of five genes whose expression is significantly induced in murine sgMga-Kras, and sgMga-Kras/p53 tumors and in TCGA human lung cancers with MGA alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>). Four of these genes were significantly upregulated upon MGA deletion in human colon organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). In both the lung and colon, we also detected a less marked de-repression of several hundred genes impinging on a diverse array of processes ranging from lipid metabolism to EMT.</p><p>Our genomic occupancy analysis in both mouse and human lung cancer lines is entirely consistent with the widespread recruitment of ncPRC1.6 subunits with MGA-MAX binding sites on genomic DNA. We detect overlap between members of the ncPRC1.6 complex (E2F6, L3MBTL2, MAX, and MGA) at several thousand promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, a high percentage of the genes whose expression is altered upon MGA deletion are directly bound by the MGA-MAX complex. The latter include most of the loci encoding germ cell related proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The data suggest that the majority of MGA-bound genes in these cells are ncPRC1.6 regulated. A subset of these genes is also bound by E2F6, consistent with previous studies suggesting that MGA represses at E2F6-Dp1 sites through ncPRC1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Llabata et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>). We show that loss of MGA results in greatly diminished L3MBTL2 and E2F6 genomic binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Taken together with our observation that MGA stabilizes ncPRC1.6 complex members in tumor cells, our findings strongly implicate MGA as an anchor or scaffold for PRC1.6 even in malignant settings.</p><p>The link between ncPRC1.6 activity and the effects of MGA loss on specific gene expression was further investigated by comparing gene expression profiles of Crispr-mediated deletion of <italic>Mga</italic> with deletions of ncPRC1.6 subunits <italic>Pcgf6</italic> and <italic>L3mbtl2</italic> in KP tumor cells. Deletion of either <italic>Pcgf6</italic>, <italic>L3mbtl2,</italic> or bothresults in expression profiles that are similar but not identical to the profiles generated by <italic>Mga</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the overall direction of change due to <italic>Mga</italic> vs. <italic>Pcgf6/L3mbtl2</italic> deletions is similar, the degree of change is attenuated for many genes. Thus, while <italic>Pcgf6</italic> and <italic>L3mbtl2</italic> contribute to the transcriptional effect consequent to <italic>Mga</italic> deletion, they do not fully account for the degree of change in gene expression. It is likely that other ncPRC1.6 subunits (e.g. E2F6) or factors (e.g. HDACs, CBX3) associated with other regions of MGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) play key roles in the transcriptional and physiological response to MGA loss of function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The DUF region is critical for MGA’s tumor suppressive function</title><p>Our mass spectrometric analysis using fragments of MGA revealed that aa1000–1300 are critical for MGA interactions with L3MBTL2. This region encompasses a domain of unknown function known as DUF4801, and several lines of evidence suggest that it is important for mediating tumor suppression. First, addback of a mutant form of MGA lacking this region fails to retard the growth of MGA-deficient human and mouse lung cancer lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Second, multiple truncating mutations in MGA reported in the pan-cancer TCGA database either remove the DUF region entirely or occur within the DUF region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Lastly, MGA truncations in leukemia due to intronic polyadenylation also occur in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). The truncated form of MGA produced in this manner acts as a dominant negative and activates MYC and E2F targets. A very recent study reported that a MGA splice variant lacking the bHLHZ region, yet still associating with ncPR1.6, acts as a dominant interfering form during germ cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kitamura et al., 2020</xref>). Further experiments will be required to determine whether the truncated MGA DUF mutant, as well as other truncated or point mutated forms, promote oncogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>MGA target gene activity in the context of MYC network and E2F targets</title><p>Our ChIP-Seq data show extensive overlap among genes occupied by MYC, MAX, RNA polymerase II, and the MGA-MAX-ncPRC1.6 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,M</xref>), and it is tempting to assume that MGA plays a role as a putative MYC antagonist similar to the MXD/MNT proteins. However, mechanistically, MGA repression, mediated by ncPRC1.6, appears to be distinct from the repressive activity of the MXD/MNT proteins, mediated by Sin3-HDAC. MGA is also unusual in possessing a functional T-box as well as a bHLHZ DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hurlin et al., 1999</xref>). A very recent report demonstrates that both of these domains are involved in MGA-induced repression of meiotic genes in murine ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uranishi et al., 2020</xref>). It is conceivable that MGA responds to a distinct set of signals and is involved in the regulation of a unique subset of genes relative to other network members. As mentioned above, MGA-PRC1.6 has been demonstrated to play a key role in repression of meiotic gene expression and more generally in the suppression of differentiation and the maintenance of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endoh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hishida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Washkowitz et al., 2015</xref>). These functions are consistent with our observation that meiotic PRC1.6 targets such as <italic>STAG3</italic> and <italic>TDRD1</italic> as well as pro-invasive genes such as <italic>PODXL</italic>2 and mesenchymal lineage genes, like <italic>SNAI1,</italic> are induced upon MGA loss in tumors. Overall, this suggests that during development, in non-transformed cells, MGA-PRC1.6 normally represses inappropriate lineage-specific transcripts. Indeed, we observe a robust upregulation of EMT-associated genes, meiotic genes, and colon stem cell markers upon loss of MGA in normal colon organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). That at least some of these genes are relevant to human cancer is supported by a recent report that high STAG3 expression in colorectal cancer is associated with metastasis, drug resistance, and poor clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sasaki et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of our gene expression profiling studies and chromatin occupancy in mouse and human lung cancer models reveals a strong enrichment for E2F4 and E2F6 targets amongst genes bound by and regulated by MGA. In addition, our studies in colon organoids reveal a robust activation of E2F cell cycle gene targets. This is consistent with studies showing that MGA in association with PRC1.6 occupies E2F and MYC responsive genes in resting (G0) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>). A large body of evidence implicates a critical role for MYC and E2F cooperation in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mathsyaraja et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pickering et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our genomic occupancy studies also reveal that nearly all MGA-bound loci are associated with RNA polymerase II and that the genes upregulated upon MGA deletion display increased polymerase binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,J</xref>). This suggests that the presence of MGA may normally limit the extent of polymerase binding at a subset of genes. MYC-bound genes are also associated with RNA polymerase II but in general do not show increased polymerase binding upon MGA loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). Nonetheless, we observed that MYC occupancy increases at promoters of certain genes upregulated upon MGA deletion, including several ncPRC1.6 meiotic gene targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Analysis of TCGA data suggests that MGA loss in lung adenocarcinoma patients is not frequently accompanied by amplification or highly increased expression of MYC family proteins, although we show that MYC is required for growth and survival of both MGA wild-type and mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). The role of MYC in MGA-inactivated tumors may involve a limited redistribution of MYC to a subset of promoters or enhancers and needs to be explored in more detail.</p><p>Based on our results, we propose that MGA inactivation in pre-malignant settings destabilizes PRC1.6 and consequentially results in unoccupied E-boxes and E2F/Dp1 sites. A combination of invasion of E-boxes by MYC-MAX and/or binding of E2Fs at target loci may account for the net transcriptional activation of these genes and tumor initiation or progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, our studies do not rule out the possibility of other transcription factors contributing to this phenotype. For example, the T-box factor Brachyury is known to promote EMT and invasiveness in several different tumor types, including lung and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernando et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shah et al., 2017</xref> reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Perhaps MGA mediates repression of EMT related transcripts, in addition to meiotic genes, via its T-box domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uranishi et al., 2020</xref>). Further structure–function studies will enable the delineation of the role of MGA’s T-box domain in suppressing tumorigenesis.</p><p>Lastly, we note that, in both the lung adenocarcinoma cells and colon organoids, MGA deletion is also accompanied by downregulation of multiple genes. While some of this repression may be indirect, it is nonetheless apparent that direct MGA binding is associated with a subset of the genes downregulated upon MGA loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which overall are associated with decreased RNA polymerase II binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). In this regard, it is noteworthy that recent reports on ncPRC functions ascribe both activation and repression activities related to ncPRC1.6 subcomplex recruitment with distinct binding and transcriptional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fursova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scelfo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stielow et al., 2018</xref>). While the genes downregulated upon MGA loss in our lung adenocarcinoma cells did not delineate evident functional pathways, the downregulated genes in the colon organoids were involved in inflammatory and interferon gamma responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The possibility of MGA acting as a transcriptional activator remains to be tested, and further studies will be required to delineate the specific components of the immune microenvironment that are impacted by MGA loss in human malignancies.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that MGA acts as a bona fide tumor suppressor in vivo and have uncovered a critical role for MGA and the atypical PRC1.6 complex in lung adenocarcinoma. We also provide preliminary evidence for a tumor suppressive role for MGA in colorectal cancer. Although our data is suggestive of a broad tumor suppressive role of MGA and PRC1.6 via antagonizing transcription of MYC and E2F targets, further studies will be required to elucidate the functional relevance of individual MGA-PRC1.6 targets such as STAG3 in tumorigenesis. Given the frequent inactivation of MGA across diverse cancer types, it will also be critical to further characterize MGA- and PRC1.6-mediated transcriptional attenuation in other malignancies with MGA alterations, such as colorectal cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This is especially important as MGA, via atypical PRC1.6, likely regulates lineage-specific genes to mediate its tumor suppressor role in a context-dependent manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Loss of MGA mediated Polycomb repression promotes tumor progression and invasiveness&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Martin Eilers as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the paper provides strong in vivo data for a tumor-suppressive role for Mga in lung carcinogenesis. The authors are convincing that MGA is important in oncogenesis. We note here that MGA is highly understudied (~200 publications) in and of itself despite its involvement with the MYC network for oncogenesis (~41,000 publications at the current time). Given a protein of 3000 amino acids, the number of potential protein partners and PTMs that might modify its tumor suppressor functions are staggering. However, the reviewers also noted that a previous paper has addressed the same topic and the novelty of the data presented here needs to better explained and additional experiments are needed to strengthen and expand the new aspects.</p><p>There are several loosely articulated stories here, but the reader does not come away with a clear take-home message. No particular oncogenic pathway is intensively explored or elucidated. MGA seems to be quite a general tumor suppressor, so is there a reason to focus experiments on lung vs. colon adenocarcinomas, or are these convenient models to explore general MGA action? The PRC1.6 story is interesting, but it is not integrated into a general description of MGA action. We think the authors buried the lede here; the take home message should be that there are multiple, perhaps independent mechanisms for tumor suppression embedded in MGA; these mechanisms should be clearly enumerated and the evidence for each supported. As presented, there is little attempt to separate or coordinate the various anti-oncogenic functions and contributions of the different domains of MGA-T-box, bHLH, or DUF480. Just considering the bHLH domain, there are multiple possibilities for MGA to disturb the MYC-network and suppress oncogenesis. The actin protrusions seem to be related to DUF480 but unrelated to PRC1.6; they probably relate with the observations about migration, wound healing and EMT (and so may also be relevant for T-box functions). I would suggest a serious re-write to identify, organize and reinforce their story(ies).</p><p>1. It seems that the investigation of publicly available datasets is essentially identical to the Schaub et al.. analysis and not new data. If the authors want to maintain this, they would need to better explain what is new. One important piece of information that seems to be missing is whether the mutations are homozygous or heterozygous. So data on MGA and MYC protein expression in human tumors would greatly strengthen this part.</p><p>Inspections of the MGA mutations on cBio portal reveals broad tissue specificity of tumors, well beyond lung and colon adenocarcinomas-in view of this range there is really no need to justify the choice of tumors, only to be wary whether differences in expression of MGA targets truly reflect MGA versus the tissue as the source of a non-pathogenic difference. Looking at the distribution of the mutations within MGA, I disagree with the assertion that DUF480 is a hotspot. The only lukewarm to hot spot in the protein seems to be the bHLH region. The other mutations are rather evenly distributed throughout the protein. This does not mean that they are not pathogenic, more likely it indicates a broad range of contributory motifs and domains. I suspect that there is a lot of interesting and important biology throughout these 3000 residues.</p><p>2. Conceptually, one would like to know whether tumor development in an MGA-delete situation depends on MYC. One would also like to know whether the polycomb complex that is assembled by MGA is tumor-suppressive. Therefore, the authors should perform a similar analysis as they did for MGA (introduce sgRNAs into the lung models) and score the phenotypes they get. Both experiments could be done in cell lines established from this model and either in vitro (that would allow a mechanistic analysis, e.g. RNA seq) or upon re-transplantation. This would also prevent simply reporting negative results.</p><p>3. The interpretation of the VENN diagram and the heatmaps in Figure 5A,B is somewhat uncertain. If one plots these for MYC, occupancy often simply parallels occupancy by RNAPII, so essentially being bound by MYC simply says the promoter is open/active. Is this the case for MGA and its complex partners? Or is there a specificity in binding? The authors should do RNAPII ChipSeqs in these cells, preferentially +/- MGA, and then show these alongside (and plot a correlation between MYC, RNAPII and MGA occupancy).</p><p>Along these lines, it is hard to understand how one obtain the extreme p-values shown in figure 5E and 5H, I would challenge this. If the authors want to maintain this, they should not use ENCODe data, but simply determine what genes are active in the cells (e.g. what promoters are bound by RNAPII) and then use those as background list and calculate P-values for overlap between MYC, MAX and E2F6.</p><p>Based on the description, the ChIPSeq analyses are not spike-normalized and I could not find information about the number of repeats. If it is n=1, the authors need to find a way to exclude that the differences are due to experimental variation.</p><p>4. The authors use the term &quot;Empty&quot; vector for their sgMGA -CRISPR-cas-Cre lentivirus without the sgRNA. This is confusing-what they mean is minus-sg; the vector is hardly &quot;empty&quot;. While it would have been nice to have a non-targeting sgRNA just to ensure that no part of the phenotype reflects off-target or non-specific effects of CRISPR-CAS or CRE-expression, at least they should make clear in the text what is the difference between the vectors.</p><p>5. The methods describing the observation and quantitation of the actin protrusions are a bit sparse. The interpretation relating DUF480 with actin protrusions and with gene expression separate fromPRC1.6 is hard to follow and sparsely supported.</p><p>6. Contrary to what is stated in the manuscript, to my eye MAX is reduced in LOU-NH-91.</p><p>7. The KP mouse models are driven by activated RAS called RASV12G but not MYC. Is MYC amplified in these models? I was struck by the finding in Figure 5 and comment that whether MGA is present or not, MYC will drive tumor growth. Some lung adenocarcinomas acquire MYC amplification. Do the human lines used in the experiments have MYC amplified?</p><p>It is unclear to me whether MAG loss and MYC amplification are mutually exclusive or correlated? The authors should comment as to whether MGA is required or not in MYC amplified tumors.</p><p>8. Does MGA-MAX compete with MYC-MAX to bind the E boxes, and if so, would enforced expression of MYC in the tumors reverse the phenotype? It would be good for the authors to define MAG as the MAX-Gene associated protein.</p><p>9. While the title states that &quot;Loss of MGA mediated polycomb repression..&quot;, I would add atypical or non-canonical polycomb to the title to distinguish is from the other better known PCR2 and PCR1 complexes.</p><p>10. The authors use PRC1.6 rather than PCFG6-PRC1 used by Llabata. The authors should make sure in the text that is refers to the same complex.</p><p>11. Figure 4 panels 4B and 4, MGA antibody shows multiple bands. A cleaner blot will help. Is MGA expressed as spliced variants or is the antibody dirty?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64212.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers agreed that the paper provides strong in vivo data for a tumor-suppressive role for Mga in lung carcinogenesis.

While they note that MGA is relatively understudied, they point out that the recent paper by Llabata et al. also addressed aspects of MGA’s tumor suppressive and DNA binding activities and the reviewers ask us to explain the novelty of our paper.</p><p>As noted, a major focus of our paper is that it provides and validates a mouse model in</p><p>which we delete MGA and demonstrate its tumor suppressive activity. The</p><p>experiments in Llabata et al., including the biological assays and the ChIP-Seq,</p><p>were done by <italic>overexpressing</italic> MGA in cells which already express endogenous</p><p>MGA. Therefore, all of their data monitor the consequences of overexpression of</p><p>MGA, a situation without clear biological relevance. In the experiments reported in</p><p>our paper, we delete MGA. Therefore, our molecular data refer to a comparison</p><p>between MGA null and the same cells expressing endogenous MGA. This is</p><p>important since MGA is a tumor suppressor and its loss of function is what is crucial</p><p>biologically, as we show here or the first time in our lung adenocarcinoma model.</p><p>In addition, by deleting MGA we were able to show that its loss corresponds to an</p><p>increase in a core set of target genes previously associated with PRC1.6.</p><p>Furthermore, we show that members of this core group are directly bound by the MGA-MAX PRC1.6 complex and are relevant to the proliferation of tumors that lack MGA (Figure 5, Figure 7L).</p><p>The PRC1.6 complex has been known to be associated with MGA since at least</p><p>2012 as indicated in our references cited. Llabata et al. confirmed that result in somatic cells as do we, but we extend this data to show that PRC1.6 subunits are associated with MGA through the DUF4801domain of MGA. This is the first identification of the interface between PRC1.6 and MGA. It is important and relevant because multiple frame shift mutants in MGA have the consequence of deleting this region in a wide range of tumor types including lung cancers (Figure 4 -Sup 1B). In our revised paper we cite Llabata as well as earlier reports relating to MGA multiple times and describe in greater detail the differences with our data (line 91+).</p><p>Regarding our choice of experimental systems (lung and colon) the reviewer is correct in suggesting that we were influenced by a combination of having available a well-established mouse model for lung adenocarcinoma as well as the ongoing organoid cultures from human colon. Both systems offer the possibility of assessing early events in oncogenic conversion. Furthermore, TCGA data indicates that LUAD is second (following UVEC) in terms of prevalence of MGA mutations. In the Introduction (line 58+) we cite the previous reports that led us to choose these models.</p><p>The reviewers point out the potentially “staggering” complexity of MGA and the possibility that it has myriad activities potentially linked to functions within its three described regions (T box, DUF 4801, and bHLHZ) and suggest a re-write of our text to clarify what we know about the structure-function relationships related to MGA. In the revised paper we have reorganized and rewritten many sections to increase clarity and have underscored both in the results and discussion what functions can and cannot be attributed to the various regions of MGA. We can only agree that there is “… a lot of interesting and important biology…” associated with MGA and see our paper as providing a jumping off point for further exploration of this “highly understudied” tumor suppressor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

TCGA paper and was lumped together with MNT and the MXDs. In the present manuscript our point was to highlight the pervasiveness of MGA loss and focus on two tumor types where MGA loss of function is apparent and also include and compare TCGA and Genie-derived data.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s request for more information we have collaborated with Alice Berger and Sita Moorthi (now listed as co-authors) genomic analysis experts who have further analyzed the TCGA data and particularly focused on MGA mutations in lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) that would be expected to lead to inactivation of the protein through loss of functional domains (e.g. frame shifts and nonsense mutations, all of which lead to truncation of MGA. We have omitted missense mutations since their effects cannot be readily predicted). The available data indicates that all of the truncating mutations in LUAD would be predicted to delete either the T-box, the DUF4801 region, or the bHLHZ or all three (see revised Figure 4- Figure supplement 1B). It was based on this information that we decided to investigate the DUF region in the proteomics experiment (line 253+). Moreover, the available data indicates that 25% of the functional mutations are homozygous. We note that heterozygous mutations may be consequential as there is recent evidence from Okuda’s lab suggesting that, in germ cell development, an alternatively spliced form of MGA can act as a dominant interfering form (Kitamura et al). Please see our comments on (line 580) in the revised paper.</p><p>Further analysis of the TCGA data revealed that only one of the LUAD samples with truncated MGA displayed amplification of MYCL and none showed MYCN or MYC amplification, while 3 tumors with MGA missense mutations showed MYC amplifications. Turning to RNA expression levels, the TCGA data show no significant difference in MYC family gene expression in MGA mutants compared to LUAD without MGA alteration (data included in Figure 5-figure supp.1D). Lastly, LUADs with MGA mutations were mutually exclusive with gain or loss of MAX copy number or expression changes, as expected since MAX loss would be expected to inactivate MGA E-box binding. While some LUAD tumor lines have high MYC, in general MYC amplification is not strongly associated with LUAD, in contrast with SCLC where all 3 Myc family members are frequently amplified. This is described in the revised paper starting at line 324.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Conceptually, one would to know whether tumor development in an MGA-delete situation depends on MYC. One would also like to know whether the polycomb complex that is assembled by MGA is tumor-suppressive. Therefore,the authors should perform a similar analysis as they did for MGA (introduce sgRNAs into the lung models) and score the phenotypes they get. Both experiments could be done in cell lines established from this model and either in vitro (that would allow a mechanistic analysis, e.g. RNA seq) or upon re-transplantation. This would also prevent simply reporting negative results.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer's request we have now utilized CRISPR to inactivate Myc, Mga, L3mbtl2, Pcgf6, and L3mbtl2+Pcgf6 in tumor derived KP cell lines and verified relevant loss of expression changes in these genes (Figure 6 supp1). To assess potential effects on cellular behavior we carried out proliferation as well as invasion assays. MYC deletion results in growth arrest or apoptosis in the KP and the KP-sgMGA cells (Figure 5- Figure supp 1F) consistent with the MYC and MAX inhibitor data already included in the paper (Figure S5G,H). Deletion of MGA, or PRC1.6 complex subunits had no significant effect on proliferation rate relative to KP controls. In the spheroid assay the sgMGA cells showed marginally greater outgrowth than controls but the sgPRC1.6 had reduced outgrowth compared to controls. These very subtle effects on cell behavior are not entirely surprising given that the KP cells are already derived from advanced lung tumors at a late stage of tumor progression. The optimal experiment would be to generate the individual deletions in the initial murine model to address their role in tumor initiation – but given the time and depth of analysis required, we cannot realistically include it in this paper.</p><p>Turning to the RNA-seq data we compared differentially expressed genes in KP cells upon individual deletion of Mga, L3mbtl2, Pcgf6, and L3mbtl2+Pcgf6 cells. In figure 6 we show heat maps and Venn diagrams demonstrating highly significant overlap among genes upregulated upon MGA loss and those upregulated by individual deletion of L3mbtl2 and Pcgf6. Most notably we find that genes associated with meiotic recombination and repair are among the most differentially upregulated upon Mga deletion as well as by deletion of Pcgf6 or L3mbtl2 (e.g. Stag3, Tdrkh, Zcwpw1) as well as genes involved in EMT. These findings support the notion of a critical role for the PRC1.6 complex in gene regulation by MGA. At the same time it is clear that deletion of key PRC1.6 factors do not fully recapitulate the effect of Mga loss. This underscores the notion that other regions of MGA contribute to the deletion phenotype. This data has been included in revised Figure 6. We have now added a separate section devoted to what we understand about the role of MYC in MGA deleted tumors (starts at line 335 and in the Discussion starting at line 584+).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The interpretation of the VENN diagram and the heatmaps in Figure 5A,B is somewhat uncertain. If one plots these for MYC, occupancy often simply parallels occupancy by RNAPII, so essentially being bound by MYC simply says the promoter is open/active. Is this the case for MGA and its complex partners? Or is there a specificity in binding? The authors should do RNAPII ChipSeqs in these cells, preferentially +/- MGA, and then show these alongside (and plot a correlation between MYC, RNAPII and MGA occupancy).</p><p>Along these lines, it is hard to understand how one obtain the extreme p-values shown in figure 5E and 5H, I would challenge this. If the authors want to maintain this, they should not use ENCODe data, but simply determine what genes are active in the cells (e.g. what promoters are bound by RNAPII) and then use those as background list and calculate P-values for overlap between MYC, MAX and E2F6.</p><p>Based on the description, the ChIPSeq analyses are not spike-normalized and I could not find information about the number of repeats. If it is n=1, the authors need to find a way to exclude that the differences are due to experimental variation.</p></disp-quote><p>Assessing RNAPII, Myc and Mga occupancy is an excellent suggestion and is something that we had planned to do as a close follow-up to the present study. Nonetheless we have now carried out these experiments and included the data in our revised paper (Figure 5). The data shown are from ChIP-seq and the Venn diagram numbers are derived from the 2 experiments. We have included a new Venn diagrams showing the overlap between MYC, MGA and RNAPII as well as TSS +/-2kb line plots and box plots indicating the concurrence of RNAPII and MGA binding in the +/- MGA conditions. As evident from the data, there is a high degree of overlap between occupancy by MGA, MYC, and RNAPII. We also note a significant increase in RNAPII occupancy to genes upregulated upon MGA deletion (Figure 5J). Downregulated genes and MYC bound genes display a modest decrease in binding (Figure 5K). As requested, we deleted the Encode-based categories from Figure 5. These findings are also discussed in the results and in the Discussion section (line 584).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors use the term &quot;Empty&quot; vector for their sgMGA -CRISPR-cas-Cre lentivirus without the sgRNA. This is confusing-what they mean is minus-sg; the vector is hardly &quot;empty&quot;. While it would have been nice to have a non-targeting sgRNA just to ensure that no part of the phenotype reflects off-target or non-specific effects of CRISPR-CAS or CRE-expression, at least they should make clear in the text what is the difference between the vectors.</p></disp-quote><p>We employed the term ‘empty’ to highlight the fact that it was indeed minus sgRNA, something that is not infrequent in the existing literature. Nonetheless we take the reviewer's point that it is ambiguous and have now ensured that it is clearly defined it in the text, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The methods describing the observation and quantitation of the actin protrusions are a bit sparse.

Contrary to what is stated in the manuscript, to my eye MAX is reduced in LOU-NH-91.</p></disp-quote><p>We pointed out the lack of a strong effect on MAX levels because previous work from us and others has indicated that MAX loss is associated with increased MYC protein degradation. Therefore, the presence of MAX would be consistent with an effect on MYC gene expression rather than protein turnover. In response to the reviewer’s comment, we have measured the levels of MAX by densitometry as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> (normalized to actin loading).

The KP mouse models are driven by activated RAS called RASV12G but not MYC. Is MYC amplified in these models? I was struck by the finding in Figure 5 and comment that whether MGA is present or not, MYC will drive tumor growth. Some lung adenocarcinomas acquire MYC amplification. Do the human lines used in the experiments have MYC amplified?</p><p>It is unclear to me whether MAG loss and MYC amplification are mutually exclusive or correlated? The authors should comment as to whether MGA is required or not in MYC amplified tumors.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not directly measured MYC levels in untransformed and KRAS transformed lung epithelial cells. However, activation of the RAS pathway has been known for many years to result in increased MYC protein stability and this is likely to be the case in the KRAS tumors. Importantly, MYC mRNA, protein, and overall genomic occupancy are not measurably different in the KRAS/p53 tumor derived cells whether or not MGA is deleted. This is consistent with the TCGA data which do not show consistent amplification or elevated expression of MYC in LUAD that correlates with MGA inactivating mutations (see Figure supplement 5D). In fact, amplification of MYC is not very common in LUAD (in sharp contrast to SCLC). Nonetheless there are some LUAD lines with amplified MYC (the human H23 line does have amplification of MYC while the A549 lacks MYC amplification). Our data indicate that the endogenous levels of MYC in both KP and KP-sgMga lines are required for proliferation and survival. It is conceivable that high MYC levels may trigger apoptosis in the absence of MGA. Having said all this it is important to note that the expression of MYC is critical for the growth of most cells including the KP and the KP-sgMGA cells (see Figure 5 supplement 1 E-G). Our future experiments will address the role of MYC and other transcription factors as a consequence of MGA loss.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Does MGA-MAX compete with MYC-MAX to bind the E boxes, and if so, would enforced expression of MYC in the tumors reverse the phenotype? It would be good for the authors to define MAG as the MAX-Gene associated protein.</p></disp-quote><p>In our paper reporting the identification and initial characterization of MGA (Hurlin et al. 1999 doi: 10.1093/emboj/18.24.7019) we noted that equivalent amounts of the GST-linked bHLHZ regions of MYC and MGA bound roughly equal amounts of MAX and E-box containing DNA oligonucleotides. Rigorous binding affinities have not been determined and would certainly be worthwhile carrying out for MGA as well as other network factors. While not definitive in terms of binding strength, our ChIP analyses indicate that MGA and MYC and other network factors can occupy the same regions of DNA.</p><p>In that same 1999 paper we identified MGA as one of a group of novel genes and proteins that heterodimerize with MAX. We named it MGA to: (i) distinguish it from the other group of MAX dimerizing proteins (MAD or MXD proteins) and (ii) to underscore that it is by far the largest of the MAX network proteins. We note in the present paper that it should be pronounced &quot;mega&quot; to reflect this fact (line 59).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
