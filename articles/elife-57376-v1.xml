pathways is challenging because of the complexity of regulatory mechanisms and response dynamics, which can vary with both time and the type of stress. We developed a reverse genetic method called ReporterSeq to comprehensively identify genes regulating a stress-induced transcription factor under multiple conditions in a time-resolved manner. ReporterSeq links RNA-encoded barcode levels to pathway-specific output under genetic perturbations, allowing pooled pathway activity measurements via DNA sequencing alone and without cell enrichment or single-cell isolation. We used ReporterSeq to identify regulators of the heat shock response (HSR), a conserved, poorly understood transcriptional program that protects cells from proteotoxicity and is misregulated in disease. Genome-wide HSR regulation in budding yeast was assessed across 15 stress conditions, uncovering novel stress-specific, time-specific, and constitutive regulators. ReporterSeq can assess the genetic regulators of any transcriptional pathway with the scale of pooled genetic screens and the precision of pathway-specific readouts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genetic screens</kwd><kwd>heat shock response</kwd><kwd>chaperones</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>protein quality control</kwd><kwd>HSF1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM115968</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brandman</surname><given-names>Onn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5 T32 GM007276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alford</surname><given-names>Brian D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1813049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valiant</surname><given-names>Gregory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1704417</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valiant</surname><given-names>Gregory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N00014-18-1-2295</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valiant</surname><given-names>Gregory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A pooled genetic screening method measures the effect of knocking down every gene on a transcriptional stress response to proteotoxic stress (the heat shock response) using only nucleic acid sequencing, without cell enrichment or single-cell isolation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The heat shock response (HSR) is a conserved stress response that shields cells from cytoplasmic proteotoxicity by increasing the expression of protective proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lindquist, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morimoto, 2011</xref>). The HSR is driven by the transcription factor Hsf1, a trimeric protein that promotes expression of chaperones and other cellular components that refold misfolded proteins or target them for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerfelt et al., 2010</xref>). A diverse array of stressors activate the HSR, including heat, ethanol, oxidative stressors, and amino acid analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morano et al., 2012</xref>). In these conditions, HSR activity can follow diverse trajectories, with both transient or prolonged activity observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sorger, 1990</xref>). Furthermore, aberrant HSR activation has been linked to neurodegeneration (too little HSR activation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campanella et al., 2018</xref>) and cancer (too much HSR activation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Whitesell and Lindquist, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The complexity of the HSR has led to a multitude of models for how the HSR is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>). These include negative regulation in which the chaperones Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zou et al., 1998</xref>), and Hsp60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neef et al., 2014</xref>) bind and inhibit Hsf1 directly. Signaling pathways have also been demonstrated to modulate Hsf1 activity through phosphorylation by kinases such as Snf1, Yak1, and Rim15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hahn and Thiele, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, post-transcriptional models have been proposed, such as HSR-regulated mRNA half life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heikkinen et al., 2003</xref>) or regulation of the translation efficiency of heat shock mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zid and O'Shea, 2014</xref>). Yet the extent to which these and other mechanisms drive the HSR under diverse stressors is poorly understood, limiting our ability to understand and remedy the HSR in disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neckers and Workman, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Reverse genetic studies of the HSR have been useful in discovering both new protein quality control machinery in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>), as well as new methods of regulating the HSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raychaudhuri et al., 2014</xref>). However, existing reverse genetic approaches to measure specific pathway activity require measuring the effect of each gene separately or enriching cells according to pathway activity, making it impractical to test multiple environmental conditions or make time-resolved measurements.</p><p>To address this methodological deficit and knowledge gap, we developed ReporterSeq, a pooled, genome-wide screening technology that can measure the effect of genetic perturbations with the scale of pooled genetic screens and the precision of pathway-specific readouts (e.g. quantitative PCR [qPCR], fluorescence, luciferase reporters). ReporterSeq measures pathway activity under a specific perturbation through levels of a corresponding barcode. Thus, ReporterSeq does not require cell sorting and instead relies only upon measuring barcode frequencies at a single genetic locus of a pooled sample. This allows dozens of samples to be collected on the same day, prepared for sequencing, and then read out in a single high-throughput sequencing run. Because ReporterSeq uses RNA levels as a direct readout of transcriptional activity, pathway activity can be measured even in conditions in which protein synthesis is compromised.</p><p>We performed ReporterSeq in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> under basal growth conditions and 13 stress conditions to identify general and stress-specific regulators of the HSR. This elucidated the roles of known regulators, like the Hsp70 chaperone system and Snf1 kinase complex, as well as novel regulators, including Gcn3 and Asc1, in responding to diverse stressors. A time course of HSR activation in response to heat stress revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms in the early and late stages of heat stress. We further investigated how loss of Gcn3 regulates the HSR and found that, contrary to its canonical role in stress-dependent inhibition of translation, Gcn3 is required for efficient translation of both Hsf1-dependent and Hsf1-independent stress-dependent reporter genes under arsenite stress. In addition to elucidating HSR regulation, our work demonstrates that ReporterSeq is a generally applicable tool to dissect the genetic basis for the activity of any transcription factor in a quantitative, scalable, and time-resolved manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A pooled strategy to measure expression of a specific gene under genome-wide, CRISPR perturbations without cell enrichment</title><p>ReporterSeq measures how endogenous genes affect the expression of an exogenous reporter gene. It accomplishes this through pairing a genetic perturbation with barcode levels from a pathway-specific readout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Though ReporterSeq can be implemented with any encodable genetic perturbation (e.g. RNAi, CRISPR knockouts), we used CRISPRi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>) as a perturbation to lower expression of each gene and paired it with a barcoded mRNA encoding GFP downstream of an Hsf1-responsive synthetic promoter built upon a ‘crippled’ <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter sequence derived from a 225 nucleotide fragment of the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guarente and Mason, 1983</xref>). This synthetic promoter, previously used in a fluorescence-based HSR screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guarente and Mason, 1983</xref>), is sensitive to Hsf1 activity as well as proteins that may regulate the <italic>CYC1</italic> sequence fragment (note that no transcription factors other than Hsf1 are known to bind to the sequence). To maximize dCas9-Mxi1 (a transcription inhibitor) and sgRNA expression, we expressed dCas9-Mxi1 and the ReporterSeq cassette on two separate high copy plasmids that were coexpressed in each cell. We verified that the genetic knockdowns could modulate the heat shock reporter by measuring the effects of known HSR regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>) on reporter output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We therefore concluded that CRISPRi knockdowns were effective in our system and capable of altering HSR reporter activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of ReporterSeq method.</title><p>Example given for measuring the heat shock response (HSR) using a heat shock element (HSE)-driven promoter and CRISPRi to perturb gene expression.

The library is then introduced into cells such that each cell contains one construct. Cells are grown in the desired conditions and then harvested at the desired timepoints. RNA and DNA are harvested from the cells and the counts of each barcode are tallied using deep sequencing. The RNA counts for a given barcode are proportional to the total transcriptional output of all cells containing that barcode, while the DNA barcode counts are proportional to cell numbers. Thus, the RNA/DNA ratio of a given barcode reflects the activity of the reporter under the influence of the specific CRISPR knockdown corresponding to that barcode. This ratio is used to identify the effect of a given knockdown on the HSR in a single condition. In situations where the same pool of yeast is divided and exposed to multiple conditions, RNA counts between these samples can be directly compared to compute gene–stressor interactions (discussed below).</p><p>Our library targeted each gene in the genome, including genes producing non-coding RNAs, with up to 12 sgRNAs and paired multiple random barcodes with each sgRNA. Multiple sgRNAs per gene were necessary due to variability in efficacy of each knockdown and to minimize the influence of off-target effects from any one guide RNA. Using multiple barcodes for each sgRNA minimized the effects of barcode bias on stability of the reporter mRNA. We cloned a library of approximately 1 million random barcode-sgRNA pairs and performed paired-end high-throughput sequencing on the library to identify these pairs. Paired-end sequencing revealed that most genes were targeted in the library by all 12 designed sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, there was a wide distribution of barcodes associated with each sgRNA, with the mean representation being approximately 14 barcodes per sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Essential genes were only weakly depleted from the library, reflecting that our screen measures the effect of knockdown and that many sgRNAs do not lead to effective knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Note that after multiple generations of growth, we expect that only one barcoded construct will be expressed in each cell even in the rare event that two constructs initially enter the same cell. Thus, the plasmid library was poised to measure the effect of each genetic knockdown on the output of the HSR reporter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ReporterSeq reveals regulators of the HSR in basal conditions</title><p>We first used the ReporterSeq library to measure the effect of each genetic knockdown on the HSR reporter in untreated, log-phase yeast. The full-genome library was transformed into &gt;100,000 cells, resulting in a subset of the plasmid library expression in cells. RNA and DNA barcodes were sequenced and matched to their corresponding sgRNAs, revealing that 91% of genes were represented by six or more sgRNAs where both RNA and DNA counts were above 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and 74% of these sgRNAs were represented by two or more barcodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To test whether the RNA/DNA ratio of barcodes reflected activation of the HSR under a specific perturbation, we assessed the effect of two predicted regulators of our synthetic HSR reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). sgRNAs targeting <italic>SSA2</italic>, an Hsp70 chaperone that binds Hsf1 and inhibits the HSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), resulted in a higher than average RNA/DNA ratio as expected. Conversely, sgRNAs targeting <italic>CYC1</italic>, the gene from which our synthetic reporter was derived and shares significant homology with, lowered the RNA/DNA ratio compared to average. Thus, the DNA/RNA ratio for a single barcode reflects the HSR reporter’s activity under a specific genomic perturbation. Note that since we do not explicitly measure knockdown efficiency of the CRISPR constructs, our results cannot rule out the effect of any gene on the HSR.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ReporterSeq reveals genome-wide basal regulators of the heat shock response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of DNA and RNA barcode counts from wild-type, untreated yeast.

Briefly, each barcode was assigned an <italic>NNS</italic>, representing how extreme the RNA/DNA ratio is for the barcode, relative to its ‘<italic>neighborhood’</italic> of barcodes with similar levels of expression. The magnitude of the score for a given barcode corresponds to the number of standard deviations from the mean, where both the standard deviation and mean are computed based on this neighborhood. The sign of the score indicates the direction of the effect on the HSR (positive <italic>NNS</italic> indicate that the knockdown increases the HSR, while negative <italic>NNS</italic> indicate the knockdown decreases the HSR). Most barcodes have <italic>NNS</italic> near 0, reflecting the fact that most perturbations do not significantly affect the HSR.

Indeed, the Hsp40 <italic>SIS1</italic> was the strongest basal suppressor of the HSR. Additional strong HSR suppressors include the negative regulators of the Ras/cAMP pathway <italic>GPB2</italic> (<bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = 3.8) and <italic>IRA2</italic> (<bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = 4.1), the mitochondrial lyso-phosphatidylcholine acyltransferase <italic>TAZ1</italic> (<bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = 6.0), the nonsense-mediated decay regulators <italic>UPF3</italic> (<bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = 3.3) and <italic>NMD2</italic> (<bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = 3.0) and the small ribosomal protein <italic>ASC1</italic> (<bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = 9.3). <italic>LST8</italic> (<bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = 13.1) was also a strong hit in the screen, likely because it shares a promoter with <italic>SIS1</italic> and thus silenced by the same sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>). Our implementation of ReporterSeq cannot distinguish between adjacent genes that may be targeted by the same sgRNAs, a general shortcoming of CRISPRi. In addition to <italic>CYC1</italic>, several mitochondrial genes (<italic>ERV1</italic> <bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = −5.8, <italic>RSM27</italic> <bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = −3.9, and <italic>TIM12</italic> <bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = −3.1) and translation genes (<italic>RPL25</italic> <bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = −5.6, <italic>RPL12A</italic> <bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = −3.3, and <italic>RPS18A</italic> <bold><italic>NNS</italic></bold> = −3.1) strongly lowered the HSR when impaired, consistent with previous observations that knockout of mitochondrial genes lowers the HSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>). To test whether top hits in the screen were dependent on the Hsf1 binding sites in our reporter rather than the crippled <italic>CYC1</italic> sequence, we compared the effect of deleting three of the top hits (<italic>SSA2</italic>, <italic>HSC82</italic>, and <italic>ASC1</italic>) on the HSR reporter versus a crippled <italic>CYC1</italic> reporter without the Hsf1-specific binding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). All deletions activated the HSR reporter without activating the crippled <italic>CYC1</italic> reporter, which has very low basal activity, suggesting that most hits in the screen are specific to Hsf1.</p><p>In order to identify processes that regulate the HSR, we analyzed which gene ontology (GO) categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2019</xref>) were enriched for genes causing high or low activation of the HSR when knocked down. We assigned each GO category a score based on the Student's t-test between the scores of all genes and those of the specific category (supplementary data file 5). As with the interaction score, the sign indicates the direction of the effect of the knockdown on the reporter activity, and the magnitude of this score indicates the confidence. Many of the GO category scores followed trends largely consistent with previous studies, with chaperone, protein folding, and protein quality control complexes such as the ribosome-associated quality control complex (RQC) amongst the most highly scoring GO categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The highest scoring GO category was negative regulation of Ras signal transduction, indicating that high Ras activity leads to high HSR activity. This is consistent with a previous study showing an inverse correlation between the HSR and the Ras/PKA-inhibited Msn2/4 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>) and studies concluding that the PKA activity induces the HSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murshid et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verma et al., 2020</xref>) The lowest scoring categories included mitochondria and translation, consistent with results of a previous HSR screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>). Knockdowns of genes involved in vacuolar acidification, a process important for many cellular activities such as protein sorting and pH maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamashiro et al., 1990</xref>) as well as regulation of the HSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Triandafillou et al., 2018</xref>) also caused a significant downregulation of the HSR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Interactions between heat stress and genes that regulate the HSR</title><p>To determine which genes affect the cell’s ability to activate the HSR in response to heat stress, we sought to quantify the interaction between the effects of heat stress and those of each genetic knockdown (a ‘stressor–gene’ interaction) on the output of the HSR reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), similar to how genetic interactions (‘gene–gene’ interactions) are conceptualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tong et al., 2001</xref>). Stressor–gene interactions are based on a comparison of the reporter output of the combined condition relative to that of the knockdown and stress independently. A stressor–gene interaction <italic>NNS</italic> of zero denotes that knockdown of the gene and the stressor itself have independent effects on the HSR. A positive <italic>NNS</italic> denotes that the combination of gene and stress resulted in a superadditive effect on the HSR (an ‘aggravating’ interaction), while a negative <italic>NNS</italic> denotes that the combination results in a subadditive effect on the HSR (a ‘blocking’ interaction). A positive or negative interaction <italic>NNS</italic> suggests that a stressor and gene are related in the context of the HSR. Traditional methods to compute interaction scores require three measurements: the phenotype of each individual perturbation and the phenotype of the double mutant. By assuming that (1) the majority of genetic knockdowns do not interact with the stressor and (2) short stressor treatments that impair cell growth (relative to the ~2.5 hr doubling time of unstressed yeast in the growth conditions used) do not significantly alter cell counts for a specific CRISPRi perturbation, we computed stressor–gene interactions by comparing RNA levels between stressed and unstressed conditions from the same yeast sample using the same scoring metric as with the untreated RNA/DNA ratios. This allowed us to compute the stressor–gene interactions without calculating the absolute induction of the gene (its RNA/DNA ratio), reducing noise arising from DNA normalization and increasing robustness by performing more comparisons than traditional methods for computing gene–gene interactions.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ReporterSeq reveals how genes interact with heat stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of gene–stressor interactions.

This suggests (1) that heat stress and <italic>SIS1</italic> depletion activate the HSR through common mechanisms and (2) that targeting both the <italic>CYC1</italic> gene as well as the HSR reporter directly (because the reporter is built upon the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter sequence) do not reduce its inducibility by heat. Indeed, induction was higher than expected in knockdown of <italic>CYC1</italic> (a positive interaction) and, generally, heat stress interaction <italic>NNS</italic> and the basal knockdown <italic>NNS</italic> were negatively correlated (r = −0.45), suggesting that knockdowns basaly increasing the HSR generally blocked HSR activation in heat and those decreasing basal HSR resulted in a bigger HSR increase during heat stress.</p><p>One knockdown target that blocked the response to heat less than would be predicted based on the general trend for strong HSR inducers was <italic>ASC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

To test this, we measured the genetic interaction between combined genetic perturbations (deletions combined with CRISPRi) to determine if these genes belonged in a shared or independent pathway of activating the HSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As expected, <italic>SIS1</italic> (encoding a cochaperone of Hsp70) and <italic>SSA2</italic> (encoding an Hsp70) had a blocking interaction with each other, as the combination of the two perturbations was 65% of the expected GFP levels (quantified as log GFP levels). By contrast, <italic>ASC1</italic> was independent of <italic>SSA2</italic>, with the combination of genetic perturbations having an almost completely additive effect on the reporter (GFP levels 94% of expected levels). This suggests that lowering Asc1 levels may activate the HSR through a separate mechanism than lowering Hsp70 levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Distinct genes regulate the early and late phases of the HSR</title><p>The pooled format of ReporterSeq and very short sample collection time allowed us to measure the effect of each knockdown on the HSR in a time-resolved way with a precision that genome-wide approaches generally cannot achieve. We collected cells at 10, 20, 40, and 120 min after transition to 39°C in duplicate and isolated RNA to calculate stressor–gene interactions each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). CRISPR knockdown of two sample genes, <italic>SIS1</italic> and <italic>SSA2</italic>, were not affected by heat shock duration, suggesting that knockdown efficiency does not change during the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Many genes had similar interaction <italic>NNS</italic> for the first and last timepoints. For example, knocking down <italic>SIS1</italic> or <italic>TPS1</italic> blocked the HSR throughout the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Tps1 is required for synthesis of trehalose and has been demonstrated to be required for induction of the HSR under heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conlin and Nelson, 2007</xref>). Other interactions, however, greatly depended on the length of heat shock. Knockdown of the Ras gene, <italic>RAS2</italic>, caused an aggravation of the HSR at 10 and 20 min, had no effect at 40 min, and then subsequently blocked the HSR at 120 min. Knockdown of <italic>HSF1</italic> had a strong blocking effect at 10 min that tapered to near zero by 40 min. Conversely, knockdown of <italic>HSP42, BTN2</italic>, or <italic>OPI10</italic> had relatively little effect until 40 and 120 min, at which point the HSR became hyper-induced. These genes have been reported to be critical for survival in heat shocked cells, with Hsp42 and Btn2 sequestering toxic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haslbeck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malinovska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Specht et al., 2011</xref>) and the human and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> orthologs of Opi10 (‘Hikeshi’) facilitating the stress-induced import of Hsp70 into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kose et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Song et al., 2015</xref>). The delay in the effects of these factors likely represents the time in which cellular damage accumulates under heat shock.

Like the aforementioned GO scores, these GO scores were calculated based on the Student’s t-test between the scores of all genes and those of the specific category. Knockdown of genes that are a part of the heat shock response, such as ‘mRNA export from nucleus in response to heat stress’, generally exacerbated the heat shock response at later time points, suggesting that if the response to heat is impaired, the stress response will be prolonged. Another mRNA regulator, the Lsm1-7-PatI complex, which degrades some mRNAs, also caused a stronger late-phase heat shock response. Additionally, genes involved in Ras signal transduction followed the same trend as <italic>RAS2</italic> and were unusually high at early time points but low at later ones. Conversely, negative regulators of Ras showed the opposite trend. The lowest interaction scores found in later time points were proteasomal genes, while the highest scores were for ribosome biogenesis genes.

Knockdown of <italic>SNF4</italic>, a Snf1 kinase subunit that plays a key role in glucose-repressed gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCartney and Schmidt, 2001</xref>), had a strong aggravating interaction only with glucose starvation. Similar to what we observed in the heat shock time course, we saw distinct interaction profiles from the chaperone genes <italic>SSA1</italic> and <italic>SSA2</italic>, with the <italic>SSA1</italic> knockdown having generally weaker blocking interactions, as well as aggravating interactions with AZC and canavanine, two stressors that were strongly blocked by <italic>SSA2</italic> knockdown.

Component 2, on the other hand, was driven most strongly with bortezomib, DTT, canavanine, macbecin, and tunicamycin. Exactly why chaperones like <italic>SSA1</italic> had interactions with these stressors is unclear, but suggests a separate role in stress sensing and response from <italic>SSA2</italic>/<italic>SIS1</italic>.</p><p>To systematically evaluate which classes of genes are important for the HSR under different conditions, we analyzed which GO categories had strong interaction scores with each of the stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>, GO categories provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). We observed a wide diversity of stress-specific interactions. For example, knockdown of translation-related GO categories strongly aggravated the response to ethanol and glucose starvation, and to a lesser extent canavanine, AZC, and DTT. Translation genes had blocking interactions with macbecin and arsenite. Knockdown of mitochondrial genes strongly aggravated response to hydrogen peroxide and glucose starvation. Proteasome knockdown significantly blocked most responses, but had aggravating interactions with macbecin and bortezomib. ER-related genes had blocking interactions with DTT, tunicamycin, hydrogen peroxide, AZC, and canavanine. Enrichment scores for all GO categories are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>. The diversity of genetic interactions observed between stressors and the HSR likely reflects effects of the knockdowns on the damage caused by the stressor as well as on stress-specific signaling to the HSR.</p><p>A prevalent model for HSR regulation is that the HSR senses changes in chaperone availability, becoming more active when chaperones become less available. In yeast, the Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones have both been proposed to have this role. Thus, lowering levels of either of these chaperones should cause constitutive HSR activation and a loss of sensitivity to stressors (i.e. a blocking interaction). Comparing HSR reporter mRNA induction in each stressor to interaction <italic>NNS</italic> for both <italic>SSA2</italic> and <italic>HSC82</italic> (one of two paralogs encoding Hsp90) revealed blocking interaction <italic>NNS</italic> with these chaperones that generally scaled with HSR induction strength, showing that both chaperones were important for responding to stressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Yet some interactions were specific to each chaperone. <italic>HSC82</italic>’s interaction with macbecin was stronger than with AZC, and <italic>SSA2</italic>’s interaction stronger with AZC, consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alford and Brandman, 2018</xref>) and reflecting macbecin’s inhibition of Hsp90 and <italic>SSA2</italic>'s role in sensing AZC stress.</p><p>Notably, cycloheximide had strong blocking interactions with chaperone genes, even though it does not substantially activate the HSR. This may occur through inhibition of translation, which lowers the load of misfolded proteins and requirements for chaperones in the cell and thus may block the HSR induction that occurs when chaperones are downregulated. Strikingly, plotting basal induction vs cycloheximide interactions revealed a negative correlation (correlation coefficient = −0.28), similar to the effect seen with heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of stressors revealed that cycloheximide clustered with late heat shock (40 and 120 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Thus, many genetic perturbations that affect the HSR are dependent on translation, consistent with reports that the bulk of misfolded proteins in a cell are newly translated, nascent chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medicherla and Goldberg, 2008</xref>) and the dependence of the HSR on translation in heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feder et al., 2021</xref>). Translation-dependent HSR activation may explain blocking interactions observed in other stressors with low HSR induction, such as DTT, tunicamycin, and glucose starvation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Gcn3-dependent translation of the HSR reporter</title><p>The knockdown with the strongest and most specific stress–gene interactions was the translation initiation factor, <italic>GCN3</italic>, displaying strong aggravating interactions with hydrogen peroxide and arsenite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

The first reporter includes the full-length promoter sequence of <italic>HSP12</italic>, a stress-responsive gene induced by a variety of stressors that includes an heat shock element (HSE) and seven STRE sequences.

ReporterSeq couples gene expression to levels of barcodes that can be read with deep sequencing, thus enabling pooled, full-genome screening without the need for cell enrichment (e.g. via fluorescence-based cell sorting). This allowed us to identify known and novel regulators of the HSR and measure their roles in responding to diverse stressors in a time-resolved manner. Because ReporterSeq measures mRNA levels, we were able to observe modulators with differential effect on mRNA and protein levels, such as <italic>GCN3</italic>, which we discovered increases translation efficiency of stress-responsive genes in some stress conditions.</p><p>The strongest HSR-regulating pathway identified by our screen was the Hsp70/Hsp40 pair, <italic>SSA2</italic>/<italic>SIS1</italic>. Knockdown of <italic>SIS1</italic> or <italic>SSA2</italic> desensitized cells to every stressor except for the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a weak activator of the HSR. This is consistent with studies demonstrating direct binding between Hsp70 and Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>) and suggesting that Sis1 is the primary Hsp40 facilitating this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feder et al., 2021</xref>). We identified one strong regulator of the HSR, Asc1, as an HSR regulator independent of Ssa2/Sis1. We note that the mechanisms through which genetic perturbations affect the HSR can vary in directness, from reducing levels of an Hsf1-binding protein to increasing levels of a toxic intermediate. Like other genetic screening methods, ReporterSeq cannot distinguish between these cases. Future studies may allow a more systematic delineation of the independence and mechanisms of pathways driving the HSR.</p><p>Both the Hsp90 inhibitor, macbecin, and the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, had somewhat similar global gene interaction profiles that differed from other stressors. They both featured aggravating interactions with the proteasome, Hsp90 binding genes, and <italic>SSA1</italic>. Furthermore, bortezomib was the only stressor to positively interact with <italic>SIS1</italic> and <italic>SSA2</italic>, while macbecin had little or no interaction with these genes. This suggests that macbecin and bortezomib may activate the HSR via a separate mechanism from Ssa2/Sis1, and is consistent with a previous study proposing separate activation mechanisms of the HSR by Hsp70 (Ssa2) and Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alford and Brandman, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms by which many of the gene and gene categories we identified regulate the HSR are at this moment unknown. For example, a major mystery is how genes regulating translation and mitochondria, which showed strong interactions with multiple conditions, regulate the HSR. Additionally, how the Ras/cAMP pathway and Taz1, which has been proposed to be essential for protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Taffin de Tilques et al., 2018</xref>), regulate the HSR is poorly understood. Interaction data from our ReporterSeq experiments may be useful in formulating hypotheses that can be tested with detailed follow-up experiments.</p><p>We identified a novel regulator of the HSR, <italic>GCN3</italic>, under specific stress conditions, such as treatments with sodium arsenite, ethanol, or hydrogen peroxide. <italic>GCN3</italic> encodes the ɑ subunit of the eIF2B complex, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eIF2. Under a variety of stress conditions, the eIF2 kinase, Gcn2, phosphorylates eIF2ɑ causing inhibition of eIF2B activity through interactions between eIF2B–eIF2ɑ-phosphorylated complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marintchev and Ito, 2020</xref>). This results in global translation repression while inducing the integrated stress response (ISR) through translation of <italic>GCN4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang and Hinnebusch, 1996</xref>). <italic>GCN2</italic> shows a similar interaction with the same stressors as <italic>GCN3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), <italic>consistent with a role for the eIF2B–eIF2ɑ complex in regulating the HSR</italic>. Gcn3 is essential for regulating translation under stress, as eIF2B activity is resistant to inhibition by phosphorylated eIF2ɑ when <italic>GCN3</italic> is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimball et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang and Hinnebusch, 1996</xref>). Thus, in stress conditions that promote eIF2ɑ phosphorylation, <italic>GCN3</italic> would be expected to lower translation efficiency of non-ISR-related genes such as our reporter genes. Yet our data suggest a role for <italic>GCN3</italic> in increasing their translation efficiency after treatment with sodium arsenite. This effect is not limited to genes that are Hsf1 dependent, since we observed similar results with reporter genes regulated by two variants of the <italic>HSP12</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chowdhary et al., 2019</xref>). These observations shed light on new roles of <italic>GCN3</italic> in increasing translation efficiency of stress-responsive genes under stress independently of the ISR. Further characterization is required in order to determine how <italic>GCN3</italic> affects the translation efficiency of non-stress induced genes under stress conditions.</p><p>Our implementation of ReporterSeq allows full-genome screens to be completed in a single-cell culture and multiple screens can be read out using a single sequencing run. We expect ReporterSeq results to improve with greater depth of sequencing and sample size. Yet even with the relatively modest level of sequencing in this study (~5 M–15 M reads per sample; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>), we identified myriad stress-specific regulators of the HSR, including known and novel regulators, creating a comprehensive genetic view of a major protein quality control pathway. The scale and precision of ReporterSeq is only limited by growth conditions and DNA sequencing, not cell enrichment, microfluidics, or cell processing. Multiple libraries can be multiplexed in pooled growth conditions. A comparison of ReporterSeq with a previous screen for HSR regulators revealed a weak correlation for basal HSR activity and enriched stress–gene interactions for hits in the previous screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), demonstrating that ReporterSeq can reveal features of known novel regulators. ReporterSeq is ideally suited to study many stress pathways, like the HSR, which have been difficult to comprehensively evaluate because they are co-regulated with translation and thus fluorescence- and luciferase-based assays that require translation are limited in effectiveness. Indeed, contemporaneous to this work, a similar technique was used to dissect the genetic regulators of Gcn4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muller et al., 2020</xref>), regulator of the yeast general amino acid control response, a stress-response homologous to the integrated stress response in metazoans. Applied broadly, ReporterSeq may significantly advance the study of cellular pathways in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>All experiments were performed with BY4741 yeast.

The first fragment was a diverse sample of inserts amplified via PCR using KAPA HiFi polymerase (Roche Basel, Switzerland), producing a sequence that contained random barcodes associated with a random sgRNAs from the library. This first fragment was generated in three steps. Step (1a) generation of a constant region using the parental plasmid as template, (1b) generation of random sgRNA sequences using the custom pool of oligonucleotides containing the sgRNA sequences, with flanking sequence to that of product of step 1a in its 5’ end. Step (2) PCR product using products of steps 1a and 1b to generate a constant region containing the random sgRNAs.

One microgram of RNA was then reverse transcribed using Multiscribe reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher) and random hexamers in a 25 µL reaction. One microliter of the cDNA was then mixed with Luna qPCR master mix (New England Biolabs) and primers (to a final concentration 100 nM), which amplified either GFP or <italic>ACT1</italic>, the reference gene. These mixtures were measured in triplicate for each sample-primer combination with a ViiA 7 qPCR machine (Thermo Fisher), and the median C<sub>T</sub> value was used in analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Allan Drummond (Reviewer #1); Lars Steinmetz (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>As you will see below, both reviewers were excited about the screening tool you introduced and were supportive about the work. The main concern was the lack of sufficient validation. The revision would therefore need to include all validation of key claims. In addition please address also all comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Alford et al., introduce a clever and obviously useful genetic screening tool termed ReporterSeq, and use it to identify regulators of various stress responses in budding yeast. The heat shock response (HSR) is a conserved transcriptional response to a variety of stresses driven primarily by the transcriptional activator Hsf1. Recent work has established that Hsf1 is primarily regulated by chaperones (primarily Hsp70 with a possible contribution of Hsp90) binding to and inhibiting Hsf1. During stress, this inhibition is relieved by titration of the chaperone off of Hsf1, allowing for induction of Hsf1 target genes. While this basic mechanism is well understood, it remains an important question how diverse stresses lead to shared activation of Hsf1 and how these different pathways might be regulated.</p><p>This study investigates that question by doing a number of genetic screens for genes which regulate the HSR in different stress conditions. This multiplicity of screens is aided by the ReporterSeq technology, which combines a CRISPRi screen with a promoter- specific readout of gene induction. The authors identify a number of genes which differentially regulate the HSR during a variety of stresses and offer some hypotheses for pathway specific effects. They propose that ASC1 depletion, bortezomib and macbecin all activate the HSR through a separate mechanism from the Hsp70 dependent pathway described. They also identify a link between GCN3 and translation regulation of their HSE containing reporter.</p><p>Taken by itself, ReportSeq represents a clear and important step forward in genetic screening methodologies, combining the ease and genetic specificity of CRISPRi screens with a more nuanced phenotypic readout than growth. The limitations of the method should be more clearly spelled out. Some technical details of the implementation could use more exploration, such as the effect of multi-day activation of gene repression and the effectiveness of various sgRNAs, but the authors clearly demonstrate the usefulness of the method. The novel insights into the HSR, however, are less convincing. Similar screens have been carried out by Onn Brandman using a fluorescence based reporter and synthetic gene arrays (Brandman et al., Cell 2012) and the findings are largely in agreement. The broader significance of particular cases highlighted in the paper would benefit greatly from validation beyond the synthetic reporter used in this study. In addition, the interaction scores used to quantify the effects of gene knockdown are influenced by the extent to which each gene regulates the basal HSR, which complicates the interpretation of some of the results.</p><p>1. In the introduction, &quot;Additionally, post-transcriptional models have been proposed, such as HSR-regulated mRNA half life (Heikkinen, 2003) or regulation of the translation efficiency of heat shock mRNAs (Zid and O'Shea, 2014).

Later material in the manuscript indicates that &quot;regulation of the HSR&quot; includes translation, not merely transcription as the introduction states. The writing should be clarified.</p><p>2. Please provide more detail on the reporter construct used. It is suggested that it is a combination of HSEs and the CYC1 promoter as used in Brandman et al., 2012. However the authors say only that it is &quot;similar&quot; to that reporter without specifying the ways in which it is different. Some additional discussion of the extent to which this reporter is regulated by Hsf1 vs other stress-induced transcription factors such as Msn2/4 is important for interpreting the results of the paper. For instance, any Hsp70-independent regulation could either be a result of Hsp70-independent regulation of Hsf1 or non-Hsf1 regulation of the reporter. I recommend additional experiments be done combining CRISPRi knockdown of key genes such as ASC1 and HSC82 with additional reporter constructs, either with promoters known to be regulated by Hsf1 or Msn2/4 or with other synthetic promoters containing STRE elements.</p><p>3. The analysis would benefit from a multiple-testing correction. What the authors call &quot;confidence&quot; is effectively statistical significance of (replicated) scores under a normal null model, a Z score, which has an associated probability. We urge the authors to apply a false discovery rate (FDR) correction, or their choice of multiple-testing correction, to assess the adjusted probability that the observed scores occur by chance in a dataset of this size.</p><p>4. The induction of the reporter after knockout of gene X is interpreted as meaning that X regulates the HSR. However, knocking out X could (say) cause build-up of a toxic intermediate in some pathway, triggering the cellular stress response and thus activation of the HSR. X here would not be a &quot;regulator&quot; of the transcriptional response in the sense in which the authors intend. The logic of the connection between signal and interpretation should be more clearly spelled out and its limitations or edge cases mentioned.</p><p>5. More technical details in the Methods section would be valuable to the community. For instance a diagram of the cloning process would be useful. In addition, providing the sequences of the adapters and primers and the times and concentrations of enzymes used in library preparation would allow for replication of the technique.</p><p>6. The inclusion of the code used and the pseudocode description of it is greatly appreciated. One question that remained is how the biological replicates are used in the creation of the score. The only time that the replicates are used or shown are in the volcano plots in Figure 2C. Supplemental figures showing the reproducibility across replicates or a description of how the replicates were used in the scoring process would be helpful.</p><p>7. In Figure S1A no induction of the reporter is seen with a SSA2 targeting sgRNA. This is at odds with subsequent data showing a strong effect of SSA2 knockdown. Presumably, this is a result of poor efficacy of the chosen sgRNA and additional sgRNAs should be tested to resolve this discrepancy. Furthermore, it would be useful to know the extent of knockdown, for instance by tracking SSA2 mRNA levels by qPCR.</p><p>8. Later, the authors point out the importance of having multiple guide RNAs and barcodes for each gene. It would be helpful to see how important these factors are by splitting out the results for a select set of genes (perhaps CYC1, SIS1 and SSA2) into guide RNA- and barcode- specific effects.</p><p>9. One drawback to the approach used here is that the library is grown for multiple days with active CRISPRi targeting of genes. Presumably, this could lead to the depletion of essential genes from the pool and a discussion of the extent to which this depletion was observed would provide important context for the breadth of the screen.</p><p>10. The authors mention that sgRNAs targeting the reporter promoter (CYC1 sgRNAs) do not prevent its activation during heat stress. This implies that knockdown under basal conditions does not necessarily prevent the induction of genes under heat shock conditions. This has important ramifications for the interpretation of later time points of the heat shock time course, partly in regards to heat shock induced genes, as the differential effects seen could result from changes in the extent of the knockdown. Western blots showing the extent of depletion for a subset of genes (such as SSA2, SSA1, SIS1 etc.) with selected guide RNAs during the time course would alleviate this concern.</p><p>11. The identification of differences in the roles of SSA1 and SSA2, and Sis1 as opposed to Ydj1 are both important contributions. However, in order to demonstrate approve a difference, it is necessary to show that these genes are all being knocked down to a similar extent. For example, SSA2 is induced by heat shock far less than SSA1, and the authors observe a time-dependent effect of SSA1 but not SSA2, raising the question as to what extent SSA1's induction profile has been altered by knockdown. Thus weI suggest additional experiments showing differential effects on HSR induction using specific guide RNAs with western blots or qPCR to show the extent of depletion. Alternatively the authors could note that they have no evidence for the knockdown of these genes during the time-course or for the relative levels of the knockdowns.</p><p>12. Because the interaction score used is based on the basal levels of regulation, genes which strongly affect the basal response such as Sis1 are expected to have strong negative interaction scores. Thus it seems that both the plots shown in Figure 3C and the PCA analysis in Figure S2 could be largely explained by the basal score of genes such as SIS1, SSA2 and SSE1. Some more discussion of how to disentangle genetic interactions with stress from the effects of knockdown on the basal HSR would be very helpful for interpreting these results.</p><p>13. Figure 6 does not convincingly show that GCN3 knockdown selectively affects translation of the reporter as opposed to a more general effect. Additional experiments as in Figure 6B but with reporters containing different promoters and 5' UTRs would help prove that the reporter is unique in its response to GCN3 knockdown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors introduce ReporterSeq, a new method for high-throughput sequencing-based readout of a reporter gene, and apply it to uncover regulation of the heat shock response. Although this response has been characterized i.e. on transcriptome and proteome changes, our understanding on the regulation of this still limited. The study extends previous work from Brandman et al., (2012) by refining perturbation and readout. ReporterSeq measures DNA and RNA barcodes, or only RNA barcodes, and is combined with genome-wide CRISPR interference. The presented study applies this technique to yield unparalleled insights into Hsf1 regulation in different stresses and over time. I recommend publication of this nice study and have no major concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57376.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this paper, Alford et al., introduce a clever and obviously useful genetic screening tool termed ReporterSeq, and use it to identify regulators of various stress responses in budding yeast. The heat shock response (HSR) is a conserved transcriptional response to a variety of stresses driven primarily by the transcriptional activator Hsf1. Recent work has established that Hsf1 is primarily regulated by chaperones (primarily Hsp70 with a possible contribution of Hsp90) binding to and inhibiting Hsf1. During stress, this inhibition is relieved by titration of the chaperone off of Hsf1, allowing for induction of Hsf1 target genes. While this basic mechanism is well understood, it remains an important question how diverse stresses lead to shared activation of Hsf1 and how these different pathways might be regulated.</p><p>This study investigates that question by doing a number of genetic screens for genes which regulate the HSR in different stress conditions. This multiplicity of screens is aided by the ReporterSeq technology, which combines a CRISPRi screen with a promoter- specific readout of gene induction. The authors identify a number of genes which differentially regulate the HSR during a variety of stresses and offer some hypotheses for pathway specific effects. They propose that ASC1 depletion, bortezomib and macbecin all activate the HSR through a separate mechanism from the Hsp70 dependent pathway described. They also identify a link between GCN3 and translation regulation of their HSE containing reporter.</p><p>Taken by itself, ReportSeq represents a clear and important step forward in genetic screening methodologies, combining the ease and genetic specificity of CRISPRi screens with a more nuanced phenotypic readout than growth. The limitations of the method should be more clearly spelled out. Some technical details of the implementation could use more exploration, such as the effect of multi-day activation of gene repression and the effectiveness of various sgRNAs, but the authors clearly demonstrate the usefulness of the method. The novel insights into the HSR, however, are less convincing. Similar screens have been carried out by Onn Brandman using a fluorescence based reporter and synthetic gene arrays (Brandman et al., Cell 2012) and the findings are largely in agreement. The broader significance of particular cases highlighted in the paper would benefit greatly from validation beyond the synthetic reporter used in this study. In addition, the interaction scores used to quantify the effects of gene knockdown are influenced by the extent to which each gene regulates the basal HSR, which complicates the interpretation of some of the results.</p><p>1.

The only difference that the study employs the reporter on a 2u plasmid while Brandman et al., 2012. integrated the reporter. This has been clarified in the text. There are no msn2 binding sites on this minimal promoter, but it is possible that regulators of the cryppled cyc1 sequence will appear as hits in the screen. This is now stated in the text. To verify that top hits in the screen are regulating the Hsf1 rather than other elements in the synthetic promoter, we tested deletion strains of 3 top hits using a reporter identical to our HSR reporter except without the Hsf1 binding site. None of the hits activated the control reporter (Figure S2-2). Additionally, another publication from our lab shows that deleting two top hits from our screen (SSA2 and HSP104) does not activate a different reporter identical to our Hsf1 reporter except with Hsf1 binding sites replaced by those for Rpn4 (Work and Brandman JCB 2020, Figure 4F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

First of all, we should not have been referring to these as ''confidence scores'', since they do not actually correspond to the confidence of rejecting the null hypothesis [no modulatory role] in any rigorous sense. In our revision, we will simply refer to them as scores. The results would not change significantly if we were to apply an FDR correction (since the corrected scores would preserve the order of the genes). Still, we don't believe that such a correction would make sense here. FDR corrections are most applicable in settings in which one wishes to understand the confidence with which one can reject the hypothesis that all trials correspond to the null hypothesis. In our settings, we do know that some genes have modulatory roles (e.g. the regulatory genes, and genes known to be associated with these). We would not want to apply an FDR correction to the scores of the control genes, because the identity of these genes was fixed prior to the experiment (there is no 'multiple hypothesis' issue for these genes). Additionally, some of the ways in which we use the scores (e.g. in building gene ontologies, looking at correlations between replicates and conditions, etc.) is different from the settings in which these corrections make the most statistical sense (i.e. when arguing that a single hypothesis is significant).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Figure 6 does not convincingly show that GCN3 knockdown selectively affects translation of the reporter as opposed to a more general effect. Additional experiments as in Figure 6B but with reporters containing different promoters and 5' UTRs would help prove that the reporter is unique in its response to GCN3 knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this up. To address this concern, we attempted to conduct experiments using a GAL1 promoter to regulate the expression of the GFP reporter and performing CRISPRi knockdown of GCN3. However, we were unable to obtain consistent results in these conditions, since cells exhibit severe slow growth in different carbon sources (raffinose and galactose) on top of expressing two different episomal plasmids (reporter and dCas9) (data not shown). We then proceeded to construct two additional reporters, one consisting of the full-length promoter of HSP12 (-965 bp) controlling GFP, and a truncated promoter of HSP12 (-805 bp). The truncation of the HSP12 promoter removed the only HSE found in its sequence, while preserving the 7 STRE. It is worth mentioning that both reporters are identical in its 5’ UTR, CDS and 3’ UTR. Removal of the single HSE of prHSP12 does not seem to be essential for its expression in heat stress conditions (Chowdhary et al., 2019), and after sodium arsenite and AZC treatments (new Figure 6A). These findings suggest that Hsf1 is dispensable for HSP12 expression in a variety of stress conditions and that these reporters can be used to answer whether GCN3 knockdown is selective to our Hsf1-responsive synthetic promoter. We observed that GCN3 knockdown affects the translation efficiency of all the reporters during arsenite stress, but not in AZC (new Figure 6). Our experiments suggest that GCN3 increases translation efficiency of stress induced genes including those with and without an HSE element. Future studies will determine how translation of non-stress induced genes is affected by GCN3 in arsenite stress.</p></body></sub-article></article>
