Recent studies have demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) arise from both venous sprouting (lymphangiogenesis) and de novo production from non-venous origins (lymphvasculogenesis), which is similar to blood vessel formation through angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. However, the contribution of LECs from non-venous origins to lymphatic networks is considered to be relatively small. Here, we identify the <italic>Islet1</italic> (<italic>Isl1</italic>)-expressing cardiopharyngeal mesoderm (CPM) as a non-venous origin of craniofacial and cardiac LECs. Genetic lineage tracing with <italic>Isl1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Isl1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic> mice suggested that a subset of CPM cells gives rise to LECs. These CPM-derived LECs are distinct from venous-derived LECs in terms of their developmental processes and anatomical locations. Later, they form the craniofacial and cardiac lymphatic vascular networks in collaboration with venous-derived LECs. Collectively, our results demonstrate that there are two major sources of LECs, the cardinal vein and the CPM. As the CPM is evolutionarily conserved, these findings may improve our understanding of the evolution of lymphatic vessel development across species. Most importantly, our findings may provide clues to the pathogenesis of lymphatic malformations, which most often develop in the craniofacial and mediastinal regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lymphatic vessel development</kwd><kwd>origin of LECs</kwd><kwd>lymphatic malformations</kwd><kwd>vascular malformations</kwd><kwd>the cardiopharyngeal mesoderm</kwd><kwd>cardiac development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003382</institution-id><institution>Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR13W2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kurihara</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic lineage tracing reveals the cardiopharyngeal mesoderm as a cellular origin of craniofacial and cardiac lymphatic vessels, which most often affected in lymphatic malformation patients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lymphatic vascular system plays diverse roles in the maintenance of tissue fluid balance, immune surveillance, lipid absorption from the gut, and tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliver and Alitalo, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, recent progress in molecular and cellular characterization has unveiled the processes involved in the development of the lymphatic vasculature and the roles played by the lymphatic vasculature in various pathophysiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klaourakis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maruyama et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maruyama and Imanaka-Yoshida, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oliver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliver and Alitalo, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The origin of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) has been discussed since the 1900s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huntington and McClure, 1910</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sabin, 1902</xref>). Recent studies using genetic lineage tracing confirmed Sabinâs hypothesis that lymphatic vessels originate from the embryonic cardinal vein through lymphangiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Srinivasan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). In mice, lymphatic vessels arise from the common cardinal vein between embryonic day (E) 9.5 and E10.0 during the partial expression of prospero homeobox transcription protein 1 (Prox1), which is the master regulator of LEC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Srinivasan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wigle and Oliver, 1999</xref>). After that, vascular endothelial growth factor C induces the sprouting and expansion of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3)<sup>+</sup> LECs from the common cardinal veins to form the first lymphatic plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">HÃ¤gerling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karkkainen et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, in tadpoles and avian embryos, mesenchymal cells also contribute to lymphatic vessel development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ny et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schneider et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilting et al., 2006</xref>), supporting Huntington and McClureâs suggestion that lymphatic vessels form via the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into LECs, which later develop into a primary lymph sac and connect to the venous system. Supporting these findings, recent studies involving various genetic lineage-tracing models have revealed that non-venous sources of LECs also contribute to the lymphatic vasculature in the skin, mesentery, and heart through lymphvasculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lioux et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mahadevan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martinez-Corral et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maruyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pichol-Thievend et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stanczuk et al., 2015</xref>). Despite the accumulation of studies on non-venous sources of LECs, it remains uncertain how much they contribute to lymphatic vessels throughout the body. Our previous studies showed that LIM-homeodomain protein Islet1 (<italic>Isl1</italic>)-expressing second heart field cells contribute to ventral cardiac lymphatic vessels as a non-venous source of LECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maruyama et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Isl1</italic>-expressing second heart field cells have been found to overlap with the progenitor populations that give rise to the pharyngeal muscles in mice and chicks, and they are collectively known as the cardiopharyngeal mesoderm (CPM), which contributes to broad regions of the heart, cranial musculature, and connective tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diogo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grimaldi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heude et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tirosh-Finkel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tzahor and Evans, 2011</xref>). The CPM is composed of the paraxial and splanchnic mesodermal cells surrounding the pharynx. Later, the CPM cells migrate to form the mesodermal cores of the pharyngeal arches. Before their differentiation, CPM cells express both immature skeletal and cardiac muscle markers, including <italic>Isl1</italic>, myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (<italic>Mef2c</italic>), and T-box transcription factor (<italic>Tbx1</italic>). In mice, these molecules have been shown to be markers of a subset of CPM cells, which play important roles in cardiovascular and skeletal muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diogo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grimaldi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heude et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lescroart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nathan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tzahor and Evans, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we identified that the CPM contributes to broader regions of the facial, laryngeal, and cardiac lymphatic vasculature using <italic>Isl1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Isl1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic> mice, which can be used to study developmental processes involving the CPM. According to our developmental analysis, CPM-derived progenitor cells have the capacity to differentiate into LECs for a limited embryonic period. CPM-derived LECs are spatiotemporally distinct from venous-derived LECs during the early embryonic period. Later, they coordinate to form capillary lymphatics in and around the cranial and cardiac regions. Conditional knockout (KO) of <italic>Prox1</italic> in <italic>Isl1</italic>-expressing cells resulted in decreased numbers of lymphatic vessels in the tongue and altered the proportions of <italic>Isl1</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>Isl1</italic><sup>-</sup> LECs in facial lymphatic vessels. These results suggest that a subpopulation of LECs may share a common mesodermal origin with cardiopharyngeal components. In addition, as the CPM is conserved across vertebrates, they may provide clues regarding the evolution of lymphatic vessel development. From a clinical viewpoint, head and neck regions contributed by the CPM are the most common sites of lymphatic malformations (LMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perkins et al., 2010</xref>). Collectively, the present findings provide a fundamental basis for our understanding of lymphatic vessel development and lymphatic system-related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Isl1</italic><sup>+</sup> CPM-derived LECs contribute to cardiac, facial, and laryngeal lymphatic vessel development</title><p>To assess the regional contribution of <italic>Isl1</italic><sup>+</sup> CPM cells to lymphatic vessel development, we crossed <italic>Isl1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice, which express Cre recombinase under the control of the <italic>Isl1</italic> promoter and in which second heart field derivatives are effectively labeled, with the transgenic reporter line <italic>Rosa26<sup>tdTomato/+</sup></italic> and analyzed at E16.5, when lymphatic networks are distributed throughout the whole body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Srinivasan et al., 2007</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers at Review Commons, and the evaluation at <italic>eLife</italic> has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Based on the previous reviews and the revisions, the manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>â The data presented in Figure 5 should be interpreted carefully as residual VEGFR3+ GFP+ cells likely indicate incomplete recombination of the Prox1 locus (probably just one allele) by the Isl1-Cre line, as a lack of PROX1 expression during differentiation should lead to an absence of LECs. Thus, it's likely that recombination of Prox1 is less efficient in the progenitors of LECs found in the lower jaw and cheeks than in the tongue. The expression of PROX1 protein should be assessed in these samples to understand the level of knockout achieved.</p><p>â Similarly, GFP expression in LYVE1 positive lymphatic vessels in Tie2-Cre;Prox1 fl/fl animals again suggests incomplete recombination of Prox1. The identity of the GFP+ cells that are not incorporated into lymphatic vessels should be clarified by imaging at higher magnification as currently, the data are not clear. The analyses in Figure 6 should be repeated with a more specific marker of lymphatic endothelial cells than LYVE1. Either PROX1 or VEGFR3. The PECAM1 staining in the sections presented in Figure 6A-B should be improved.</p><p>â It is likely that Myf5 is expressed transiently and at low levels in any mesodermal progenitor that gives rise to the endothelium. The Myf5-CreERT2 mouse line used in this study was constructed using an IRES-CreERT2 cassette in the 3'UTR of the Myf5 gene, meaning that expression of CreERT2 from this locus is likely significantly lower than in the Myf5-Cre line previously used to investigate LEC origins (Stone and Stainier, Dev Cell, 2019). Thus, the conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment presented in Supplementary figure 2 are limited. We recommend deleting the second sentence of the discussion 'We also showed that Myf5+ myogenic lineages, which were previously suggested to be possible sources of LECs35, did not contribute to lymphatic vasculature formation in Myf5-CreERT2 mice subjected to tamoxifen treatment at E8.5' and leaving the discussion of these analyses presented on lines 288-292, which more accurately place these data in the context of published work.</p><p>â Reviewer #3 at Review Commons suggested using a Pax3-Cre to assess the contribution of this lineage to facial lymphatics. These analyses have been published and so it would be sufficient to reference Stone and Stainier, Dev Cell, 2019.</p><p>â The following statement &quot;The same group has further argued that the Pax3+ lineage gives rise to lymphatic vessels on the trunk side through lymphangiogenesis (Lupu et al., 2022)&quot; should read &quot;The same group has further argued that the Pax3+ lineage gives rise to lymphatic vessels on the trunk side through lymphvasculogenesis (Lupu et al., 2022)&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81515.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. General Statements</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Please see combined review below in the next section,</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>This is a descriptive manuscript providing a few new insights into a well-recognized and biologically important phenomenon â the lymphatic endothelial cells have heterogeneous origins in different organs. Overall, the idea of Islet1 lineage contributes to regional lymphatic vessel formation during a particular developmental stage is exciting and proven with detailed and careful lineage tracing. The first observation that Islet1 lineage gives rise to cardiac lymphatic vessels was published by the same group in Dev Bio in 2019 so the novelty here is dampened, although the pharyngeal lymphatics and the exact time of these non-venous origin lymphatic vessels arise were not previously characterized â so the current manuscript does provide new important insights. Both the data quality and manuscript layout need improvements, especially when it comes to defining where Islet1 is expressed at all the stages and statistics.</p><p>The following suggestions will deepen the scope of the manuscript:</p></disp-quote><p>First of all, we would like to express our appreciation to the reviewer for all the constructive comments. We carefully read the reviewerâs comments and discussed it. We agree with the reviewer that our manuscript needs improvements with changes in layout several additional experiments. We have also included several description and new immunostaining data (e.g., Isl1,VEGFR3 and LYVE1 co-staining), to confirm our new findings and highlight the importance of the current manuscript beyond our previous one in Dev Biol in 2019. We also have included detailed quantification methods, single-channel images with improved data resolution, and improved clarity of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Description of the planned revisions</p><p>Point 4.</p><p>The effect of lineage-specific Prox1 knockout is very descriptive, without any discussion of the potential biological function of such cellular origin heterogeneity. This part may be worth a few follow-up experiments in later embryonic stages or even in postnatal stages. The authors demonstrated that loss of Prox1 in Islet1 lineage decreases the number of lymphatic vessels and leads to lymphangiectasia, but whether this phenotype can be later compensated or shows any clinical impact was not proven. Therefore, the statement made in line 206 is questionable, and whether Islet1 lineage-derived lymphatic endothelial cells are dispensable/indispensable remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer in that additional follow up experiments using later embryonic or postnatal stages will give an insight into the potential biological function of cellular origin heterogeneity. We are generating lineage-specific Prox1 knockout mice by treating <italic>Isl1MerCreMer; Prox1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with tamoxifen at E8.5 to analyze phenotypes in the facial lymphatic vessels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Description of the revisions that have already been incorporated in the transferred manuscript</p><p>Point 1 and 2</p><p>1.Whether Isl1 lineage is independent of venous-derived endothelial cells.</p><p>2.This point is very important: the manuscript does not actually show Isl1 expression through the stages they are inducing. I would want to be sure that lymphatic endothelial cells at this stage don't express Isl1. Another way to get at this is to maybe use other second-heart fields or even broader mesoderm drivers that are known to be never expressed in endothelial cells to confirm the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous work (Maruyama et al., <italic>Dev Biol</italic> 452:134â143, 2019, Figure 2C), we demonstrated that <italic>Isl1</italic><sup>+</sup> lineages using <italic>Isl1-Cre</italic> mice did not contribute to endothelial cells in the cardinal vein and its branches (intersomitic vessels: ISVs), which had been thought to the primary and biggest sources of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). In this paper, we confirmed this finding using <italic>Isl1MerCreMer</italic> mice with tamoxifen treatment at E8.5 (Figure 4J). We have scanned whole embryos and detected no eYFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the cardinal vein or ISVs (the detailed quantification methods have been added in Methods section). Consistently, another group (Lioux et al., <italic>Dev Cell</italic> 52:350-363, 2020) re-evaluated this point using <italic>Isl1-Cre</italic> mice that the <italic>Isl1</italic><sup>+</sup> lineage contribute to endothelial cells of the cardinal vein only by less than 2%, which neither explains the abundant contribution of the <italic>Isl1</italic><sup>+</sup> lineage to coronary lymphatics (&gt;50%) nor its restriction to the ventral heart. Based on these reports, we supposed that the <italic>Isl1</italic><sup>+</sup> lineage was independent of LECs derived from the cardinal vein and ISVs.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we added new data showing thorough expression patterns of Isl1, Prox1, Flk1, and PECAM in the E9.0 to E11.5 pharyngeal arches and cardinal veins by immunostaining and presented them as Supplemental Figure 4. In these sections, we detected Isl1 and Prox1 expression with partial overlapping within the pharyngeal mesodermal core, whereas Isl1 was co-expressed with Flk1, or PECAM neither in vessel-like structures around the mesodermal core nor in the cardinal vein and their surrounding Prox1<sup>+/</sup>PECAM<sup>+</sup> LECs (Supplemental Figure 4Hâ and Jâ) confirming the independency. These findings have been described in the manuscript as follows:</p><p>âTo identify possible Isl1<sup>+</sup> LEC progenitors, we investigated the expression patterns of Isl1, Prox1, and vascular endothelial markers (Flk1 and PECAM) by immunostaining sections of E9.0 to E11.5 pharyngeal arches and cardinal veins. Consistent with the previous report (Cai et al., 2003), Isl1 was abundantly expressed in the core mesoderm of the first and second pharyngeal arches corresponding to the CPM from E9.0 to E11.5 (Nathan et al., 2008), where Prox1<sup>+</sup> cells also aggregated and partially overlapped with Isl1 signals (Supplemental Figure 4A, Aâ C, Câ E, Eâ G, Gâ I, Iâ). By contrast, Flk1<sup>+</sup> or PECAM<sup>+</sup> cells were distributed mainly around the CPM and not expressed Isl1 (Supplemental Figure 4A, Aâ C, Câ E, Eâ G, Gâ I, Iâ). Furthermore, Isl1 was expressed neither in the endothelial layer of the cardinal vein nor in surrounding Prox1<sup>+</sup>/PECAM<sup>+</sup> LECs (Supplemental Figure 4B, Bâ D, Dâ, F, Fâ, H, Hâ, J, and Jâ). Taken together with the result from Myf5-CreERT2 mice, these results indicate that Isl1<sup>+</sup> non-myogenic CPM cells may serve as LEC progenitors independent of venous-derived LECs and the commitment to LEC differentiation occurs before E9.5 in the pharyngeal arch region.â (Page 6-7, lines 187-200)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3.</p><p>The author stated that Islet1 lineage gives rise to lymphatic endothelial cells via the Tie2 mechanism but did not elaborate on this part. What is the potential relationship between Islet1 and Tie2? Or Tie2 just serves as a pan-endothelial lineage marker here?</p></disp-quote><p>To clearly demonstrate the relationship between <italic>Isl1</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>Tie2</italic><sup>+</sup> lineages in facial lymphatics, we added schematic representation in Figure 6G, which showed the differential Tie2 expression in lymphatic vessels in the tongue and facial skin.</p><p>Related to point 1 and 2, it has been thought that almost all LECs are formed from cardinal vein-derived <italic>Tie2</italic><sup>+</sup> endothelial cells. However, we identified the presence of <italic>Isl1</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Tie2</italic><sup>+</sup> LECs in the tongue, which are apparently not originated from the cardinal vein. In previous reports using Tie2-GFP mice or in situ hybridization of <italic>Tie2</italic>, <italic>Tie2</italic> was not detected in the developing LECs at E9.5, 11.5, 13.5, and E15.5 (Motoike et al., 2000; Srinivasan et al., 2007). In adult mice, <italic>Tie2</italic> expression in lymphatics was only observed in restricted regions (Morisada et al., 2005; Tammela et al., 2005). Taken together with our present data that the differentiation fate of <italic>Isl1</italic><sup>+</sup> CPM-derived LECs was determined between E6.5 and E9.5 (Figure 2-4, Supplemental Figure 3), Tie2 is supposed to be transiently expressed during LEC differentiation in the tongue from early <italic>Isl1</italic><sup>+</sup> CPM cells, although it remains difficult to identify the Tie2-expressing stage during non-venous LEC differentiation.</p><p>It will be an important future subject to identify the stage and implication of transient Tie2 expression in the lineage and, in this paper, we want to just note that the <italic>Tie2</italic><sup>+</sup> lineage does not always mean the derivation from cardinal vein endothelial cells.</p><p>This point has already been included in the manuscript as follows:</p><p>âThe present study further indicates that the LECs in the tongue are derived from Tie2-expressing cells among the Isl1<sup>+</sup> lineage. Although it is unclear whether Isl1<sup>+</sup>-derived cells at the Tie2expressing stage represent a venous endothelial identity, this result means that Tie2<sup>+</sup> LECs are not equivalent to cardinal vein-derived LECs.â (Page 10, 298-301)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Point 1.</p><p>The layout of the manuscript needs to be reorganized:</p><p>Details in statistical methods and quantification logic were completely missing from the manuscript. For example, definitions of &quot;a sample&quot; (how many sections are taken from one biological sample and how many fields take from one section, etc.), &quot;number of vessels per field&quot;, &quot;diameters&quot;, and of what parameters the numbers were normalized to, etc. need to be described in the Materials and methods section. For instance, it is not clear how &quot;tomato+ lymphatic vessels per field/Vegfr3+ lymphatic vessels&quot; was defined. First, what proportion of tomato+ cells need to colocalize with Vegfr3 expression cells in a specific vessel to make this vessel being determined as a &quot;tomato+ lymphatic vessel&quot;? Most data provided here are section immunostaining where &quot;multiple vessels&quot; are very likely coming from different cross-sections of one same vessel in the same field. Second, Vegfr3 can stain venous endothelial cells in earlier stages so the specificity of this marker can be controversial. These are some important technical aspects to include in the revised version. Figures needing more description in quantification methods include but are not limited to Figure 1H, 2H, 2P, 5K-R.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the statistical methods from the ratio of the count of the number to ratio of the area of lymphatic vessels in Figure 1H, 2H, P, and Supplemental Figure 3I to represent more precisely the contribution of Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells to lymphatic vessels. We also added more detailed description of the quantification methods in âMaterials and methodsâ section, as follows:</p><p>âQuantification of the section and whole mount images</p><p>For the quantification of section immunostaining at E16.5 embryos, the average of two 16-Î¼mthick sections taken every 50 Î¼m and 10x power field of views (0.42 mm<sup>2</sup>/field) for each anatomical part (the larynx, the skin of the lower jaw, the tongue, and the cardiac outflow tracts) were subjected to the analyses. In the facial skin, lymphatic vessels in superficial layers of dermis were subjected to the analyses.

LECs in this region have mixed developmental origins. Both these conclusions are convincingly supported by the study. However, the work would greatly be strengthened by Pax3-Cre lineage tracing. This would complement the Isl1-Cre lineage tracing. As the authors observe, the LEC descendants of Isl1+ cells also appear to go through Tie2+ state. Therefore, Tie2-Cre study has not helped to delineate the LECs of CPM and cardinal vein origins. In this context, tracing with Pax3-Cre is likely to give a very clear picture of LEC origins.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer in that the data using Pax3-Cre mice will strengthen our manuscripts. Unfortunately, we could not find out researchers who had this line in our society in Japan. For using this line, we need to get cryo-recovered mice from Jaxon laboratory. It will take at least several months. Therefore it is not realistic for us to use Pax3-Cre mice in this work because of time limitation. Instead, we addressed this issue by rewriting the discussion on the possible complementation with the Pax3-Cre lineage by citing (Lupu et al., 2022; Stone and Stainier, 2019).</p><p>This point has been addressed in the text as follows:</p><p>âA recent study has suggested that Pax3<sup>+</sup> paraxial mesoderm-derived cells contribute to the cardinal vein and therefore venous-derived LECs originate from the Pax3<sup>+</sup> lineage (Stone and Stainier, 2019).

Antibodies did not penetrate well on the tongue and, as for lymphatics of facial skin, their complicated morphology prevented clear visualization. Whole-mount imaging of the entire head was difficult for the same reason. In our experience, the antibody was useful for immunostaining of the early-stage embryos (up to E11.5) and the surface area of the heart, where lymphatic vessels were distributed on the epicardium. Even in the whole-mount heart, we have not succeeded in clear and estimable imaging of the vascular structure in the myocardium. Instead, we improved the quality of images and statistical comparisons in the revised manuscript, which we believe makes it more convincing.</p><p>References.</p><p>Adachi N, Bilio M, Baldini A, Kelly RG. 2020.

This discrepancy may indicate that the recombination efficiency differs among tissues and that embryos with low recombination efficiency could survive until E13.5.

The identity of the GFP+ cells that are not incorporated into lymphatic vessels should be clarified by imaging at higher magnification as currently, the data are not clear. The analyses in Figure 6 should be repeated with a more specific marker of lymphatic endothelial cells than LYVE1. Either PROX1 or VEGFR3. The PECAM1 staining in the sections presented in Figure 6A-B should be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the point above, we have performed section immunostaining of <italic>Tek-Cre;Prox1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> homozygous (n=3) and <italic>Tek-Cre;Prox1<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> heterozygous (n=3) embryos for PECAM, eGFP, and Prox1 at E16.5 in the back skin.

Considering a previous report that loss of Prox1 resulted in the formation of anastomosis between blood and lymphatic vessels (Johnson et al., 2008), our observation may indicate the formation of anastomosis between blood and lymphatic vessels. They also indicated that loss of Prox1 in LECs altered marker expression patterns (VE-cadherin and Lyve1 expression were down-regulated in <italic>CAGGCre-ERT2;Prox1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (Figure 5C and D)).

The Myf5-CreERT2 mouse line used in this study was constructed using an IRES-CreERT2 cassette in the 3'UTR of the Myf5 gene, meaning that expression of CreERT2 from this locus is likely significantly lower than in the Myf5-Cre line previously used to investigate LEC origins (Stone and Stainier, Dev Cell, 2019). Thus, the conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment presented in Supplementary figure 2 are limited. We recommend deleting the second sentence of the discussion 'We also showed that Myf5+ myogenic lineages, which were previously suggested to be possible sources of LECs35, did not contribute to lymphatic vasculature formation in Myf5-CreERT2 mice subjected to tamoxifen treatment at E8.5' and leaving the discussion of these analyses presented on lines 288-292, which more accurately place these data in the context of published work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have deleted indicated sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Reviewer #3 at Review Commons suggested using a Pax3-Cre to assess the contribution of this lineage to facial lymphatics.
