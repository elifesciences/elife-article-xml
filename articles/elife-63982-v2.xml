shows extreme sexual dimorphism in feeding. Only females are attracted to and obtain a blood-meal from humans, which they use to stimulate egg production. The <italic>fruitless</italic> gene is sex-specifically spliced and encodes a BTB zinc-finger transcription factor proposed to be a master regulator of male courtship and mating behavior across insects. We generated <italic>fruitless</italic> mutant mosquitoes and showed that males failed to mate, confirming the ancestral function of this gene in male sexual behavior. Remarkably<italic>, fruitless</italic> males also gain strong attraction to a live human host, a behavior that wild-type males never display, suggesting that male mosquitoes possess the central or peripheral neural circuits required to host-seek and that removing <italic>fruitless</italic> reveals this latent behavior in males. Our results highlight an unexpected repurposing of a master regulator of male-specific sexual behavior to control one module of female-specific blood-feeding behavior in a deadly vector of infectious diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sexual dimorphism is a phenomenon among animals, insects and plants where the two sexes of a species show differences in body size, physical features or colors. The bushy mane of a male lion, for example, is nowhere to be seen on a female lioness, and only male peacocks have extravagant tails. Most examples of sexual dimorphism, such as elaborate visual displays or courtship behaviors, are linked to mating.</p><p>However, there are a few species where behavioral differences between the sexes are not connected to mating. Mosquitoes are an example: while female mosquitoes feed on humans, and are attracted to a person’s body heat and odor, male mosquitoes have little interest in biting humans for their blood. Therefore, female mosquitoes are the ones responsible for transmitting the viruses that cause certain blood-borne diseases such as dengue fever or Zika. Determining which genes are linked to feeding behaviors in mosquitoes could allow researchers to genetically engineer females so they no longer bite people, thus stopping the spread of these diseases. Unfortunately, the genes that control mosquito feeding behaviors have not been well studied.</p><p>In other insects, some of the genes that control mating behaviors that depend on sex have been identified. For example, a gene called <italic>fruitless</italic> controls courtship behaviors in male flies and silkworms, and is thought to be the ‘master regulator’ of male sexual behavior across insects. Yet it remains to be seen whether the <italic>fruitless</italic> gene has any effect in mosquitoes, where sex differences relate to feeding habits.</p><p>To investigate this, Basrur et al. removed the <italic>fruitless</italic> gene from <italic>Aedesaegypti</italic> mosquitoes. The genetically altered male mosquitoes became unable to mate successfully, but – similar to unmodified males – still preferred sugar water over blood when feeding. Unlike unmodified males, however, the male mosquitoes lacking <italic>fruitless</italic> were attracted to the body odor of a person’s arm (like females).</p><p>These results reveal that <italic>fruitless</italic>, a gene that controls sex-specific mating behaviors in other insects, controls a sex-specific feeding behavior in mosquitoes. The <italic>fruitless</italic> gene, Basrur et al. speculate, likely gained this role controlling mosquito feeding behavior in the course of evolution. More research is required to fully understand the effects of the <italic>fruitless</italic> gene in male and female mosquitoes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Aedes aegypti</kwd><kwd>mosquito</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-Cas9</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vosshall-Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vosshall</surname><given-names>Leslie B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1 TR000043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vosshall</surname><given-names>Leslie B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Harvey L Karp Discovery Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Obaldia</surname><given-names>Maria Elena</given-names></name><name><surname>Morita</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JSPS Overseas Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morita</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHW Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Obaldia</surname><given-names>Maria Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1 TR001866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Obaldia</surname><given-names>Maria Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30DC017658</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herre</surname><given-names>Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herre</surname><given-names>Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Quadrivium Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vosshall/Herre-Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herre</surname><given-names>Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering male mosquitoes lacking the <italic>fruitless</italic> gene induces them to be attracted to humans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Across animals, males and females of the same species show striking differences in behavior. Male <italic>Paradisaeidae</italic> birds-of-paradise perform an elaborate courtship dance to seduce prospective female partners, contorting their bodies in forms resembling flowers, ballerinas, and smiling faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scholes, 2008</xref>). Female <italic>Serromyia femorata</italic> midges pierce and suck conspecific males dry during mating, breaking off his genitalia inside her, thereby supplying the female with both nutrition and sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edwards, 1920</xref>). Although an astonishing diversity of sexually dimorphic behaviors exists across species, most insights into the genetic and neural basis of sex-specific behaviors have come from a limited set of model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matthews and Vosshall, 2020</xref>). Which genes control sexual dimorphism in specialist species that have evolved novel behaviors? Do conserved genes control sexual dimorphism in species-specific behaviors, or do novel genes evolve to control new behaviors?</p><p>Many advances in understanding the genetics of sexually dimorphic behaviors have come from the study of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> fly courtship, where a male fly orients toward, taps, and follows a female fly, extending a wing to produce a courtship song before tasting, mounting, and copulating with her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall, 1994</xref>). Courtship comprises behavioral modules, which are simple discrete behaviors that must be combined to perform a complex behavior and are elicited by different sensory modalities and subsets of <italic>fruitless</italic>-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clyne and Miesenböck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kohl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>). Courtship modules include orienting, which is driven by visual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>) and persistent following and singing, which are triggered by chemical cues on a female fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>) and guided by vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sten et al., 2020</xref>). The <italic>fruitless</italic> gene is sex-specifically spliced in the brain of multiple insect species including mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertossa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gailey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salvemini et al., 2013</xref>) and has been proposed to be a master regulator of male courtship and mating behavior across insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Demir and Dickson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ryner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seeholzer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2017</xref>). Sex-specific splicing of the <italic>fruitless</italic> gene controls several aspects of courtship behavior. Male flies mutant for <italic>fruitless</italic> promiscuously court other males and cannot successfully mate with females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ryner et al., 1996</xref>). Forcing male <italic>fruitless</italic> splicing in females triggers orientation and singing behaviors normally only performed by males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Demir and Dickson, 2005</xref>). In addition, <italic>fruitless</italic> is required for sex-specific aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vrontou et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Fruitless</italic> encodes a BTB zinc-finger transcription factor that is thought to control cell identity and connectivity during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ito et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neville et al., 2014</xref>), as well as the functional properties of neurons in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Fruitless</italic> modulates the expression of a number of potential downstream target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neville et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sato and Yamamoto, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vernes, 2015</xref>) in a cell-type-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brovkina et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, <italic>fruitless</italic> has a conserved role controlling courtship in multiple <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seeholzer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2017</xref>), and sex-specific <italic>fruitless</italic> splicing is conserved across wasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertossa et al., 2009</xref>) and mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gailey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salvemini et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that <italic>fruitless</italic> may act as a master regulator of sexually dimorphic mating behaviors across insects.</p><p>Mosquitoes display striking sexually dimorphic mating and feeding behaviors. Only male mosquitoes initiate mating, and only females drink blood, which they require to develop their eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galun et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jové et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klowden, 1995</xref>). Sexual dimorphism in blood-feeding is one of the only instances of a completely sexually dimorphic feeding behavior because male mosquitoes never pierce skin or engorge on blood. While part of this dimorphism is enforced by sex-specific genitalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spielman, 1964</xref>) or feeding appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones and Pilitt, 1973</xref>), there is also a dramatic difference in the drive to hunt hosts between males and female mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roth, 1948</xref>). To blood-feed, females combine multiple behavioral modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowen, 1991</xref>). Female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes take flight when exposed to carbon dioxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>) and are attracted to human olfactory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeGennaro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dekker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zwiebel and Takken, 2004</xref>), thermal, and visual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu and Vosshall, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Breugel et al., 2015</xref>), and integrate at least two of these cues to orient toward and land on human skin. Engorging on blood is triggered by specific sensory cues tasted by the female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galun et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jové et al., 2020</xref>). It is not known which genes have evolved to control this unique sexually dimorphic and mosquito-specific feeding behavior. Here, we generate <italic>fruitless</italic> mutant <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes and show that consistent with observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>fruitless</italic> is required for male mating behavior. Unexpectedly, <italic>fruitless</italic> mutant male mosquitoes gain the ability to host-seek, specifically driven by an attraction to human odor. Our results demonstrate that sexual dimorphism in a single module of a mosquito-specific behavior is controlled by a conserved gene that we speculate has gained a new function in the course of evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Fruitless</italic> is sex-specifically spliced in the mosquito nervous system</title><p>We used an arm-next-to-cage assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to monitor attraction of male and female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes to a live human arm. Consistent with their sexually dimorphic blood-feeding behavior, only females were strongly attracted to the arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). What is the genetic basis for this extreme sexual dimorphism? We reasoned that <italic>fruitless</italic>, which is alternatively spliced in a sex-specific manner and promotes male courtship and copulation in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ryner et al., 1996</xref>), may play similar roles in controlling sexually dimorphic behaviors in <italic>Aedes aegypti. Fruitless</italic> is a complex gene with multiple promoters and multiple alternatively spliced exons. Downstream promoters drive broadly expressed non-sex-specific <italic>fruitless</italic> transcripts and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). A previous study showed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salvemini et al., 2013</xref>) and we confirmed that transcripts from the upstream neuron-specific (P1) promoter in the <italic>Aedes aegypti fruitless</italic> gene are sex-specifically spliced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–H</xref>). Both male and female transcripts include a short male ‘m’ exon, and female transcripts additionally include a longer female ‘f’ exon with an early stop codon, predicted to yield a truncated Fruitless protein in the female. However, it is unlikely that any sex-specific Fruitless protein or peptides are stably expressed in adult females. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, sex-specific female fruitless peptides are not detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2000</xref>), and <italic>transformer</italic> is thought to inhibit translation by binding to female <italic>fruitless</italic> P1 transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Usui-Aoki et al., 2000</xref>). P1 transcripts of both sexes splice to the first common ‘c1’ exon, but only male transcripts are predicted to encode full-length Fruitless protein with BTB and zinc-finger domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

The concept that a latent sex-specific behavior can be revealed by knocking out a single gene was elegantly demonstrated in the mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>). Only male mice court and initiate sexual contact with females and yet knocking out the <italic>Trpc2</italic> gene causes female mice to display these male-specific behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kimchi et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>There are field reports of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> males being collected near human hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hartberg, 1971</xref>), which the experimenters interpreted as male <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> attraction to humans. We note, however, that these field experiments did not control for the presence of females, suggesting that the collected males may have been attracted to the female mosquitoes that attempt to bite humans. In our well-controlled laboratory assays, we were unable to find any evidence of strong attraction to humans in mosquito males at close-range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) or at long distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In these same assays, wild-type male mosquitoes showed strong attraction to floral cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). We cannot exclude that male mosquitoes in the field show some attraction to a human host, but suggest that any attraction in males would be weaker than in wild-type females, or the attraction we demonstrate in <italic>fruitless</italic> mutant males here.</p><p>Host-seeking is the first step in a complex sequence of behaviors that lead to blood-feeding. After detecting and flying toward a human host, the female mosquito must land on the human, pierce the skin, and ultimately engorge on blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowen, 1991</xref>). We have shown that <italic>fruitless</italic> has evolved to control sexual dimorphism in one module of this specialized behavior, the ability to host-seek. Females integrate multiple sensory cues to identify and approach human hosts, and we show that <italic>fruitless</italic> controls the response to just one of those cues, human odor. Sexual dimorphism in thermosensation, or in subsequent feeding behaviors does not appear to be controlled by <italic>fruitless</italic> in the male mosquito, since neither wild-type nor mutant <italic>fruitless</italic> males will drink warm blood. The modular genetic organization of mosquito behavior sparks intriguing parallels to other complex sexually dimorphic behaviors like mouse parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>). To be effective parents, female mice must build nests, and then retrieve, groom, and nurse their pups. In the deer mouse <italic>Peromyscus,</italic> the conserved peptide vasopressin has evolved to control nest building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref>). In both <italic>Peromyscus</italic> and <italic>Aedes</italic>, a conserved gene has gained control over a single aspect of a complex behavior. It has been hypothesized that certain classes of genes like neuromodulators and transcription factors are more likely to underlie phenotypic differences between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bendesky and Bargmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin and Orgogozo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tosches, 2017</xref>), and our study demonstrates that this is true even for an entirely novel behavior.</p><p>Where in the nervous system is <italic>fruitless</italic> required to suppress host seeking in male mosquitoes? <italic>fruitless</italic> might function in the antenna to modulate the detection of human odor in male mosquitoes, perhaps by tuning the functional or anatomical properties of olfactory sensory neurons. Such a role has been recently demonstrated in the aging-dependent sensitization of the male <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennal response to pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang and Su, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, both wild-type males and females might detect human odor, and <italic>fruitless</italic> could function in the central brain to reroute these signals to drive different motor outputs, as has been demonstrated with the sexually dimorphic response to <italic>Drosophila</italic> pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kohl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>). To distinguish between these two models, we would require significant advances in technology and mosquito genetics, including a <italic>fruitless</italic> driver line to image neural responses to human odor. Despite significant effort, we were unable to generate a viable <italic>fruitless</italic> driver line both because of tight genetic linkage of <italic>fruitless</italic> to the sex-determining M locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall et al., 2015</xref>) and because gene-targeted females failed to blood-feed and were therefore sterile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To explore central brain <italic>fruitless</italic>+ circuits, we would need to be able to subset expression to label and drive reporters or rescue <italic>fruitless</italic> expression in sparse populations of neurons, a technology that is still out of reach. Advances in mosquito genetic tools, such as the successful implementation of orthogonal transcriptional activator reagents, combined with sparse labeling approaches will be required to gain mechanistic insight into <italic>fruitless</italic> function within mosquito host-seeking circuits. We note that these advances were not trivial in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, requiring efforts from multiple laboratories over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kohl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>), and expect that the generation of these tools and the subsequent characterization of the circuit will be significantly more challenging in the mosquito, a non-model organism.</p><p>Our work suggests that <italic>fruitless</italic> has evolved the novel function of enforcing female-specific host-seeking while maintaining its presumably ancestral male mating function. How might <italic>fruitless</italic> have evolved to control host-seeking? One possibility is that non-sex-specific host-seeking neural circuits first emerged in the ancestral mosquito, and then secondarily began to express <italic>fruitless</italic> to suppress the development or adult function of host-seeking circuits specifically in males. Another possibility is that mosquitoes duplicated and co-opted the ancestral <italic>fruitless-</italic>expressing mating neural circuits and retuned the inputs and outputs into this circuit to drive host-seeking. Circuit duplication is one of the mechanisms by which neural circuits are proposed to evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tosches, 2017</xref>) and has been demonstrated in the case of vocal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakraborty and Jarvis, 2015</xref>) and in the evolution of cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kebschull et al., 2020</xref>). In these duplicated mosquito circuits, <italic>fruitless</italic> function would have switched from promoting mating to inhibiting host-seeking in males. We speculate that both possibilities allow for <italic>fruitless</italic> to control both sex-specific host-seeking and mating behaviors, and identification and molecular profiling of the <italic>fruitless</italic> cells controlling host-seeking and mating will help distinguish between these models. Our work highlights <italic>fruitless</italic> as a potential means to investigate the circuit basis of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> host seeking, a behavior that is responsible for infecting millions of people with life-threatening pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>)</td><td><italic>fruitless</italic></td><td>RefSeq</td><td>LOC5567734</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>fruitless</italic></td><td>VectorBase</td><td>AGAP000080</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>)</td><td><italic>fruitless</italic></td><td>RefSeq</td><td>CPIJ010853</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Wyeomyia smithii</italic>)</td><td><italic>fruitless</italic></td><td>This paper</td><td/><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Toxorhynchites amboinensis</italic>)</td><td><italic>fruitless</italic></td><td>This paper</td><td/><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Aedes aegypti,</italic> both sexes)</td><td>LVP-IB12</td><td>BEI resources</td><td>MRA-735</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Anopheles gambiae,</italic> both sexes)</td><td>G3</td><td>Flaminia Catteruccia (Harvard University)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Culex quinquefasciatus,</italic> both sexes)</td><td>JHB</td><td>BEI resources</td><td>NR-43025</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Wyeomyia smithii,</italic> both sexes)</td><td>PB</td><td>William Bradshaw and Christina Holzapfel (University of Oregon)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Toxorhynchites amboinensis,</italic> both sexes)</td><td/><td>Laurence Zwiebel (Vanderbilt University)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Aedes aegypti,</italic> both sexes)</td><td><italic>fruitless<sup>∆M</sup></italic></td><td>This paper</td><td/><td><italic>fruitless</italic> mutant strain;

It was therefore impossible to maintain these lines. We do not know if the blood-feeding defect was due to a failure to respond to the host or some other behavioral or anatomical defect. Since <italic>fruitless</italic> is tightly linked to the male-determining locus, it was not an option to maintain this targeted allele in males. Integrations on the male chromosome would yield ~1/500 females with the recombinant allele, and integrations on the female chromosome yield inviable females and rare recombinant males. In either scenario, the <italic>fruitless<sup>∆F</sup></italic> insertion is unmarked and would need to be followed by PCR genotyping. We also attempted to generate a line where we both deleted the female <italic>fruitless</italic> exon and knocked-in an intronic 3xP3 fluorescent marker, which would allow us to maintain this line in males and use the marker to select rare recombinants for behavioral analysis. However, females with this integration did not have any behavioral phenotypes, suggesting that the intronic 3xP3 marker interfered with regular <italic>fruitless</italic> splicing in both males and females. These difficulties precluded any further investigation of the phenotype of expressing full-length fruitless protein in females.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Antibody staining – brain whole mounts</title><p>Dissection of adult brains and immunostaining was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jové et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matthews et al., 2019</xref>).

Brains were incubated in 0.25% PBT plus 2% normal goat serum with primary antibodies at the following dilutions: rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland 600-401-379) 1:200 and mouse anti-<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Brp (nc82) 1:5000. The nc82 hybridoma developed by Erich Buchner of Universitätsklinikum Würzburg was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, created by the NICHD of the NIH and maintained at The University of Iowa, Department of Biology, Iowa City, IA 52242. Primary antibodies were incubated for 2 nights at 4°C and then washed at least six times for 15 min with 0.25% PBT at room temperature. Brains were incubated with secondary antibody for 2 nights at 4°C with secondary antibodies at 1:500% and 2% normal goat serum. Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo A32732) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo A-21235). Brains were then washed for 15 min at least six times with 0.25% PBT at room temperature and mounted in Slowfade Diamond (Thermo S36972) using #1.5 coverslips as spacers before confocal imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Antibody staining – antennal whole mounts</title><p>This protocol was adapted from a <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo staining protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manning and Doe, 2017</xref>). Six- to 10-day-old mosquitoes were anesthetized, decapitated, and placed in 1.5 mL 5 U/mL chitinase (Sigma C6137) and 100 U/mL chymotrypsin (Sigma CHY5S) in 119 mM NaCl, 48 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 25 mM HEPES buffer on ice. Male heads were incubated for 5 min on a ThermoMixer (Eppendorf 5382000023), and 25 min in a rotating hybridization oven, and female heads were incubated for 10 min on the ThermoMixer and 50 min in rotating oven, all at 37°C. Heads were then rinsed once and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 1X Ca<sup>+2</sup>, Mg<sup>+2</sup> free PBS, and 0.25% Triton X-100 for 24 hr at room temperature on a rotator. All subsequent 4°C steps used a nutator, and room temperature steps used a rotator. Heads were washed for 30 min at room temperature at least three times in 1X PBS with 0.03% Triton X-100 (0.03% PBT). Antennae were then dissected into 0.5-mL microfuge tubes and dehydrated in 80% methanol/20% DMSO for 1 hr at room temperature.

Briefly, for each trial, 20 adult mosquitoes were sorted under cold anesthesia (4°C) and placed in a cage and allowed to acclimate for 30 min. A human arm was placed 2.5 cm from one side of a standard 28 × 28×28 cm cage. Mosquitoes could not directly contact the human arm. A Logitech C920s HD Pro Webcam was positioned to take images of mosquitoes responding to the human arm. Trials ran for 10 min and images were acquired at a rate of 1 frame/s. To quantify mosquito responses, we manually counted the number of mosquitoes resting on the lower portion of the screen closest to the human arm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Feeding assay</title><p>Mosquitoes were cold-anesthetized, and 20 mosquitoes were sorted into 250 mL bottles covered with a taut net secured with rubber bands. They were allowed to acclimate for 24 hr with access to water through cotton balls. The following meals were presented: water, 10% sucrose, or sheep’s blood (Hemostat DSB100) supplemented with 1 mM ATP (Sigma A6419). Meals were warmed to 45°C before being used in the assay. 10 mL of a given meal was pipetted into the bottle caps, animals were activated with a 30 s pulse of 4% CO<sub>2</sub>, and bottles were inverted on top of the caps. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on each meal through the net for 10 min and were then anesthetized at 4°C and scored as fed if any level of feeding was observed, as assessed by visual inspection of the abdomen of the animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Insemination assay</title><p>Mosquitoes were separated by sex at the pupal stage and sex was confirmed within 24 hr of eclosion.

Mosquitoes were then anesthetized at 4°C, females separated from males, and female spermathecae were dissected to score for insemination as a sign of successful mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Degner and Harrington, 2016</xref>). Control virgin females were dissected in parallel to verify absence of insemination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quattroport olfactometer</title><p>Details of Quattroport fabrication and operation are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/VosshallLab/Basrur_Vosshall2020">https://github.com/VosshallLab/Basrur_Vosshall2020</ext-link>. Briefly, the Quattroport consists of four tubes, each with its own stimulus box, trap, and mosquito start chamber. There are adjustable gates between each chamber. The stimulus was placed upstream of a trap, and mosquitoes are prevented from contacting the stimulus by a mesh barrier. In each trial, four stimuli were run in parallel, with the positions of stimuli randomized and rotated between each trial. Air was filtered and pumped into each box, either at a final concentration of 1% CO<sub>2</sub> (for host-seeking assays) or at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (honey-seeking assays). For all assays, ~20 mosquitoes were sorted and placed into canisters the day of behavior. Mosquitoes were allowed to acclimate in the assay for 10 min, then exposed to the stimulus for 30 s, after which gates were opened and animals allowed to fly for 5 min. After this time, gates were closed and mosquitoes were counted to quantify the percent of mosquitoes in the trap.</p><p>For honey assays, 3- to 7-day-old mosquitoes were fasted for 24 hr before the experiment by replacing 10% sucrose with a water source. CO<sub>2</sub> was not added for honey assays. Either 1 g of leatherwood honey (Tasmanian Honey Company, Tasmania, Australia) or glycerol (Sigma G5516) was applied to a 55 mm diameter Whatman filter paper circle (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and placed in a Petri dish.</p><p>For host-seeking assays, mosquitoes were allowed access to sucrose before the experiment. A final concentration of 1% CO<sub>2</sub> was supplied in the airstream for the duration of the 5 min 30 s assay in all host-seeking assays (for both human forearm/odor stimuli and blank/unworn nylon controls). For live human host-seeking assays, a human subject placed their forearm on an acrylic box, exposing a 2.5 × 5 cm rectangle of skin to the airstream.</p><p>For human odor host-seeking assays, the same human subject wore a tan nylon sleeve (L'eggs Women's Comfortable Everyday Knee Highs Reinforced Toe Panty Hose, modified with scissors to remove the toe area) on their forearm. A second black nylon sleeve was worn on top of the tan nylon odor sampling sleeve to protect it from external odors. After 6 hr of continuous wear, the black nylon sleeve was discarded, and the tan nylon sleeve was frozen at −20°C. Nylons were used within 1 week of being worn. On the day of the assay, nylons were thawed for at least 1 hr at room temperature. A 10 × 14 cm piece of the sleeve was presented with the skin-contacting surface facing upward in the stimulus box along with CO<sub>2</sub>. Unworn nylons were similarly frozen, thawed, and cut to serve as negative controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Heat-seeking assay</title><p>Experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corfas and Vosshall, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, 45–50 mosquitoes were fasted for 3 hr before the experiment by replacing 10% sucrose with a water source and were then transferred into a custom-made Plexiglass box (30 × 30×30 cm), with carbon-filtered air pumped continuously into the box via a diffusion pad installed on the ceiling of the enclosure. All stimulus periods lasted 3 min and were presented on a single Peltier element (6 × 9 cm, Tellurex) covered with a piece of standard white letter-size printer paper (NMP1120, Navigator) cut to 15 × 17 cm and held taut by a magnetic frame. CO<sub>2</sub> pulses (20 s, to &gt;1000 ppm above background levels) were added to the air stream and accompanied all stimulus period onsets. Mosquito landings on the Peltier were monitored by fixed cameras (FFMV-03M2M-CS, Point Grey Research) with images acquired at 1 Hz. Images were analyzed using custom MATLAB scripts to count mosquito landings within a fixed target region. Mosquito occupancy on the Peltier was quantified during seconds 90–180 of each stimulus period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantification, statistical analysis, and reproducibility</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version 8. Data collected as percent of total are shown as mean ± s.e.m. Details of statistical methods are reported in the figure legends. Preliminary experiments were used to assess variance and determine sample sizes before carrying out experiments. Typically, sample sizes were n = 6–14 groups of 10-20 mosquitoes in behavioral assays. We used similar sample sizes for all experiments where the same variable was being compared. No data were excluded from this study. Since mosquito behavior is variable, all olfactometer experiments with a human arm were carried out repeatedly to assess the effect of external environmental conditions on behavior. No experiments were performed on days when &lt; 40% of wild-type females responded to a live human arm. No data met these exclusion criteria. All attempts at replication over multiple days were successful. We carried out all experiments with different groups of animals hatched up to 4 weeks apart, and over multiple days. Several experiments were carried out repeatedly over the course of this study, namely the wild-type female response to a live human arm in Quattroport olfactometer assays. These results were robust and reliable over the course of the many years it took to complete this study. For all experiments, mosquitoes from a cage were randomly selected and sorted by sex into groups for behavioral assays. All stimuli and genotypes were interspersed, and positions were randomized when possible. Every experiment involved replicates collected over multiple days, to ensure that there was no effect of daily environmental or experimental conditions. We also collected a similar sample size for each variable every time the experiment was run, to ensure no effect of external conditions. Blinding to genotype was performed in the heat-seeking assays. The experimenter was not blinded to genotype in the host-seeking assays because the mutant phenotype we describe is so robust it was impossible to be blinded in these assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Data and software availability</title><p>All raw data are provided in the accompanying Source Data files.

Unlike their wild-type controls, <italic>fruitless</italic> mutant male mosquitoes are attracted to human odor. Interestingly, <italic>fruitless</italic> males do not also acquire heat seeking, a second component of the female-specific human host-seeking program, and do not feed on blood. These results suggest that <italic>fruitless</italic> functions in the male olfactory system to repress a key component of host seeking.</p><p>The reviewers are in agreement that the work is of very high quality, the experiments are well designed and analyzed, the figures are of excellent quality and the paper well written. Textual clarifications are requested below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the Discussion, the authors provide two different models to explain the function of <italic>fruitless</italic> in suppressing host seeking behavior in male mosquitos. In one model, <italic>fruitless</italic> modulates the detection of human odors in the periphery. In another, <italic>fruitless</italic> functions in the central brain to reroute olfactory information. The authors favor the latter and dismiss the first based on their observation that the <italic>fruitless</italic> mutation does not change the number or position of the <italic>fruitless</italic>-positive glomeruli in the antennal lobe. This argument is unconvincing. Is it possible that <italic>fruitless</italic> suppresses the expression of specific olfactory receptor genes? Does the <italic>fruitless</italic> mutation change glomerular volume? Changes in OR expression may alter olfactory tuning and volume changes may alter olfactory response intensity. Without functional data, it would be difficult to favor either model. It is interesting that <italic>fruitless</italic> males do not heat seek, do not feed on blood and are not feminized in their response to CO2 (is this correct?) indicating that <italic>fruitless</italic> controls an important but delimited part of host seeking behavior. This Discussion should be revised. Relatedly, the Abstract sentence &quot;suggest[ing] that male mosquitoes possess the neural circuits required to host-seek and that removing <italic>fruitless</italic> reveals this latent behavior in males&quot; might be revised.</p><p>2) The text is sometimes rather imprecise and could benefit from some refinement. Consider changing the following sections/sentences:</p><p>&quot;<italic>fruitless</italic> encodes a BTB zinc-finger transcription factor that is thought to control cell identity and connectivity during development (Ito et al., 2016; Neville et al., 2014), as well as the functional properties of neurons in adulthood (Sethi et al., 2019), although its genomic targets and the molecular mechanism by which it acts remain unclear.&quot; Genomic targets and molecular mechanisms are not completely unclear! Neville et al., 2014 identifies targets, as does Vernes, 2014. There is substantial recent work on <italic>fruitless</italic> targets (lola, robo, chromatin modifiers), <italic>fruitless</italic> interaction partners and molecular mechanisms by the Yamamoto group- see e.g. the recent review from Sato and Yamamoto, 2020, as well as e.g. Sato et al. 2020, Commun Biol doi: 10.1038/s42003-020-01327-z. A follow up to Sethi et al., 2019 with more mechanistic insight is available at Cell reports Sneek Peek: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3624384</p><p>&quot;However, it is unlikely that any Fruitless protein is stably expressed in the female. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, female <italic>fruitless</italic>peptides are not detected.&quot; Specify: sex specific proteins/peptides, in the adult. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, common isoforms of Fruitless are expressed in females during development. The uninitiated reader would benefit from a bit more detail about sex specific vs. common isoforms.</p><p>&quot;The projections of <italic>fruitless</italic>&gt;tdTomato neurons appear to be dramatically sexually dimorphic relative to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.&quot; Unclear: P1 fru transcripts, as judged by fru-GAL4 (Stockinger line) expression show a clear dimorphic expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> – the level of &quot;dimorphicness&quot; in mosquitos does not seem &quot;dramatically&quot; more/stronger to me.</p><p>&quot;If <italic>fruitless</italic> function in <italic>Aedesaegypti</italic> were limited to mating and courtship as it is in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot;. Fruitless also functions in aggression in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: Vrontou et al., 2006. Actually, here males mutant for FruM (so called FruF males) &quot;gain&quot; female specific behavior/fighting style. Maybe that would be worth mentioning in the Discussion as well – that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, FruM also seems to suppress some female specific behaviors.</p><p>&quot;Since males are able to host-seek in the absence of <italic>fruitless</italic>, the sex of the mosquito does not intrinsically regulate the development and function of brain circuits</p><p>controlling host-seeking behavior.&quot; Unclear – absence/presence of <italic>fruitless</italic> is an important aspect of &quot;the sex&quot; of the mosquito- or what else do the authors mean by &quot;the sex&quot;?</p><p>&quot;Another possibility is that mosquitoes duplicated and co-opted the ancestral <italic>fruitless</italic>-expressing mating neural circuits, and retuned the inputs and outputs into this circuit to drive host-seeking. In these duplicated circuits,…&quot;. I have a hard time understanding the concept of a &quot;duplicated mating circuit&quot; which is subsequently retuned. I don't think the gene duplication-diversification model/concept can be so easily re-used for circuits. I'd appreciate if the authors could clarify what they exactly mean here and give some citations, if available.</p><p>3) The figures are not mentioned in order in the text- Figure 3 is referred to in the Results before the second part of Figure 2 (D-K, behavioral data). Please rearrange figures or text to make it fit.</p><p>4) The authors claim that the construct they use as marker and mutant allele <italic>fruitless<sup>∆M</sup></italic>-CsChrimson:tdtomato lead to Chrimson expression that is too low for any optogenetic activation (subsection “<italic>fruitless<sup>∆M</sup>andfruitless<sup>∆M-tdTomato</sup></italic> strain generation). Could they elaborate if and how they tested for the effect of a functional Chrimson on a behavioral level? I am convinced from Figure 4D that the Chrimson allele alone does not elicit attraction to human odor in males, but was there indication that it had an influence on other behaviors in either males or females? Alternatively, did the authors confirm that the homozygous deletion allele without Chrimson (<italic>fruitless<sup>∆M</sup></italic>/<italic>fruitless<sup>∆M</sup></italic>) gives the same phenotype?</p><p>5) Statistical analysis in Figure 4. It was stated in the legend &quot;In C, E, data labeled with different letters are significantly different from each other (Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons, p &lt; 0.05)&quot;. First, this statement is likely referred to panels B and D, not C and E. Second, it is unclear whether statistical test was run between different temperatures in panel B. If so, the letters for 26 degree appear to be &quot;b b b&quot;, instead of &quot;a a a&quot;.</p><p>6) Given the careful analysis of the <italic>fruitless</italic> gene structure, it is very likely that the <italic>fruitless<sup>∆M</sup></italic> mutation does not affect female mating or host-seeking behavior. However, mutant females were only examined with the human odor host-seeking assay (Figure 4D). Readers would be interested to see the experiments carried out as in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 to be performed with <italic>fruitless<sup>∆M</sup></italic> mutant females. Such data would strengthen the argument that females do not make a full-length <italic>fruitless</italic> protein and the <italic>fruitless<sup>∆M</sup></italic> mutation does not affect female mating or host-seeking behavior. If the authors already have this data, it would be a nice addition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63982.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the Discussion, the authors provide two different models to explain the function of fruitless in suppressing host seeking behavior in male mosquitos.

Consider changing the following sections/sentences:</p><p>&quot;fruitless encodes a BTB zinc-finger transcription factor that is thought to control cell identity and connectivity during development (Ito et al., 2016; Neville et al., 2014), as well as the functional properties of neurons in adulthood (Sethi et al., 2019), although its genomic targets and the molecular mechanism by which it acts remain unclear.&quot; Genomic targets and molecular mechanisms are not completely unclear! Neville et al. 2014 identifies targets, as does Vernes, 2014. There is substantial recent work on fruitless targets (lola, robo, chromatin modifiers), fruitless interaction partners and molecular mechanisms by the Yamamoto group- see e.g. the recent review from Sato and Yamamoto, 2020, as well as e.g. Sato et al. 2020, Commun Biol doi: 10.1038/s42003-020-01327-z. A follow up to Sethi et al., 2019 with more mechanistic insight is available at Cell reports Sneek Peek: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3624384</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight our imperfect scholarship and have revised this sentence to include the suggested citations on the targets and mechanism of action of <italic>fruitless</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;However, it is unlikely that any Fruitless protein is stably expressed in the female. In Drosophila, female fruitless peptides are not detected.&quot; Specify: sex specific proteins/peptides, in the adult. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> common isoforms of Fruitless are expressed in females during development. The uninitiated reader would benefit from a bit more detail about sex specific vs. common isoforms.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to clarify that <italic>fruitless</italic> has broadly expressed common isoforms and neuronally enriched sex-specific isoforms and mentioned that the latter are not likely to lead to functional protein in females.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;The projections of fruitless&gt;tdTomato neurons appear to be dramatically sexually dimorphic relative to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.&quot; Unclear: P1 fru transcripts, as judged by fru-GAL4 (Stockinger line) expression show a clear dimorphic expression in Drosophila – the level of &quot;dimorphicness&quot; in mosquitos does not seem &quot;dramatically&quot; more/stronger to me.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our original statement was subjective and have revised this sentence to remove comparisons with <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;If fruitless function in Aedes aegypti were limited to mating and courtship as it is in Drosophila&quot;. Fruitless also functions in aggression in <italic>Drosophila:</italic> Vrontou et al. 2006. Actually, here males mutant for FruM (so called FruF males) &quot;gain&quot; female specific behavior/fighting style. Maybe that would be worth mentioning in the Discussion as well – that in Drosophila, FruM also seems to suppress some female specific behaviors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting the important research on sex-specific <italic>Drosophila</italic> aggression and have now included this reference in the Discussion and relevant portions of the Results and Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Since males are able to host-seek in the absence of fruitless, the sex of the mosquito does not intrinsically regulate the development and function of brain circuits</p><p>controlling host-seeking behavior.&quot; Unclear – absence/presence of fruitless is an important aspect of &quot;the sex&quot; of the mosquito- or what else do the authors mean by &quot;the sex&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this sentence to clarify that other genes in the sex-determination hierarchy do not control sexual dimorphism in host-seeking behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Another possibility is that mosquitoes duplicated and co-opted the ancestral fruitless-expressing mating neural circuits, and retuned the inputs and outputs into this circuit to drive host-seeking. In these duplicated circuits,…&quot;. I have a hard time understanding the concept of a &quot;duplicated mating circuit&quot; which is subsequently retuned. I don't think the gene duplication-diversification model/concept can be so easily re-used for circuits. I'd appreciate if the authors could clarify what they exactly mean here and give some citations, if available.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this paragraph to include a clarification of this concept, and included relevant citations to highlight the rich scholarship on the mechanisms of neural circuit evolution, namely recent work on the role of circuit duplication in the evolution of vocal learning and of cerebellar nuclei.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The figures are not mentioned in order in the text- Figure 3 is referred to in the Results before the second part of Figure 2 (D-K, behavioral data). Please rearrange figures or text to make it fit.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the figures to appear in the order in which they are referred to in the text. Specifically, we have expanded Figure 2 to exclusively show <italic>fruitless</italic> expression in the central brain, and now have a new Figure 4 with the behavioral experiments formerly in Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim that the construct they use as marker and mutant allele fruitless<sup>∆M</sup>-CsChrimson:tdtomato lead to Chrimson expression that is too low for any optogenetic activation (subsection “fruitless<sup>∆M</sup> and fruitless<sup>∆M-tdTomato</sup> strain generation). Could they elaborate if and how they tested for the effect of a functional Chrimson on a behavioral level? I am convinced from Figure 4D that the Chrimson allele alone does not elicit attraction to human odor in males, but was there indication that it had an influence on other behaviors in either males or females? Alternatively, did the authors confirm that the homozygous deletion allele without Chrimson (fruitless<sup>ΔM</sup>/fruitless<sup>∆M</sup>) gives the same phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Potential CsChrimson driven activation of fruitless+ neurons is an important concern to rule out. We note that CsChrimson:tdTomato expression is very weak since it is driven by the endogenous <italic>fruitless</italic> promoters without any amplification from QF2. In support of this, CsChrimson:tdTomato endogenous fluorescence was not visible under a confocal microscope, even at high laser intensities, and required amplification from antibodies in all our images. We also note that animals were not fed trans-retinal, the necessary cofactor for CsChrimson activity. Even when we fed animals retinal and attempted to substitute human odor and CO<sub>2</sub> with optogenetic activation of <italic>fruitless</italic>+ neurons in a blood-feeding assay, we did not observe increased feeding or any other behaviors, likely due to this weak expression (preliminary data not shown). Finally, we have now included more behavioral data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, showing that <italic>fruitless<sup>∆M-CsChrimson-tdTomato/+</sup></italic> males and females are able to mate normally, and <italic>fruitless<sup>∆M-CsChrimson-tdTomato/+</sup> </italic>females show normal blood-feeding and egg-laying behavior. We have not examined <italic>fruitless<sup>∆M /∆M</sup></italic> animals due to the difficulty of obtaining these animals without molecular genotyping of each individual. However, given the weak expression of CsChrimson and the robust behavior of heterozygote animals, we consider it unlikely that this allele is significantly affecting mosquito behavior. We have now included these details in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Statistical analysis in Figure 4. It was stated in the legend &quot;In C, E, data labeled with different letters are significantly different from each other (Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons, p &lt; 0.05)&quot;. First, this statement is likely referred to panels B and D, not C and E. Second, it is unclear whether statistical test was run between different temperatures in panel B. If so, the letters for 26 degree appear to be &quot;b b b&quot;, instead of &quot;a a a&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for noting the error in the legend, which we have now corrected. The test was run within genotypes for a given temperature, and not between temperatures. The figure legends for this panel, as well as other ambiguous panels in Figure 4 have been updated to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Given the careful analysis of the fruitless gene structure, it is very likely that the fruitless-deltaM mutation does not affect female mating or host-seeking behavior. However, mutant females were only examined with the human odor host-seeking assay (Figure 4D). Readers would be interested to see the experiments carried out as in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 to be performed with fruitless<sup>∆M</sup> mutant females. Such data would strengthen the argument that females do not make a full-length fruitless protein and the fruitless<sup>∆M</sup> mutation does not affect female mating or host-seeking behavior. If the authors already have this data, it would be a nice addition.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added Figure 5—figure supplement 1 showing blood-feeding, egg-laying, and mating status of <italic>fruitless<sup>∆M/∆M-CsChrimson-tdTomato</sup></italic> females, in addition to heterozygous controls, as well as wild-type females crossed to various male genotypes. Notably, <italic>fruitless<sup>∆M/∆M-CsChrimson-tdTomato</sup></italic> females blood-feed at comparable rates to wild-type females (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A), are able to lay eggs at high rates (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B), and are able to successfully mate with wild-type males (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C), suggesting that the <italic>fruitless<sup>∆M</sup></italic>mutation does not significantly affect female mating, host-seeking, or feeding behavior. These data support the model where sex-specific <italic>fruitless</italic> protein is not functional in females.</p></body></sub-article></article>
