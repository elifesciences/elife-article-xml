Genome-wide association studies have identified <italic>SLC6A14,</italic> an electrogenic amino acid transporter, as a genetic modifier of CF-associated meconium ileus. The purpose of the current work was to determine the biological role of <italic>Slc6a14,</italic> by disrupting its expression in CF mice bearing the major mutation, F508del. We found that disruption of <italic>Slc6a14</italic> worsened the intestinal fluid secretion defect, characteristic of these mice. In vitro studies of mouse intestinal organoids revealed that exacerbation of the primary defect was associated with reduced arginine uptake across the apical membrane, with aberrant nitric oxide and cyclic GMP-mediated regulation of the major CF-causing mutant protein. Together, these studies highlight the role of this apical transporter in modifying cellular nitric oxide levels, residual function of the major CF mutant and potentially, its promise as a therapeutic target.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>organoids</kwd><kwd>colonic cell line</kwd><kwd>nitric oxide signaling</kwd><kwd>amino acid transporter</kwd><kwd>F508del-CFTR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIHR MOP-97954</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIHR GPG-102171</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bear</surname><given-names>Christine E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000082</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CFC-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bear</surname><given-names>Christine E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Loss of an amino acid transporter and tissue depletion of nitric oxide worsens the intestinal function of CF mice, a finding that potentially explains variation in disease severity amongst CF individuals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal genetic disorder, caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (<italic>CFTR</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kartner et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Riordan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rommens et al., 1989</xref>). The CFTR protein is primarily expressed in epithelial cells lining the airways, intestinal tract, and tubular organs, where its anion channel activity on the apical membrane drives fluid transport and modulates the pH of elaborated fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bear et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quinton, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shah et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">2016b</xref>).

CF mice have growth retardation when compared to their Wt (wild type) littermates, and this has been attributed to malabsorption and decreased secretion of IGF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canale-Zambrano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rogan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Doorninck et al., 1995</xref>).

Hence, SLC6A14-mediated regulation of murine F508del-CFTR occurs at the physiologically relevant temperature.</p><p>SLC6A14-mediated increase in F508del-CFTR function could be achieved through a number of possible mechanisms. The mutant F508del CFTR protein is known to have several defects at the cellular level, including retention in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 1990</xref>), and decreased surface stability of the temperature rescued protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lukacs et al., 1993</xref>). We tested the impact of SLC6A14 on these cellular phenotypes of human F508del CFTR protein, using the BHK heterologous over-expression system. We found that over-expression of SLC6A14 did not affect the processing of the temperature rescued F508del-CFTR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>), nor did it alter the cell surface stability of the rescued protein. Therefore, there was no significant effect of SLC6A14 expression on the processing or stability of human F508del-CFTR. These findings are consistent with the results of our biochemical studies, that failed to provide conclusive support for a direct or indirect interaction between these two membrane proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>, we did not detect reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of the two membrane proteins. These negative results prompted us to test the hypothesis that the positive functional interaction between SLC6A14 and F508del-CFTR as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> may be mediated via intracellular signaling.Â </p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, the SLC6A14 substrate, arginine, is converted to nitric oxide (NO) by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and we found that induced NOS (iNOS) is expressed in mouse colonic tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Nitric oxide is known to exert a positive effect on the functional expression of Wt-CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zaman et al., 2006</xref>). In the current work, we showed nitric oxide (NO) also activates F508del-CFTR channel function. Specifically, the forskolin response measured in split-open organoids from <italic>Cftr</italic><sup>F508del/F508del</sup> mice was enhanced by the NO donor GSNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

We found that the positive effect of arginine on forskolin activated F508del channel function was reduced by pretreatment with the iNOS inhibitor 1400W in organoids derived from <italic>Cftr</italic><sup>F508del/F508del</sup> mice. Further the 1400W sensitive effect of arginine was dependent on SLC6A14 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,c</xref>). Given this initial evidence supporting a role for SLC6A14Â mediated NO signaling in enhancing F508del-CFTR channel function, we were prompted to assess the role of SLC6A14 in NO synthesis.</p><p>In these studies, a fluorescence-based assay was used to measure intracellular NO levels (DAF-FM-DA), in murine intestinal tissue. A standard curve for change in DAF-FM fluorescence to increasing concentrations of NO was generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, colonic epithelial tissue derived from <italic>Slc6a14</italic> knock-out mice exhibited lower constitutive NO levels. Interestingly, while there was an increase in NO production evoked by acute addition of arginine (1 mM) to the apical surface of split-open colonic organoids obtained from wild-type mice, this increase was abrogated in split-open organoids generated from <italic>Slc6a14</italic><sup>(-/y)</sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6eâf</xref>). Altogether, these data show that <italic>Slc6a14</italic>-mediated arginine uptake is important for NO synthesis, and hence NO mediated signaling to the CFTR channel. Conversely, over-expression of <italic>SLC6A14</italic> via lentivirus transduction conferred increased constitutive levels of NO and enhanced the increase in cytosolic NO after addition of arginine to the apical surface of split-open organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6gâi</xref>). Altogether, these data show that <italic>Slc6a14</italic>-mediated arginine uptake is important for NO synthesis, and hence NO mediated signaling to the CFTR channel.</p><p>The effect of the nitric-oxide signaling pathway on PKA-mediated CFTR channel activation has not been studied extensively, but it has been shown that the down-stream signaling molecule, cyclic GMP (cGMP), does lead to enhanced PKG-dependent phosphorylation of CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Picciotto et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tien et al., 1994</xref>). Hence, we were prompted to test the possibility that enhanced intracellular accumulation of NO will induce cGMP-dependent activation of CFTR. We employed the human colonic epithelial cell lineÂ (Caco-2) for these studies, as it is known to express functional CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sood et al., 1992</xref>). Using the ACC assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmadi et al., 2017</xref>), to measure CFTR channel function, we found that PKA-mediated activation of Wt-CFTR function can be enhanced by the NO donors GSNO and SNP, and by the downstream signaling molecule cGMP. This effect of GSNO on PKA-activated CFTR channel function is abolished in presence of protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitors Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS and KT5823 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b,c,d</xref>).

Taken together, we show that SLC6A14-mediated arginine transport can enhance CFTR function via the NO signaling pathway, in Caco-2 cells.</p><p>Finally, we tested the relevance of this signaling pathway in the mutant mice generated in our study. We asked if the reduced F508del-CFTR function measured in the double mutant mice could be overcome by bypassing the need for arginine uptake, and directly modifying F508del-CFTR protein by protein kinase G-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The ACC assay was used to measure F508del-CFTR function in colonic split-open organoids from the double mutant mice, after pre-treatment with 8Br-cGMP or vehicle (control). These studies were conducted at 27Â°C, given the very low levels of F508del-CFTR function that could be measured in colonic tissue derived from these double mutant mice. Interestingly, we found that pre-treatment of split-open organoids from double mutant mice, with membrane permeable cGMP (8Br-cGMP), enhanced forskolin-activated F508del-CFTR channel activity partially towards that observed in tissues from F508del mice with native SLC6A14 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a,b</xref>). As the organoid swelling assay is known to be very sensitive in detecting F508del-CFTR-mediated fluid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dekkers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekkers et al., 2013</xref>), we were encouraged to assess the effect of 8Br-cGMP on forskolin-mediated fluid secretion in colonic organoids from the double mutant mice, at 37Â°C. Importantly, the partial rescue effect induced by 8Br-cGMP pre-treatment was recapitulated at physiological temperature in the organoid swelling assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c,d</xref>). Specifically, pre-treatment of organoids from double mutant mice with cGMP restored forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) to approximately 50% of the swelling measured in F508del-CFTR organoids, at 37Â°C. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that the arginine transport activity of SLC6A14 and the downstream signaling via NO regulated cGMP plays an important role in modifying F508del-CFTR channel function and F508del-CFTR-mediated secretion.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37963.024</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Mutant F508del-CFTR function in double mutant murine organoids can be enhanced by directly enhancing PKG-mediated phosphorylation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Split-open organoids from double mutant (<italic>Cftr</italic><sup>F508del/F508del</sup>; <italic>Slc6a14</italic><sup>(-/y)</sup>) mice were used to perform ACC assay, after low temperature (27Â°C) rescue of the mutant F508del CFTR protein.

This pleiotropic effect supports the hypothesis that it modifies the basic defect responsible for disease in multiple organs, namely the defect in anion conduction. The work in this study focused on the impact of disrupting <italic>Slc6a14</italic> on the CF phenotype in the mouse intestine, because this phenotype has been well described by multiple laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canale-Zambrano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rozmahel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scholte et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Doorninck et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilke et al., 2011</xref>). In support of the above hypothesis, we found that the intestinal phenotypes associated with the primary CF defect in mice, namely defective secretory capacity with thickened smooth muscle, were worsened by disruption of <italic>Slc6a14</italic> expression.</p><p>Interestingly, disruption of <italic>Slc6a14</italic> expression in mice bearing Wt-CFTR did not cause profound changes in colonic morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">IMPC, 2018</xref>), function or mouse survival. These findings confirm previous findings reported by Ganapathy and colleagues, who disrupted <italic>Slc6a14</italic> and did not observe gross changes in mouse health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babu et al., 2015</xref>).

Together, these observations support the hypothesis that this arginine transporter on the apical membrane of colonic epithelium has a dominant role in CFTR regulation rather than nutrient uptake, as amino acid uptake normally occurs in the small intestine.</p><p>Most of our studies of the CF phenotype employed transgenic mice engineered to express the F508del-<italic>Cftr</italic> mutation. In contrast to the consequences of the F508del mutation in the human CFTR protein, the negative consequences of this mutation in folding and assembly of the mouse CFTR protein are somewhat less severe, hence there is residual epithelial expression and function being detected in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scholte et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Doorninck et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilke et al., 2011</xref>). As previously published, this reflects a less deleterious effect of the mutation on the folding, assembly and maturation, such that a significant amount of the mutant mouse protein (still less that wild-type) will reach the surface and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">French et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rozmahel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scholte et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Doorninck et al., 1995</xref>). It was this residual F508del-<italic>Cftr</italic> function that was modulated by <italic>Slc6a14</italic> in the current study. We predict that the extent of modulation by SLC6A14 in the colonic epithelium of CF patients with the F508del mutation will depend on its residual expression levels at the apical membrane of this epithelium, or the abundance of this mutant at the cell surface after correction with Lumacaftor.</p><p>Our findings suggest that the modulation of F508del-CFTR by SLC6A14 is dependent, at least in part, on arginine-mediated NO production and PKG activation. The role of the arginine-NO pathway has been well studied in models of CF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grasemann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grasemann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grasemann and Ratjen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grasemann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oliynyk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poschet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). At the molecular level, it is known that the downstream regulators of this pathway, cGMP and PKG, can enhance wild-type and mutant CFTR channel function and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Golin-Bisello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poschet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vaandrager et al., 1997</xref>). Previous studies of mouse derived intestinal organoids showed that agonists of PKG are effective in enhancing CFTR-mediated organoid swelling, in the absence of agonists of the canonical regulation of CFTR, such as PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pattison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Picciotto et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Seidler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vaandrager et al., 1997</xref>). Our studies confirm the functional significance of this regulatory pathway in murine colon, and further, our findings suggest that PKG-mediated phosphorylation exerts a âprimingâ effect on the canonical PKA-mediated activation of CFTR. There are five sites at which CFTR can be phosphorylated by PKG (NetPhosK v3, consensus strengthÂ &gt;0.5). Two are localized in the regulatory âRâ domain, at position 788 and 795, which overlap with the consensus site for PKA phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pasyk et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the strength of the consensus sites for PKG at position 788 is predicted to exceed that of PKA, and may be preferentially phosphorylated by PKG.</p><p>Both of our assays of regulated F508del-CFTR channel function in colonic tissue lacking SLC6A14 showed that cGMP partially rescued the defects in cAMP-induced channel activation and organoid swelling. However, while significant, this augmentation did not fully restore these functions to those observed in tissues obtained from F508del mice (expressing native <italic>Slc6a14</italic>). Hence, there could be other, yet unidentified, signaling pathways involved in SLC6A14-mediated CFTR modulation. Alternatively, the doubly mutated mice may harbor secondary, chronic consequences, which impact F508del-<italic>Cftr</italic>, and we will assess such consequences in future studies.</p><p>The current findings suggest that upregulation of <italic>Slc6a14</italic> expression and SLC6A14-mediated arginine uptake will ameliorate the disease phenotype associated with <italic>Cftr</italic> mutation. Interestingly, studies by Grasemann and colleagues showed that patients with CF have a decreased concentration of exhaled NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grasemann et al., 1997</xref>), related to decreased nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, increased cellular arginase activity, and decreased arginine bioavailability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grasemann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grasemann and Ratjen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grasemann et al., 2005</xref>). The mechanism underlying decreased arginine bioavailability in CF is unknown, but we propose that this deficit worsens the channel function of the low, residual levels of F508del-CFTR and that increased SLC6A14 expression will offset this deficit.</p><p>An increase in SLC6A14-mediated arginine uptake would be expected to overcome decreased arginine bioavailability in CF tissues, and enhance NO and cGMP-mediated âprimingâ of F508del-CFTR channel activity at the cell surface. Although not specifically tested in this study, we showed in primary cultures of airway epithelium derived from CF patients that bacterial products enhance the expression of <italic>SLC6A14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Paola et al., 2017</xref>). As the bacterial load in the colon of patients will be high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pereira and Berry, 2017</xref>), we expect that SLC6A14 expression will be upregulated and poised to modify any mutant CFTR protein that exhibits residual channel function.

Each loop was injected with 100 ÂµL of buffer (25 mM HEPES, 140 mM sodium chloride, 5.4 mM potassium chloride, 1.8 mM calcium chloride, 0.8 mM magnesium sulfate and 5 mM glucose; pH 7.4; 300 mOsm) supplemented with 1 ÂµCi/mL of L-[2,3-<sup>3</sup>H]-arginine (specific activity of 54.6 Ci/mmol), and 100 ÂµM or 20 mM cold L-arginine. The concentrations of sodium and chloride in this buffer exceed the Kmâs required for transporter activity and likely result in maximum transport via SLC6A14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karunakaran et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>After waiting 15 mins, the loops were opened, and the apical surfaces were flushed with ice-cold buffer (as above) supplemented with 20 mM arginine and lysed with 0.5M NaOH. Following lysis on ice for approximately 1 hr, samples were spun down at 18,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 mins. 12.5 ÂµL of each lysate was added to 2 mL of EcoScint A Scintillation Fluid (Diamed, Switzerland) along with the appropriate controls, and counts were read using a Beckman Scintillation Counter (LS-6000IC). Total lysate protein was determined using a BioRad protein assay. Amount of protein was determined by absorbance (at 595 nm) of a Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye. 10 ÂµL of diluted protein samples (diluted 1:10 and 1:20 in ddH<sub>2</sub>O) was added to 200 ÂµL of dye, and protein concentration was interpolated using a bovine serum albumin (BSA)Â standard curve. Normalized arginine uptake was calculated by dividing scintillation counts per minute (CPM) by the determined protein concentration. The final calculation units used were in CPM per mg/mL of protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Studies of CFTR and F508del-CFTR-mediated swelling of colonic organoids</title><p>Organoids were pre-incubated with a fluorescent live-cell marker, Calcein-AM (20 Î¼M) for 30 min and were removed from the Matrigel matrix by washing the Matrigel dome with ice cold buffer. Organoids were plated into 96-well plate and were centrifuged at 500 <italic>g</italic> and 4Â°C to settle. Organoids were imaged for five mins to establish baseline. CFTR was stimulated with FSKÂ (1 Î¼M). CFTR-mediated fluid secretion measured as FSK-Induced Swelling (FIS) was captured by imaging for 30 mins at 5 min intervals following the addition of FSK, with bright field and fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Epifluorescence/Histology Microscope), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekkers et al., 2013</xref>). Analysis was performed using Cell Profiler v2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Fluorescent images extracted from FIS videos were exported as .TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) files and a pipeline using CellProfiler (Carpenter Lab) was created to analyze the video files. Following manual thresholding (0.1) of background fluorescence and identifying and tracking primary objects (&gt;50 organoids/well) within the diameter limit of 40â150 pixels, the CellProfiler pipeline generated each identified objectsâ area, perimeter, diameter, and radius changes. The change in area (ÎA) relative to baseline (A<sub>0</sub>) was calculated, and the maximum change in ÎA/A<sub>0</sub> within 30 mins of FSK addition was used as a measure of FIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekkers et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Generation of split open organoids</title><p>The organoids were suspended in 10 mL of DMEM/F12 (Dulbeccoâs Modified Eagle Medium with nutrient mixture F12) media and spun down at 500 <italic>g</italic> for 5 mins.

The wells were then allowed to dry in a sterile environment for 2 hr. Thereafter, 200 ÂµL/well of the resuspended organoid culture was pipetted into each well. After 24 hr (Day 2), 100 ÂµL of media was removed from each well and replaced with 100 ÂµL of fresh conditioned media. This promotes spontaneous splitting of the organoids to form a lawn of cells such that the apical membrane is exposed to the medium as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>.

After 24 hr (Day 2), 100 ÂµL of media was removed from each well and replaced with 100 ÂµL of fresh conditioned media. On Day 3, the ACC assay was performed. After 48 hr, split-open 2D lawns were produced, giving access to apical membrane.

The organoids were incubated in DMEM-Dulbeccoâs Modified Eagle Medium (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) with 1 mM L-arginine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). To prepare the organoids for nitric oxide measurements, 200 ÂµL of NaCl buffer (145 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES) containing 7 ÂµM DAF-FM Diacetate (4-Amino-5-Methylamino-2',7'-Difluorofluorescein Diacetate, Cayman Chemical, USA) and 10 ÂµM Calcein Blue AM (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) was added to each well for 1 hr. The organoids were then washed three times with PBS, to wash the dye. The organoids were then kept in the aforementioned NaCl buffer at 37Â°C for 20 mins. Fluorescence was measured using the i3x-Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA), at excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 515 nm respectively for DAF-FM and 360 and 449 respectively for Calcein Blue. After reading baseline fluorescence, 1 mM L-arginine was added to acquire fluorescence of live NO production. The fluorescence measurements were expressed as the change in fluorescence relative to the fluorescence measurement just before arginine addition. To account for the heterogeneity of the organoid cultures, final readouts were expressed as DAF-FM fluorescence/Calcein Blue AM fluorescence. Each condition was repeated with at least four technical replicates on the sample plate, and a total of at least four biological replicates per condition.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ralph DeBerardinis as Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Carol Bertrand (Reviewer #2); Lane Clarke (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper explores the role of the amino acid transporter SLC6A14 in modifying the intestinal phenotype of cystic fibrosis caused by homozygosity of the CFTR delta F508 mutation. The authors find that loss of SLC6A14 reduced arginine abundance in colonic tissue and, when combined with delta F508 homozygosity, led to reduced survival after weaning. SLC6A14 contributes to an arginine-dependent phenotype of CFTR-mediated fluid secretion. The authors provide evidence that this mechanism involves nitric oxide (NO) production by iNOS, which requires arginine as a substrate. NO stimulates protein kinase G-mediated stimulation of CFTR activity and thereby enhances mutant CFTR's secretory activity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, all three reviewers were enthusiastic about the findings of the paper. Three substantive comments are listed below. In addition, one reviewer suggested that confirmation of some of these observations in primary human colonic tissue would strengthen the paper.</p><p>1) In Figure 8, the authors show that a permeable form of cGMP can enhance FSK-stimulated CFTR activity. This instructive experiment should be complemented by an experiment that more fully tests the model. In F508del/SLC6A14 WT organoids, do NO donors, in the absence of Arg, also stimulate CFTR activity, and can this be blocked by PKG inhibitors?</p><p>2) SLC6A14 is a Na- and Cl-dependent transporter, but the impact of luminal electrolyte concentration on amino acid uptake was not tested or discussed. This is important in the context of CFTR, as mutation-dependent changes in the near membrane chloride concentration may occur, and evidence suggests that removal of chloride substantially impairs amino acid uptake (i.e., Anderson et al., 2008). The majority of functional assays were performed in the presence of 140 mM NaCl, which likely results in maximum transport. Any available experiments or, at a minimum, citation of literature regarding the ion dependence should be presented in the context of how aberrant Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion might impact transport.</p><p>3) A technical concern is raised with the ex vivo loop assay for assessing intestinal arginine uptake (subsection âEx vivo closed loop amino acid uptake assayâ: Figure 3E and 3F). From the appearance of colonic sections shown in Figure 3A and 3B, distinct morphological differences are apparent in the volume of mucosa vs. the combined volume of submucosal and smooth muscle in the F508del Â± <italic>Slc6a14</italic> knockout as compared to WT genotypes. Since the assay reports arginine CPM/mg/ml protein from protein isolates of whole intestine, the mucosal protein as a fraction of total protein is likely less in the F508del Â± <italic>Slc6a14</italic> knockout as compared to WT genotypes, thereby accentuating the purported decrease in uptake in the F508del CFTR cohorts. Since the authors have tissue volumes of the different genotypes (measured by 3DHISTECH), a calculation of these differences would indicate whether there is potential for a significant error in the arginine uptake data. If so, arginine uptake needs a different normalization standard or correction by mathematical means.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37963.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, all three reviewers were enthusiastic about the findings of the paper.

In triplicate organoid platings, we showed that the NO donor: GSNO stimulated residual F508del channel function in the absence of arginine (subsection âLoss of <italic>Slc6a14</italic> and arginine-mediated nitric oxide generation contributes to worsening of defective epithelial fluid secretionâ, fifth paragraph, plus Figure 6âfigure supplement 2).</p><p>We showed the role of PKG in this NO effect in split open organoids prepared from the human colonic, CaCo-2 cell line bearing Wt-CFTR (Figure 7). The use of this cell line enabled a mid-throughput study comparing multiple interventions: an inhibitor of iNOS, two different NO donors and modulation of GSK using two chemically distinct small molecules. In our revision, we highlighted the importance of these detailed, mechanistic studies in CaCo-2 cells for supporting relevance in humans and validating the steps in our proposed signaling pathway (subsection âLoss of <italic>Slc6a14</italic> and arginine-mediated nitric oxide generation contributes to worsening of defective epithelial fluid secretionâ, seventh paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) SLC6A14 is a Na- and Cl-dependent transporter, but the impact of luminal electrolyte concentration on amino acid uptake was not tested or discussed.

According to the literature, the K<sub>M</sub> (Na<sup>+</sup>) is 10-20 mM and the K<sub>M</sub> (Cl<sup>-</sup>) is 1-2 mM for SLC6A14 (Karunakaran et al., 2011). Electrolyte concentrations in the stool have been estimated at 5-38 mM (Comparison of the composition of faecal fluid in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis Gut, 1982,23,326-332) and not expected to be limiting to the activity of the SLC6A14 transporter. In our functional studies of the transporter we exceeded these stool electrolyte concentrations in both the closed loop assay (140 mM NaCl) and in the ACC assay of split open organoids (38 mM NaCl). Therefore, we have likely modeled maximal transport efficiency in both systems. These considerations have been included in the revised version of our manuscript (subsection âEx vivo closed loop amino acid uptake assayâ, first paragraph and subsection âApical Chloride Conductance (ACC) Assay for CFTR in âsplit-openâ organoidsâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A technical concern is raised with the ex vivo loop assay for assessing intestinal arginine uptake (subsection âEx vivo closed loop amino acid uptake assayâ: Figure 3E and 3F).

In the revised version we include a statement regarding the lack of effect of SLC6A14 knockout on morphology (Discussion, third paragraph). Our findings are substantiated by recent phenotypic data generated by the NorComm2 Phenotyping consortium through which these mice were created (reference in the aforementioned paragraph). Therefore, the decrease in arginine uptake associated with knockout of SLC6A14 is not reflecting a change in tissue morphology.</p></body></sub-article></article>
