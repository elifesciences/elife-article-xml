have been reported to be mutually exclusive in most brain regions. In juvenile and adult neocortex, Nav1.1 is predominantly expressed in inhibitory neurons while Nav1.2 is in excitatory neurons. Although a distinct subpopulation of layer V (L5) neocortical excitatory neurons were also reported to express Nav1.1, their nature has been uncharacterized. In hippocampus, Nav1.1 has been proposed to be expressed only in inhibitory neurons. By using newly generated transgenic mouse lines expressing <italic>Scn1a</italic> promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP), here we confirm the mutually exclusive expressions of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 and the absence of Nav1.1 in hippocampal excitatory neurons. We also show that Nav1.1 is expressed in inhibitory and a subpopulation of excitatory neurons not only in L5 but all layers of neocortex. By using neocortical excitatory projection neuron markers including FEZF2 for L5 pyramidal tract (PT) and TBR1 for layer VI (L6) cortico-thalamic (CT) projection neurons, we further show that most L5 PT neurons and a minor subpopulation of layer II/III (L2/3) cortico-cortical (CC) neurons express Nav1.1 while the majority of L6 CT, L5/6 cortico-striatal (CS), and L2/3 CC neurons express Nav1.2. These observations now contribute to the elucidation of pathological neural circuits for diseases such as epilepsies and neurodevelopmental disorders caused by <italic>SCN1A</italic> and <italic>SCN2A</italic> mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SCN1A</kwd><kwd>SCN2A</kwd><kwd>pyramidal

in the generation and propagation of action potentials, contributing to excitability and information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Catterall, 2012</xref>). They consist of one main pore-forming alpha- and one or two subsidiary beta-subunits that regulate kinetics or subcellular trafficking of the alpha subunits. Human has nine alpha (Nav1.1–Nav1.9) and four beta (beta-1–beta-4) subunits. Among alphas, Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6, encoded by <italic>SCN1A</italic>, <italic>SCN2A</italic>, <italic>SCN3A</italic>, and <italic>SCN8A</italic>, respectively, are expressed in central nervous system. <italic>SCN3A</italic> is mainly expressed embryonically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brysch et al., 1991</xref>), and <italic>SCN1A</italic>, <italic>SCN2A</italic>, and <italic>SCN8A</italic> are major alphas after birth. Although these three genes show mutations in a wide spectrum of neurological diseases such as epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability, two of those, <italic>SCN1A</italic> and <italic>SCN2A</italic>, are major ones (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamakawa, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meisler et al., 2021</xref>). To understand the circuit basis of these diseases, it is indispensable to know the detailed distributions of these molecules in the brain.</p><p>We previously reported that expressions of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 seem to be mutually exclusive in many brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamagata et al., 2017</xref>). In adult neocortex and hippocampus, Nav1.1 is dominantly expressed in medial ganglionic eminence-derived parvalbumin-positive (PV-IN) and somatostatin-positive (SST-IN) inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lorincz and Nusser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogiwara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamagata et al., 2017</xref>). In the neocortex, some amount of Nav1.1 is also expressed in a distinct subset of layer V (L5) excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogiwara et al., 2013</xref>), but their natures were unknown. In the hippocampus, Nav1.1 seems to be expressed in inhibitory but not in excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogiwara et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, a major amount of Nav1.2 (~95%) is expressed in excitatory neurons including the most of neocortical and all of hippocampal ones, and a minor amount is expressed in caudal ganglionic eminence-derived inhibitory neurons such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-positive ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lorincz and Nusser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamagata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ogiwara et al., 2018</xref>). However, a recent study reported that a subpopulation (more than half) of VIP-positive inhibitory neurons is Nav1.1-positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goff and Goldberg, 2019</xref>).</p><p>VGSCs are mainly localized at axons and therefore it is not always easy to identify their origins, the soma. To overcome this, here in this study we generated bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse lines that express GFP under the control of <italic>Scn1a</italic> promoters, and we carefully investigated the GFP/Nav1.1 distribution in mouse brain. Our analysis confirmed that expressions of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 are mutually exclusive and that in neocortex Nav1.1 is expressed in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons while in hippocampus only in inhibitory but totally absent in excitatory neurons. Furthermore by using a transcription factor FEZF2 (FEZ family zinc finger protein 2 transcriptional factor), also referred to as Fezl, Fez1, Zfp312, and Fez, as a marker for L5 pyramidal tract (PT) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Molyneaux et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lodato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matho et al., 2021</xref>), and a transcription factor TBR1 which suppresses FEZF2 expression and therefore does not overlap with FEZF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McKenna et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matho et al., 2021</xref>), we found that most of L5 FEZF2-positive neurons are GFP-positive while L5/6 TBR1-positive neurons are largely GFP-negative and Nav1.2-positive. These results proposed that Nav1.1 is expressed in L5 PT while Nav1.2 in L5/6 non-PT neurons such as L5/6 cortico-striatal (CS) and L6 cortico-thalamic (CT) projection neurons. A majority of L2/3 excitatory neurons express Nav1.2 but a minor subpopulation are GFP-positive, suggesting that most of cortico-cortical (CC) projection neurons express Nav1.2 but the distinct minor population express Nav1.1. These results refine the expression loci of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 in the brain and should contribute to the understanding of circuit mechanisms for diseases caused by <italic>SCN1A</italic> and <italic>SCN2A</italic> mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and verification of <italic>Scn1a-</italic>GFP transgenic mouse lines</title><p><italic>Scn1a</italic>-GFP founder mice were generated from C57BL/6J zygotes microinjected with a modified <italic>Scn1a</italic>-GFP BAC construct harboring all, upstream and downstream, <italic>Scn1a</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakayama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (see Materials and methods for details).

Of note, somata of dentate granule cells were apparently GFP-negative. CA1–3 pyramidal cells were twined around with fibrous GFP immunosignals. We previously reported that the fibrous Nav1.1 signals clinging to somata of hippocampal CA1–3 pyramidal cells were disappeared by conditional elimination of Nav1.1 in PV-INs but not in excitatory neurons, and therefore concluded that these Nav1.1-immunopositive fibers are axon terminals of PV-INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogiwara et al., 2013</xref>). As such, GFP signals are fibrous but do not form cell shapes in the CA pyramidal cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, G, K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, G</xref>), and therefore these CA pyramidal cells themselves are assumed to be GFP-negative.

All Nav1.1-positive cells were GFP-positive. Reversely all GFP-positive cells were also Nav1.1-positive in the hippocampus, but in the neocortex only a half of GFP-positive cells were Nav1.1-positive. This is largely because in the hippocampus Nav1.1 expression is restricted to inhibitory neurons, but in the neocortex Nav1.1 is expressed not only in inhibitory but also in a subpopulation of excitatory neurons in which Nav1.1 expression is low and not easily detected immunohistochemically by anti-Nav1.1 antibodies. In neocortex, one-third of GFP-positive cells were GABAergic cells such as PV-INs and SST-INs, and the remaining two-third were excitatory neurons. GFP signals were especially intense in PV-positive cells indicating strong Nav1.1 expression in those cells, while GFP signals in SST-positive cells were similar to those in excitatory neurons. In addition, extensive immunostaining analyses using projection neuron markers FEZF2 and TBR1 together with anti-Nav1.2 antibody also revealed that most L5 PT neurons and a minor subpopulation of L2/3 CC neurons express Nav1.1 while the majority of L6 CT, L5/6 CS, and L2/3 CC neurons express Nav1.2.</p><p>The above observations should contribute to understanding of neural circuits responsible for diseases such as epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders caused by <italic>SCN1A</italic> and <italic>SCN2A</italic> mutations. Dravet syndrome is a sporadic intractable epileptic encephalopathy characterized by early onset (6 months to 1 year after birth) epileptic seizures, intellectual disability, autistic features, ataxia, and increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). De novo loss-of-function mutations of <italic>SCN1A</italic> are found in more than 80% of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Claes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sugawara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujiwara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dravet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Depienne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meng et al., 2015</xref>). In mice, loss-of-function <italic>Scn1a</italic> mutations caused clinical features reminiscent of Dravet syndrome, including early-onset epileptic seizures, hyperactivity, learning and memory deficits, reduced sociability and ataxic gaits and premature sudden death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oakley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalume et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ito et al., 2013</xref>).

It is thus plausible that Nav1.1 haplo-deficiency in PV-IN plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of many clinical aspects of Dravet syndrome. Notably, mice with selective Nav1.1 reduction in global inhibitory neurons were at a greater risk of lethal seizure than heterozygote null mice (Nav1.1 KO/+), and the mortality risk of mice with Nav1.1 haplo-deficiency in inhibitory neurons was significantly decreased or improved with additional Nav1.1 reduction in dorsal telencephalic excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogiwara et al., 2013</xref>). These observations indicate beneficial effects of Nav1.1 deficiency in excitatory neurons for epileptic seizures and sudden death. Because of the absence of Nav1.1 in hippocampal excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogiwara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamagata et al., 2017</xref>) and the present study, the ameliorating effect was most possibly caused by Nav1.1 haploinsufficiency in neocortical excitatory neurons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalume et al., 2013</xref> reported that parasympathetic hyperactivity is observed in Nav1.1 haplo-deficient mice and it causes ictal bradycardia and finally result in seizure-associated sudden death.</p><p>Our present finding of Nav1.1 expression in L5 PT projection neurons which innervate the vagus nerve may possibly elucidate the ameliorating effects of Nav1.1 haploinsufficiency in neocortical excitatory neurons for sudden death of Nav1.1 haplo-deficient mice and may contribute to the understanding of the neural circuit for SUDEP in patients with Dravet syndrome.

This mouse line provides a valuable resource, especially for epilepsy and autism research, as it offers a reliable tool that can be used to identify specific cell populations that potentially cause disease-related symptoms such as seizures, ataxia, sociability deficits, learning and memory problems, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87495.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Antoine</surname><given-names>Michelle</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02jzrsm59</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.03.31.437794">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.437794v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Priscilla Kolibea Mante (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1. For figure 1, please add a figure showing quantification for GFP and endogenous SCN1A protein levels in WT and BAC transgenic animals, with preferably more than four animals in each group. This quantification will strengthen the claim that endogenous levels of Scn1a are not altered (increased/decreased) in your BAC mouse.</p><p>2. To substantiate the statements of figure1E-F, please quantify and apply the relevant statistical analyses for the double-staining of endogenous Nav1.1 and Scn1a-GFP at the AISs, using robust sampling such as &gt;40 AISs per region, and from multiple animals. This quantification can be added to the results proportion of the manuscript.</p><p>3. In the neocortex (Figure 2B, F, J), GFP-positive cells do not appear to be sparsely distributed throughout all cortical layers. Please include counts of the number of (GFP+ NeuN+/ NeuN) cells across the cortical layers for either the 184 or 233 BAC line.</p><p>4. The data in Figure 3 is not convincing as it is not a fair comparison of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 expression in the AIS. Namely because GFP is mostly somatic while Nav1.2 is primarily in the AIS. Please provide quantification with relevant statistical analyses of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 co-expression in AISs. One approach would be triple- immunostaining for Nav1.1, Nav1.2 and ankyrin, with appropriate samples sizes and replication.</p><p>5. The authors assume that the FEZF2 and TBR1 positive neurons that are GFP negative are Nav1.2 positive. Please apply triple-immunolabeling for (a) FEZF2, GFP and NAV1.2 and (b) TBR1, GFP and NAV1.2, with quantification and the relevant statistical analyses, to determine the proportion of FEZF2+ and TBR1+ neurons that are both GFP- and Nav1.2+ at either P15 or P28 for cortical layers 2/3, 5 and 6.</p><p>6. Please either remove Figure 6 or provide quantitative data to support the conclusions of the figure. This quantitative data may include a viral- based strategy to label, PT, CC(a-c), CT and iCS neuronal subsets. Followed by quantifications for each virally-labeled cell type for: Nav1.1+FEZF2+; Nav1.1-FEZF2+; Nav1.1+TBR1+; Nav1.1-TBR1+; Nav1.2+FEZF2+; Nav1.2-FEZF2+; Nav1.2+TBR1+; Nav1.2-TBR1+ neurons.</p><p>7. Please remove all references to how SUDEP might happen in Dravet Syndrome, including Figure 7. Although the hypothesis proposed is intriguing, this section weakens the paper, as it is purely speculative and not directly supported by the data presented in the manuscript.</p><p>8. For Supplemental figure 1, please add quantifications for the populations of PV+GFP+ and SST+GFP+ neurons in the neocortex and hippocampal regions analyzed in Supplementary figure 1. This data may provide quantitative support for the statement that all GFP cells in the hippocampus are inhibitory.</p><p>9. For Supplemental figure S2, please add to the figure, quantification and the relevant statistical analyses, for AIS quantifications of Nav 1.2+ ankyrin+ TBR1+, Nav 1.2- ankyrin+ TBR1+, Nav1.1+ ankyrin+ TBR1+, Nav1.1- ankyrin+ TBR1+ neurons.</p><p>10. Please specify in the methods section:</p><p>1. How many sections were reviewed per animal per age.</p><p>2. How many images per section.</p><p>3. Please clearly specify the brain region where sections and images originated.</p><p>4. Please indicate in each case whether the sections are sagittal or coronal.</p><p>11. Please review all the comments from the three manuscript referees to identify areas within the manuscript where grammatical errors and mislabeling of figures were observed. These errors must be corrected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. This manuscript contains numerous, very long sentences that are difficult to read and understand. Some examples are included below.</p><p>A. This sentence is too long.</p><p>Kalume and colleagues (2013) reported that sudden death in Nav1.1 haplo-deficient mice occurred immediately after generalized tonic-clonic seizures and ictal bradycardia or slower heart rate, that the cardiac and sudden death phenotypes were reproduced in mice with forebrain GABAergic neuron-specific, but not cardiac neuron-specific heterozygous elimination of Scn1a, and that the ictal bradycardia and sudden death were suppressed by atropine, a competitive antagonist for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and therefore counteracts against parasympathetic nervous system.</p><p>B. This sentence is too long.</p><p>Here in this study we revealed that Nav1.1 is expressed in PT neurons. Together with the above mentioned parasympathetic hyperactivity (Kalume et al., 2013) and the ameliorating effect of Nav1.1 haploinsufficiency in neocortical excitatory excitatory neurons (Ogiwara et al., 2013) observed in the sudden death of Nav1.1 haplo-deficient mice, the pathological neural circuit was assumed to be as follows, &quot;Nav1.1 haploinsufficiency in neocortical PV-IN fails to suppress and therefore activates PT neurons as well as subsequent parasympathetic neurons and consequently suppresses heart activity and results in cardiac arrest&quot; (Figure 7), in which Nav1.1 is remained in full amount in PT neurons of the mice with inhibitory neurons-specific haploelimination of Nav1.1 and therefore the lethality of the mice was further aggravated.</p><p>2. This manuscript contain some sentences that utilize the same words multiple times in one sentence. An example is included below.</p><p>A. In contrast, a major amount of Nav1.2 (~95%) is expressed in excitatory neurons including the major population of neocortical and all of hippocampal ones, and a minor amount is expressed in caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE)-derived inhibitory neurons such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-positive ones (VIP-IN) (Lorincz and Nusser 2010; Yamagata et al., 2017; Ogiwara et al., 2018), however a recent study reported that a subpopulation (mostly half) of VIP-IN are Nav1.1-positive (Goff and Goldberg, 2019).</p><p>3. Please see additional suggested edits below.</p><p>A. Please edit the title to Figure 3 to state GFP-positive cells.</p><p>B. The word &quot;mimicking&quot; is misspelt in the sentence below.</p><p>We therefore performed immunohistochemical investigations of Nav1.1-mimicing GFP signals in Scn1a-GFP mice by using FEZF2 and TBR1 as projection neuron markers (Figure 4 and Figure 5).</p><p>C. Fluorescence imaging showed relatively intense GFP signals in the caudal brain portions (Figure 1D), which is well consistent with the previously reported regional distribution of Nav1.1 protein and Scn1a mRNA in wild-type mouse brain (Ogiwara et al., 2007).</p><p>D. In the sentence below, consider the use of another segue word than instead.</p><p>Instead, most AISs of TBR1-positive neurons are Nav1.2-positive (Supplemental figure S2).</p><p>E. The meaning of the sentence below is unclear and should be re-written.</p><p>A majority of neocortical excitatory projection neurons in L5 consist of pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic cortico-striatal (iCS) neurons, here we define iCS rather than CS because PT also occasionally innervate striatum, and those in L6 are mostly cortico-thalamic (CT) neurons (Shepherd, 2013).</p><p>Science Comments</p><p>1. In Figure 1B the β-tubulin blot does not appear to be a re-probe of the blot for Nav1.1 as the lanes for the β-tubulin blot are not clearly visible.</p><p>2. Using western blot or a similar technique, please quantify GFP and SCN1A protein levels in multiple (n&gt;8-10) WT and BAC transgenic animals. This quantification will strengthen the claim that endogenous levels of Scn1a are not altered (increased/decreased) in your BAC mouse.</p><p>3. This statement is unfounded from the images.</p><p>&quot;Immunohistochemical double-staining of Nav1.1 and GFP revealed Nav1.1-signals at axon initial segments (AISs) of most neocortical and hippocampal GFP-positive cells (Figure 1E, F)&quot;.</p><p>Please quantify the double-staining of Nav 1.1 and GFP at the AISs in a subset ( ~100 cells per region in 4-5 mice) of neocortical and hippocampal neurons.</p><p>4. Please include matched images i.e. at the same brain level for Figure 2A and Figure 2E.</p><p>5. The GFP-positive cells do not appear to be sparsely distributed throughout all cortical layers. Please include counts for the number of (GFP+ NeuN+/ NeuN) cells across the cortical layers for either the 184 or 233 S.</p><p>6. Only chromogenic staining seemed to be shown for both the 184 and 233 Scn1a-GFP lines. Thus, please re-write the sentence below:</p><p>The Scn1a-GFP lines #184 and 233 showed a similar distribution of GFP-signals, immuno-reactive and fluorescent signals as well, across the entire brain (Figure 1C, 2A-L).</p><p>as:</p><p>The Scn1a-GFP lines #184 and 233 showed a similar distribution of chromogenic GFP-signals across the entire brain (Figure 1C, 2A-D, 2E-2H).</p><p>7. Please replace this statement: These data indicate that GFP signals in the Scn1a-GFP lines faithfully reflect endogenous Scn1a/Nav1.1 expression.</p><p>with</p><p>These data indicate that GFP signals in the Scn1a-GFP lines may phenocopy endogenous Scn1a/Nav1.1 expression in the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum.</p><p>8. The data in figure 3 is not convincing as it is difficult to distinguish the AIS of GFP- positive and non-GFP positive cells. Thus, it is unclear whether the AISs of GFP-positive cells are Nav1.2-negative.</p><p>9. In figures S1A, S1E, and S1AF, some cells with &quot;dense&quot; and &quot;less intense&quot; staining appear to be stained for GFP and an inhibitory marker. Likewise, some cells have prominent GFP staining but are not labeled for either SST or PV. To strengthen your claim, the data presented in supplementary figure S1 should include quantification of brain slices that are triple labeled for PV, SST and GFP. Cell counts should then be included for the fraction of GFP cells that are PV+ and SST+.</p><p>10. Objective and quantitative definitions for &quot;dense&quot; and &quot;less&quot; intense&quot; GFP staining should be established. Next, the fraction of inhibitory, and excitatory cells that have &quot;dense&quot; and &quot;less&quot; intense&quot; GFP staining should been quantified. Without such criteria, it is difficult to conclude that FEZF2 or TBR1 signals were found in cells with less intense GFP signals.</p><p>11. Please provide quantification to support the statement made in the manuscript that most AISs of TBR1-positive neurons are Nav1.2-positive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There is an excessive use of abbreviations which makes the reading of both the results and the discussion quite difficult. This can be minimized as much as possible.</p><p>The arrow heads in Figure 3 do not clearly point towards what authors indicate they are pointing towards.</p><p>Figure 3 shows that Nav1.2 is not expressed in the axon initial segments of GRP-positive cells in the cortex and other brain regions. Indeed the authors state that data for the &quot;other brain regions&quot; are not shown but it will be great if they could mention of some of these brain regions.</p><p>The authors state that &quot;most AIS of TBRI-positive neurons are Nav1.2 positive&quot; and go on to show only one supplemental figure (Supplemental Figure S2). The conclusions drawn from Figure 5 and Figure 6 were supported by percentage expression patterns in Supplemental Table 1. The authors should include a similar supplementary table to support the data shown in Supplemental Figure S2, since a conclusive statement is being made from that figure.</p><p>There are a few grammatical errors that need addressing:</p><p>Page 5 Paragraph 1: &quot;Human has nine alphas (Nav1.1~Nav1.9) and four betas (β-1~β-4).&quot;</p><p>Results Paragraph 2: &quot;….and GFP fluorescent signals are well negative in CA pyramidal and Dentate granule cells…..&quot;</p><p>Results Paragraph 4: &quot;We therefore examined whether Nav1.2 is expressed in of cells expressing GFP and found that…..&quot;</p><p>Results, Final Paragraph: The first sentence needs a rewrite. The use of &quot;mostly half&quot; is inappropriate and does not lend to understanding. The last sentence also needs a rewrite &quot;…..the remained Nav1.1-negative are assumed to be…&quot;</p><p>Discussion: The last two paragraphs of the discussion could benefit from a rewrite which seeks to simplify the ideas being conveyed. These are really long sentences which reduce clarity of the statements being made. There are also multiple grammatical errors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This new transgenic mice is very exciting and an important contribution to the field of epilepsy mechanisms.</p><p>My main suggestion for the manuscript is to remove the portion about how SUDEP might happen in Dravet Syndrome, including Figure 7. This section is purely speculative and is not necessary for the main objectives of the paper: Presenting the transgenic mouse model and further characterizing the excitatory cortical neurons in which Nav1.1 is expressed. I think the hypothesis proposed is intriguing, and as mentioned in the public review the transgenic mice will be useful in future experiments testing it. But right now I feel it weakens the paper by ending on a note that is not directly supported by the data presented in the manuscript (we don't see confirmation that the problem is cortical disinhibition and not dysfunction of hypothalamic neurons that also express Nav1.1 and would represent the bulk of input to the autonomic brainstem centers with the corticobulbar projections representing a minority and might even just go to the portion of the nucleus ambiguus in charge of pharyngeal muscles).</p><p>While I agree with the authors that statistical methods are not necessary for a characterization study, the methods section would benefit from additional details. How many sections were reviewed per animal per age? How many images per section? There is a mention in the Results section of the FEZF2 neurons being quantified in the primary motor cortex. Were all images taken in this region? Were the sections sagital or coronal?</p><p>The subheading &quot;Nav1.1 is expressed in pyramidal tract while Nav1.2 in cortico-striatal and cortico-thalamic projection neurons&quot; of the Results section would benefit from a quick review of the main projections from each layer at the top. Referring to figure 6 earlier would also make it easier for the reader to follow the results presented later in the section. Figure 6 is a great way to summarize the main points of the latter experiments by the way.</p><p>The authors assume that the FEZF2 and TBR1 positive neurons that are GFP negative are Nav1.2 positive. I assume this was not confirmed experimentally because the antibody for both transcription factors and Nav1.2 are all rabbit derived, but if other antibodies are available this would be an important point to confirm through IHC.</p><p>I would suggest doing a double labelling of PV and SST in Supplemental Figure 1 to show that all GFP cells in the hippocampus are inhibitory.</p><p>In Figure 1, it looks like the left arrowhead in the GFP panel of E is right on top of the neuron's AIS; unlike in the Merge panel where the neurons seems to be completely to the right of the arrowhead</p><p>In figure 2, the stratum pyramidale in CA1 and CA3 od panel C seems to have a lot of background and it is very hard to see the truly positive cells</p><p>In Figure 3, because the GFP is mostly somatic and Nav1.2/ankyrin G are located in the AIS, the current magnification of the figure makes it difficult to interpret. Consider using the same magnification as in Figure 1 panels E and F. With the current magnification it seems like one cell in the top left corner is positive for both GFP and Nav1.2</p><p>In the legend of Figure 5 for consistency keep the order of labeling consistent when describing the arrows and asterisks (i.e. mention the GFP status first in all of them). In the description of the asterisks it mentions CFP/TBR1-double positive cells. That CFP should be GFP.</p><p>In Supplemental Table S1 please add the conventions for the a, b, and c superscripts. For consistency remove the line between P15 and 4W in the L2/3 rows and consider adding a line between the L5 and L6 rows.</p><p>There are occasional grammar and misspelling issues throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87495.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1.

Of note, all cells with Nav1.1-positive AISs or somata were GFP-positive, but AISs or somata for only half of GFP-positive cells were Nav1.1-positive (Figure 4D and Supplementary tables S3, S4), possibly due to undetectably low levels of Nav1.1 immunosignals in a subpopulation of GFP-positive cells.”</p><p>Lines #181-189 at the Results section;</p><p>“In contrast to the neocortex where only half of GFP-positive cells were Nav1.1-positive, in the hippocampus all GFP-positive cells were Nav1.1-positive and all Nav1.1-positive cells were GFP-positive (Figure 5).

However, we noticed that sparsely-distributed cells with intense GFP-signals, which are assumed to be PV-INs (see Figure 8), were often NeuN-negative (Supplementary figure S5A – arrowheads), reminiscent of a previous report that NeuN expression is absent in cerebellar inhibitory neurons such as Golgi, basket and satellite cells in cerebellum (Weyer et al., 2003).

Of note, all cells with Nav1.1-positive AISs or somata were GFP-positive, but AISs or somata for only half of GFP-positive cells were Nav1.1-positive (Figure 4D and Supplementary tables S3, S4), possibly due to undetectably low levels of Nav1.1 immunosignals in a subpopulation of GFP-positive cells. The above ratios of GFP-positive cells among neurons (cells with ankyrinG-positive AISs) obtained in the triple-immunostaining of Nav1.1, GFP and ankyrinG are rather discordant to those obtained in the later experiment of triple-immunostaining of Nav1.2, GFP and ankyrinG, 23% (L2/3), 30% (L5) and 21% (L6) (see Figure 11). Therefore, we additionally performed double-immunostaining of GFP and ankyrinG on brains of <italic>Scn1a</italic>-GFP mouse at P15, and the ratios of of GFP-positive cells among neurons were 30% (L2/3), 26% (L5) and 9% (L6) (Supplementary figure S6 and Supplementary table S5). Averaged ratios of GFP-positive cells among neurons of Figures 4D, 11B and Supplementary figure S6B are 23% (L2/3), 26% (L5) and 13% (L6) (Supplementary figure S7 and Supplementary table S6), which are actually significantly lower than those obtained in the NeuN-staining (Supplementary figure S5 and Supplementary table S1).”</p><p>Line #502-504 at the Materials and methods section;</p><p>&quot;Following antibodies were used to detect GFP, Nav1.1, Nav1.2, TBR1, FEZF2, ankyrinG, NeuN, parvalbumin and somatostatin; …”</p><p>Line #510-511 at the Materials and methods section;</p><p>&quot;… mouse anti-NeuN biotin conjugated antibody (1:2,000; MAB377B, Millipore), …”</p><p>Line #515-516 at the Materials and methods section;</p><p>&quot;To detect NeuN, Alexa-647 conjugated streptavidin (1:1,000; S21374, Thermo Fisher Science) was used.&quot;</p><p>Lines #520-534 at the Materials and methods section;</p><p>&quot;Fluorescence and Immunofluorescence quantification</p><p>For quantification of inhibitory neurons in GFP-positive cells, we used <italic>Scn1a</italic>-GFP/<italic>Vgat</italic>-Cre/<italic>Rosa26</italic>-tdTomamto mice at 4W.

To further confirm it, here we performed triple immunostaining for Nav1.1, Nav1.2 and ankyrinG, and counted Nav1.1- or Nav1.2-immunopositive AISs in the neocortex of <italic>Scn1a</italic>-GFP mice (Figure 10). The staining again showed that Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 expressions are mutually exclusive in brain regions including neocortex (Figure 10A). The counting revealed that 5% (L2/3), 6% (L5) and 3% (L6) of AISs at P15 were Nav1.1-positive and 78% (L2/3), 69% (L5) and 69% (L6) of AISs at P15 were Nav1.2-positive in the neocortex (Figure 10B and Supplementary table S17). Of note, less than 0.5% of AISs are Nav1.1/Nav1.2-double positive confirming that Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 do not co-express.

As such, GFP signals are fibrous but do not form cell shapes in the CA pyramidal cell layer (Figures 2C, G, K and Supplementary figures S2C, G), and therefore these CA pyramidal cells themselves are assumed to be GFP-negative.

This section is purely speculative and is not necessary for the main objectives of the paper: Presenting the transgenic mouse model and further characterizing the excitatory cortical neurons in which Nav1.1 is expressed. I think the hypothesis proposed is intriguing, and as mentioned in the public review the transgenic mice will be useful in future experiments testing it. But right now I feel it weakens the paper by ending on a note that is not directly supported by the data presented in the manuscript (we don't see confirmation that the problem is cortical disinhibition and not dysfunction of hypothalamic neurons that also express Nav1.1 and would represent the bulk of input to the autonomic brainstem centers with the corticobulbar projections representing a minority and might even just go to the portion of the nucleus ambiguus in charge of pharyngeal muscles).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer's comment and therefore eliminated the discussion for Figure 7 and SUDEP from the revised manuscript as we responded to the Essential Revisions: Editor's comment #7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While I agree with the authors that statistical methods are not necessary for a characterization study, the methods section would benefit from additional details.

In the neocortex at 4W, 23% (L2/3), 28% (L5) and 27% (L6) of GFP-positive cells were Tomato-positive inhibitory neurons and 73% (L2/3), 77% (L5) and 83% (L6) of Tomato-positive cells were GFP-positive (Figure 7C and Supplementary tables S9, S10). These results suggest that a significant subpopulation of neocortical excitatory neurons also express Nav1.1. Our previous observation that Nav1.1 is expressed in callosal axons of neocortical excitatory neurons (Ogiwara et al., 2013) supports that a subpopulation of L2/3 CC neurons express Nav1.1. Unlike in neocortex, in the hippocampus most of GFP-positive cells were Tomato-positive, 98% (CA1) and 94% (DG), and majorities of Tomato-positive GABAergic neurons are GFP-positive, 93% (CA1) and 77% (DG). These results further confirmed that in hippocampus Nav1.1 is expressed in inhibitory neurons but not in excitatory neurons. Although somata of pyramidal cells in CA2/3 region are weakly GFP-positive in this and some other experiments (Figure 7B, Supplementary figure S2G), those were GFP-negative in other experiments (Figures 2K, 5A, D) and therefore the Nav1.1 expression in CA2/3 pyramidal cells would be minimal if any.</p><p>We further performed immunohistochemical staining of PV and SST in neocortex and hippocampus of <italic>Scn1a</italic>-GFP mice at 4W (Figure 8). PV and SST do not co-express in cells and do not overlap. PV-INs and SST-INs were both GFP-positive, and especially GFP signals in PV-INs were intense (Figure 8A). Cell counting revealed that 21% (L2/3), 37% (L5), 37% (L6), 58% (CA1), 42% (CA2/3), and 41% (DG) of GFP-positive cells were PV or SST-positive depending on regions in neocortex and hippocampus (Figure 8B and Supplementary tables S11-S13). All PV-INs were GFP-positive (Figure 8B – middle), and most of SST-INs were GFP-positive (Figure 8B – right). Comparison of these results with those of <italic>Vgat</italic>-Cre mouse (Figure 7) suggests that GFP-positive GABAergic neurons in neocortex are mostly PV- or SST-positive, while in hippocampus a half of those are PV/SST-negative GABAergic neurons. Higher ratios of PV- or SST-positive cells (Figure 8B) compared with those of <italic>Vgat</italic>-Cre-positive cells (Figure 7C) among GFP-positive cells would be explained by that we counted PV-positive cells even if their PV-immunosignals are moderate and a significant subpopulation of such cells are known to be excitatory neurons (Jinno et al., 2004; Tanahira et al., 2009; Matho et al., 2021). Quantitative analysis of GFP signal intensity and area size of cells revealed that GFP signal intensities in PV-positive cells were significantly higher than those in PV-negative cells and GFP signal intensities in SST-positive cells were lower than those in PV-positive cells but similar to PV/SST-double negative cells (Figure 9 and Supplementary tables S14-S16). These results indicate that Nav1.1 expression level in PV-INs is significantly higher than those in excitatory neurons and PV-negative GABAergic neurons including SST-INs.”</p><p>Lines #520-534 at the Materials and methods section;</p><p>&quot;Fluorescence and Immunofluorescence quantification</p><p>For quantification of inhibitory neurons in GFP-positive cells, we used <italic>Scn1a</italic>-GFP/<italic>Vgat</italic>-Cre/<italic>Rosa26</italic>-tdTomamto mice at 4W.

The staining showed that AISs of GFP-positive cells are largely negative for Nav1.2, and cells with Nav1.2-positive AISs are mostly GFP-negative (Figure 11A). Cell counting revealed that 88% (L2/3), 90% (L5) and 95% (L6) of cells with Nav1.2-positive AISs at P15 were GFP-negative (Figure 11B-middle panel and Supplementary table S19), and 69% (L2/3), 83% (L5), and 86% (L6) of AISs of GFP-positive cells at P15 were Nav1.2-negative (Figure 11B-right panel and Supplementary table S20).
