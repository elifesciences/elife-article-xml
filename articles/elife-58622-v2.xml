The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) is necessary for orchestrating the initiation process by binding to origin DNA, recruiting CDC6, and assembling the MCM replicative helicase on DNA. Here we report five cryoEM structures of the human ORC (HsORC) that illustrate the native flexibility of the complex. The absence of ORC1 revealed a compact, stable complex of ORC2-5. Introduction of ORC1 opens the complex into several dynamic conformations. Two structures revealed dynamic movements of the ORC1 AAA+ and ORC2 winged-helix domains that likely impact DNA incorporation into the ORC core. Additional twist and pinch motions were observed in an open ORC conformation revealing a hinge at the ORC5·ORC3 interface that may facilitate ORC binding to DNA. Finally, a structure of ORC was determined with endogenous DNA bound in the core revealing important differences between human and yeast origin recognition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dna replication</kwd><kwd>AAA+ ATPase</kwd><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>cryoEM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joshua-Tor</surname><given-names>Leemor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM129923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaremko</surname><given-names>Matt J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009643</institution-id><institution>National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM45436</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The origin recognition complex is a dynamic complex that assumes various conformational states that likely correspond to different steps in replication initiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA replication is essential to all forms of life. In eukaryotes, replication is initiated from multiple start sites on chromosomes called replication origins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bleichert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leonard and Méchali, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">On et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prioleau and MacAlpine, 2016</xref>). The very first step of this initiation process is accomplished by DNA association with the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), a six-subunit protein that forms a partial ring around origin DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, this is a sequence-specific binding event, however, in metazoans the manner in which origins are identified is not yet clear. The bromo-adjacent homology (BAH)-domain at the N-terminus of ORC1 facilitates binding of ORC to DNA through nucleosomes which contain specific histone modifications that influence ORC1 affinity to the chromatin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hossain and Stillman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Müller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noguchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rivera et al., 2014</xref>). Once bound to origins, the ORC-related AAA+ ATPase CDC6 enters the complex to complete the ORC-CDC6 ring around the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). Subsequent recruitment of the licensing factor CDT1 bound to the replicative helicase MCM hexamer complex then leads to the formation of MCM double-hexamers assembled around dsDNA in a head-to-head association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). During origin licensing, ORC must perform several tasks sequentially: bind DNA, find origin sites, and dissociate from DNA upon completion of the MCM double-hexamer loading and assembly. In fact, single molecule studies have shown that ORC is released from DNA immediately following stable association of two MCM molecules with the DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). These dynamic events likely require significant conformational changes in ORC.</p><p>High resolution structures of ORC from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (ScORC), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (DmORC), and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (HsORC) have revealed the detailed architecture of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bleichert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tocilj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). The complex consists of six subunits (ORC1-6), with subunits ORC1-5 forming a partial ring capable of encircling DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tocilj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). All five subunits contain a winged-helix domain (WHD) and a AAA+ domain which consists of the RecA-fold and lid domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), although the ORC2 and ORC3 RecA-folds have diverged slightly and do not contain a lid domain. Adjacent ORC subunits associate in a double-layer arrangement through interfaces between the WHDs in one layer and the AAA+ domains in another with ATP-binding sites sandwiched between the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4, ORC4<bold>·</bold>5, and ORC5<bold>·</bold>3 AAA+ interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tocilj et al., 2017</xref>). The ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 and ORC4<bold>·</bold>5 sites represent canonical AAA+ ATPase sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>), while the ORC5<bold>·</bold>3 interface is considerably more flexible relative to the other ATP interfaces. Of the three ATP-binding sites, only the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 site exhibits ATPase activity and this activity is essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klemm et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Randell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tocilj et al., 2017</xref>).

In the open state, the ORC1 AAA+-domain binds to the ORC4 AAA+-fold to form the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 ATPase active site and ORC2 WHD is adjacent to the ORC3 WHD. The ring-shaped core of ORC in the open state is accessible to solvent and DNA substrates. In the closed state, the ORC1 AAA+ motif is dramatically rotated by ~80° towards the ORC2 WHD position and ORC2 WHD is collapsed into the open ring-shaped core of the complex. The collapsed ORC1 AAA+-domain and ORC2 WHD in the closed state completely obstruct the core of ORC and could not accommodate DNA. In addition, the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 AAA+ interface is disrupted and, therefore, the main ATPase site is disrupted. Initially, the closed state was only seen in DmORC, but recent cryoEM studies on HsORC suggested that the ORC1 AAA+ domain also adopts the auto-inhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bleichert et al., 2018</xref>). Further structural analysis is necessary to determine the prevalence and function of the auto-inhibited state in other species.</p><p>As mentioned, origin recognition, which is conferred by ORC binding to DNA, differs between yeast and metazoans. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, ORC specifically recognizes and binds to a class of DNA sequences, called the autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs), which act as the replication initiation sites in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brewer and Fangman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huberman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Linskens and Huberman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marahrens and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rao and Stillman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Theis et al., 1999</xref>). Previous ScORC structures revealed multiple regions of Orc1, Orc2, Orc4 and Orc5 that interact with double stranded DNA, including a lysine-rich region in an unstructured domain of Orc1, as well as two motifs within the AAA+ domain in each subunit that interact with elements of ARS DNA: the initiation-specific motifs (ISM) in the AAA+-domains and β-hairpin wings in the WHDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bleichert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">On et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). Of particular importance are the ISM of Orc2 and an α-helix inserted into the β-hairpin wing of Orc4. The Orc2 ISM binds to the DNA minor groove with the W396 sidechain tucked into the hydrophobic minor groove at the T-rich region within the ARS consensus DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the α-helix insertion in the β-hairpin wing of Orc4 extends deep into the DNA major groove and likely plays an important role in DNA sequence-specific interactions with the ARS sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). The β-hairpin wing of Orc4 is unresolved in the DmORC and HsORC structures and the importance of this region is unknown in metazoans. In metazoans, notably, ORC lacks sequence specificity for origin recognition and may rely on interactions with nucleosomes to establish DNA origin sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noguchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Remus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vashee et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have determined cryoEM structures of the human Origin Recognition Complex in various conformational states and at higher resolution than previous studies. Four cryoEM maps revealed dynamic movements of ORC without DNA. The ORC1 AAA+ domain and the ORC2 WHD seem to repel each other to create dynamic movement between two extreme states. In addition, a hinge was identified at the ORC3<bold>·</bold>5 interface that creates prominent twist and pinch movements of the entire complex. Lastly, a structure of ORC bound to co-purified, endogenous DNA (ORC<sub>DNA</sub>) was determined that revealed several ORC regions in close contact with DNA. The ORC2 WH- and ORC1 AAA+-domains are both visible in this ORC conformation and bind DNA directly. The various ORC conformations provide insight into the dynamics of ORC during DNA replication initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall HsORC structure and comparison to ORC from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></title><p>Two HsORC constructs were generated for recombinant expression based on our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tocilj et al., 2017</xref>) with the following changes: ORC2 was extended to full-length, the StrepTag was moved from the N-terminus of ORC1 to the N-terminus of ORC3 to improve sample purity during affinity purification, and the Sumo tag on ORC1 was removed. One construct consisted of full-length ORC1, but after expression and purification, ORC1 was absent yielding a complex of ORC2-5 (henceforth labelled ORC<sub>O2-5</sub>). Another construct included a truncated version of ORC1 [aa471-861] that yielded a purified complex of ORC1-5 with multiple conformations. We utilized cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) to investigate ORC due to the various conformations and potential flexibility seen in previous ORC structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bleichert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tocilj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). The cryoEM analysis lead to a 3.5 Å structure of the ORC2-5 complex (ORC<sub>O2-5</sub>) and four distinct structures of the ORC1-5 complex: ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> (3.2 Å), ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> (3.7 Å), ORC<sub>OPEN</sub> (4.0 Å), and ORC<sub>DNA</sub> (4.3 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The four structures determined from ORC1-5 illustrate the flexibility and dynamic movements of ORC when ORC1 is present in the complex.</p><p>The ORC<sub>O2-5</sub> structure that lacks the ORC1 subunit consists of subunits ORC2-5 in a compact and substantially closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The ORC2 WHD of ORC<sub>O2-5</sub> is collapsed into the ring-shaped core of the complex with the β-hairpin wing facing the ORC4 WHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The ORC2 WHD is significantly deeper in the core and rotated ~135° compared to the auto-inhibited state of ORC2 WHD in the DmORC structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bleichert et al., 2015</xref>). Once ORC1 is bound to form ORC1-5, the complex opens up into several related conformations to accommodate ORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–f</xref>). The first of these, ORC<sub>O2WH</sub>, consists of a dynamic ORC1 AAA+ domain that is unresolved in the refined map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Interestingly, in this structure, the ORC2 WHD was stably bound inside the ring-shaped core of ORC in a conformation that is similar to the auto-inhibited state observed in the DmORC structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,f</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bleichert et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to ORC<sub>O2WH</sub>, ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> consists of a dynamic ORC2 WHD that is unresolved in the refined map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The ORC1 AAA+ domain in this structure is ordered and forms the important interface with ORC4 with an ATP coordinated between the two subunits, an ATPase active conformation seen in previous ScORC and HsORC structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tocilj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). The flexibility of ORC2 WHD is also observed in ScORC and in the DNA-bound ScORC, where the domain was located in several states proximal to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>), and different from its position in the yeast OCCM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the dynamic movements of the domain are prevalent across species and likely influence binding to DNA and CDC6. The subunits of the third conformational state of the ORC1-5 structure, ORC<sub>OPEN</sub>, are arranged in a more open configuration relative to the previous two structures where the overall spiral of the complex is widened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The conformation of ORC<sub>OPEN</sub> resembles the ScORC conformation bound to Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). It was noted previously from low resolution cryo-EM structures comparing ScORC on DNA with ScORC-Cdc6 on DNA that substantial changes in the location of parts of the Orc1 subunit occurred upon binding of Cdc6 to ORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, the cryoEM map of ORC<sub>DNA</sub> consists of DNA bound in the core of the complex (ORC1-5) with several ORC subunits making contacts to the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The ORC1 AAA+ and ORC2 WHD of ORC<sub>DNA</sub> most likely envelop DNA predominantly through electrostatic interactions. The ORC<sub>OPEN</sub> and ORC<sub>DNA</sub> maps suffered from the existence of a preferred orientation which likely contributed to the lower resolutions of these maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). In addition, the nominal resolution of these maps, determined from their optimal direction is higher than their overall appearance merits. Nonetheless, these maps provided valuable information about the architecture and dynamics of the complex (see below).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dynamic states of ORC1 AAA+ and ORC2 WH domains.</title><p>3D classification ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> was performed with the density map low-pass filtered to 20 Å and an E-step resolution limit of 20 Å.

Although not provided in the sample buffer, magnesium ions were also resolved in the maps and were likely retained from the protein expression lysate. Only in the ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> structure was an ATP absent at the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 site due to the displacement of the ORC1 AAA+-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) and consequential disruption of the ATP binding site. The architectures of the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 and ORC4<bold>·</bold>5 sites are characteristic of AAA+ ATPase proteins, where the Walker-A and Walker-B motifs of the RecA-fold of one subunit coordinate the ATP molecule on one face and three conserved basic residues, one from the same subunit and two from the other subunit coordinate the other face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). At the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 interface, for example, these three basic residues are R720 of the ORC1 lid domain, acting as the trigger (or sensor-II), the ORC4 finger R209, and the ORC4 tether R205 coordinating the other face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). As mentioned, the only site that has been shown to have ATPase activity is the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 site, and mutations at this site are associated with the developmental disorder Meier-Gorlin Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tocilj et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 and ORC4<bold>·</bold>5, the ORC5<bold>·</bold>3 interface appears considerably more flexible and, in fact, ORC3 does not seem to participate in ATP coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Nonetheless, we do observe density for an ORC3 region proximal to the ATP site in low-pass filtered maps which indicate dynamic movements of the unresolved residues 86–94.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-58622-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>The dynamic conformations of ORC1 AAA+ in ORC<sub>O2WH</sub>.</title><p>A low-pass filtered 3D classification of ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> revealed an ORC1 AAA+ position near the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 interface that forms the ATP binding site and an ORC1 AAA+ position near the auto-inhibited state disrupting the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 ATP binding site.</p></caption></media><p>The structures of ORC2, ORC3, and the WHD of ORC5 have significantly improved resolution compared to the previous published HsORC structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tocilj et al., 2017</xref>). ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> was especially improved in this region due to the 3D focused refinement we applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). The close intertwine between ORC2 and ORC3 in ScORC and DmORC structures is also apparent in the structures of HsORC presented here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). The N-terminal regions of ORC2 and ORC3 wrap around each other contributing to their tight binding. In fact, ORC2 and ORC3 localize to centromeres in mitosis and may function independently of the other ORC subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>). The solvent-accessible surface area buried between ORC2 and ORC3 (3296 Å<sup>2</sup>) is significantly larger than the next closest interacting subunits ORC4 and ORC5 (2707 Å<sup>2</sup>). In the ScORC structure, the ORC2 N-terminal region wraps around the WHD of ORC3 and forms a helix on the opposite end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>). In the HsORC structures, the ORC2 N-terminal helix (aa239-249) is present in the ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> and ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> maps, while the loop (aa250-267) wrapping around ORC3 is dynamic and thus unresolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). In addition, the ORC3 N-terminal region (residues 10–14) loops around the RecA-like fold of ORC2 and forms a β-strand that adheres to one of the ORC2 RecA-like β-strands (aa335-339).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dynamic states of ORC1 AAA+ and ORC2 WH</title><p>The ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> and ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> structures illustrate the dynamic movements of ORC1 AAA+ and ORC2 WH domains relative to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). Other than the ORC1 AAA+ and ORC2 WHD, the architectures of the two conformations are similar. In both maps, density for the missing domains can be seen in 3D classifications with a 20 Å low-pass filtered template and E-step resolution limit of 20 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In the ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> structure, the ORC2 WHD undergoes conformational changes but does not change its overall position in the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In contrast, in the ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> structure, the ORC1 AAA+ rotates ~90° from a position proximal to the ORC4 AAA+ domain where it completes the major ATP binding site in the ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> structure, to a position proximal to the ORC1 and ORC5 WHDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), disrupting the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 ATP binding site. The latter position resembles the auto-inhibited state observed in the DmORC structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bleichert et al., 2015</xref>). This state was also observed in 2D classifications of the human ORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bleichert et al., 2018</xref>). While ORC1 AAA+ is locked in the auto-inhibited state in DmORC, the ORC1 AAA+ domain in human ORC appears to be dynamic along a continuum of positions between two extreme states: the auto-inhibited state observed in the DmORC and when it forms the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 interface with ORC4 as observed in ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub>. As mentioned, the ATPase site between the ORC1 and ORC4 is the only site that exhibits activity and mutations at the site are associated with the developmental disorder Meier-Gorlin Syndrome, but the functional role of ATP hydrolysis is unknown. The ORC1 AAA+ domain’s dynamic movements may be a consequence of ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 ATP hydrolysis, but further investigation is necessary. On the other hand, the ORC4<bold>·</bold>5 and ORC5<bold>·</bold>3 subunit interfaces are stable, and do not appear to be disrupted, which may be a consequence of their inability to hydrolyze ATP. Based on this idea and previous studies using mutant ORC4 and ORC5 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siddiqui and Stillman, 2007</xref>), we conclude that ATP promotes the assembly and stability of the human ORC, which, unlike yeast ORC, is assembled and disassembled throughout the cell division cycle. Overall, the ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> and ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> populations reveal a dynamic switch between the ORC1 AAA+ and ORC2 WHD where the locking into position of one domain within the ORC ring-shaped core kicks the other domain into a dynamic state. These domains are accommodated simultaneously only in the ORC<sub>OPEN</sub> and ORC<sub>DNA</sub> complexes, two conformations that separate the ORC1 AAA+ and ORC2 WH domains by widening the gap between ORC1 and ORC2 and by mutual electrostatic attraction to DNA, respectively (see below).</p><p>A minor ORC2 WHD conformation was observed in further 3D classifications of the ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Secondary structure elements can be seen in the ORC2 WHD region that are clearly different from the auto-inhibited conformation. In fact, this conformation resembles the completely collapsed ORC2 WHD conformations in the ORC<sub>O2-5</sub> structure where the domain is further tucked into the core of the complex compared to the auto-inhibited state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Although the density region of the ORC2 WHD alternative state in ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> is of low resolution, we were confidently able to fit this region once we modelled the ORC2 WHD inactive state in the well-resolved ORC<sub>O2-5</sub> structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Notably, this alternative conformation does not resemble any of the conformations of ORC2 WHD in any previously reported structures of the various ORCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bleichert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bleichert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tocilj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). The buried ORC2 WHD appears to stabilize ORC2-5 complex prior to ORC1 binding, hence we termed this structure of the ORC2 WHD the inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,e</xref>). The binding of ORC1 seems to facilitate the release of the O2 WHD from this tucked-in state, generating a more labile structure for downstream events. In both the yeast OCCM and ORC-DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>), the ORC2 WHD interacts with the origin DNA and is far away from the gap between the ORC1 and ORC2 AAA+ domains, forming a collar of ORC WHDs that surround the DNA. Thus the movement of the ORC2 WHD seems to be a universal feature of controlling DNA access to the ring-shaped core of ORC and hence binding to DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Hinge movement arising from the ORC3·5 interface</title><p>The ORC<sub>OPEN</sub> structure displays a conformation similar to what was reported previously for HsORC and ScORC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).

In addition, the ORC3 N-terminal region of ORC<sub>OPEN</sub> consists of an extended, straightened α-helix (aa42-86) that is bent in the other ORC conformations by 32° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This long helix in ORC<sub>OPEN</sub> may provide structural stability to the open conformation. The ORC3 straight helix is also present in the ScORC structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>), while the helix is bent in the DmORC structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bleichert et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, both the ORC1 AAA+ and O2 WHD are ordered in the open conformation. The extra space in the ORC ring opening reduces clashes between the ORC2 WHD and ORC1 AAA+ domain and allows both domains to adopt a fixed orientation relative to their mutually-exclusive static positioning observed in the more closed ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> and ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To assess the prominent movements around the ORC3<bold>·</bold>five interface, we performed multibody refinement in Relion on the ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub>, ORC<sub>O2WH</sub>, and ORC<sub>OPEN</sub> particle populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Subunits ORC2<bold>·</bold>3 (including ORC5 WHD) and ORC1<bold>·</bold>4<bold>·</bold>5 of HsORC were designated as two separate masked bodies in Relion's multibody refinement to determine their independent movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakane et al., 2018</xref>) (ORC1 was isolated as a third masked body in multibody refinement, but the experiment did not provide conclusive results, most likely due to the relatively small size of ORC1). The components of the masked bodies and ORC movements were further validated by performing Cryosparc’s unbiased 3D Variability Analysis on the ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> particles (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Punjani and Fleet, 2020</xref>). Compared to Multibody Refinement, 3D Variability Analysis does not rely on user input to determine regions that move independently of one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Punjani and Fleet, 2020</xref>). Both Multibody Refinement and 3D Variability Analysis revealed the same prominent movements in the ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> particle population. For all three ORC populations, multibody refinement generated two components (specific movements of ORC) that contributed significantly more to the overall variance (total movement of ORC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). These movements contributed between 17% to 23% of the total variance of each particle population. The two movements can be described as twisting and pinching, respectively, both emanating from the hinge at the ORC3<bold>·</bold>5 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The ORC twisting motion involves ORC1 and ORC2 sliding over each other, while the pinching motion involves ORC1 and ORC2 narrowing/widening the ORC ring opening between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The twisting and pinching movements provide potential flexibility to ORC during replication initiation events, including DNA binding, movement along DNA, and/or complex release after MCM double hexamer formation.</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-58622-video3.mp4"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>The ORC3<bold>·</bold>5 interface acts as a flexible hinge.</title><p>Relion’s Multibody Refinement and Cryosparc’s 3D Variability Analysis revealed the same two prominent movements which resemble a twist and pinch motion, respectively.</p></caption></media><p>In the global refinement of ORC, the ORC2<bold>·</bold>3 regions lining the gap with ORC1 suffered the most in terms of alignment.

However, the multibody/focused refinement significantly improved the ORC2<bold>·</bold>3 region of the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). The N-terminus of ORC3, which wraps around ORC2 and extends the β-sheet of the RecA-like fold of ORC2 with an additional strand, was clearly resolved in the focused-refined map. In addition, the density of an ORC2 loop region (residues 361–368), which comes into close proximity with bound DNA in the ORC<sub>DNA</sub> map (see below), is significantly improved. The improved density maps of ORC further validates the multibody refinement parameters and, therefore, the flexibility at the ORC3<bold>·</bold>5 interface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DNA bound to HsORC</title><p>One class from the ORC1-5 sample contained clear density for DNA in the core of the complex and yielded a 4.3 Å map into which DNA could be fit into the ORC1-5 structure (ORC<sub>DNA</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). DNA was detected in the affinity-purified, recombinant HsORC expressed in Sf9 insect cells and the presence of this DNA species was only detected when ORC was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Furthermore, a post 2D classification of the DNA-bound HsORC yielded classes with strong density in the core of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The bright appearance of this density in the 2D classification likely represents the heavy phosphorous atoms in the DNA backbone since heavy atoms scatter electrons to a greater extent and to higher angles in TEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kellenberger et al., 1986</xref>). Since DNA-binding of HsORC is not sequence specific, the DNA is likely to have multiple orientations along its axis in the core, consistent with further 3D classification of the DNA-bound ORC populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In other words, the DNA fragment visualized is a result of a superposition of sequences along the DNA fragment. The overall conformation of ORC<sub>DNA</sub> resembles the more closed conformations of ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> and ORC<sub>O2WH</sub>, albeit with ORC2 WHD in a different conformation (see below). The structure shows DNA contacts by all five subunits of ORC, with the most significant interactions occurring with the ORC1 RecA-fold and ORC2 WHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c</xref>). In the ORC1 RecA-fold, two loops (residues 593–596 and 626–630, respectively) at the N-terminal regions of two α-helices are in close contact to the DNA. Importantly, there are several positively-charged and aromatic residues in the loops (K591, N595, H596 W626, H628, K629) that appear to be involved in binding the negatively-charged DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Sequence alignments show that while most of these residues are conserved in vertebrate species, they differ in insects, plants and fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). The ORC2 WHD is also in close contact with the DNA and this domain undergoes significant secondary structure rearrangement, which prevented precise fitting of modelled ORC2 WHD into the region, and the resolution is not high enough for unambiguous model building of this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The ORC2 WHD may adopt multiple conformations in this structure similar to the multiple ORC2 WHD states observed in DNA-bound ScORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, clear secondary structure is visible in the ORC2 WHD region of the map, in which, a long helix has significant contact with the DNA density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). In addition, the initiation specific motif (ISM) of ORC2 (residues 364–368) in the RecA-like fold is near the DNA substrate. Specifically, the positively-charged ORC2 residue R367 emanating from this loop, appears to mediate the interaction with DNA. The ORC2 ISM in humans may play an important role in binding DNA similar to the ORC2 ISM in ScORC where W396 is buried in the minor groove of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). The β-hairpin loop in ORC5 of HsORC also consists of a positively-charged residue H398 in close proximity to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,f</xref>). Similarly, the β-hairpin loop in ORC5 of ScORC contains positively-charged residues (N438, K439, N440, K447, R449) extending into the major groove of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The Orc4 WHD plays an important role in origin-specific binding in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, this domain contains an α-helix insertion in the β-hairpin wing (residues 481–489) that inserts into the major groove of the ARS-sequence DNA and is a key contributor to conferring sequence specificity for origin recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The homologous ORC4 region in HsORC is visible in the ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> cryoEM density map allowing us to now model this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). This region in HsORC is 20 residues shorter than the ScORC segment and does not contain an α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). The missing helix in HsORC likely reduces its ability to bind specifically to a DNA sequence resulting in the requirement of other mechanisms to establish stable origin interactions. This loss of specificity also contributes to the multiple conformations of DNA observed in the core of human ORC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Despite the missing helix, the shorter ORC4 loop contacts the DNA in the ORC<sub>DNA</sub> structure proximal to R390 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), a positively-charged residue that may participate in DNA-backbone interactions similar to R478 in ScORC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Based on sequence alignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>), the ORC4 helix insertion has likely evolved in a small clade of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>-related budding yeast species in tandem with a loss of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated transcriptional gene silencing, while the region is absent in most other eukaryotic organisms, including fungi, plants, and animals, which use RNAi for silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). Since HsORC does not display DNA sequence specific DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vashee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vashee et al., 2001</xref>), the significant difference in ORC4 between budding yeast and human ORC contributes to the sequence-dependent and -independent origin binding in these species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). HsORC binds to specific locations in chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miotto et al., 2016</xref>) and unlike ScORC, it is most likely targeted to these sites by binding to specific histones and their modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hossain and Stillman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Long et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>DNA replication initiation is a highly dynamic, multi-complex process that requires essential coordination by ORC. Our findings uncover several dynamic conformations of HsORC which have implications in facilitating initiation events including DNA engagement, CDC6 recruitment, and MCM complex assembly onto DNA. We determined four structures of ORC that demonstrate the previously unappreciated flexibility of the complex. The ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> and ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> consists of two dynamic domains, ORC2 WH and ORC1 AAA+, respectively, that repel each other from adopting their fixed positions. The domain dynamics are possibly linked to the catalytic activity at the ORC1<bold>·</bold>4 ATPase site, warranting further analysis to determine the molecular basis and the biological role of these domain movements. While the ORC<sub>OPEN</sub> structure largely resembles the ScORC conformation in the budding yeast OCCM complex and the previously reported HsORC structure, it unexpectedly reveals a significant hinge point at the ORC3-5 interface that generates a twist and pinch motion. The twist motion may allow ORC to move on DNA with a scanning mechanism to establish origin sites and the pinch motion may be involved in facilitating ORC to accommodate DNA into its central cavity via the partial ring opening and the subsequent incorporation of CDC6 into the ORC-DNA complex. The ATPase activity of ORC may promote the dynamic movement of the ORC1 and ORC2 subunits during assembly or prior to origin recognition. Lastly, the ORC<sub>DNA</sub> structure contains endogenous DNA bound in the core of ORC and reveals regions in the core that are in close proximity to the bound DNA. These observations along with previous studies on the dynamic, ATP-dependent assembly of ORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siddiqui and Stillman, 2007</xref>) suggest a model in which a pre-assembled ORC2-5 complex binds to ORC1 and promotes the opening of the ORC core to facilitate DNA binding. Since ORC1 appears to be the first ORC subunit to bind to chromosomes during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Okuno et al., 2001</xref>), ORC1 may recruit the other subunits via the pathway outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. These interactions between ORC1 and ORC2-5 may be facilitated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) the predicted N-terminal regions of ORC1 and ORC2 forming condensates via phase transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parker et al., 2019</xref>). Proteins containing IDRs are difficult to express and by their nature contain large unstructured regions. We therefore removed the ORC1 N-terminal region from our construct and we were not able to resolve the ORC2 N-terminal region. Due to the absence of these regions, IDRs appear unnecessary for ORC assembly. Finally, it is known that the C-terminus of yeast Mcm3 binds to and activates the ATPase activity of the ORC-Cdc6 complex on DNA, possibly preventing futile loading of incomplete Mcm2-7 hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frigola et al., 2013</xref>). It is also possible that if the C-terminus of Mcm3 stimulates the ATPase activity of ORC, it may induce movement of the ORC1 AAA+ and a switch from the active to the inactive state of ORC after complete pre-RC assembly. Comparing the human and yeast ORC DNA contacts provides insights into the different sequence specificity requirements of ORC-DNA binding between the species. Our study establishes the foundation for further exploration of the critical determinants in metazoan replication origin establishment.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for ORC dynamics.</title><p>The binding of ORC1 to ORC2-5 opens the complex and facilitates dynamic movements of ORC1 AAA+ and ORC2 WH at the ring opening and a hinge motion at the ORC3<bold>·</bold>5 interface.

Each subunit of the models was rigid body fit using the ‘fit in map’ function in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goddard et al., 2007</xref>). The resulting model, including nucleotides and coordinating metal ions, was subject to further model building using the COOT software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>), and then real-space refined with the PHENIX package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonine et al., 2012</xref>). The rotation angle calculations at the O3<bold>·</bold>5 hinge was determined using the ‘align’ function in UCSF ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>). The ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> and ORC<sub>OPEN</sub> structures were aligned at ORC4, followed by alignment of ORC2<bold>·</bold>3 which generates a report containing the rotation angle between the aligned ORC2<bold>·</bold>3 subunits. UCSF ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>) was also used to generate the figures and buried surface areas were determined using the ‘measure buriedarea’ function in ChimeraX). Model statistics are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Joshua-Tor laboratory for helpful comments and suggestions.

replication complex in free and DNA-bound states, is a major advance. The resolution is significantly improved compared to what was reported previously and the newly described conformational states provide further mechanistic insight into the significance of protein movements that are relevant for DNA binding.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The dynamic nature of the human Origin Recognition Complex revealed through five cryoEM structures&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sriram Subramaniam as the Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tim Grant (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Jaremko et al. describe structures of multiple states of the human ORC complex, an essential replication complex in free and DNA-bound states. The structures contribute a major advance, as the resolution is significantly improved compared to the previous HsORC structure and describe conformational states that provide further mechanistic insight into HsORC function. Altogether these results are important and should be published.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Validation and analysis:</p><p>Supplementary file 1 and validation reports don't match. Supplementary file 1 lacks info.</p><p>– FSC (model-to-map) for final models should be provided.</p><p>– Maps should be displayed next to the model or a table indicating which conformation includes which subunits/domains/residues in the corresponding model should be provided to give the reader more clarity about which parts of the complex were modeled in each conformation and how the conformations differ from each other.</p><p>– Show EM maps for all ATPs sites, not only 1 conformation (in Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>2) Revision of Figures 1, 2, 4 and Video 1:</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>– Sideview does not add much new info, rather show a cryoEM map next to the model to visualize which parts of the map have been modeled.</p><p>– Panel J) Show close-up of the β-341 hairpin loop of ORC<sub>4O1AAA</sub> and show corresponding area in ScORC as well as cartoon of WHD domains from HsORC4 and ScORC4 side by side either in 1J or as part of Figure 4.

Show cartoon representation of structural models throughout this figure. Show top down view on dsDNA at appropriate zoom to visualize all interactions in 1 image.</p><p>Video 1:</p><p>– Use colorzone command or encircle WHD domain to highlight WHD domain unambiguously. Label red map, blue map and don't change color at the end of the video?</p><p>3) A deeper discussion of findings and the mechanistic model:</p><p>– The authors find shortening of an α-helix in the WHD domain of HsORC4 compared to ScORC that could account for sequence specificity of ScORC. Is there more data to support this? Which organisms have or don't have this helix? Does the presence of the helix correlate with sequence specificity of Orc? Are there prior sequencing data of corresponding ScORC4-WHD domain mutants that support this? This is an important finding, but is explored very little in the manuscript.</p><p>– The authors speculate that Arg89 of ORC3 could be involved in ATP coordination (subsection “Overall HsORC structure and comparison to ORC from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Drosophilamelanogaster</italic>”). Ideally, they'd mutate the residue and test function. Absent that, is this residue conserved?</p><p>– The authors also speculate that HsORC may detect intracellular levels of ATP. Is there data to back this up? What is the Kd of ATP? Is it reasonable for acting as a sensor? If not, then this needs to be removed.</p><p>– The authors propose an interesting model for HsORC activation and DNA binding. Is there biochemical data in support of this model? Could comment a bit more on the role of the conserved WHD domain of ORC2 and the inactive state: Does the WHD domain in inactive state prevent nonspecific DNA binding of ORC2-5? Is there available DNA binding data on deletion mutants of WHD domain of ORC2?</p><p>– Discussion in regard to IDRs and phase separation: The text reads as if IDRs are present in several subunits – in which subunits and where are the IDRs? Are they predicted? Why are they not present in structures? Are they not resolved (likely owing to flexibility) or were they not included in expression constructs? Please clarify in discussion.</p><p>– Comment more on the characteristic structural changes from closed to open to DNA-bound (subunit to subunit translation, helical radius, etc). What does &quot;open&quot; refer to? Widening of the spiral?</p><p>Report on buried surface interaction area between ORC subunits to confirm exceptional intertwining of ORC2 and ORC3 from HsORC and DmORC.</p><p>– How do the authors come to the conclusion that the loop in ORC3 (Figure 1—figure supplement 5) is related to DNA binding, is this area close to DNA or DNA binding site? Is this area resolved in all conformations?</p><p>4) Multibody refinement:</p><p>– To solidify the ORC3·5 hinge, verify that hinge point is not an artefact of mask choice. Run multibody refine with a mask boundary between ORC1·4 and ORC2·3·5 and report on results.</p><p>– Figure legend is in discrepancy with text: Legend indicates that for multibody refinement particles from only 1 conformation were used, text states particles from 3 conformations were included.</p><p>– The text is also not very quantitative in description of the MBR.</p><p>5) DNA-bound structure:</p><p>It makes sense that the DNA sequence would not be in register because HsORC isn't sequence specific, but is the major/minor groove positioning in register? I would think that the positioning of the double helix is essentially fixed relative to the major/minor grooves. Can the authors make out DNA helix clearly? Clearer figures would help.</p><p>6) Sample preparation details:</p><p>In the sample preparation, addition of ATP in the buffer is mentioned. Were there any divalent cations, Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>, included? What is the rationale for the ATP addition instead of ATPγS, AMPPNP or ADP·BFx? What are the green spheres shown next to the ATP molecules in Figure 1G-I? Why is ATP not hydrolyzed in ORC1·4 or ORC4·5?</p><p>7) In Figure 1—figure supplement 3D and E, the maps look of much lower resolution than 3.7 Å (ORC<sub>OPEN</sub>) or 4.3 Å (ORC<sub>DNA</sub>). Were these maps unsharpened? The authors may consider showing representative EM map regions or 3D-FSC.</p><p>8) DNA density:</p><p>For the ORCDNA complex, it will be important to show an EM map covering the DNA portion. Although base sequences are mixed, the DNA backbones should still be recognizable.</p><p>9) Resolution anisotropy:</p><p>The resolution is extremely directionally dependent, and the true resolution of the ORC open and ORC DNA maps is low in all but one direction. Based on the direction plots shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 all of the samples suffered somewhat from preferential orientation. I believe the authors should mention this, and perform a direction dependent resolution analysis of their maps (e.g. using the 3D FSC server – https://3dfsc.salk.edu/) and report the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58622.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Validation and analysis:</p><p>Supplementary file 1 and validation reports don't match.

Are there prior sequencing data of corresponding ScORC4-WHD domain mutants that support this? This is an important finding, but is explored very little in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the short comments from section 1, and expanded the discussion in the “DNA bound to HsORC” section.</p><p>We also added the really intriguing observation that the ORC4 helix insertions, along with sequence specificity, have likely evolved in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisae</italic> budding yeast and other fungi coincident with loss of RNA-interference mediated silencing, while this region is absent in other organisms, including fungi, plants, and animals that do have RNAi. This is discussed in much greater detail in a paper that just came out in bioRxiv (Hu, et al., 2020) and that we now refer to in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors speculate that Arg89 of ORC3 could be involved in ATP coordination (subsection “Overall HsORC structure and comparison to ORC from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster”). Ideally, they'd mutate the residue and test function. Absent that, is this residue conserved?</p></disp-quote><p>R89 is not conserved and after further inspection this claim has been removed from the text. However, we are confident in the remaining residues involvement in ATP coordination that are discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors also speculate that HsORC may detect intracellular levels of ATP. Is there data to back this up? What is the Kd of ATP? Is it reasonable for acting as a sensor? If not, then this needs to be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is probably too speculative and thus removed this from the text because we have no current data to validate the claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors propose an interesting model for HsORC activation and DNA binding. Is there biochemical data in support of this model? Could comment a bit more on the role of the conserved WHD domain of ORC2 and the inactive state: Does the WHD domain in inactive state prevent nonspecific DNA binding of ORC2-5? Is there available DNA binding data on deletion mutants of WHD domain of ORC2?</p></disp-quote><p>As observed from the structures, the position of the ORC2 WHD in ORC2-5 occupies the same space as the DNA occupies in the ORC-DNA complex. Hence, we speculated that it obstructs DNA from binding at the central cavity in ORC2-5. ORC2-5 exhibits DNA binding activity (data not shown) but its exact mode of DNA interaction and how this interaction is related to the ORC-DNA conformation in the current study is still under investigation. Since metazoan ORC does not exhibit the sequence-specific DNA interaction observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we do not expect ORC2-5 or the ORC in the ORCDNA conformation to discriminate between specific and non-specific DNA-binding in our current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Discussion in regard to IDRs and phase separation: The text reads as if IDRs are present in several subunits – in which subunits and where are the IDRs? Are they predicted? Why are they not present in structures? Are they not resolved (likely owing to flexibility) or were they not included in expression constructs? Please clarify in discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have further clarified the discussion of IDRs in the text: “These interactions between ORC1 and ORC2-5 may be facilitated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) within the predicted N-terminal regions of ORC1 and ORC2 forming condensates via phase transitions (Parker, et al., 2019). Proteins containing IDRs are difficult to express and structurally resolve, therefore we removed the ORC1 N-terminal region from our construct and we were not able to resolve the ORC2 N-terminal region. Due to the absence of these regions, IDRs are likely not necessary for ORC assembly. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Comment more on the characteristic structural changes from closed to open to DNA-bound (subunit to subunit translation, helical radius, etc). What does &quot;open&quot; refer to? Widening of the spiral?</p><p>Report on buried surface interaction area between ORC subunits to confirm exceptional intertwining of ORC2 and ORC3 from HsORC and DmORC.</p></disp-quote><p>We added to the discussion (subsection “Overall HsORC structure and comparison to ORC from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>”) describing widening of the spiral in the ORC<sub>OPEN</sub> conformation and added Figure 3—figure supplement 2 which illustrates the change in conformation of a long α-helix in ORC that likely contributes to the stability of the open conformation.</p><p>In addition, we have utilized the ‘measure buriedarea’ function in ChimeraX to determine the solvent-accessible surface area buried between ORC subunits and determined that buried area between ORC2 and ORC3 (3296 Å<sup>2</sup>) is significantly larger than the next closest interacting subunits ORC4 and ORC5 (2707 Å<sup>2</sup>). This is discussed in the subsection “Overall HsORC structure and comparison to ORC from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>”. We have also added a figure in Figure 1—figure supplement 8 that focuses on the intertwine between O2 and O3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How do the authors come to the conclusion that the loop in ORC3 (Figure 1—figure supplement 5) is related to DNA binding, is this area close to DNA or DNA binding site?

Run multibody refine with a mask boundary between ORC1·4 and ORC2·3·5 and report on results.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid mask bias, we performed Cryosparc 3D Variability to complement the Multibody Refinement results. Compared to Multibody Refinement, 3D Variability Analysis does not rely on user input to determine regions that move independently of one another. In addition, though ORC1 may be too small for a single body in Multibody Refinement, this is not the case for 3D Variability. Both analyses revealed the same prominent movements of the ORC<sub>O1AAA</sub> particle population. We included the movements of both analyses in Video 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure legend is in discrepancy with text: Legend indicates that for multibody refinement particles from only 1 conformation were used, text states particles from 3 conformations were included.</p><p>– The text is also not very quantitative in description of the MBR.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for finding this mistake. There are 3 conformations and we have corrected this. The Multibody Refinement results for ORC<sub>O2WH</sub> and ORC<sub>OPEN</sub> are available in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, which shows the principle component analysis results. We have included text in the Figure 3 legend to clarify this.</p><p>In addition, we’ve added more text discussing the Multibody Refinement variance results and added Cryosparc’s 3D Variability Analysis to further validate the movements we observed (subsection “Hinge movement arising from the ORC3·5 interface”).

Clearer figures would help.</p></disp-quote><p>We can roughly see the backbone but the resolution is too low. Even though we collected 2M particles we cannot resolve the various DNA conformations by 3D classification because of the number of particles remaining (see Figure 4—figure supplement 3). We therefore decided to report conservatively on our conclusions of the ORC-DNA binding. We have added a figure of the EM map covering the DNA in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 to better clarify the model and map of the DNA region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Sample preparation details:</p><p>In the sample preparation, addition of ATP in the buffer is mentioned.

It should be noted that these four conformations come from the same sample so some particles might have hydrolyzed ATP and some haven’t. The ATPase at the ORC4·5 interface is not functional based on our previous work (see Tocilj et al.), and would therefore not hydrolyze ATP. We also note, from work not yet published that the ATP is tightly bound at the ORC4·5 and is still clearly present from lysates even when ATP is not provided in the sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 1—figure supplement 3D and E, the maps look of much lower resolution than 3.7 Å (ORC<sub>OPEN</sub>) or 4.3 Å (ORC<sub>DNA</sub>).

Based on the direction plots shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 all of the samples suffered somewhat from preferential orientation. I believe the authors should mention this, and perform a direction dependent resolution analysis of their maps (e.g. using the 3D FSC server – https://3dfsc.salk.edu/) and report the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed 3DFSC and included plots in Figure 1—figure supplement 6. We also mentioned the analysis in the manuscript and referenced the work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
