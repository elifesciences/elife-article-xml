Recent studies show these to be components of a network of highly regulated systems connecting apoptotic processes to counter-invader immunity, in prokaryotes with a multicellular habit. However, the provenance of key adaptor domains, namely those of the Death-like and TRADD-N superfamilies, a quintessential feature of metazoan apoptotic systems, remained murky. Here, we use sensitive sequence analysis and comparative genomics methods to identify unambiguous bacterial homologs of the Death-like and TRADD-N superfamilies. We show the former to have arisen as part of a radiation of effector-associated α-helical adaptor domains that likely mediate homotypic interactions bringing together diverse effector and signaling domains in predicted bacterial apoptosis- and counter-invader systems. Similarly, we show that the TRADD-N domain defines a key, widespread signaling bridge that links effector deployment to invader-sensing in multicellular bacterial and metazoan counter-invader systems. TRADD-N domains are expanded in aggregating marine invertebrates and point to distinctive diversifying immune strategies probably directed both at RNA and retroviruses and cellular pathogens that might infect such communities. These TRADD-N and Death-like domains helped identify several new bacterial and metazoan counter-invader systems featuring underappreciated, common functional principles: the use of intracellular invader-sensing lectin-like (NPCBM and FGS), transcription elongation GreA/B-C, glycosyltransferase-4 family, inactive NTPase (serving as nucleic acid receptors), and invader-sensing GTPase switch domains. Finally, these findings point to the possibility of multicellular bacteria-stem metazoan symbiosis in the emergence of the immune/apoptotic systems of the latter.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biological conflicts</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd><kwd>multicellularity</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>marine animals</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000092</institution-id><institution>National Library of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LM000084-20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaur</surname><given-names>Gurmeet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prokaryotic TRADD-N and Death-like adaptor domains in diverse predicted apoptosis and immune systems from multicellular prokaryotes and metazoans indicate the common origin of key apoptosis mechanisms required for the stabilization of multicellularity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolutionary evidence favors several independent origins for multicellularity in diverse eukaryotic and prokaryotic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Grosberg and Strathmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Lyons and Kolter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Kysela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Dunin-Horkawicz et al., 2014</xref>). However, the emergence of this life history characteristic is accompanied by specific similarities across phylogenetically distant branches of the tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Grosberg and Strathmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Lyons and Kolter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib189">Rokas, 2008</xref>). One such is programmed cell death, cell suicide, or apoptosis of individual cells within the multicellular assemblage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ameisen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Vaux, 1993</xref>). Indeed, apoptosis has been observed and studied across multicellular eukaryotes, such as metazoans, fungi, amoebozoan slime molds (e.g., <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>), and plants as well as certain multicellular prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria and actinobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ameisen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib225">Yuan and Kroemer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Elmore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Fuchs and Steller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Greenberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Bidle and Falkowski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Jiménez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib231">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Filippova and Vinogradova, 2017</xref>). It is shown to occur in several biological contexts: (1) in routine development, where it serves as a mechanism for ‘sculpting’ the body forms of organisms (e.g., inter-digital cell death in tetrapods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Chautan et al., 1999</xref>); (2) in responses to stress and environmental insults, where it might help eliminate cells with DNA damage or other defects, like misfolded proteins, that might prove deleterious to the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams, 2003</xref>); (3) as part of the immune response to clear moribund cells and limit infections of viruses and other intracellular parasites by eliminating infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Imre, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Hayakawa et al., 2006</xref>); and (4) self-non-self recognition, where it serves to restrict fusion or mergers of non-kin individuals, for instance, in fungal heterokaryon incompatibility or allo-incompatibility in colonial animals like ascidians, bryozoans, cnidarians, and sponges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Daskalov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Glass and Dementhon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Buss, 1990</xref>).</p><p>At first sight, the evolution of a suicidal response appears paradoxical as it effectively nullifies the fitness of the cell. However, such a response can be selected for due to the principle of inclusive fitness. Here, the cell undergoing suicide, despite dying, accrues fitness via the benefits its death confers on identical or closely related kin cells in a multicellular assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Bourke, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Hamilton, 1964</xref>). This is amply borne out by the biological contexts in which apoptosis occurs, namely those in which the death of individual cells is for the greater good of the multicellular assemblage of kin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Michod and Roze, 2001</xref>). In these contexts, apoptosis is initiated by specific interactions involving the delivery of effectors or sensing of specific stimuli that are best understood in multicellular eukaryotes. These processes include: (1) direct delivery of initiating effectors from outside to cells targeted for death, such as the lysosomal granules bearing perforin and granzymes by CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells in jawed vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Podack, 1995</xref>); (2) extrinsic cell-death-initiating signals communicated via the cell-surface receptors (e.g., receptors with Death domains in metazoans; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib195">Schulze-Osthoff et al., 1998</xref>); (3) intrinsic stimuli sensed by intracellular receptors such as pathogen molecules detected by LRR repeats in plants or the RIG-I viral RNA-sensing helicase module in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Chattopadhyay and Sen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Ting et al., 2008</xref>); and (4) stimuli in the form of molecules sensed at the interface between the mitochondria and the cytoplasm that signal deleterious metabolic (especially oxidative) stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Altman and Rathmell, 2012</xref>). Such triggers result in the deployment of effectors that enzymatically target cellular molecules leading to suicide, such as caspases that cleave proteins, DNases that cleave genomic DNA, TIR domains that cleave NAD<sup>+</sup>, or ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) that modify DNA or proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams, 2003</xref>). Alternatively, effector action occurs through membrane perforation by transmembrane proteins (Bcl-2) or non-covalent protein-templated (prion-like) assembly of filamentous polymeric complexes (e.g., of CARD, Pyrin, and TIR domains) within cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Delbridge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Gentle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Morehouse et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Signaling mechanism parallels between eukaryotic Death-superfamily domains and prokaryotic effector-associated domains (EADs) in their biological contexts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Extrinsic and (<bold>B</bold>) intrinsic pathways in eukaryotic apoptosis signaling.

Thus, the evolution of apoptosis has gone hand-in-hand with a striking array of negative regulators and switches that limits the option of apoptosis to specific situations. In their simplest form, these regulatory interactions involve a pair of paralogous pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, for example, members of the Bcl-2 family of transmembrane (TM) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Cory et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Hawkins and Vaux, 1994</xref>). Increasingly complex forms of regulation are constituted by well-coordinated cascades of enzyme activity (e.g., proteolytic cascades mediated by the caspases and ZU5 domains) or energy-requiring, threshold-dependent switches mediated by different families of NTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Janssens and Tinel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">D’Osualdo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib229">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Regulation is also achieved by a series of shifting non-covalent interactions involving non-catalytic domains, often termed adaptors, that may further interface with covalent modifications of proteins by phosphorylation and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Lee and Peter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Kumar and Colussi, 1999</xref>). These regulatory processes controlling the ultimate unleashing of the effector often occur in the context of large macromolecular complexes such as the apoptosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Riedl and Salvesen, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Studies by us and others revealed that despite the protean manifestations of apoptosis and related phenomena in immunity across diverse eukaryotic lineages, at the molecular level it features certain common protein domains mediating different steps of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Aravind et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Aravind et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Koonin and Aravind, 2002</xref>). On the regulatory side, these include the NTP-dependent switches involved in the formation of the apoptosome, inflammosome, and related complexes in animals, fungi, and plants in the form of the STAND NTPases (e.g., AP-ATPases, NACHT, and DAP-3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and AP-GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Leipe et al., 2004</xref>). These NTPase domains are typically coupled in the same polypeptide to supersecondary-structure-forming repeats, such as the LRR, WD, and TPR that provide a platform for the assembly of macromolecular complexes and the recognition of cell-death stimulating molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Leipe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Inohara and Nunez, 2001</xref>). On the effector side, the domains shared by disparate apoptotic systems feature a common set of executors or toxin domains in the form of the caspase-like peptidase (caspase, paracaspase and metacaspase, and their relatives; hereinafter caspase), NucA/EndoG-like endonuclease, TIR, and ART domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib211">Uren et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Sanmartín et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Schäfer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Narayanan and Park, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Hassa et al., 2006</xref>). Further, these studies also indicated that both the regulator and effector domains found across eukaryotic apoptotic systems have their ultimate origins in prokaryotes, where they show a preponderant presence in multicellular forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Aravind et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Koonin and Aravind, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes, these domains are commonly incorporated into lineage-specific protein domain architectures and embedded within signaling webs that are typical of eukaryotic regulatory systems, such as protein kinase cascades (e.g., MAP kinases) or the ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like (Ub/Ubl)-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Aravind et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Orlowski, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Keshet and Seger, 2010</xref>). Until recently, potential regulatory networks in which the prokaryotic homologs of apoptotic proteins were situated remained unclear. As part of our program to comprehensively identify new molecular components mediating biological conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib229">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Iyer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Aravind et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Burroughs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib230">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Burroughs and Aravind, 2020</xref>), we uncovered a class of thematically unified systems in phylogenetically distant prokaryotes with a predominantly multicellular habit (e.g., actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, chloroflexi, and myxobacteria; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). These possess counterparts of eukaryotic apoptotic protein domains as part of multidomain proteins predicted to form multimeric signaling complexes. These complexes are often characterized by a ‘ternary’ form, that is, with three functional categories of components predicted: (1) to detect invaders, (2) signal their presence and set a threshold for effector activation, and (3) finally unleash the effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, they show threshold-setting components that are based on chaperone-cochaperone pairs, proteolysis, nucleotide signals, and/or GTPase switches (belonging to the broader septin/GIMAP-like clade) that present analogies to the tight regulation seen in eukaryotic apoptotic systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). Selection for domain architectural and sequence diversification in these systems, especially in terms of their effector and invader-sensing components, suggested that the apoptosis-like processes mediated by these systems are part of the counter-invader response in multicellular prokaryotes.</p><p>These prokaryotic systems also brought to light a hitherto unappreciated commonality with metazoan apoptotic systems, namely the use of small ‘adaptor’ domains in complex formation and effector recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In metazoa, the regulators and effectors are brought together by the interactions of the adaptor domains, which are most commonly the α-helical domains of the Death-like superfamily, viz., the Death domain, Death effector domain (DED), caspase recruitment domain (CARD), and Pyrin domain (PYD) that have a shared six-helical bundle fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For example, the C-terminal Death domains of the vertebrate tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1), FAS, or the neurotrophin receptor p75, in response to activation by their respective ligands (TNFα, Fas-Ligand, and the nerve growth factor), recruit TRADD with a C-terminal Death domain, which in turn recruits the protein kinase Rip1 and FADD that also possess Death domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Micheau and Tschopp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Hsu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib200">Stanger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Boldin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib223">Yazidi-Belkoura et al., 2003</xref>). FADD additionally possesses a DED, which in turn recruits caspases with DEDs to induce a proteolytic cascade, leading to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Chinnaiyan et al., 1995</xref>). The N-terminal region of TRADD contains a domain (TRADD-N; Pfam PF09034) structurally related to the small-molecule-binding ACT domain (RRM-like fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Aravind and Koonin, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Park et al., 2000</xref>), which recruits the MATH domain of the TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), leading to activation of JNK/AP1-kinase and inflammatory response pathways transcriptionally controlled by nuclear factor (NF)-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Park et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Hsu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Tsao et al., 2000</xref>), thus uniting apoptotic and immune signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our recent work showed that both α-helical domains (including the first examples of domains distantly related to the metazoan Death-like superfamily) and those related to the TRADD-N are present as potential adaptors in the newly described conflict systems enriched in multicellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>These findings provided the first hints for the possible provenance of key apoptotic adaptors related to the Death-like and TRADD-N families in bacterial conflict systems. In this study, we expand these findings to show that the classical metazoan-type Death domains are found in bacterial conflict systems that possess a similar array of effectors as the metazoan apoptotic systems. We also identify several previously unrecognized families of the TRADD-N domain in bacteria and metazoans. The new metazoan TRADD-N families often show lineage-specific expansions (LSEs) with a remarkable diversity of domain architectures paralleling their contextual connections in prokaryotic conflict systems. Consequently, we show that the TRADD-N domains define a widespread, conserved functional principle for regulating effector deployment across diverse conflict systems. These observations helped us identify and explain the mechanisms of several novel components of prokaryotic and animal immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The ‘EAD principle’ helps identify bacterial Death-like domains closely related to metazoan Death domains</title><p>Despite sharing a basic ternary organization of invader sensing, threshold setting, and effector deployment components, the recently identified conflict systems enriched in multicellular prokaryotes differ in terms of the actual components that play these roles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). One major class of these have a threshold-setting regulatory core comprising a MoxR-type AAA+-ATPase-von Willebrand factor A (vWA) domain chaperone-cochaperone pair, with the effector domains typically occurring in the C-terminal region of the same polypeptide as the vWA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Different versions of these systems are defined by one of several distinct third components, such as the vWA-MoxR-associated protein (VMAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, top-left panel) or the inactive STAND NTPase module (iSTAND; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, middle two panels). The system-specific third components have invader-recognition and multimeric assembly domains further linked to N-terminal signaling domains that are predicted to facilitate effector activation through nucleotide-derived or proteolytic signals. Other ternary systems have a core GTPase-switch along with their own invader recognition and effector components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, top-right panel). Despite these disparate elements, we observed that these systems frequently share one or more of 12 distinct, small, non-catalytic domains showing parallel domain-architectural and predicted functional features. Since these domains are typically coupled with effector domains, we termed them the effector-associated domains (EADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). In the ternary systems, they are most frequently coupled to the system-specific third component, for example, at the N-terminus of the VMAP or iSTAND proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). Additional genes encoding EAD proteins occur in the same operon as the genes for the core ternary system or elsewhere in the genomes of organisms possessing such systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lower panel). Further, the EADs encoded in genomic proximity to each other or by the same organism tend to be more closely related than their counterparts from other genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Thus, by tracking the EADs we were able to identify other predicted core counter-invader conflict systems beyond the original ternary systems. Their domain compositions pointed to diverse activating mechanisms, such as proteolysis by either trypsin-like or caspase-like peptidases (respectively NucA-trypsin and EACC1 systems; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these observations helped define a widespread organizational feature of these conflict systems, that is, the EAD principle: the EADs increase the range of effector and signaling domains that can be recruited to and deployed by a core system via homotypic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). This pointed to a functional analogy between the EADs in these bacterial systems and the homotypic interactions mediated by the Death-superfamily adaptors in metazoan apoptosis/immune systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Park et al., 2007</xref>). Augmenting this equivalence, we found that 9 out of the 12 EADs are α-helical domains with structural parallels to the metazoan Death-like superfamily domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Moreover, we found two distant bacterial homologs of the Death-like superfamily among the EADs, namely bDLD1 (EAD3) and bDLD2. These are present in the vWA-MoxR ternary systems respectively with VMAP and iSTAND modules as their third component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Instigated by these findings, we used the procedure of domain architectural analysis followed by iterative sequence profile searches to find any new EADs that might throw further light on their evolutionary and/or functional relationship to the Death-like superfamily. As a result, we retrieved a novel family of bacterial Death-like domains (e.g., GenBank accession: OUL31312, <italic>Nostoc</italic> sp. T09; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) associated with predicted counter-invader systems such as the vWA-MoxR-iSTAND ternary system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B, C and D</xref>). We accordingly named this the bacterial Death-like domain-3 (bDLD3). Remarkably, unlike bDLD1 and bDLD2, bDLD3 is closely related to metazoan Death domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). For instance, sequence profile searches with a bDLD3 domain from <italic>Nostoc</italic> (GenBank: OUL31312.1) as query recovered the eukaryotic Death domain in iterative PSI-BLAST searches (e.g., the nematode <italic>Gongylonema</italic> VDN25015.1 in iteration 2, e-value 10<sup>–6</sup>). A multiple alignment of bDLD3 showed that it shares key conserved residues with the classical metazoan Death domain including tryptophans in helices 2 and 4, and an RxD motif at the beginning of the terminal helix 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib221">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib216">Weber and Vincenz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). bDLD3 is more widespread in bacteria and displays a broader range of domain architecture and gene neighborhood associations than bDLD1 and bDLD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). Like the earlier described ternary systems, bDLD3 shows a statistically significant propensity to occur in bacteria with a multicellular habit, such as members of actinobacteria, proteobacteria, cyanobacteria, nitrospinae/tectomicrobia, and planctomycetes (p<italic>=</italic>3.179 × 10<sup>–14</sup>; calculated using the hypergeometric distribution; see Materials and methods). Predicted effector domains fused to bDLD3 include catalytic domains involved in NAD<sup>+</sup>/nucleotide-processing (TIR, purine/pyrimidine nucleotide phosphorylase [hereinafter PNPase]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Essuman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Mao et al., 1997</xref>), protein modification (S/T kinase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib205">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>), proteolysis (caspase and trypsin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Aravind and Koonin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Barrett and Rawlings, 1995</xref>), and hydrolysis of membrane-lipids (α/β-hydrolase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Holmquist, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). The versions fused to caspases are often linked in an operon to a gene encoding an AP-ATPase (a member of the STAND clade of NTPases typified by the animal apoptosome proteins APAF1/Ced-4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Leipe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Saleh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Chaudhary et al., 1998</xref>). As with other EADs, bacteria (where complete genomes are available) frequently possess multiple copies of bDLD3, where one copy is fused to C-terminal effectors and the other to the N-termini of core components of the ternary system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, mimicking the earlier-reported fusion in a ternary system of the bDLD1 to the iSTAND module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>), in this work we recovered a fusion of bDLD3 to the iSTAND domain in a <italic>Thiotrichaceae proteobacterium</italic> (HID99200.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Again, like in the first system where an adjacent gene codes for a second copy of bDLD1 fused to a trypsin-like peptidase effector domain, in the current system we found a second neighboring gene coding for a bDLD3 domain fused to a trypsin-like peptidase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The same organism also has two other bDLD3 domains elsewhere in the genome, of which one is fused to a Clp-like AAA+ ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Hoskins et al., 2001</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Domain and gene neighborhood contexts of the bacterial Death-like domains (bDLD).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative gene neighborhoods coding for bDLD3 proteins.

Consequently, we detected systems in which the bDLD3-encoding gene was genomically linked to 3′ MoxR-vWA pairs typical of other ternary systems (e.g., <italic>Micromonospora</italic>, WP_144082196); however, in these it was fused to an unknown module that took the place of the third component VMAP or iSTAND modules of the previously described ternary systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This unknown module was additionally seen in several MoxR-vWA systems, where it was fused to N-terminal EAD1 or EAD8 domains that took the place of bDLD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Through profile-profile comparisons with the HHpred program, we found this unknown module to be a previously unrecognized inactive STAND NTPase module (p-value 10<sup>–6</sup> for iSTAND and p=1.2–2.2 × 10<sup>–4</sup> for other STAND NTPases); accordingly, we named it iSTAND2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In the known VMAP and iSTAND systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>), the effector domains are most often directly connected to the C-terminus of the vWA component by an α-helical linker domain, the vWA-L. In the iSTAND2 systems, as in a minority of iSTAND systems, the vWA-L with C-terminal effector domains is encoded by a separate gene adjacent to that coding for the vWA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Using this gene neighborhood template, we identified a further class of MoxR-vWA ternary systems that contain a gene coding for a protein with the vWA-L fused to C-terminal effector domains adjacent to the separate vWA gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The conserved 5′ gene of these systems codes for the third component typified by a novel α + β domain distinct from the third component of all other MoxR-vWA ternary systems; we named it TERNS3 for <italic>tern</italic>ary <underline>s</underline>ystem component <underline>3</underline> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Both these new systems, like the earlier-described ternary systems, are mainly found in multicellular cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, chloroflexi, and proteobacteria (iSTAND2: p<italic>=</italic>2.67 × 10<sup>–3</sup>; TERNS3: p<italic>=</italic>4.106 × 10<sup>–17</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Both iSTAND2 and TERNS3 are linked to some of the same signaling domains associated with the VMAP and iSTAND modules, either via direct N-terminal fusions or via fusions to EADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). In the case of iSTAND2, this linked domain is predominantly a trypsin-like domain and infrequently a cNMP cyclase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Murzin, 1998</xref>), which are fused to either the same EADs or bDLD3 corresponding to that found at the N-terminus of iSTAND2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). In the TERNS3-containing systems, the most common association is with the TIR domain and less commonly with proteases (e.g., the circularly permuted transglutaminase-like peptidase; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Anantharaman et al., 2001</xref>), both showing direct fusions. These contextual connections suggest subtle differences in the predominant regulatory mode of the iSTAND2 and TERNS3 ternary systems, with the former probably mainly depending on a proteolytic activation step and the latter typically using a NAD<sup>+</sup>-derived signal with a ADP-ribose (ADPr) moiety generated by the TIR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Burroughs and Aravind, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Essuman et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the effectors fused to the vWA-L domain, some of these systems contain genes coding for additional effectors fused to the cognate EADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). The classes of effector domains found in the iSTAND2- and TERNS3 systems overlap with those in the VMAP and iSTAND ternary systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). These include restriction endonuclease fold (REase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib202">Steczkiewicz et al., 2012</xref>), supersecondary structure forming α-helical repeats, small-molecule kinase (related to aminoglycoside kinases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Hon et al., 1997</xref>), S/T/Y protein kinases, TIR, FtsK ATPases (both active and inactive copies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>), and the cyanobacteria-specific tetrapyrrole-binding GUN4 and FGS domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Davison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Doulatov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). Both iSTAND2- and TERNS3 systems, like the previously described VMAP-ternary systems, also feature receiver domains occurring independently of histidine kinases as potential effectors. We predict a role for these comparable to the recently described versions of the receiver domain in biological conflict systems that might function independently of histidine kinases as nucleotide-responsive switches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Burroughs and Aravind, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib217">West and Stock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Pao and Saier, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Iyer et al., 2021</xref>). Unique to the iSTAND2 systems are effectors containing a modified nucleic-acid-binding PUA domain fused to a STAND NTPase and inactive zincin-like metalloprotease domains (e.g., <italic>Varivorax</italic>; WP_077000516.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Iyer et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib203">Stöcker et al., 1995</xref>). Unique to certain TERNS3 systems are effector modules with the RNA-binding OST-HTH domain fused to multiple OB fold S1 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Anantharaman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These point to the potential recognition of both modified and unmodified nucleic acids as part of the response to the invasive elements by these systems. In some TERNS3 systems, we observed a unique signaling ensemble in the form of a Ubl-conjugation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Iyer et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Burroughs et al., 2012a</xref>) with an E1 ligase coupled to Ubl and E2 components, both fused to EAD1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These are likely recruited to the core TERNS3 domain that is furnished with its own N-terminal EAD1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>bDLD3 and EAD10 help identify counter-invader systems respectively with lectin fold and RNA polymerase-association modules</title><p>EADs link biochemically disparate effector domains to the regulatory core of counter-invader conflict systems. These effector domains might also be found independently of EADs as part of other (often simpler) counter-invader systems. Thus, the EAD-linked domains help define potential novel effectors and conflict systems that possess them. This postulate helped us identify multiple previously unrecognized sets of conflict systems, two of which utilized lectin fold domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>) and were uncovered via bDLD3, and another one predicted to associate with the RNA polymerase (RNAP) that was discovered via EAD10.</p><p>The first of these are typified by the NPCBM (<italic>n</italic>ovel <italic>p</italic>utative <underline>c</underline>arbohydrate <italic>b</italic>inding <italic>m</italic>odule; Pfam: PF08305) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib188">Rigden, 2005</xref>), a member of the discoidin-like fold that includes numerous carbohydrate-binding (lectin) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Baumgartner et al., 1998</xref>). We observed loci with tandem genes (e.g., WP_052086955.1 of <italic>Nocardia seriolae</italic>) specifying proteins wherein bDLD3 is fused to either NPCBM or PNPase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, top panel). Closely related NPCBM domains are frequently fused to known effectors such as TIR and S/T/Y-type kinases and are encoded in conserved gene neighborhoods coding for an AP-ATPase fused to TPR repeats and caspases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, bottom panel). The second of these systems are centered on the FGS domain (the so-called ‘Formylglycine-generating enzyme sulfatase’ in Pfam: PF03781) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alayyoubi et al., 2013</xref>), which has the same protein fold as another large class of lectin domains, the C-type lectins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">McMahon et al., 2005</xref>). In the cyanobacterium <italic>Symploca</italic> (NET60851.1), we found bDLD3 in an identical configuration as the above-described fusion with the NPCBM domain, except that the latter domain was replaced by the FGS domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, top panel). Further, a conserved gene neighborhood found in certain proteobacteria and nitrospinae codes for a pair of bDLD3 proteins: one of the bDLD3 domains is fused to STAND NTPase and FGS domains (acc: WP_089718394.1) and the other to a TIR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). This similarity in the domain architectural and contextual connections of NPCBM and FGS domains suggests that these are indeed functionally comparable.</p><p>The above-noted STAND NTPase-FGS combination is also found widely across several bacterial and archaeal lineages independently of its association with bDLD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). In these cases, the N-terminal bDLD3 is often displaced by a slew of other EADs (EAD1, EAD2, EAD7, and EAD8) or effector domains belonging to diverse functional classes: for example, nucleotide and NAD<sup>+</sup>-processing domains (TIR, DRHyd, calcineurin), peptidases (caspase, trypsin), and protein phosphorylation-related domains (S/T/Y-kinase, FHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Burroughs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Aravind and Koonin, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Durocher and Jackson, 2002</xref>). The central NTPase also shows some diversity – it might either belong to the NACHT clade or the MNS clade (Npun2340/2341 family) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Leipe et al., 2004</xref>) or a novel STAND NTPase clade that we term nSTAND1 (sometimes also present in the previously described EACC1 conflict systems; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). The STAND NTPase domain might also be displaced by other types of NTPase domains, namely the KAP ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Aravind et al., 2004</xref>), which was previously described as a player in anti-bacteriophage immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Clark et al., 2014</xref>) or the AP-GTPase, a small GTPase domain of the Ras-like clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), which is found in animal apoptotic proteins (e.g., the DAP protein kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Kawai et al., 1999</xref>]). As in the ternary conflict systems, the EAD genes associated with these systems are typically found in multiple copies. Here again, one copy of the EAD is fused to the N-terminus of aforesaid NTPases and the rest to distinct effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). We had earlier noted the FGS domain as an effector in several ternary conflict systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). As in those systems, here too the FGS genes are often associated with the components of the diversity generating system (DGR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib219">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), namely a reverse transcriptase and the four-helical domain accessory protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). These occur as either a neighboring locus or elsewhere in the genome. Hence, it is likely that as in the classical DGR and ternary systems, the FGS domain is diversified by the error-prone action of the reverse transcriptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alayyoubi et al., 2013</xref>). Further, organisms often have two or more copies of the NTPase-FGS system, each with distinct NTPase types and N-terminal EADs or effectors suggesting selection for diversification to cover for resistance on the side of the invaders.</p><p>The recruitment of two distinct lectin fold domains, NPCBM and the FGS, to conflict systems, along with their similar contextual connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>) is reminiscent of the SPRY-like domains (SPRY, PRY, and Neuralized repeat) with the concanavalin lectin fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Ponting et al., 1997</xref>) that are prominent in eukaryotic immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">D’Cruz et al., 2013</xref>). In eukaryotes, the SPRY-like domains are coupled to effectors such as the RING finger or HECT domain E3 Ub-ligase (the TRIM proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Reymond et al., 2001</xref>), or the NACHT clade of STAND NTPases or different members of the Death-like superfamily (e.g., Death, Pyrin, and CARD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Papin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Chae et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). In several stramenopiles, the above-mentioned Ub-ligases might additionally possess a NPCBM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). In the well-studied TRIM systems, SPRY domains directly recognize viral molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib179">Perez-Caballero et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">James et al., 2007</xref>) (e.g., the glycosylated HIV capsid protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib222">Yap et al., 2005</xref>]). Based on these parallels, we propose that the NPCBM and the FGS domains directly interact with invasive molecules (viral nucleic acids or proteins) and recruit other catalytic effectors to evince downstream action, such as apoptosis, to limit the invader. Since lectin domains can recognize glycosylated macromolecules, these could be one possible target (see below). In the case of the FGS domain, the associated DGR suggests that these could be potential analogs of vertebrate adaptive immunity receptors that undergo hypermutation to bind a wide diversity of invader molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Boehm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010</xref>). Further, the significant preponderance of both NPCBM (actinobacteria) and FGS (cyanobacteria) systems in multicellular bacteria (p=2.7 × 10<sup>–36</sup> and p=3.7 × 10<sup>–5</sup>, respectively) implies that they are part of the unique immune processes of such organisms, which are regulated by the associated NTPase domains, ternary systems, or other fused signaling domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In a similar vein, EAD10 led us to a previously unrecognized prokaryotic conflict system that is widespread in bacteria and sporadic in archaea. The archetypal member of this system features an EAD10 domain fused to a constant (but rapidly evolving) C-terminal region comprised of TPR repeats a GreA/B-C domain, and a hitherto undetected version of the PIN domain (WP_017307658.1 from the cyanobacterium <italic>Fischerella</italic> sp.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). In other examples of this system, EAD10 is replaced by 1 of 13 different effector domains, such as DNase (REase, HNH), NAD<sup>+</sup>/nucleotide-targeting (PNPase, TIR, SIR2), and peptidase (trypsin, papain fold transglutaminase-like domain: BTLCP) domains, and an uncharacterized effector domain also found at the N-terminus of certain fungal heteroincompatibility HetE proteins.</p><p>The GreA/B-C is a domain related to the FKBP-like peptidyl prolyl isomerases that occurs in the bacterial transcription elongation factors GreA and GreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib201">Stebbins et al., 1995</xref>) and transcription inhibitors like Gfh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib204">Tagami et al., 2010</xref>). This domain engages the universally conserved coiled-coil segment that forms part of the RNAP secondary exit channel in the β′ subunit, which is needed to accommodate the 3′ end of the back-tracked transcript and the diffusion of soluble nucleotide substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelkareem et al., 2019</xref>). Given that these systems mostly occur as standalone genes, with few conserved gene neighbors, we predict that they act by themselves on the RNAP complexes that have been hijacked to transcribe viral DNA. It is conceivable that the GreA/B-C domain of these proteins engages the RNAP β′ coil-coil as in conventional transcription elongation and causes the transcript to be extruded into the secondary channel. It can then be cleaved by the C-terminal PIN domain. However, if this action on the transcript were to fail due to viral inhibition or the overwhelming of this line of defense, the N-terminal variable effector could be activated either directly or via EAD-EAD interaction to unleash an apoptotic response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Bacterial and metazoan immunity systems with a vast array of TRADD-N domains</title><p>TRADD is a versatile adaptor protein that interacts via its Death domain with the cytoplasmic Death domains of multiple members of the TNFR family, activating different apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Micheau and Tschopp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Hsu et al., 1995</xref>).

For example, PSI-BLAST searches initiated with a TRADD-N domain of <italic>Anaerolineales bacterium</italic> (GenBank: MBE0669634.1, region 141.232), in addition to numerous bacterial sequences, recovered several metazoan sequences with significant scores (e = 10<sup>–5</sup>-10<sup>–12</sup> within five iterations; e.g., amphioxus XP_035660412.1 e = 10<sup>–8</sup> in iteration 4). This search also recovered borderline hits to two starfish proteins (XP_022106408.1; <italic>Acanthaster planci</italic>; region 58.150, e = .08; XP_033636006.1, <italic>Asterias rubens</italic>; region 300.388, e = 0.09, iteration 6). Their relationship to the bacterial proteins was confirmed by reciprocal searches: for instance, a PSI-BLAST search seeded with the above region from the <italic>A. planci</italic> recovered significant hits to bacteria homologs (e.g., NEP55853.1 from the cyanobacterium <italic>Symploca</italic>, e = 10<sup>–5</sup>). Also recovered in these searches were the DNA-binding Death effector domain-2 (DEDD2/FLAME3) proteins of metazoans.

This hit overlapped with a model termed ‘Nucleic_acid_bd’ in the Pfam database (PF13820) defined by animal-specific proteins homologous to NCOA6.

A multiple sequence alignment helped define the correct boundaries of this conserved domain in the animal NCOA6 proteins and secondary structure prediction along with a sampling of the conserved sequence motifs (see below) showed a complete congruence to the TRADD-N domain structure. Further, profile-profile searches with representatives of each of the newly recovered groups also hit versions of the conventional ACT and structurally related domains (e.g., Dystroglycan DAG1 and acylphosphatases; HHpred probability 68–72%) consistent with the previously established shared presence of a RRM-like fold in these domains and TRADD-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Park et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Tsao et al., 2000</xref>).

We used a comprehensive multiple sequence alignment of the recovered TRADD-N domains to construct a phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Despite being a small domain, it showed multiple well-separated metazoan LSEs within them. The bacterial sequences appear to form a basal group from within which two distinct metazoan clade clades have emerged. The first of these encompasses the NCOA6 and related LSEs of metazoan proteins. The second encompasses the DEDD2, vertebrate TRADD, and related LSEs from various metazoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

The bacterial TRADD-N domains are found in multidomain proteins, usually occurring in-between distinct N- and C- terminal domains. The N-terminal domains tend to vary greatly even between closely related organisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and include enzymatic ones such as TIR, PNPase, HNH, REase, calcineurin-like phosphoesterase, caspase, or a novel nucleotidyltransferase domain of the DNA polymerase-β superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Aravind and Koonin, 1999a</xref>) or non-enzymatic domains, viz., extracytoplasmic sigma-factor (ECF)-like HTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Heimann, 2002</xref>) or EADs (EAD1, EAD4, EAD7). The overlap in these domains with effector domains and EADs found in other counter-invader conflict systems suggests that they are the likely effector components of these systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, the ECF-like HTH domain points to a transcriptional response as a unique aspect of some of these systems. The C-terminal region typically contains supersecondary-structure-forming repeats such as pentapeptide, TPR, and HEAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Das et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Groves et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Bateman et al., 1998</xref>), or other enzymatic (STAND NTPase, caspase), small-molecule-binding (PAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Ponting and Aravind, 1997</xref>], GUN4), adaptor (bDLD3), or DNA-binding (HTH) globular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Aravind et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Some of these TRADD-N proteins are encoded in conserved gene neighborhoods with a further gene coding for a STAND NTPase of the AP-ATPase clade fused to C-terminal TPR repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Another group of the bacterial TRADD-N proteins are also encoded in conserved two-gene neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), whose second gene codes for a protein with a constant N-terminal module comprised of a novel α + β domain followed by a caspase domain. We termed the former domain EACC2 (Effector-associated Constant Component 2) by analogy to the similarly organized, previously described EACC1 systems with a comparable constant component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). The C-terminus of this protein is highly variable and contains one of several domains that might be either extracellular with accompanying TM helices (e.g., CHASE2 – a small-molecule receptor domain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib232">Zhulin et al., 2003</xref>) or intracellular (e.g., PDZ, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Doyle et al., 1996</xref>, S/T/Y-type protein kinase, and STAND NTPase domains; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Versions of this second gene also occur independently of the TRADD-N component, and in those instances the C-terminal region is again highly variable with fusions to several small-molecule-binding domains, supersecondary forming repeats, ADP-ribose-processing macro domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Slade et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib180">Peterson et al., 2011</xref>), trypsin-like peptidases, and multi-TM domains that might form membrane pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In the majority of these neighborhoods that are independent of the TRADD-N gene, there are additional genes encoding an ECF sigma factor and a TPR protein (Pfam: DUF1822). Given that the organization of these systems with the constant EACC2 and caspase domains is reminiscent of the previously described EACC1 systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>), we propose that these proteins might sense stimuli that then induce an autopeptidase activation of the system via the action of the constant caspase domain.

Similarly, we also observed fusions to known mediators of apoptosis, like the Bcl2 domain, FIIND, and the UPA-Zu5 module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">D’Osualdo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Cleary et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Pathan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">Tschopp et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, other representatives of this clade are fused to a wide range of RNase/RNA-binding domains in cnidarians and brachiopods such as the Piwi module, NYN RNase, HEPN RNase, the interferon-induced SF2 helicase DDX60, the RNAi pathway helicase Mov10, and RLR-like viral RNA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Burroughs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Miyashita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>).</p><p>This pattern of LSEs accompanied by great domain-architectural diversity even between closely related organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) is largely unprecedented among eukaryotic immune proteins. Hence, we closely examined the genomic neighborhood of these TRADD-N genes and found that in the DEDD2 clade there are several associations with retrotransposons. Moreover, there are certain examples with direct fusions of the TRADD-N-coding genes to retrotransposons and cut and paste DNA transposons related to Mutator/Mule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Dupeyron et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, we propose that this diversity of architectures with novel fusions is at least in part generated by the transposition of retrotransposons carrying reverse-transcribed segments of conflict-related genes or by the integration of reverse-transcribed transcripts into neighborhoods of TRADD-N coding genes. The resulting gene fusions are then likely to be selected if they provide an advantage against invasive elements. This might explain fusions to whole conflict-related genes that otherwise occur independently of TRADD-N domains in other organisms. Thus, these systems might be seen as paralleling the diversity generated via reverse-transcription in the prokaryotic DGR systems or the immune receptor diversification in <italic>Branchiostoma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib219">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Huang et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Mechanistic implications of the bacterial Death-like domains and TRADD-N domains</title><p>The discovery of unambiguous bacterial versions of the Death-like superfamily and the characterization of the diversity of the TRADD-N domains helps clarify general, unifying mechanisms at the heart of apoptosis and immunity. Although both superfamilies of domains show similar architectural and/or genome contextual linkages to a formidable array of distinct effectors in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>), they appear to define two distinct mechanistic principles. A key observation in this work is the identification of a common organizational principle unifying the Death-like domains and the bacterial EADs, thereby placing the former within the spectrum of the radiation of EADs in prokaryotic counter-invader conflict systems. Indeed, in profile-profile searches we were able to recover hits between certain EADs, bDLDs, and members of the metazoan Death-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In bacteria, the common organizational principle is reflected in both the genomic context and domain architectures of the EAD and bDLD proteins. Regarding genomic context, EADs or bDLDs are encoded in multiple copies in the same locus or genome. With respect to domain architectures, they show a statistically significant tendency (p=3.177 × 10<sup>–47</sup>, χ<sup>2</sup>-test) to be N- or C-terminally positioned domains that are coupled to other effector and signaling domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>This terminal positional bias in the domain architectures is also reflected in the metazoan Death-like superfamily (p=6.6 × 10<sup>–56</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Thus, it points to a common role for these domains in bridging different proteins of the apoptotic or immune systems via homotypic interactions to allow the stepwise or aggregated unfurling of the response cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>). Alternatively, certain versions of the Death-like superfamily, like the Pyrin domains, self-assemble into large multimeric complexes through a prion-like templating mechanism, resulting in cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Comparable filament formation has recently been observed with other effectors (e.g., the TIR domain) and sensors (e.g., the cyclic oligonucleotide-binding STING) in eukaryotic and bacterial immunity, suggesting that it is a more widespread phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Gentle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Morehouse et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, our findings imply that the spectrum of interactions ranging from bridging of effectors and regulators to the self-templated assembly of polymeric complexes is a common function of the EADs and Death-like domains, which has been repeatedly and independently exploited by immune/apoptotic systems of both bacteria and metazoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>).</p><p>The TRADD-N domain shows a rather contrasting positional bias, with a significant tendency to occur between two other globular domains in a single copy within multidomain architectures (p=6 × 10<sup>–68</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Further, the newly identified TRADD-N proteins frequently show constant regions combined to regions showing variability in the types of their constituent domains, with the TRADD-N domain usually lying at the junction of the constant and variable parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As noted above, a Ser residue, which in TRADD-N plays a key role in interacting with its MATH domain partner, is conserved across bacterial and eukaryotic TRADD-N domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Park et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Hsu et al., 1996</xref>). However, the MATH domain is absent in bacteria and there are no corresponding expansions of MATH domains in the organisms with expansions of TRADD-N. Hence, despite the conserved aspect of the interface, the MATH domain is not a universal partner for the TRADD-N domains. Analysis of the Shannon entropy plots of the different families of TRADD-N domains suggests that other than NCOA6 proper, TRADD, and DEDD2 proper, the remaining members of the superfamily have significantly higher mean column-wise entropies. This is an indication that they are under selection for diversification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This diversification tracks the variability in the types of domains in the flanking regions. These observations point to a unified model for the action of the TRADD-N domain across these systems that operates via the reconfiguration of protein-protein interactions. Based on the precedence of its role in TRADD and its bridging position in-between flanking domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), we posit that it interacts with both flanking domains to keep them in an inactive state under normal conditions. Upon the reception of an invader- or apoptotic signal, which is either directly sensed by one of the flanking domains or transmitted to it by upstream interactions, the interaction interface of the TRADD-N domain is reconfigured with the flanking domains assuming different conformations. We predict that this switch is mediated by the conserved Ser.</p><p>The consequence of these shifting interactions is likely to be twofold: first, it allows recruitment of the TRADD-N protein to a larger complex of apoptotic/immune-related proteins by favoring certain protein-protein interactions (e.g., recruitment of TRADD to the TNFR and in turn the TRAF2 Ub E3 ligase; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Hsu et al., 1996</xref>). This model is also consistent with the repeated, independent association of the TRADD-N domain with the Death-like superfamily domains (more generally EADs) that we observe in both bacteria and eukaryotes. These are likely to recruit the TRADD-N proteins to larger complexes via their homotypic interactions. Second, it is likely to unleash the associated effector domains to attack either self or non-self macromolecules. In some cases, the effector deployment could directly ensue from reconfigured interactions of the TRADD-N domain. In other cases, it might result from a cascading process such as proteolysis. In this regard, it is notable that we found the TRADD-N domain in polypeptides with the FIIND. This predicts that the TRADD-N proteins with ZU5/FIIND likely undergo autoproteolysis akin to the ZU5 protein PIDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">D’Osualdo et al., 2011</xref>), which might be critical for effector deployment. Further, the astonishing diversity of effector domains that we find fused to the TRADD-N domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) points to a potentially diversified ‘output’ that could tackle a wide range of invaders.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>‘Institutionalized’ systems and marine ecology-specific immune responses based on the TRADD-N domain</title><p>The transcriptional coactivator NCOA6 is the only TRADD-N protein that is retained in a single copy across most of metazoa and also does not contain any conflict-related domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). Its conservation pattern, including the characteristic Ser residue, suggests that it mediates a switch through protein-protein interactions similar to that proposed for the other TRADD-N domains. However, its above-noted features suggest that, early in metazoan evolution, this TRADD-N domain was coopted and ‘institutionalized’ for a conserved role in transcription, probably acting as a switch during the recruitment of the histone methylation complex to specific transcription factors. This transcriptional role is paralleled by the prokaryotic versions associated with ECF-sigma factor HTH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Heimann, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The apoptosis/immune-related TRADD-N domains show a contrasting phyletic pattern between vertebrates and invertebrates. The former show low numbers of TRADD-N domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Kysela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Dunin-Horkawicz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib189">Rokas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ameisen, 2002</xref>), and those involved in apoptosis/immunity are nearly always the orthologs of DEDD2 and TRADD. In contrast, phylogenetically distant lineages of invertebrates show expanded repertoires of diverse TRADD-N domains, which are typified by striking lineage-specific differences in domain architectures, even between closely related species. Further, such expansions are restricted to marine species, namely cephalochordates, hemichordates, echinoderms, molluscs, brachiopods, cnidarians, and sponges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). Beyond this, it is notable that every marine group showing such LSEs of TRADD-N domains are either largely sessile as adults (e.g., sponges, cnidarians, brachiopods, bivalve molluscs, and hemichordates) or show slow-moving massive herding behavior (e.g., sea cucumbers and starfishes) or dense seasonal aggregation (amphioxus) in marine environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Könnecker and Keegan, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Marquet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Craeymeersch and Jansen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Kenchington and Hammond, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Frankenberg, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Piper, 2015</xref>). This is exemplified by the fact that arthropods or cephalopod molluscs, which, like vertebrates, tend to be highly motile, have very few (e.g., DEDD2) or no TRADD-N domains. We quantified this tendency using the previously devised metric the polydomain score (PDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Schäffer et al., 2020</xref>) that captures both the prevalence (tendency to occur as LSEs) and the domain architectural complexity of a class of proteins in a given organism as a single number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; see Materials and methods). Whereas the majority of organisms show TRADD-N proteins with comparable PDS, the above-mentioned marine metazoans are dramatic outliers, with significantly higher PDS than the mean of 74 (often orders of magnitude greater; range of 300–9000; p&lt;10<sup>–6</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that the TRADD-N proteins are a feature of a peculiar form of immune response that is strongly selected in certain marine environments, like reefs or shallow ocean floors, where these animals aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Palmer and Traylor-Knowles, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The diversification of the TRADD-N-associated variable effector domains, between even closely related species (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, first two networks), is notable. More specifically, we observed that they feature (1) known RNA receptors (e.g., RLR), RNA-binding domains (e.g., KH, RRM), and RNA-targeting endonucleases (e.g., HEPN, NYN). These suggest RNA viruses or retroviruses/mobile retrotransposons to be potential stimulating signals as well as targets for these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). (2) Superstructure-forming repeats (e.g., β-propellers and ankyrins) associated with the TRADD-N domains suggest that they might directly recognize invader molecules to activate the TRADD-N conformational switch to unleash associated effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). (3) TRADD-N proteins in receptor-like architectures in the bivalve <italic>Crassostrea</italic>. This suggests that external stimuli in the form of direct adherence of pathogens or activated immunocytes might also trigger the TRADD-N switch. In this case, the pathogens could also include cellular forms, including infectious tumor cells that have been reported in these molluscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Collins and Mulcahy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Oprandy et al., 1981</xref>). (4) Ub-system domains like Ub and Ub-ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Burroughs et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Burroughs et al., 2012b</xref>): these suggest responses involving ubiquitination of invader proteins as well as recognition of invader proteins ubiquitinated by other E3 ligases involved in anti-invader defense. This array of effector domains is consistent with both direct targeting of invader molecules and containment of the invader via apoptosis. Moreover, their variability also indicates an arms-race scenario potentially driven by rapidly evolving resistance to the effectors in the invaders either from sequence divergence in the targets or due to the effectors being nullified by invader-derived inhibitors.</p><p>Finally, it is notable that the TRADD-N domains are shared not just between disparate metazoans with similar ecology but also disparate multicellular bacteria with similar sessile aggregations or colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Hence, they are likely to mediate a mechanism of immunity that was likely acquired by animals from these multicellular bacteria and fixed due to similar selective pressures. Given the above observations, we posit that marine aggregations might be susceptible to a variety of pathogens that might rapidly spread through them. In these animals, the TRADD-N proteins were probably selected for as a confluence for a diversified repertoire of immune mechanisms of disparate provenance that function independently in other metazoans. Intriguingly, these phylogenetically disparate metazoans also uniquely share certain domain architectures of TRADD-N proteins to the exclusion of the rest. For example, the glycosyltransferase GT4-TRADD-N combination (see below) is shared by cnidarians, cephalochordates, and hemichordates and no other metazoan species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). This raises the possibility of some of these immune genes spreading through lateral transfer in marine environments. This possibility is strengthened by the above-noted association with retrotransposons, some which have been noted to jump between different marine species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Metzger et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>TRADD-N proteins help identify novel effector-deployment systems</title><p>Spurred by the observation that the metazoan TRADD-N proteins bring together a wide array of potential effector domains, we carefully analyzed these to detect previously unrecognized effector-deployment systems.

GT4 domains are also found independently of the TRADD-N domain in a massive LSE of over 500 paralogs in the coral <italic>Acropora digitifera</italic>. Beyond the GT4 domain, these proteins display high variability of domain architecture with fusions to several other domains suggestive of roles in biological conflicts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). We found that the metazoan GT4 domains are closest to the versions found in a range of bacterial conflict-related contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) such as the above-noted GreA/B-C systems. Homologous GT4 domains are also found in the effector position in the recently described MoxR-vWA-dependent VMAP and caspase-dependent CATRA ternary conflict systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Burroughs and Aravind, 2020</xref>).

Several of these are found frequently fused to various classical STAND NTPase modules, such as AP-ATPase, NACHT, and SWACOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Leipe et al., 2004</xref>), often in a C-terminal position comparable to the above-reported fusions of related STAND NTPases to different lectin fold domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). A subset of these STAND NTPase-GT4 proteins also contain additional N-terminal effector domains, namely TIR and caspase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, last column). Beyond these, the GT4-STAND NTPase domain fusions sometimes occur as part of proteins encoded by a distinct, mobile, bacterial two-gene operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The constant core of both proteins encoded by this operon are STAND NTPase modules. These STAND NTPases define a novel family that is closer to the recently reported CR-ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib230">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), the mitochondrial apoptotic ribosomal protein S29/Dap3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Kim et al., 2007</xref>), and another mitochondria-associated STAND NTPase RNA12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Hanekamp and Thorsness, 1996</xref>) than to the above-mentioned classic STAND domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib230">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). While both proteins possess a conserved arginine finger, suggesting that they form a toroidal hetero-multimer, the NTP-binding motifs of one of these STAND proteins have eroded, indicating that it is inactive like the iSTAND and iSTAND2 versions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). This inactive STAND module is fused to variable, predicted effector modules that are most commonly either a GT4 domain or a HEPN RNase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>The GT4 domain is also found in the effector position of another prokaryotic conflict system centered on the AP-GTPase proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), which are homologs of their metazoan counterpart, the apoptotic DAP protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Kawai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Bialik and Kimchi, 2012</xref>). In these proteins, the AP-GTPase and associated COR domain are fused to rapidly evolving N-terminal leucine-rich repeats akin to those found in the intracellular pathogen-recognition module of the NACHT clade in animals and the AP-ATPase clade in plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">McHale et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Correa et al., 2012</xref>). Their C-terminal region shows an assortment of variable domains, which is a kinase in the case of the metazoan DAP. In bacteria, this position is occupied by at least 24 different domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), which, in addition to the GT4 domain, include the usual array of frequently found effectors from conflict systems such as the TIR, DRHyd, caspase, trypsin and FGS domains, or different EADs. A single bacterium can possess multiple copies of these proteins, each with a different effector domain (e.g., <italic>Haliscomenobacter hydrossis</italic>, a filamentous bacteroidetes possess 11 paralogous copies), suggesting a broad-based strategy to counter immune evasion and inhibition of effectors by the invaders.</p><p>Together, these observations suggest that the GT4 domain is a potential effector that is used in a variety of bacterial conflict systems both in intracellular counter-invader and inter-organismal conflict. Via lateral gene transfer, it has also been ‘drafted into’ and expanded in the immune systems of certain metazoans. Biochemically characterized metabolic versions of the GT4 family modify a variety of substrates such as glycoproteins, lipids and sugars, and metabolites like mycothiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Campbell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib214">Vetting et al., 2008</xref>). This, along with the expansion in animals, indicates that they might act in anti-pathogen conflicts via modification of the invader molecules to either directly neutralize their interactions or render them available to binding by lectin-like domains of conflict systems (see above). Alternatively, they could block interactions between invader and host molecules by glycosylation of residues at the interface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>FAM124-type VOC superfamily domains</title><p>We found the approximately 500-amino-acid-long, so-called FAM124 domain coupled to the TRADD-N domain in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">El-Gebali et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Several of these contain a conserved extension with a predicted caspase site, indicating that they are possibly regulated as part of a proteolytic cascade by cleavage at this site. The prototypic member of this family, FAM124B, which only has the FAM124 domain, is a nuclear protein that interacts with SWI2/SNF2 ATPase-driven chromatin-remodeling complexes such as CHD7 and CHD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Batsukh et al., 2012</xref>). Secondary structure prediction based on a multiple alignment indicated that the FAM124 domain is made of up of two subdomains with comparable secondary structure (Figure—source data 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Of these, the C-terminal β-α-β-β-β subdomain retrieves vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily dioxygenase/glyoxylase domains in iterative sequence-profile searches (e = 2 × 10<sup>–4</sup>, iteration 3). Members of this superfamily have two homologous tandem β-α-β-β-β structural units, with the β-sheets of two units (derived from the same or different polypeptides; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>) dimerizing to form an incomplete barrel-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">He and Moran, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Gerlt and Babbitt, 2001</xref>). Given that FAM124 shows a N-terminal region with a comparable secondary structure to the C-terminal unit that can be unified with the VOC superfamily, as well as the conserved motifs that interact with the linker between the two tandem subdomains, we propose that the N-terminal region represents the first repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>In most VOC superfamily members, the tandem units cooperate to coordinate divalent metal ions through residues in β1 and β4 of the two units and two vicinal oxygen atoms in the substrate. While these residues differ between VOC families, their positions are conserved across the families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">He and Moran, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Gerlt and Babbitt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Armstrong, 2000</xref>). Many FAM124 domains possess a highly conserved histidine and glutamate in the regions corresponding to β1 of the N- and C-terminal structural units, and glutamines in the β4 of the N- and C-terminal structural units (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Hence, the versions with these residues have the potential to coordinate a metal ion and exhibit catalytic activity. The VOC superfamily catalyzes diverse enzymatic reactions such as isomerizations, epimerizations, and oxidative ring cleavage (extradiol dioxygenase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Gerlt and Babbitt, 2001</xref>). Due to this diversity, the precise activity of FAM124 remains unclear. Based on its association with the CHD7 and CHD8 complexes, it is tempting to suggest that its enzymatic activity might be directed towards chromatin proteins, such as in the isomerization or restoration of glyoxalated amino acid side chains. Those TRADD-N-fused FAM124 domains, which lack the above-noted conserved residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), could still bind target proteins like the active versions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The newly identified conflict systems provide insights regarding the evolution of immune and apoptotic systems</title><p>In prokaryotes, highly regulated conflict systems, such as those described here and previously, are strongly correlated with a multicellular habit across phylogenetically distant lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). The thematically similar but lineage-specific domain architectures in both bacteria and multicellular eukaryotes suggest that a basic ‘vocabulary’ of apoptosis-related domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Dunin-Horkawicz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Aravind et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Hofmann, 2019</xref>) was recombined with each other and with other immune-related domains to constitute domain architectures with similar syntax in each of the disparate lineages that possess them. The presence of similarly expanded complements of TRADD-N and Death-superfamily proteins across distantly related aggregating marine invertebrates is one such case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). This argues for both the existence of a grammar of functional interactions between these domains and strong selective advantages for coupling immunity and apoptosis, especially in multicellular organisms across the tree of life. More specifically, our observations also elucidate the emergence of specific types of components in the tangled history of immune and apoptotic systems. We consider these in greater detail below.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NTPase switches, sensors and adaptors</title><p>More than two decades ago, it was observed that the STAND NTPases are a common denominator of the apoptotic systems in animals, plants, and fungi, which are shared with bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Aravind et al., 1999</xref>). The vast radiation of these NTPases in bacteria, along with the nesting of the eukaryotic versions within these bacterial radiations, indicated that they have been repeatedly acquired by eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Aravind et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Koonin and Aravind, 2002</xref>). Some examples like the NACHT telomerase subunit TLP1 and the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S29/Dap3 were early acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Koonin and Aravind, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Kissil et al., 1999</xref>), whereas other acquisitions are limited to certain lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Koonin and Aravind, 2002</xref>). Over this period, structural studies revealed how the metazoan AP-ATPases and NACHTs form toroidal complexes, such as the apoptosome and the inflammosome, that form a platform for NTP-regulated effector deployment in related processes in apoptosis and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Riedl and Salvesen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Duncan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Latz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Cain et al., 2000</xref>). In another direction, these studies also established that STAND NTPases belong to the CDC6/Orc clade of AAA+ NTPases, whose archetypal members mediate the assembly of the replication origin complexes in the archaeo-eukaryotic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Leipe et al., 2004</xref>). Further, the recent study of the CR-ATPases, which are ATPase domains found in secreted effectors deployed in eukaryotic inter-organismal conflict, revealed the evolutionary trajectory of the STAND NTPases from CDC6/Orc-related ATPase domains of the transposases of certain mobile DNA elements and Mu-like bacteriophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib230">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, it has also become clear that other NTPase regulatory domains, namely AP-GTPases and AIG-GTPases, also have an ultimately bacterial origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Aravind et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Leipe et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In bacteria, STAND NTPases are widely distributed and are implicated in several functions other than apoptosis proper, for example, as sensory switches in transcription regulation and antiviral defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Leipe et al., 2004</xref>). Recently, we uncovered a class of highly regulated prokaryotic conflict systems, the ternary systems, which are enriched in multicellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). These systems, together with those reported in the current work, firmly establish the connection of a subset of bacterial STAND proteins to immunity-linked apoptotic responses. A notable point emerging from these studies is the deployment of both active and inactive versions that span the evolutionary range of the STAND clade of NTPases from the more basal clades closer to the transposase ATPases and CR-ATPases to the well-known classical clades such as AP-ATPase, NACHT, and SWACOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Leipe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib230">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). The active versions show all the hallmarks of forming apoptosome/inflammosome-like toroidal complexes for effector deployment, akin to their eukaryotic counterparts.</p><p>In contrast, the inactive versions do not have functional precedents in the well-studied eukaryotic STAND systems. However, in the related hexameric ORC complex of eukaryotes, only two of the ATPase domains are active, though both the active and inactive versions bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Foss et al., 1993</xref>). Other STAND NTPases like the ribosomal S29/Dap3 GTPase have been shown to bind single-stranded RNA as monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Kissil et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib215">Waltz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Berger et al., 2000</xref>), an activity also probably possessed by the eukaryotic RNA12 STAND protein. We found at least three distinct versions of inactive STAND domains, two in the ternary systems (iSTAND and iSTAND2) and one in the system with GT4 and HEPN effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). In the case of iSTAND and iSTAND2, they are predicted to form the invader-sensing component. Hence, we propose that more generally the inactive STAND domains retain the ancestral nucleic-acid-binding role to act as nucleic acid receptors. Thus, they are predicted to function as the bacterial counterparts of metazoan nucleic acid receptors such as the RLRs and the superfamily-2 RNA helicase receptors (e.g., IFIH1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Chattopadhyay and Sen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib224">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the STAND NTPases appear to have taken two trajectories – first, as NTP-dependent switches for regulating the assembly of multimeric apoptotic/immune complexes and, second, as nucleic acid sensors, echoing the nucleic acid-binding capabilities of their ancient ORC/CDC6-like predecessors. In contrast, the AP-GTPases appear to have remained only as switches in both bacteria and metazoa.</p><p>This thematic equivalence among the invader-sensing modules of prokaryotic and eukaryotic conflict systems is also reinforced by our discovery of distinct multiple lectin fold sensors, viz., NPCBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib188">Rigden, 2005</xref>) and FGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alayyoubi et al., 2013</xref>), in prokaryotic conflict systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>).

While we have not yet observed any prokaryotic conflict systems deploying SPRY-like domains, it is notable that, like the FGS domain which was first reported in variable tail proteins of phages such as BPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Liu et al., 2002</xref>), the SPRY domain too has its origin in bacteriophage tail proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Iyer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Mackrill, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Bacterial provenance of apoptotic adaptor domains</title><p>As with the regulatory NTPases, studies over the past two decades have shown that much of the core ‘domain vocabulary’ of eukaryotic apoptotic systems, like TIR, PNPases, CIDE (CAD/DFF40)-like HNH endonucleases, caspases, ZU5 autopeptidases (e.g., in PIDD1) and components of the metazoan ASK signalosome, have their ultimate origins in bacterial conflict systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib229">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Aravind et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Koonin and Aravind, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Burroughs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Burroughs and Aravind, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib228">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Aravind et al., 2000</xref>). This work and the earlier-reported ternary systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>) again show that these domains are likely to be used comparably to the eukaryotic versions in bacterial counter-invader systems, especially in multicellular bacteria. However, the provenance of the adaptor domains such as those of the Death-like superfamily and TRADD-N, which are so critical to metazoan apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Park et al., 2000</xref>), remained mysterious. Here, we show that the eukaryotic Death-like and TRADD-N domains are found in bacteria. Notably, they possess domain architectures comparable to their counterparts in metazoan apoptotic/immune systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Moreover, the Death-like domains are part of a larger radiation of bacterial EADs that are adaptor components of bacterial counter-invader systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). This establishes that not just the enzymatic effectors but also key non-enzymatic adaptors were already in place in the bacterial systems that couple immunity and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings presented in this work offer a more complete picture of the intertwined evolutionary connections between immune and apoptotic systems of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Phylogenetically distant multicellular or social forms are threatened by intracellular invaders/pathogens that can rapidly spread from cell to cell across the ensemble. This, coupled with inclusive fitness due to their clonal nature or close relatedness, favors the origin of apoptotic mechanisms of defense that limit the invasions to the initially infected cells. Other components of the metazoan toolkit, such as components of the calcium stores system and adhesion molecules, have also been reported to have their roots in bacteria with multicellular tendencies (e.g., cyanobacteria) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Schäffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Aravind et al., 2003</xref>). Hence, special habitats that bring together colonial eukaryotes and bacteria (e.g., stromatolites) might have been the epicenters of the origin and spread of multicellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Lyons and Kolter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib194">Schirrmeister et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Bosak et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The tracing of the classical metazoan Death-like domain to the bacteria and the identification of the TRADD-N diversification adds to the functional understanding of these adaptor domains. Specifically, the predictions made regarding the mode of action of the TRADD-N domain could help understand the poorly understood immune systems of invertebrates. The prediction of shared immune mechanism across diverse invertebrates with comparable ecological features could help understand epidemics in marine ecosystems. Finally, we also believe that the predicted nucleic acid sensor and catalytic domains such as GT4 described here might help develop unique biochemical reagents to detect and modify biomolecules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Comparative genomics</title><p>The NCBI Taxonomy database was used to obtain the names and ranks of taxa.

The BLASTCLUST program was used for clustering for classification or filtering of nearly identical sequences. The program takes both the length of the pairwise alignment (L) and measure of similarity, that is, bit-score (S), as inputs; these were changed as per the degree of required clustering.

The boundaries of several domains in Pfam were corrected and expanded with additional divergent members that were not found by the original Pfam models to improve detections. Given the rapid sequence divergence of proteins in biological conflict systems, improved detection of homology both in terms of range (i.e., detection of more homologs) and depth (i.e., detection of more distant homologs) is an important issue. The former can be problematic because of the continuum of sequence divergence between homologs; hence, a single starting point might not be sufficient to detect all homologs in iterative sequence searchers. The latter arises from absence of ‘bridging’ sequences in the current database between two distant homolog groups. Hence, to achieve ‘sensitivity’ on both these accounts we used curated, successively constructed multiple alignments that encompass an increasing diversity of sequences to construct the profile for RPS-BLAST, HMM, and profile-profile HHpred searches.

hypergeometric test was used to test for association of systems described herein with multicellularity in prokaryotes thus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>): each prokaryotic organism in the above-mentioned complete genome database assembled from NCBI GenBank/RefSeq was systematically assessed and assigned a multicellularity flag (True, False, NA: when not known) using all available information obtained from the Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Whitman, 2015</xref>) and the available publications on the individual taxon. This allowed scoring of 7538 organisms in the database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) accounting for almost all prokaryotes except the candidate phyla radiation for which there is no information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Lyons and Kolter, 2015</xref>). This gave us the background frequency of organisms with or without a multicellular habit, which we used to test significance of the associations of the systems reported here for multicellularity using the hypergeometric distribution implemented in the phyper function of the R language. For this test, the four input values were: q = the number of organisms containing a copy of a given system that score as multicellular; m = the total number of multicellular organisms in the database; n = the total number of non-multicellular organisms in the database; and k = the total number of organisms with the given system drawn without replacement from the total set in the database. The χ<sup>2</sup> test for the bias in location of the domains in architectures was performed using its implementation in the R language in form of the chisq.test command.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>p-Values of profile-profile search (HHPRED) hits recovered with various effector-associated domains and bacterial Death-like domains as queries.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="octet-stream" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70394-supp1-v2.csv"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Hypergeometric distribution test for association of various conflict systems described in the text with multicellular prokaryotes.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="octet-stream" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70394-supp2-v2.csv"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Chi-squared statistics of the positional bias of major domains described in the study.</title><p>The left three columns show the frequency of domain occurrence in the various positions in unique architectures, and the probability of this occurring by chance is given in the rightmost column.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="octet-stream" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70394-supp3-v2.csv"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Position-specific entropy of sequences from multiple sequence alignments of various TRADD-N clades.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70394-supp4-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Polydomain scores of various TRADD-N-domain-containing species.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="octet-stream" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70394-supp5-v2.csv"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>Multicellular status of all organisms included in analysis of the significance of systems overrepresentation in multicellular prokaryotic genomes.</title><p>The multicellular flag is defined as either True, False, or NA (not enough information available).</p></caption><media mime-subtype="octet-stream" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70394-supp6-v2.csv"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70394-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

(2) These domains have emerged as part of a radiation of effector-associated α-helical adaptor domains that likely, via homotypic interactions, bring together diverse effector and signaling domains.(3) The TRADD-N domain links effector deployment to invader-sensing in multicellular bacterial and metazoan counter-invader systems.

Several times, the authors mention &quot;sensitive sequence analysis&quot; without actually telling what they have in mind. Clearly, the approach involves including hits even if sequence statistical measures are not fully supportive/borderline. This is not an error if other indicators (hydrophobic patterns, gene context in procaryotes, important functional residues, etc.) support the conclusion. It would be great if the authors transparently showed when their sequence analysis needed to become extra-&quot;sensitive&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>By sensitivity of sequence analysis we mean the capacity for improved detection of homology both in terms of range (i.e. detection of more homologs) and depth (i.e. detection of more distant homologs). The former is an issue because of the continuum of sequence divergence between homologs; hence, a single starting point might not be sufficient to detect all homologs in iterative sequence searchers. The latter arises from absence of “bridging” sequences in the current database between two distant homolog groups. Both are specifically important when studying proteins in biological conflict systems due to their rapid sequence divergence. Sensitivity can be increased by using curated, successively constructed multiple alignments that encompass an increasing diversity of sequences to construct the profile for RPS-BLAST, HMM and profile-profile HHPRED searches. We have now added more details to the Materials and methods explaining this (page 26, lines 7-16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. As a reader, I would appreciate a compression package of all the alignments, domain definitions, etc. in a computer-readable form (e.g., in aln format) as supplementary material. This would greatly help to make the work reproducible.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide in the supplementary material a compressed archive containing all alignments generated in this study as text alns. We will also be also submitting these alignments to the Pfam database for wide dissemination across the community upon publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>The manuscript is written clearly, all conclusions are backed by data. Yet, it would be helpful to have Results and Discussion being clearly distinguished.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that certain involved inferences are closely related to the actual observations, we have kept those beside the paragraphs reporting the latter. However, in response to this suggestion we now have a separate Results section that includes all the primary findings and a Discussion section (page 22) that only includes the more general context and implications of the findings in the former section along with possible evolutionary hypotheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The paper by Kaur et al. describes use of bioinformatics to look for relationships between genes encoding cell death proteins in bacteria and metazoans. While the focus is on adaptor proteins related to TRADD-N domains, many other domains are also covered.</p><p>With the caveat that I am not a bioinformatician or computational biologist, I found this paper to be outstanding. The clear and informative figures provide a rapid way for interested readers to see the composition, origin, and relationships of their favorite proteins.</p><p>The discussion is intelligent and revealing of evolutionary relationships and plausible explanations of how cell suicide could have been adaptive. They convincingly argue that prokaryotes use these proteins for defense: to detect foreign molecules, transmit signals, and implement responses.</p><p>The abundance, complexity, and ubiquity of these proteins amongst single-celled organisms suggests defense against other, invading, organisms was an early and very important adaptation during evolution, and perhaps more surprisingly, use of these proteins for the suicide of cells, in order to protect their relatives, was also an early and widely adopted strategy.</p><p>(Significance (Required)):</p><p>I am not qualified to verify the bioinformatic analysis.</p><p>I could not come up with any suggestions for how this manuscript could be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments on the impact, significance and import of the study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
