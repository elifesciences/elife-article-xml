than 50 years. Several hypotheses have been proposed, and the most widely accepted one is codon compensation, which suggests that phages encode tRNAs that supplement codons that are less frequently used by the host. Here, we combine several observations and propose a new hypothesis that phage-encoded tRNAs counteract the tRNA-depleting strategies of the host using enzymes such as VapC, PrrC, Colicin D, and Colicin E5 to defend from viral infection. Based on mutational patterns of anticodon loops of tRNAs encoded by phages, we predict that these tRNAs are insensitive to host tRNAses. For phage-encoded tRNAs targeted in the anticodon itself, we observe that phages typically avoid encoding these tRNAs, further supporting the hypothesis that phage tRNAs are selected to be insensitive to host anticodon nucleases. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that phage-encoded tRNAs have evolved to be insensitive to host anticodon nucleases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tRNA</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>mycobacteria</kwd><kwd>anticodon nuclease</kwd><kwd>phage defense system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Bacteriophages</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101003229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van den Berg</surname><given-names>Daan F</given-names></name><name><surname>Brouns</surname><given-names>Stan JJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VI.C.192.027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brouns</surname><given-names>Stan JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Costa</surname><given-names>Ana Rita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new perspective on the 50-year old mystery of why phages encode their own tRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) were first discovered in the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kresge et al., 2005</xref>) and have since been found to play a vital role in the central dogma of molecular biology in all living systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crick, 1970</xref>). During the 1960s, tRNAs were also reported in viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages or phages) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Weiss et al., 1968</xref>). We now know that phage-encoded tRNAs are widespread, especially among virulent phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailly-Bechet et al., 2007</xref>). Multiple hypotheses have been proposed for the role of these phage-encoded tRNAs. The most established being codon compensation, where codons rarely used by the host but necessary to the phage are supplemented by the tRNAs encoded by the phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailly-Bechet et al., 2007</xref>). Why phages are pushed toward these alternative codons is generally believed to be a side effect of differences in the GC content of phage and host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailly-Bechet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lucks et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Limor-Waisberg et al., 2011</xref>). A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yang et al., 2021</xref> may have hinted at an additional factor: phage tRNAs represent a means to counteract the depletion of host tRNAs that occurs as an early response to phage infection. The host employs several mechanisms to deplete its tRNA pool, such as downregulating the expression of its tRNAs, modifying tRNAs to make them unusable for translation, and most notably cleaving the tRNAs using anticodon nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thompson and Parker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailly-Bechet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amitsur et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wolfram-Schauerte et al., 2022</xref>). Exactly what activates host tRNA cleavage is often unknown; an exception is anticodon nuclease PrrC, which cleaves tRNA-Lys(ttt) when triggered after sensing phage T4-encoded protein Stp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaufmann, 2011</xref>). In response, phage T4 encodes a tRNA ligase that repairs the cleaved tRNA-Lys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaufmann, 2011</xref>). Recently, a phage-encoded tRNA was found to replenish the depleted host tRNA caused by phage defense system Retron Ec78 , thereby preventing the inhibition of phage propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azam et al., 2023</xref>). However, it remains unclear how phage tRNAs avoid being degraded by the same mechanism that results in the depletion of host tRNAs during phage infection. Here, we have analyzed phage-encoded tRNAs and hypothesize that the tRNAs encoded by phages are insensitive to tRNA anticodon nuclease activity, preventing depletion of the tRNA pool and translation stalling during phage infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To investigate our hypothesis that phage tRNAs are insensitive to tRNA anticodon nucleases, we analyzed the tRNAs encoded by a large and well-characterized dataset of tRNA-rich bacteriophages (33 tRNAs per phage on average) that infect mycobacteria: mycobacteriophage cluster C1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Russell and Hatfull, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We specifically selected this mycobacteriophage dataset because the bacterial host encodes a range of well-characterized tRNA nucleases (tRNAses), such as VapC, MazF, and RelE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Winther et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chauhan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cruz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">CintrÃ³n et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>). A subset of these tRNAses target the tRNA anticodon loop and are activated upon various stress responses, including phage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calcuttawala et al., 2022</xref>). Upon activation, these anticodon nucleases cleave specific tRNAs in conserved regions within the anticodon loop to inactivate the tRNAs and thereby regulate protein translation of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Winther et al., 2016</xref>). The cleavage region within the tRNA anticodon loop is sequence-dependent and highly specific to the type of tRNA. Mutations in the recognition and cleavage sequence within the anticodon loop have been found to result in insensitivity to these anticodon nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Winther et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cruz et al., 2015</xref>). To check phage tRNAs for mutations that are known to cause insensitivity to anticodon nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Winther et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cruz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chauhan et al., 2022</xref>), we compared them to those of their host. We found that all 10 mycobacteriophage-encoded tRNAs that are targeted by anticodon nucleases contained anticodon loop mutations known to affect cleavage by VapC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). These findings support the idea that phage-encoded tRNAs are insensitive to cleavage by anticodon nucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We propose that these phage tRNAs serve as a mechanism to counteract the depletion of tRNAs by anticodon nucleases during phage infection, thereby allowing the phage to translate its proteins and successfully complete the infection cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phage transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are predicted to be anticodon nuclease resistant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The genomic context of the tRNA clusters containing 36 tRNAs present in C1 mycobacteriophage Rizal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Russell and Hatfull, 2017</xref>).

Specifically, this avoidance is seen for the serine-coding tRNAs that are cleaved at the GA site within the anticodon (tRNA-Ser(g<underline>ga</underline>), tRNA-Ser(t<underline>ga</underline>), tRNA-Ser(c<underline>ga</underline>), and tRNA-Ser(a<underline>ga</underline>)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Winther et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). To compensate for this, the phage encodes a serine tRNA (tRNA-Ser(gct)) that is not targeted by nucleases. We observed the same avoidance for known targets of RelE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>), including stop codon (cta), tRNA-Leu(tta), and tRNA-Gln(cga) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Interestingly, when comparing the codon frequency of phage genes, we observed no differences in the codon frequency between codons for which the phage encodes a tRNA and those for which it does not (Welchâs two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t</italic> = 1.0471, df = 41.591, p-value=0.3011) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Moreover, we did not observe a difference in the codon frequency between phage and host genes (paired <italic>t</italic>-test, p-value=0.999) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). We also found that in only 2 out of 23 instances the preferred codon (i.e. the most frequently encoded codon per amino acid) of the phage did not match that of the host (tRNA-Val(cac) and tRNA-Ala(cgc)) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that the phage-encoded tRNAs were likely not selected for codon compensation. Overall, our findings support the hypothesis that phage tRNAs in mycobacteria evolved to resist anticodon nucleases in order to overcome host tRNA-depletion strategies that limit phage propagation. To investigate whether this hypothesis could extend more generally outside mycobacteria, we examined other species with anticodon nucleases, including <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> (VapC-LT2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Winther and Gerdes, 2011</xref>), <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (VapC, PrrC, Colicin D, and Colicin E5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Winther and Gerdes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaufmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amitsur et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ogawa et al., 2006</xref>), and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (VapC/MvpT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Winther and Gerdes, 2011</xref>). It is important to point out that the following analyses are based solely on the known cleavage site, and that the recognition sequence of these anticodon nucleases is unknown, thus limiting the ability to identify possible insensitivity-causing mutations in the recognition site of the anticodon loop. Despite this limitation, we observed mutations in the anticodon loop near or at the cleavage site of anticodon loop-targeted phage-encoded tRNAs in nearly all instances (9 out of 11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). When the anticodon itself was the target of the anticodon nuclease, as is the case for VapC-LT2 in <italic>S. flexneri</italic>, we found that the phage generally avoided encoding the target tRNA (tRNA-fMet), except for two instances. One of these is the phage-encoded tRNA-Lys(ttt) in coliphages. In this instance, the phage encodes a tRNA-Lys ligase (rnl1 and rnl2) that repairs tRNA-Lys(ttt) after it has been cleaved by PrrC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaufmann, 2011</xref>). The other instance involves phage-encoded tRNAs targeted by <italic>E. coli</italic> Colicin E5. The cleavage activity of Colicin E5 depends on modifying the wobble position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ogawa et al., 2006</xref>), which might be absent in these phage tRNAs possibly caused by mutations in the anticodon loop that we observed for three out of the four targeted tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). Alternatively, these mutations might affect the recognition by Colicin E5. In summary, our findings in mycobacteria are consistent with almost all (9 out of 11) currently known instances of targeted phage tRNAs in enterobacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). The discrepancies in these cases can be accounted for by the presence of tRNA ligases, reliance on tRNA modifications of the cleavage site, or mutations within the uncharacterized recognition site. Thus, we speculate that our hypothesis may be extended beyond mycobacteria and enterobacteria, given the ubiquity of virus-encoded tRNAs and host tRNAses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ogawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavard and Lazdunski, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jones et al., 2017</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose that phage-encoded tRNAs escape targeting by host tRNAses via insensitivity-causing mutations within the tRNA cleavage and recognition site.

It could be that the codons of cleaved tRNAs are also found in phage-encoded mutated tRNAs, but then why would we expect the phages to avoid them? Perhaps a better analysis would be to compare the anticodons of phage-encoded and host-encoded tRNAs.

Specifically, they propose that phage-encoded tRNAs are resistant to host-encoded tRNases that are activated by the host in response to phage infection. Consequently, phage-encoded tRNAs translation and phage propagation proceed despite the tRNA degradation induced by the tRNases. To investigate this hypothesis, the authors perform a sequence analysis of one class of phages that affect mycobacteria. They demonstrate that, of the 10 phage-encoded tRNAs that are expected to be targeted by mycobacterial tRNases, they all exhibit mutations in the tRNase recognition or cleavage sites that would be expected to prevent tRNA cleavage. In addition, the authors provide two examples supporting the idea that the sequences of phage-encoded tRNAs have evolved under selective pressure to avoid sequences expected to be cleaved by mycobacterial tRNases.

Abstract: &quot;bacterial genera&quot; may be more clear as &quot;bacterial host genera&quot;?</p><p>3. &quot;Based on mutational patterns of tRNA anticodon loops, we predict that phage tRNAs are insensitive to the host tRNAses&quot;: I was surprised to only find only a relatively simple analysis of a single host-phage group to support this broad claim. As currently written, this manuscript reads to me more like a nice preliminary observation rather than a complete study: there is no experimental confirmation of the hypothesis, the analysis is not extended beyond a single phage group and a single host, and the only statistical test performed was run on whole phage genomes when, most likely, the pattern the authors would expect would be specific to some (group of) genes only.</p><p>4. Introduction:</p><p>The current introduction is a bit short in my opinion, and could benefit from being expanded on some of the following topics: at which stage in the infection cycle do the depletion of host tRNAs occur, and how is it triggered? Is it more a defense used against lytic or temperate phages, and why? What is the mechanism(s) that hosts use to deplete the tRNA pool? Note that some information is currently in the first section of the results (&quot;We hypothesize [â¦] Figure 1D.&quot;), which I would argue would be a better fit in the introduction section instead.</p><p>5. Results and discussion:</p><p>&quot;We compared the tRNAs encoded by phages with those of their host and observed all 10 phage-encoded tRNAs that are known to be targeted by anticodon nucleases to contain anticodon loop mutations (Winther et al., 2016; Cruz et al., 2015; Chauhan et al., 2022), reinforcing the idea that phage-encoded tRNAs are likely insensitive to cleavage (Figure 1C).&quot;: This sentence is unclear to me, was this a new analysis run by the authors? If so, the analysis itself should be better described before reporting the results. Otherwise, it must be made clear to the readers that this is a previously published result, e.g. &quot;Previous studies compared.â¦&quot; or &quot;In previous studies, we compared.â¦&quot;</p><p>6. &quot;we also observed a strong counter-selection for tRNAs that are cleaved in the anticodon itself (Table S1)&quot;: Table S1 lists 168 tRNA, but it's unclear to me how a reader can go from this list to an observation of counter-selection for tRNAs predicted to be cleaved? I also could not find a legend to Table S1, so I don't understand some of the columns (&quot;Manual ACL to host&quot; ?), or even what the &quot;Sequence_ID&quot; refer to (phage genes ? Host genes ?)</p><p>7. &quot;we observed that phage genes do not avoid codons of cleaved tRNAs, nor do they have a preference for codons with nuclease insensitivity (Welch Two Sample t-test, t = 0.53848, df = 41.583, p-value &gt; 0.05), suggesting that the selection of phage tRNAs is only determined by their insensitivity to tRNAses and not by codon usage.&quot;: I am not sure I understand this claim. The way I understand it, either the phage tRNAs recognize the same codon as the host tRNAs, in which case there is no reason to think that codon usage would be impacted (regardless of tRNAse activity), or the phage and host tRNAs recognize different codons, in which case a selection for nuclease insensitivity should impact codon usage? I am not sure what I am missing here. Could the authors clarify how they link this lack of codon usage bias they observe with a selection determined by insensitivity?</p><p>8. Material and Methods: This section should provide more information on how the statistical enrichment/depletion in codon was performed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this short paper, van den Berg et al. hypothesize that viral tRNAs are resistant to host-encoded nucleases that suppress viral infections by destroying tRNAs. To support this hypothesis, they compared the tRNAs encoded in 161 mycobacteriophage genomes with those of their host and show that phage tRNAs contain mutations anticipated to make them resistant to cleavage by host nucleases. While the paper is unusually short and lacks biochemical evidence supporting the sequence observations, the sequence comparisons are compelling, and the concept has broad implications.</p><p>Figure 1a highlights the genomic context of 36 tRNAs present in C1 mycobacteriophage Rizal.

For this reason, we chose to investigate our hypothesis in Mycobacterium species, which has the most extensively researched (and diverse) anticodon nucleases with known target specificity.

As for point 7, we have performed the suggested comparison between the anticodons of the phage-encoded and host-encoded tRNAs and found that 29 out of 30 phage-encoded anticodons are also encoded by the host (Supplementary File 1b). In addition, we have compared the codon frequency of the phage and host and found no difference (Paired t-test, p-value = 0.999). Moreover, we found that in only 2 out of 23 instances, the preferred codon (i.e., the most frequently encoded codon per amino acid) of the phage did not match that of the host. Together, these observations suggest that the phage-encoded tRNAs were likely not selected for codon compensation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this computational and theoretical study, van den Berg et al. present a new hypothesis for why many classes of phages encode a large number of tRNAs.

Results and discussion:</p><p>&quot;We compared the tRNAs encoded by phages with those of their host and observed all 10 phage-encoded tRNAs that are known to be targeted by anticodon nucleases to contain anticodon loop mutations (Winther et al., 2016; Cruz et al., 2015; Chauhan et al., 2022), reinforcing the idea that phage-encoded tRNAs are likely insensitive to cleavage (Figure 1C).&quot;: This sentence is unclear to me, was this a new analysis run by the authors? If so, the analysis itself should be better described before reporting the results. Otherwise, it must be made clear to the readers that this is a previously published result, e.g. &quot;Previous studies compared.â¦&quot; or &quot;In previous studies, we compared.â¦&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text to better distinguish between previous results and results from analyses performed in this study.</p><p>âTo check phage tRNAs for mutations that are known to cause insensitivity to anticodon nucleases (Winther et al., 2016; Cruz et al., 2015; Chauhan et al., 2022), we compared them to those of their host. We found that all 10 phage-encoded tRNAs that are known to be targeted by anticodon nucleases contained anticodon loop mutations known to affect cleavage (Supplementary File 1a and Supplementary File 1b). These findings support the idea that phage-encoded tRNAs are insensitive to cleavage by anticodon nucleases (Figure 1C).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. &quot;we also observed a strong counter-selection for tRNAs that are cleaved in the anticodon itself (Table S1)&quot;: Table S1 lists 168 tRNA, but it's unclear to me how a reader can go from this list to an observation of counter-selection for tRNAs predicted to be cleaved? I also could not find a legend to Table S1, so I don't understand some of the columns (&quot;Manual ACL to host&quot; ?), or even what the &quot;Sequence_ID&quot; refer to (phage genes ? Host genes ?)</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a description to Supplementary Figure 1a and improved the descriptions of the columns. We added an abundance column that shows the abundance in percentages of C1 mycobacteriophages that carry specific tRNA sequences. We also removed columns that were not relevant to this work (tRNA_tail, host_tail, tRNA Type, and Accep. Host). Lastly, we created Supplementary Figure 1b to show the anticodons encoded by the host and phage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. &quot;we observed that phage genes do not avoid codons of cleaved tRNAs, nor do they have a preference for codons with nuclease insensitivity (Welch Two Sample t-test, t = 0.53848, df = 41.583, p-value &gt; 0.05), suggesting that the selection of phage tRNAs is only determined by their insensitivity to tRNAses and not by codon usage.&quot;: I am not sure I understand this claim. The way I understand it, either the phage tRNAs recognize the same codon as the host tRNAs, in which case there is no reason to think that codon usage would be impacted (regardless of tRNAse activity), or the phage and host tRNAs recognize different codons, in which case a selection for nuclease insensitivity should impact codon usage? I am not sure what I am missing here. Could the authors clarify how they link this lack of codon usage bias they observe with a selection determined by insensitivity?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point. To clarify the wording, we have changed âcodon usageâ to âcodon frequencyâ. When we compared to codon frequency of the phage to its host, we observed no difference (paired t-test, p = 0.999) (Supplementary Figure 1b). Additionally, we analyzed if frequently used codons by the phage, but rarely used by the host, are encoded by the phage to supply the tRNA pool of rare anticodons. To check this, we looked for codons that are preferred by the phage but rarely used by the host. In only 2 instances (tRNA-Val(cac) and tRNA-Ala(cgc)) out of 23 preferred codons (the most frequently encoded codon per amino acid) (Supplementary Figure 1b) that correspond to anticodons encoded by the phage, there was a difference between the phage and host-preferred codon, further supporting the notion that codon compensation is not a factor. Moreover, we have performed a comparison between the anticodons of the phage-encoded and host-encoded tRNAs and found that 29 out of 30 phage-encoded anticodons are also encoded by the host (Supplementary Figure 1b). We clarified the text as follows:</p><p>âInterestingly, when comparing the codon frequency of phage genes, we observed no differences in the codon frequency between codons for which the phage encodes a tRNA and those for which it does not (Welch Two Sample t-test, t = 1.0471, df = 41.591, p-value = 0.3011) (Supplementary Figure 1b). Moreover, we did not observe a difference in the codon frequency between phage and host genes (Paired t-test, p-value = 0.999) (Supplementary Figure 1b). We also found that in only 2 out of 23 instances, the preferred codon (i.e. the most frequently encoded codon per amino acid) of the phage did not match that of the host (tRNA-Val(cac) and tRNA-Ala(cgc)) (Supplementary Figure 1b). Together, these observations suggest that the phage-encoded tRNAs were likely not selected for codon compensation.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Material and Methods: This section should provide more information on how the statistical enrichment/depletion in codon was performed.</p></disp-quote><p>Our Material and Methods section has been carefully reviewed and updated to reflect the changes made to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this short paper, van den Berg et al. hypothesize that viral tRNAs are resistant to host-encoded nucleases that suppress viral infections by destroying tRNAs. To support this hypothesis, they compared the tRNAs encoded in 161 mycobacteriophage genomes with those of their host and show that phage tRNAs contain mutations anticipated to make them resistant to cleavage by host nucleases. While the paper is unusually short and lacks biochemical evidence supporting the sequence observations, the sequence comparisons are compelling, and the concept has broad implications.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs positive assessment of our manuscript.

A subset of these is anticipated to be targeted host anticodon nucleases (red). Consider comment on the other tRNAs and their biological roles.</p></disp-quote><p>We suspect that undiscovered host anticodon nucleases may also target other phage-encoded tRNAs, as evidenced by similar mutations in these tRNAs (Supplementary Figure 1a). It should be noted that these mycobacteriophages encode a large portion of the hostâs codons (29 out of 50) (Supplementary Figure 1b), suggesting that the primary purpose might be to replace a large part of the tRNA pool of the host, without any specific biological role apart from replacement. This aligns with the observation that some phages downregulate the host tRNAs to completely take over the tRNA pool (Son et al., 2022). Additionally, it is possible that some of these other tRNAs serve distinct biological functions, such as regulation. For example, some tRNAs may be intentionally encoded for cleavage, which has been shown in mammals to have distinct regulatory functions, such as interference RNAs (Fazio et al., 2022). Lastly, a recent preprint by Azam et al. (2023) sheds new light on the possibility that phage-encoded tRNAs are specific to replenish certain cleaved tRNAs targeted by the host anti-phage defense system. This is a more likely role for the tRNAs encoded by phages with few tRNAs, which supports our findings. However, the above-mentioned hypotheses for the role of these other phage-encoded tRNAs are too speculative and were difficult to add to the paper without deviating too much from the primary storyline.</p></body></sub-article></article>
