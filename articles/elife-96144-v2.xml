The EC integrates a wide range of cortical and subcortical inputs, but its synaptic organization in the human brain is largely unknown. We used volume electron microscopy to perform a 3D analysis of the microanatomical features of synapses in all layers of the medial EC (MEC) from the human brain. Using this technology, 12,974 synapses were fully 3D reconstructed at the ultrastructural level. The MEC presented a distinct set of synaptic features, differentiating this region from other human cortical areas. Furthermore, ultrastructural synaptic characteristics within the MEC was predominantly similar, although layers I and VI exhibited several synaptic characteristics that were distinct from other layers. The present study constitutes an extensive description of the synaptic characteristics of the neuropil of all layers of the EC, a crucial step to better understand the connectivity of this cortical region, in both health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>ultrastructure</kwd><kwd>autopsy</kwd><kwd>human</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2021-127924NB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeFelipe</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CSIC Interdisciplinary Thematic Platform</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cajal Blue Brain</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeFelipe</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/945539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeFelipe</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRE2019-089228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cano-Astorga</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FPU19/00007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plaza-Alonso</surname><given-names>Sergio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>3D electron microscopy provides the first extensive quantitative ultrastructural dataset of synapses of the human entorhinal cortex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The formation and consolidation of declarative memories require the interaction of rich networks that encompass multiple brain areas. Among them, the entorhinal–hippocampal connectivity is a key element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki and Moser, 2013</xref>). In primates, the entorhinal cortex (EC) is a brain region located in the anterior part of the medial temporal lobe, close to the hippocampal formation and the perirhinal (PRC) and parahippocampal (PHC) cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insausti et al., 2017</xref>). The EC acts as a major sensory interface, mediating the flow of information between the hippocampus and the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eichenbaum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Insausti and Amaral, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schultz et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, several studies have linked major neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, to alterations in the EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braak and Braak, 1992</xref>).</p><p>The EC is a complex brain region in terms of cytoarchitecture and connectivity. In human and non-human primates, it has been traditionally divided into several subdivisions, based on cytoarchitectonic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insausti et al., 2017</xref>). An alternative organization, which follows the connectivity patterns between the EC, the hippocampus, and parahippocampal regions, divides this area into two functionally defined parts: lateral and medial EC (LEC and MEC, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maass et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, LEC is highly connected to the PRC, providing the hippocampus with information about the content of an experience. As for MEC, it receives projections from the PHC (or the post-rhinal cortex in rodents) and provides the hippocampus with the spatial context of an experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knierim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reagh and Yassa, 2014</xref>). This connectivity-based division was first described in rodents and later in both human and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maass et al., 2015</xref>). The primate LEC comprises the rostrolateral region of the EC, whereas MEC extends through the caudomedial axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maass et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Witter and Amaral, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The connectivity between EC represents the major cortical afferent source of the hippocampus and has been studied in great detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Insausti and Amaral, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Witter and Amaral, 1991</xref>). EC upper layers (II and III) give rise to the perforant pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Insausti and Amaral, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Insausti and Amaral, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nilssen et al., 2019</xref>). In general, the classic trisynaptic circuit EC layer II → DG → CA3 → CA1 seems to be related to the acquisition of new memories, whereas the direct connection of EC layer III neurons with CA1 (and subiculum; S) (monosynaptic pathway) is thought to contribute to the strength of previously established memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen and Squire, 1980</xref>). Deep layers (V and VI) of the EC represent the main target of return connections from the hippocampus, which arise mainly from the CA1 and S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Insausti and Amaral, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saunders and Rosene, 1988</xref>). These deeply located neurons of the EC project to subcortical and cortical regions such as the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, the temporal pole and the superior temporal sulcus, as well as to frontal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Insausti and Amaral, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muñoz and Insausti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ohara et al., 2021</xref>). Recent studies have proposed that these deep layers of the EC not only represent simply a relay station between the hippocampus and other telencephalic regions, but also act as a crucial hub for information processing in the EC—hippocampal connectivity. For example, it has been proposed that deep layers of the EC integrate diverse inputs, on a multistep circuit between the hippocampus, the cortex and the superficial EC layers, which may be essential for episodic and spatial memory (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gerlei et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Most of the connectivity-based studies mentioned have been performed in experimental animals, mainly in rodents and monkeys. Although connectivity appears to be similar in all species studied, there are also species-specific variations. For this reason, we can only assume that the general pattern of connections of the human hippocampal formation is similar to that described in experimental animals, particularly non-human primates, but it is possible that there are significant differences. For example, in the monkey, only the most rostral part of the hippocampus is connected by commissural fibers from the subiculum to the contralateral EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Insausti and Amaral, 2012</xref>). In humans, commissural connections seem to be even more reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Insausti and Amaral, 2012</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Simon et al., 2022</xref> reported that excitatory neurons in layer VIb of the mouse EC project to all subregions of the hippocampal formation and receive input from the CA1, thalamus and claustrum.</p><p>Connectivity in the brain is mostly based on point-to-point chemical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeFelipe, 2015</xref>). Therefore, the synaptic properties of a region are a crucial aspect to be described, both in terms of connectivity and functionality. We can distinguish two major goals in studying synapses. First, studying connections between identified neurons, which consists of identifying the specific presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons involved in each synapse. Second, studying synaptic features in general, which includes quantifying synaptic density, identifying different types and sizes of synapses, and determining their postsynaptic targets (dendrites, somas, or other structures). Assessing the synaptic density in a particular brain region is crucial for understanding both connectivity and functionality. In particular, both the synaptic density (number of synapses per volume) and excitatory/inhibitory proportions are meaningful parameters to describe the synaptic connections of a particular brain region, which can be considered useful for understanding the synaptic circuits of any brain region.</p><p>In the human EC, synaptic organization remains largely unknown. There are several approaches available to study synaptic connectivity at the ultrastructural level in the mammalian brain, with the gold standard being volume electron microscopy. Some scientists consider that the best strategy is to study a relatively large volume of tissue in a given region using serial block-face electron microscopy to obtain saturated or dense reconstructions, even if only one individual can be examined using this approach due to the technical difficulties associated with this technology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karimi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Motta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winding et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shapson-Coe et al., 2024</xref>). However, we believe that volume electron microscopy can be exploited much more efficaciously if multiple samples of smaller volumes of tissue of the brain region of interest are examined in several individuals using focused ion beam (FIB)/SEM. Multiple sampling using volume electron microscopy is especially important when examining human brain tissue, not only because of the large size of the brain and extension of particular brain regions, but also because interindividual variability is clearly more pronounced than in animal models. To illustrate the magnitude of the technical challenges involved, it is useful to consider the reconstruction of a single fragment of the human temporal cortex from layer I to layer VI, with dimensions of only 1.7 mm × 2.1 mm × 28.3 microns (0.1 mm<sup>3</sup>), which represents 0.41 petabytes of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loomba et al., 2022</xref>). If the reconstructed volume is increased to 1 mm<sup>3</sup> (3 mm × 2 mm × 170 µm), the data expand to 1.4 petabytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shapson-Coe et al., 2024</xref>). Nevertheless, the volume of the EC is relatively large and varies with age, showing differences between the left and right hemispheres ranging approximately from 730 to 1100 mm<sup>3</sup>, depending on age and hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, in order to explore the synaptic characteristics present in a given region, our approach is to determine the range of variability by sampling relatively small volumes of the region of interest multiple times and in several individuals. More specifically, we used this technology to obtain data on the density and spatial distribution of different types of synapses (excitatory and inhibitory), as well as to determine the size and shape of the synaptic junctions and the postsynaptic targets of the axon terminals.</p><p>Our previous studies of the EC in autopsy tissue have analyzed the neuropil of layers II and III using FIB/SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2021a</xref>). However, in these studies, we did not distinguish between the neuropil of the cell island and transition zones that characterize layer II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insausti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kobro-Flatmoen and Witter, 2019</xref>), nor were the rest of the cortical layers and subdivisions analyzed. In the present article, we further examined the ultrastructure of the normal human MEC by analyzing brain tissue obtained at autopsy with FIB/SEM. The purpose was to perform a volume electron microscopy study (3D analysis) in the neuropil of the MEC, including all layers and subdivisions, namely I, II (cell islands and transition zones), III, V (a/b and c), and VI to define the ultrastructural characteristics of synapses. This dataset is critical not only for understanding connectivity, but also from a functional perspective, and it is currently virtually unavailable for the human brain. This kind of analysis has already yielded high-quality data on synaptic ultrastructural properties from other regions of the human cerebral cortex obtained at autopsy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cano-Astorga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero-Crespo et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the data presented here aim to represent a step toward a better understanding of the networks and connectivity characteristics of the human cerebral cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the present study, we used coronal sections of the MEC at a caudal level—following the subarea delimitation proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insausti et al., 2017</xref>—to analyze layers I, II, III, IV, V, and VI of the EC. The layers were individually delimited based on cytoarchitectural characteristics, identified by two different staining techniques (i.e., Nissl and toluidine blue on semithin sections), as well as by direct visualization using FIB/SEM. Layer I showed a uniform, thick band with very few neurons present. Layer II presented clear islands occupied by large, stellate cells and modified pyramidal neurons, and transition zones with very few neurons between islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insausti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kobro-Flatmoen and Witter, 2019</xref>). This clear separation enabled us to study both areas separately (referred to here as ‘layer II-is’ for the area occupied by the islands, and ‘layer II-ni’ for the neuropil between islands). Layer III comprised a homogeneous population of medium-sized pyramidal neurons, radially organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insausti et al., 2017</xref>). Layer V, in turn, was characterized by the presence of large pyramidal neurons homogeneously distributed throughout the layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insausti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Insausti and Amaral, 2012</xref>). This layer is traditionally divided into three subdivisions: layers Va, Vb, and Vc. However, at the level analyzed in the present study, sublayers Va and Vb are often indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insausti et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, here we considered both as a single layer (for the sake of clarity, we will refer to it as Va/b). Layer Vc consisted of a pronounced band formed by a few neurons and a dense plexus of fibers. In the analyzed sections, this sublayer became apparent and it could be mistaken for the caudal extension of the lamina dissecans (or layer IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insausti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Insausti and Amaral, 2012</xref>). Finally, layer VI presented a heterogeneous population of neurons, forming a thick layer that exhibits an abrupt border with the underlying white matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insausti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Insausti and Amaral, 2012</xref>). Given these evident cytoarchitectural differences, data from all layers included in the present study were displayed and analyzed separately.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neuropil occupies most of the grey matter volume</title><p>Estimation of the volume fraction (Vv) occupied by different cortical elements (i.e., neuropil, cells bodies—neuronal, glial, and undetermined somata—and blood vessels) was performed in all MEC layers studied, applying the Cavalieri principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gundersen et al., 1988</xref>).

The proportion of AS formed on the different postsynaptic targets greatly resembled the general distribution of synapses established on the postsynaptic targets described above, given the greater number of AS than SS. In all layers of the MEC, AS were mostly established on dendritic spine heads (63%), followed by AS established on dendritic shafts (36.5%; 17.6% on spiny shafts and 18.9% on aspiny shafts) and, lastly, we found a small percentage of AS formed on dendritic spine necks (0.5%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1k</xref>). Our analysis revealed significant differences between MEC layers regarding the proportions of AS synapses established on dendritic spine heads. Layer VI exhibited the highest proportion of AS on spine heads (79.6%), whereas layer Va/b had the lowest proportion (54.9%; χ<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;0.0001).

The majority of SS were found on dendritic shafts (85.7%), with 47.5% on shafts containing dendritic protrusions (spiny shafts) and 38.2% on smooth dendritic shafts (aspiny shafts). A smaller proportion of SS were established on dendritic spine heads (12.1%) and spine necks (2.2%). Due to the low number of SS identified as axospinous in each layer (ranging from 3 in layer Va/b to 19 in layer Vc), statistical comparisons of this proportion between layers were not performed. However, we observed some variations between layers. Layer Va/b had the highest proportion of SS on dendritic shafts (92.3%), whereas layer Vc exhibited the lowest percentage of SS formed on shafts (77%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1k</xref>).</p><p>Considering all types of synapses established on dendritic spines, the proportion of AS:SS was 99:1, whereas the proportion of AS:SS established on dendritic shafts was 87:13.

These results were consistent across the different layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we were able to detect dendritic spines that contained more than one synapse (i.e., multisynaptic spines).

There were no significant differences in the proportion of multisynaptic spines between the different layers (χ<sup>2</sup>, p&gt;0.0001). Nevertheless, interestingly, the proportion of spines presenting one AS and one SS (0.73%) was higher than the percentage of dendritic spines containing a single SS (0.50%)——and this was consistent in most of the layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>AS established on dendritic spine necks are the smallest</title><p>The relationship between the postsynaptic elements of the synapses and their size was also determined. For this purpose, the areas of the SAS—of both AS and SS—were analyzed according to the postsynaptic targets. In order to perform a more accurate analysis of the size of the axospinous synapses, we excluded those synapses established on incomplete spines. Considering all layers, for AS, the mean area of synapses established on dendritic spine heads was similar to those of synapses established on dendritic shafts (127,956 nm<sup>2</sup> and 120,978 nm<sup>2</sup>, respectively). However, AS established on dendritic spine necks were notably smaller considering all layers (66,435 nm<sup>2</sup>; Dunn’s test, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1l</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1m</xref> for values for each individual case).

The main findings indicate that the MEC exhibits a distinct set of synaptic features that differentiates this region from other human cortical areas. Additionally, our results reveal common patterns in the synaptic structure across mammalian brains, such as the proportion of synaptic types and shapes. Furthermore, ultrastructural synaptic characteristics within the MEC are predominantly similar, although layers I and VI exhibit several synaptic characteristics that are distinct from those in the other layers.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The synaptic density is similar in all layers and most synapses are excitatory</title><p>Synaptic density is considered a meaningful parameter, in terms of connectivity, to describe the synaptic organization of a brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cano-Astorga et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we found that the analyzed MEC layers had similar synaptic density values. Moreover, the average density was 0.41 synapses/μm<sup>3</sup>, very close to the previously reported values in layers II and III of the intermediate-caudal EC (0.42 synapses/μm<sup>3</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2021a</xref>). However, MEC had slightly lower synaptic densities than other cortical regions from human samples studied using identical processing and analyzing methods, such as layer III from Brodmann area 21 (0.49 synapses/μm<sup>3</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cano-Astorga et al., 2023</xref>); layer III from Brodmann area 24 (0.49 synapses/μm<sup>3</sup>), area 38 (ranging from 0.54 to 0.76 synapses/μm<sup>3</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cano-Astorga et al., 2023</xref>), area 17 and area 3b (0.45 and 0.44 synapses/μm<sup>3</sup> , respectively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>), and the CA1 hippocampal field (ranging from 0.45 synapses/μm<sup>3</sup> in the stratum oriens to 0.99 synapses/μm<sup>3</sup> in the superficial stratum pyramidale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero-Crespo et al., 2020</xref>). These differences were more evident for deep MEC layers (especially Va/b and VI), which had the lowest values (0.35 and 0.36 synapses/μm<sup>3</sup>, respectively). Indeed, the data presented here highlight the importance of studying the human brain by region and in a layer-specific manner since synaptic values might depend on the specific features of the particular brain region and/or layer. Further analysis of human deep layers from other cortical areas might provide information to determine whether deep layers have a lower synaptic density or whether there is specificity depending on the brain region.</p><p>Previous studies, using transmission electron microscopy methods to estimate the synaptic density from layers III and V of the human EC, obtained a density of 0.32 and 0.27 synapses/μm<sup>3</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scheff et al., 1993</xref>), which is about 30% lower than reported in the present study. This difference in synaptic density may stem from a number of differences between their approach and ours. For example, Scheff et al. treated layer V as a single layer without dividing it into two sublayers as we did. Also, there were differences regarding the age of the human subjects—in our study, the ages of the three individuals examined were 40, 53, and 66 years old, while in the study by Scheff et al., the cases analyzed were older (range: 58–103 years old; mean ± SD, 71.7 ± 11.7 years), with longer postmortem delays (mean ± SD, 8.0 ± 2.8 hr, compared to 4, 2.4, and 3 hr in our cases, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1p</xref>). Moreover, the method employed to estimate synaptic density differed; Scheff et al. used an estimation of the number of synaptic profiles per unit area using single ultrathin sections. In this approach, known as the size-frequency method, synaptic density is estimated from two-dimensional samples. However, FIB/SEM technology enables us to calculate the actual number of synapses per volume unit, avoiding most of the bias associated with these traditional EM methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cano-Astorga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Merchán-Pérez et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The final number of synapses per cortical layer may be influenced by the proportion of tissue which is occupied by the neuropil. In the present study, the neuropil, where the vast majority of synapses are found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeFelipe et al., 1999</xref>), constituted the main element in all of the layers studied (86–96%, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a and b</xref>). This result is similar to previous values obtained in several regions of the human neocortex and hippocampus (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>).</p><p>It has been widely reported that the cortical neuropil has a larger proportion of AS than SS, regardless of the cortical region and species analyzed (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeFelipe et al., 2002</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cano-Astorga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cano-Astorga et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>). In the present study, the AS:SS ratio was, on average, 94:6, and no differences were found between layers.</p><p>However, interpreting the functional relevance of AS:SS is challenging due to variations in cytoarchitecture and connectivity across different cortical regions. Although AS:SS ratios were similar in all MEC layers, we cannot rule out differences in the proportion of AS and SS on the dendritic arbors of particular neurons. For example, previous studies have demonstrated variations in the number of inputs of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in different neuronal types (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourne and Harris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeFelipe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeFelipe and Fariñas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu and Vervaeke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schubert et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, examining synaptic inputs for specific cell types is necessary to assess potential differences in the AS:SS ratio in these cells, even though the overall AS:SS ratio may remain constant in the neuropil. Additionally, it is important to mention that our current study exclusively focuses on neuropil synapses, while the analysis of perisomatic innervation remains unexplored. Investigating perisomatic innervation would undoubtedly enhance our comprehension of the synaptic organization of these cortical circuits. The study of the axo-somatic innervation on neuronal somata would require a different technical approach (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ostos et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Synaptic distribution is indistinguishable from a random spatial distribution</title><p>The present analysis of the synaptic spatial distribution indicated that statistical tests were unable to distinguish synapse distributions from random distributions in the neuropil of most of the FIB/SEM samples.</p><p>As discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Merchán-Pérez et al., 2014</xref>, in a random distribution, a synapse could be formed anywhere in space where an axon terminal and a dendritic element may touch, provided this particular spot is not already occupied by a preexisting synapse. However, spatial randomness does not necessarily mean nonspecific connections. In fact, spatial specificity in the neocortex may be scale dependent. At the macroscopic and mesoscopic scales, the mammalian nervous system is highly structured, with connections established in a very specific and ordered way. Even at the microscopic level, different layers of the cortex receive specific inputs.</p><p>Previous ultrastructural studies of other human cortical areas, including the CA1 field of the hippocampus, have also reported synapse distributions exhibiting patterns that statistical tests could not distinguish from randomness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cano-Astorga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cano-Astorga et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero-Crespo et al., 2020</xref>). These findings suggest that the spatial distribution of synapses in the neuropil may reflect a general tendency toward randomness across the analyzed regions of the human cerebral cortex. This could mean that, as the axon terminals reach their destination, the spatial resolution achieved by them is fine enough to find a specific cortical layer, but not sufficiently fine to form a synapse on a particular target, such as a specific dendritic branch or dendritic spine within a layer.</p><p>Nevertheless, a few stacks of images from different layers showed slight tendencies toward either cluster or regular distributions. These ‘unexpected’ 3D distributions may arise from particular elements of the tissue studied, such as the presence of large trunks of apical dendrites or myelin fibers that could reduce the effective neuropil space where synapses may be established.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Macular small synapses are the most frequent and have the smallest sizes</title><p>Determination of the individual synaptic characteristics (such as synaptic size and shape) provides crucial data on the functionality of the synapses, regarding both synaptic transmission efficiency and dynamics. It has been proposed that synaptic size correlates with release probability, synaptic strength, efficacy, and plasticity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chindemi et al., 2022</xref> and references therein). It has been demonstrated that synaptic size correlates with the number of receptors in the PSD; larger PSDs have more receptors (as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lüscher and Malenka, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lüscher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Magee and Grienberger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sumi and Harada, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Toni et al., 2001</xref>). In the present study, MEC layers presented an average SAS area of 119,242 nm<sup>2</sup> for AS and 71,384 nm<sup>2</sup> for SS. In the MEC layers included in the present study, the analysis of SAS area also revealed that AS were larger than SS, as previously reported in other human cortical regions and layers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cano-Astorga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero-Crespo et al., 2020</xref>). This finding supports the idea that this synaptic characteristic is highly conserved in the human cerebral cortex.</p><p>Additionally, the SAS area data of both AS and SS from MEC layers follow a log-normal distribution, which is also manifested in a large number of many functional and morphological properties of the synapses and the circuits that formed, such as postsynaptic current amplitude, dendritic spine volume, and axonal width—or synaptic strength and spike transmission probability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbour et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scheler, 2017</xref>). This particular distribution is also consistent with the findings of previous studies performed on the human brain (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cano-Astorga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero-Crespo et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the fitting of the SAS area to a log-normal distribution likely emerges as a general synaptic characteristic of mammalian cortical synapses.</p><p>The analysis of AS SAS area revealed it to be rather uniform across layers, although some significant differences were found in layers I and VI, which had the lowest values (105,906 mm<sup>2</sup> and 99,489 mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively) and layers III and Vab, with the largest AS (130,268 nm<sup>2</sup> and 136,111 nm<sup>2</sup>, respectively). Thus, these data suggest that synaptic size might have a layer-specific component in the MEC. This is of great interest since synaptic size is one the most important parameters correlating with the actual function of the synapse. It has been related to release probability, synaptic strength, efficacy, and plasticity (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ganeshina et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ganeshina et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holderith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kharazia and Weinberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Südhof, 2012</xref>). Moreover, larger synaptic sizes are thought to contain a larger AMPA receptor population, which in turn directly relates to the unitary excitatory postsynaptic potential, thus critically influencing synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araya, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ganeshina et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kharazia and Weinberg, 1999</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Palomero-Gallagher and Zilles, 2019</xref>, although using human autopsies samples with postmortem delays between 12 and 18 hr, described a higher density of AMPA receptors in the superficial layers of the EC, which would coincide with the larger SAS area found in layer III. However, it has been reported that some receptors can be found both synaptically and extrasynaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Palomero-Gallagher and Zilles, 2019</xref>). Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering potential correlations between receptor densities, number of synapses, and/or synaptic size.</p><p>Furthermore, we observed that the majority of synapses in the MEC, regardless of the analyzed layer, exhibited a macular shape (84%, considering all layers). These findings are consistent with previous research conducted in various brain regions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cano-Astorga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero-Crespo et al., 2020</xref>). However, differences in this proportion were observed among the MEC layers. Specifically, layer VI had the lowest proportion of macular synapses (78%), for both AS and SS, while layer II-is displayed the highest percentage of macular synapses (88%). Once again, this suggests layer-specific variations. In all layers of the MEC, the sizes of complex-shaped synapses—including perforated, horseshoe-shaped, and fragmented synapses—were consistently larger compared to simple-shaped synapses (macular synapses). As mentioned above, larger synapses contain a higher proportion of AMPA receptors. Complex-shaped synapses have been reported to have a larger population of AMPA and NMDA receptors compared to macular synapses. This makes them a relatively powerful and more stable pool of synapses, contributing to long-lasting memory-related functionality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ganeshina et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ganeshina et al., 2004b</xref>). The smaller area of macular synapses, on the other hand, may play a crucial role in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kharazia and Weinberg, 1999</xref>). Consequently, the higher proportion of complex-shaped synapses in layer VI may indicate a specific connectivity pattern characterized by synapses with higher synaptic strengths, while the prevalence of macular synapses in layer II, which had the highest macular population, may suggest lower release probability, synaptic strength and efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Synapses are mainly established on dendritic spines</title><p>Examining the postsynaptic target for each 3D reconstructed synapse may allow us to identify variations in the proportion of synapses on dendritic spines and shafts. These differences might signify a microanatomical specialization of the examined cortical layers. Such variations could have significant functional implications for information processing. Studies have shown (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cornejo et al., 2022</xref>) that the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron is modulated differently depending on whether a synapse is established on a dendritic spine or a dendritic shaft. Consequently, variations in the proportions of these synaptic targets are likely to have clear functional significance. The present study showed that 60% of total synapses were AS established on dendritic spines (considering all layers), whereas the proportion of AS on dendritic shafts was 34%. Using the same techniques and analysis (in previous studies), this ratio has varied depending on the region examined. For example, in layers II and III of the EC, the results were similar (54% and 52% of synapses were on dendritic spines, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2021b</xref>)—and this was also the case in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1 (57%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero-Crespo et al., 2020</xref>). However, there is a higher proportion of AS on dendritic spines in layer III in Brodmann areas 24, 38 (ventral and dorsal), 21, 17, and 3b (70%, 74%, 72%, 71%, 67%, and 69%, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>) and in the stratum pyramidale of CA1 (88% in the superficial part and 81% in the deep layer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero-Crespo et al., 2020</xref>). These differences may indicate another microanatomical specialization of the synaptic structure in the neuropil (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1o</xref> for a comparison on the distribution of synapses established on the different postsynaptic targets from a variety of mammal species and brain regions).</p><p>Moreover, several studies have described a preference of glutamatergic axons (forming AS) for spines and of GABAergic axons (forming SS) for dendritic shafts, in numerous cortical regions and species (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeFelipe et al., 2002</xref>). This finding was also observed in the present study as the proportion of AS:SS established on dendritic spines was 99:1, whereas the proportion of AS:SS on dendritic shafts was 87:13. Considering that the general distribution for AS:SS was 94:6, this shows a clear preference for AS to be established on dendritic spines and SS to be formed on dendritic shafts. This has been consistently observed in every human cortical region and layer analyzed to date using the same techniques and analyses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cano-Astorga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cano-Astorga et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero-Crespo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the size of the synaptic junctions, it has been observed in several neocortical regions that AS on dendritic spine heads are larger than those on dendritic shafts or dendritic spine necks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cano-Astorga et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>). However, in the CA1 field of the hippocampus, the AS on shafts were slightly larger than axospinous AS (which include both spine heads and necks), although the differences were not found to be statistically significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero-Crespo et al., 2020</xref>). In the case of the MEC, however, we observed that AS, whether established on dendritic spine heads or dendritic shafts, shared a similar size, whereas AS on dendritic spine necks were significantly smaller. This suggests another specialization of synaptic anatomical features that may vary between cortical areas.</p><p>Additionally, the study of the multisynaptic spines revealed that, regardless of the layer analyzed, the vast majority of spines contained only a single AS on their head (96%). Once again, this percentage is in agreement with previous studies that showed around 95% of AS on spines were single synapses in layer III of Brodmann areas 21, 24, and 38 (ventral and dorsal), 17, 4 and 3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>). The hippocampal CA1 region presented a slightly higher percentage of single AS on spines (97.9%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero-Crespo et al., 2020</xref>). These results highlight another microanatomical specialization concerning the presence of single AS on spines, although its functional relevance remains unclear. In fact, the generation of multisynaptic spines has been associated with synaptic potentiation and has been linked to memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giese et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McLeod et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, in the mouse neocortex, it has been suggested that spines receiving one AS and one SS are electrically more stable than spines establishing a single AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Villa et al., 2016</xref>). As mentioned above, more stable synapses would lead to an increment in their synaptic size. Indeed, in the MEC, AS established on multisynaptic spines containing an SS were 30% larger than single AS.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Complex-shaped synapses are more frequently found on dendritic spines</title><p>In the present study, we observed that, out of the total macular AS, the distribution of these synapses on dendritic spine heads and dendritic shafts was 61:39. This ratio is very similar to the distribution of all AS (without considering their shape) on the same postsynaptic targets, which was 63:37. However, when making the same comparison for complex synapses, this ratio was 75:25 for AS established on dendritic spine heads and dendritic shafts. This indicates that the proportion of complex synapses in spine heads is almost 15% higher than what would be expected based on the overall distribution of synapses.</p><p>Indeed, complex AS established on dendritic spine heads were larger than those established on dendritic shafts, whereas macular AS established on dendritic shafts were larger than those on dendritic spine heads (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). As mentioned above, complex-shaped synapses presented larger synaptic sizes than macular synapses, and this correlates with higher synaptic strengths. This type of synapse contributes to the formation of more stable circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ganeshina et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ganeshina et al., 2004b</xref>). In the MEC, while the general distribution of synapses established on dendritic spine heads and dendritic shafts appears to be quite similar, especially when compared to other neocortical regions such as Brodmann areas 21, 24, 38, 17, 4 or 3b (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>), complex synapses established on dendritic spine heads may play a crucial role in consolidating the synaptic circuits that are formed in the different layers. Indeed, persistent dendritic spines, which form the basis of consolidated circuits, are described to be larger and have bigger PSDs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holtmaat et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yuste, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Ultrastructural characteristics of synapses are similar across layers of the MEC</title><p>Similarity of the synaptic characteristics of the MEC may seem surprising given its cytoarchitectonic and innervation complexity.

This layer is characterized by the presence of reelin-positive stellate cells and calbindin-positive pyramidal neurons clustered together to form ‘cell islands’ with gaps between them that contain almost no neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insausti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kobro-Flatmoen and Witter, 2019</xref>). In the present study, we were able to selectively analyze the neuropil of both zones independently. Our data showed no differences in any parameter studied. In fact, these results were very similar to those described in one of our previous studies performed in the same layer on different autopsy samples, but with no distinction made between islands and non-island areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2021a</xref>). For example, in this study, a density of 0.40 synapses/μm<sup>3</sup> was found in EC layer II, which is very close to the 0.42 and 0.44 synapses/μm<sup>3</sup> found in the present study in layer II, in the island and non-island regions, respectively.</p><p>Conversely, layer VI stood out in many of the synaptic parameters analyzed. Although the synaptic density in this layer was comparable to that of other layers, overall it had the smallest synapses and both the smallest macular and complex-shaped AS. It also had the lowest proportion of macular synapses (78%) and the highest proportion of synapses established on dendritic spine heads (76%). In humans, layer VI contains a variety of cell types, ranging from small- to medium-sized bipolar and multipolar calbindin-positive cells, large pyramidal calretinin-positive neurons, and multipolar parvalbumin interneurons, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kobro-Flatmoen and Witter, 2019</xref> and references wherein). Additionally, this layer receives projections from numerous regions, including the hippocampus, the medial frontal and orbitofrontal cortex, the thalamus, and the claustrum (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The synaptic peculiarities described in the present study may have a critical impact on how this layer processes the information it receives.</p><p>Despite the complexity of the MEC in terms of its cytoarchitecture, connectivity, and function, it is remarkable that the ultrastructural synaptic characteristics remain rather similar across layers. One possible explanation is that several of the parameters investigated in this study (e.g., synaptic density, proportion of AS:SS) do not depend on the cytoarchitecture or connectivity of the region, at least in the case of the MEC neuropil. Very few papers have analyzed the synaptic characteristics at the ultrastructural level of different layers in the same human brain region. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero-Crespo et al., 2020</xref> found that the ultrastructural synaptic characteristics of the human hippocampus may be influenced by the innervation that the different layers receive. The ultrastructural synaptic characteristics in the layers receiving CA3 Schaffer collaterals (e.g., stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum) differ from those in stratum lacunosum moleculare, which mainly receives information from the EC. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cano-Astorga et al., 2023</xref>—when analyzing the ultrastructural synaptic characteristics of layer III in different cingulate and temporopolar cortices—described remarkable differences in synaptic size and density between the ventral and dorsal part of BA38, which may also be correlated with the differential connectivity pattern exhibited by this brain area.</p><p>Finally, another crucial aspect is the interindividual variability of human samples. There are numerous studies describing interindividual variability in the human cerebral cortex, both in terms of structure and function (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeFelipe, 2015</xref>). However, in the present study, the synaptic parameters analyzed showed relatively little variability (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b,d,g,i,k, and m</xref>, which provide data from all MEC layers for each individual case). Indeed, the proportion of AS:SS showed remarkable uniformity across individuals in all layers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This apparent similarity was further confirmed through the examination of the variability between cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and stacks of images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1n</xref>), supporting the regularity of the data in all layers of the MEC. Furthermore, in all individuals, layers, and stack of images, SS had significantly smaller sizes and were in much lower numbers than AS. This is in line with the fact that, as already discussed, synaptic characteristics of SS are similar in the different cerebral regions, layers, and animals examined so far (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cano-Astorga et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cano-Astorga et al., 2024a</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the present data point to a set of highly conserved synaptic characteristics in all layers of the MEC, while some data point to a laminar specificity. Future studies on human synaptic nanoconnectivity of different layers in additional brain regions could confirm whether there is a commonly shared trend across the human cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>Human brain tissue was obtained from autopsies from two men and one woman (with short postmortem delays of less than 4 hr, and ages ranging from 40 to 66 years old; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1p</xref>) with no recorded neurological or psychiatric alterations (supplied by Unidad Asociada Neuromax, Laboratorio de Neuroanatomía Humana, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Albacete, Spain).

A grid, whose points covered an area of 2500 μm<sup>2</sup>, was randomly overlaid at 10–15 sites over the previously traced layer (separately) in each semithin section to determine the volume fraction (Vv) occupied by the different elements. Vv (e.g., in the case of the neuropil) was estimated with the following formula: Vv-neuropil = Q-neuropil × 100/(Q-neuropil + Q-neurons + Q-glia + Q-undetermined cells + Q-blood vessels).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Three-dimensional electron microscopy</title><p>The blocks containing the embedded tissue were glued onto a sample stub using carbon adhesive tabs (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 77825-09, USA).

The stubs with the mounted blocks were then placed into a sputter coater (Emitech K575X, Quorum Emitech, Ashford, Kent, UK) and the top surface was coated with several 10-nm-thick layers of gold/palladium to facilitate charge dissipation.</p><p>The 3D study of the samples was carried out using a dual beam microscope (Crossbeam 40 electron microscope, Carl Zeiss NTS GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany). This instrument combines a high-resolution field-emission SEM column with a focused gallium ion beam (FIB), which permits the removal of thin layers of material from the sample surface on a nanometer scale. Using a 7 nA ion current (30 kV accelerating voltage), a first coarse trench was milled to have visual access to the tissue below the block surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The exposed surface of this trench was then milled with a 100 pA ion current (30 kV accelerating voltage) to remove 20 nm. As soon as one layer of material is removed by the FIB, the exposed surface of the sample is imaged by the SEM using the backscattered electron detector (at 1.7 kV acceleration potential). The sequential automated use of FIB milling and SEM imaging allowed us to obtain long series of photographs of a 3D sample of selected regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Merchán-Pérez et al., 2009</xref>). Image resolution in the xy plane was 5 nm/pixel. Resolution in the z-axis (section thickness) was 20 nm, and the image size was 2048 × 1536 pixels. These parameters ensured an optimal field of view where the different types of synaptic junctions could still be clearly identified in a reasonable period of time (approximately 12 hr per stack of images). Although the sample is destroyed during milling, the size of the trench needed to acquire a stack of serial images is around 30–40 microns wide, allowing the collection of multiple stacks from the same region.</p><p>Alignment (registration) of serial microphotographs obtained with the FIB/SEM was performed with the ‘Register Virtual Stack Slices’ plug-in in FIJI, which is a version of ImageJ with a collection of preinstalled plug-ins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fiji.sc/">https://fiji.sc/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

To estimate the shrinkage in our samples, we photographed and measured the area of the vibratome sections with ImageJ (ImageJ 1.51; NIH, USA), both before and after processing for electron microscopy. The section area values after processing were divided by the values before processing to obtain the volume, area, and linear shrinkage factors, yielding correction factors of 0.90, 0.93, and 0.97, respectively. Nevertheless, in order to compare with previous studies—in which no correction factors had been included or such factors were estimated using other methods—in the present study, we provide both sets of data (i.e., corrected and not corrected for shrinkage).</p><p>Additionally, a correction in the volume of the stack of images for the presence of fixation artifacts (e.g., swollen neuronal or glial processes) was applied after quantification with the Cavalieri principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gundersen et al., 1988</xref>).

Synaptic segmentation depends on the intense electron density of these pre- and postsynaptic regions.

The resulting segmentation creates a 3D object encompassing the active zone and postsynaptic densities as these represent the two darkest areas of the synaptic junction.

As previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cano-Astorga et al., 2023</xref>, unambiguous identification of dendritic spines requires the spine to be visually followed to the parent dendrite, in which case we refer to it as a ‘complete spine’. When synapses are established on a dendritic spine-shaped postsynaptic element whose neck cannot be traced to the parent dendrite, we identify these elements as ‘incomplete spines’. These incomplete dendritic spines were identified based on their size and shape, the lack of mitochondria, and the presence of a spine apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peters et al., 1991</xref>)—or because they were filled with a characteristic fluffy material (used to describe the fine and indistinct filaments present in the spines). We also described the presence of single or multiple synapses on a single dendritic spine. Finally, if the synapse was established on a dendritic shaft, we could further determine whether the target dendrite was spiny or aspiny (based on the presence of dendritic spines along its path throughout the image stack).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>3D reconstruction of a dendritic segment from focused ion beam FIB/SEM serial images.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Serial images showing a dendritic segment partially reconstructed (in purple).

To analyze the spatial distribution of synapses (i.e., whether synapses are arranged in a regular, random, or clustered distribution), spatial point-pattern analysis was performed as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Merchán-Pérez et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, we compared the actual position of the synapse centroids with the CSR model—a random spatial distribution model that defines a situation where a point is equally likely to occur at any location within a given volume. The mathematical model underlying CSR is a homogeneous spatial Poisson point process. For each of the 63 different samples, we calculated three functions commonly used for spatial point pattern analysis: F, G, and K functions, each of which computes different parameters (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Merchán-Pérez et al., 2014</xref> for a detailed description). Briefly, the F function, known as the empty space function, is—for a distance d—the probability that the distance of each point to its nearest synapse centroid is at most d. The G function, also called the nearest-neighbor distance cumulative distribution function, is—for a distance d—the probability that a typical point separates from its nearest neighbor by a distance of at most d. The K function, called the reduced second-moment function, is—for a distance d—the expected number of points within a distance d of a typical point of the process divided by the intensity λ. An estimation of the K function is given by the mean number of points within a sphere of increasing radius d centered on each sample point, divided by an estimation of the expected number of points per unit volume. In addition, we calculated the theoretical distribution that corresponds to a homogeneous spatial Poisson point process which serves as a reference point, in each stack of images. We then calculated the envelope area corresponding to the Poisson distribution, obtained from 99 simulations performed with the same number of centroids in each of the stacks analyzed. Thus, if the curves obtained from the F, G, or K functions in any or the stacks of images appear to be inside the envelope area, it means that the spatial distribution of the centroids in the stack of images is indistinguishable from random. This study was carried out using the spatstat package and R Project program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baddeley et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We studied differences in synaptic density, as well as morphological and spatial parameters, between layers by conducting multiple mean comparison tests on data from the various MEC layers studied. In this case, we performed KW, followed by a post hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test (when KW test finds statistical significance), and MW nonparametric <italic>U</italic>-test, since normality and homoscedasticity criteria were not met in any comparison. Frequency distribution analysis of the area of the SAS was performed using KS nonparametric test. The analysis of proportions was carried out using pairwise comparisons in contingency tables (χ<sup>2</sup>), followed by a post hoc Bonferroni correction test for multiple comparisons. The criterion for statistical significance was considered to be met if p&lt;0.05 when the sample size was equal to the number of subjects or image stacks (i.e., MW and KW tests) and if p&lt;0.0001 when the sample size was equal to the number of synapses (i.e., KS and pairwise comparison) in order to avoid overestimation of the differences due to a very large sample size.</p><p>Data variability between individuals and stacks of images was estimated by calculating the CV of each synaptic parameter in every layer. CV was calculated by dividing the SD by the mean for each of the synaptic parameters analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1n</xref>). Additional statistical comparisons of the variability between individuals were carried out using KW, followed by a post hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>All statistical studies were performed using GraphPad Prism statistical package (Prism 9 for Windows, GraphPad Software Inc, USA) and R Project software (R.4.2.2; Bell Laboratories, NJ; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Alyssa Wilson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Albert Cardona as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Casey Schneider-Mizell (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>In the reviewers' discussions, several claims from this article were identified that require further support or alteration. Of the reviewers' recommendations, the following revisions will be expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, claims of homogeneity should be contextualized more fully, with discussions about the potential contributions of noise to observations, and about the applicability of findings given the spatial scales investigated and the measurements made. In this expanded discussion, please address the following points in particular:</p><p>(1a) For each ultrastructural measurement presented, a quantitative characterization of variability should be reported, on a per-image-volume basis (currently, measures appear to be aggregated per individual, per layer, as in Table S3). Additionally, a figure formatted similarly to Figure 3C but with variability measures (e.g. error bars with interquartile range per data point) should be presented for each measurement, to provide a clearer sense of inter-image-volume variability. The degree of this variability should be discussed in the text.</p><p>(1b) Similarly, given the substantial clinical differences between brain donors, a characterization of inter-individual variability should be presented, where distributions for each measurement are aggregated by donor, per layer, and compared (again using plots similar to Figure 3C but with variability measures). Here, statistical tests of similarity between donors would also be of interest for assessing the impacts of combining data for multiple donors.</p><p>(1c) In the text, the approximate size of each reconstructed volume (~10 µm per side) should be explicitly reported and discussed as it relates to the spatial scales for which structural variability can be interrogated. It would further be helpful to provide context about how these volumes may relate to structure at other spatial scales relevant for human medial entorhinal cortex.</p><p>2) Although data acquisition and annotation have been carefully executed in this work, there are several aspects of synapse selection and annotation that should be more thoroughly described, since these factors may have impacted the authors' findings. In particular;</p><p>(2a) The authors appear to annotate active zones and postsynaptic densities by thresholding synapse images at some user-defined pixel intensity value, taking only pixels darker than that threshold as their annotations (Lines 806 – 812). This technique seems like it could be prone to producing noisy annotations, particularly since in the EM images provided (Figures S11-16) the pixel intensities of active zones/postsynaptic densities and surrounding neuropil do not appear to be highly distinct.</p><p>(2b) The authors note that they have excluded synapses formed onto cell somata or proximal apical dendrites in their analyses. However, this choice may have resulted in disproportionate exclusion of inhibitory synapses, as inhibitory neurons are more likely to form synapses directly onto somata or dendritic shafts. The authors should quantify the number of synapses that were excluded as a result of this approach and should comment about potential impacts on their findings (for example the fraction of asymmetric synapses observed to form on dendritic shafts of spiny neurons as shown in Figure 6).</p><p>3) Much of the value of this study derives from the data itself, and further, in order to fully reproduce the findings in this work, the image volumes, corresponding synapse segmentations, and metadata should be made readily available (pending any agreements that may be needed for sharing human tissue data). Currently, it appears that segmentations and annotations, but not the image volumes, have been made available at the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph. Further, while not essential, it would substantially increase the usability of this dataset if it were deposited in a form compatible with industry standard tools for electron microscopy, like Neuroglancer or cloud-volume, and the authors are encouraged to consider this option.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would like to emphasize that overall, this work contains an impressive amount of rigorous analysis. The main concern I have is that the variability in the analysis, some of which I understand is unavoidable given the work involved in EM reconstructions and in identifying appropriate brain donors, should be more explicitly shown. The claim of homogeneity should be stated in such a way that someone who reads the abstract, for instance, does not take away this piece of your findings without also understanding the important caveats.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific Recommendations and Concerns</p><p>1) The concept of &quot;synaptic organization,&quot; as introduced on Line 122, is a key part of the framing but it is not clear what specifically the authors aim to measure. Some meanings could indeed be a &quot;crucial aspect&quot; but some might not. This matters when making claims about views of the &quot;best strategy.&quot; There are many aspects to the synaptic organization of the nervous system that require whole-cell scale reconstruction and are completely unavailable to small cutouts or, indeed, anything less than whole-brain datasets. There are other aspects of synaptic organization, such as the ones considered in this work, where smaller cutouts are sufficient, and it is thus possible to generate better sampling. It is misleading to suggest that the detailed goals of and the observations produced by circuit-scale connectomics and small-cutout volume EM are the same, but that is not to say that one is any better than the other. The useful descriptions would be better served if the authors argued concretely why these properties they measure are important.</p><p>2) The most impressive part of this study is the sampling across multiple individuals, which is often not feasible in larger-scale EM studies, and the most consistent result is the similarity across them. However, the choice of data representation is inconsistent with regards to the replicates within and between individuals, which dilutes the ability to assess these trends. For example, Figure 3C very nicely shows each sample from each individual, while Figure 1A appears to group samples but still shows each individual, while panels like Figure 1B and Figure 4B-E omit these distinctions entirely. A more consistent and complete visualization of the inter-sample and inter-individual data throughout would strengthen the arguments of the paper. Much of this is already done in the supplementary figures, but could be brought more fully into the results and discussion (for example, variability is largely not discussed in terms of synapse shape or size).</p><p>3) While synapses onto excitatory dendrites are generally straight-forward to classify into asymmetric and symmetric synapses, the postsynaptic densities of synapses onto inhibitory dendrites are not as clearly defined in my experience. Similarly, experience has shown that manual detection of small synapses can be quite difficult even after several passes. It would be useful to know how the authors approached and mitigated these specific problems in their tissue.</p><p>4) I was surprised by the relatively large value of asymmetric synapses onto dendritic shafts of spiny neurons (10-20%, in most cases 4-5 times the number of symmetric synapses onto spiny shafts), and the consistency across layers, as shown in Figure 6. It does not match my experience in mammalian cortex that excitatory inputs onto excitatory shafts significantly outnumber inhibitory inputs onto shafts. Is this a difference between mouse/rodent and human MEC?</p><p>5) Much of the value of this study derives from the data itself. It would be extremely beneficial for the authors to deposit the image volumes, synapse segmentations, and metadata online in a form that could be visualized in industry standard tools like Neuroglancer and read by software such as cloud-volume. This could be especially nice if integrated into the tissue coordinates identified from the light level analysis to create a multiscale dataset. I do see the synapse segmentations on the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph platform, but not the associated imagery. Moreover, the.seg format is for Espina, which appears to not be available for Mac OS. Given that the authors are engaging on a series of similar studies.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Volume Electron Microscopy Reveals Unique Laminar Synaptic Characteristics in the Human Entorhinal Cortex&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Albert Cardona (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and a peer reviewer. Their feedback is below.</p><p>We thank the authors for the improvements made to the new manuscript, which have addressed many of our comments. We note that the authors have clarified the Results text, added some statistical test data, satisfactorily clarified their synapse annotation methods, and reformatted their plots to meet most of the Essential Revisions stipulations.</p><p>However, several points in the Essential Revisions still need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>(1) As stipulated in Essential Revision 3, the authors are required to include a way to access their EM data in their Data Availability statement. Although we understand the authors' concerns, sharing raw data is journal policy.</p><p>(2) As stipulated in Essential Revision 1, the authors are required to present an explicit quantification of variability for each synapse measurement, in two respects:</p><p>* Essential Revision 1a): between the 3 image stacks collected per donor+layer.</p><p>* Essential Revision 1b): between donors per layer.</p><p>We appreciate several revisions and responses made by the authors with respect to these requirements (below). We would like to clarify what additional changes are required to satisfy Essential Revisions 1a) and 1b) beyond these updates.</p><p>– The authors have included a of coefficient of variation for each synapse measure by layer (using aggregated donor/stack data).</p><p>– While the coefficient of variation is a useful quantification of the per-layer data assuming it is well-mixed, on its own it unfortunately does not address our main concerns of whether the data itself is well-mixed for each layer, across individual stacks per donor and across donors.</p><p>– Data visualizations now show inter-stack variability to a much greater extent, with most properties plotted in the format of Figure 3C (Figure 1C, 3A,C, 4C,E; Figure 1S1A, 4S3A,C).</p><p>- This represents a substantial improvement but does not include sufficient information to assess data mixing. The image stack means are provided without a measure of variance, but the combination of both mean and variance is necessary for visualizing cross-stack variability. Currently, error bars correspond to per-layer aggregated data, which is useful for the across-layer comparisons but does not address the issue of variability we raised.</p><p>– The authors have noted in their response (Essential Revisions 1c) that sampling of multiple small image stacks within a tissue can be sufficient to capture the distributions of synapse properties, citing Merchan-Perez et al. 2009 (which studied synapse numbers in the cerebral cortex).</p><p>– We agree that sampling can be a reasonable strategy for the measurement of anatomical synapse properties and that reconstruction of an entire tissue is not necessarily preferable in these cases. However, given that every donor, tissue type/sample, and synapse property is subject to different variability, it is essential to perform a quantitative analysis of the data itself to show that sampling is sufficient for the synapse properties measured. One piece of this analysis would be a demonstration that stacks are well-mixed, which we are requiring. An additional piece would be a power analysis.</p><p>With these points in mind, the following changes are required:</p><p>2A) Essential Revision 1a): in Figures1C, 3A,C, 4C,E 1S1A, and 4S3A,C, each data point must be given its own error bar to allow visual comparison of stacks (+/-standard deviation is fine). Additionally, statistical comparisons of the 3 image stacks per donor+layer should be explicitly reported for each synapse measure. A nonparametrical test that compares distributions, like the Mann-Whitney/Kruskal Wallis (used by the authors elsewhere in the manuscript) is appropriate and should be used. Test results (p-values) can be reported in a supplemental table; any cases in which stacks for a donor+layer significantly differ should be noted in the figure legends. Some kind of commentary on these results should also be provided in the text.</p><p>(2B) Essential Revision (1b): a new figure panel showing inter-donor variability is required. This new figure should have a panel for each of the following measures: synapse density; intersynaptic distance; SAS synapse area; AS synapse area; macular-shaped synapse area (for SAS and AS synapses separately); complex-shaped synapse area (SAS and AS synapses separately). In each panel the mean + standard deviation should be shown for each donor. Statistical testing should also be performed to check whether donor distributions are statistically distinguishable (Mann-Whitney/Kruskal-Wallis is also fine) and p-values should be reported in a supplemental table, with statistical differences between donors noted in the figure panel/legend. Please also briefly comment on these comparisons in the text.</p><p>Notably, this step will be quite useful to the field to be able to cite cases like this when handling questions of inter-individual variability.</p><p>(3) The term &quot;synaptic organization&quot; must be replaced throughout the manuscript with a term that clearly communicates the types of measurements that were analyzed, to avoid misinterpretation. One suggestion for an acceptable term would be &quot;anatomical synapse features of neuropil&quot;. (Essential Revision 1)</p><p>(4) The Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion sections should be revised to clearly indicate that anatomical features of neuropil synapses are being studied, and to clearly summarize the paper's findings as being structural patterns that are either repeated across cortical layers based on their dataset or not. The term &quot;homogeneity&quot; should be avoided. (Essential Revision 1)</p><p>(5) Essential Revision 1c): In the interest of transparency, the authors are required to report the (x,y,z) sizes of individual blocks in the manuscript.</p><p>In the current revision, the authors' reporting on individual block size unfortunately remains less than transparent. They do report a range and mean of individual block volumes in the text (Lines 212-213: &quot;The number of sections per stack ranged from 244 to 319 (Supplementary file 1c), which corresponds to a raw volume ranging from 384 to 502 μm^3 (mean: 450 μm^3).&quot;), but further clarification about what kind of spatial scale these blocks represent is not presented. Other information about block size is also indirect (inclusion volume per block is given in the &quot;Raw Data Densities&quot; sheet of Supplementary file 2; in Figure 9D FIBSEM trenches are shown at low magnification, with the relevant scale bar in a separate panel such that length estimation is difficult).</p><p>Being explicit about the 1-dimensional spatial extents of individual image stacks is important for the claims the authors are making. For example, as noted by Reviewer #2 previously, the author's use of F, G, and K functions only allow them to measure deviations in their data from random point distributions if the densities are changing at a scale smaller than their volume samples.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Volume Electron Microscopy Reveals Unique Laminar Synaptic Characteristics in the Human Entorhinal Cortex&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Albert Cardona (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. We greatly appreciate that the authors have shared the BOSSDB URL for their EM images. We would just ask that the DOI be added to the manuscript prior to acceptance.</p><p>2. The p-values for the Kruskal-Wallace (KW) tests used in assessing inter-individual variability should be provided in addition to the p-values reported for the Dunn's multiple comparison tests. We note that the Dunn test is a follow-up to the KW, and in this case would be used to investigate differences between donor pairs when the KW test indicates significant differences among the 3 donors. Unfortunately, Dunn's test can fail to detect differences for several reasons (it applies a z-score approximation to each donor distribution, and it can use conservative p-value corrections). For this reason, Dunn test p-values should be considered alongside their corresponding KW test p-value.</p><p>3. The Discussion section should be condensed substantially (one notable part is Lines 516-568), as this version is still difficult to read through.</p><p>4. Line 571: it is stated that synapses &quot;were randomly distributed&quot;, but the statistical testing used only implies that no differences could be distinguished from random distributions, which is a different conclusion. Please adjust this phrasing to more accurately reflect the conclusions of these tests.</p><p>5. Please place a scale bar in each panel of Figure 9 separately, to help readers more easily interpret these images (currently the authors use one scale bar for all panels, and this makes it difficult to visualize sizes in some panels).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96144.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>In the reviewers' discussions, several claims from this article were identified that require further support or alteration.

The coefficient of variation, both between cases and stack of images for each layer, has been calculated. New tables have been added (Tables 2 and Supplementary file 1n).</p><p>The following new subsection has been included in the Results section:</p><p>“Synaptic parameters show little variability</p><p>Variability between cases was examined by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV, see material and methods) of each synaptic parameter in every MEC layer.</p><p>We observed little variability between cases for any of the synaptic characteristics analyzed (Table 2).

Furthermore, in all individuals, layers and stack of images, SS had significantly smaller sizes and were in much lower numbers than AS. This is in line with the fact that, as already discussed, synaptic characteristics of SS are similar in the different cerebral regions, layers and animals examined so far (e.g., Alonso-Nanclares et al., 2023; Cano-Astorga et al., 2023).</p><p>Overall, the present data point to a set of highly conserved synaptic characteristics in all layers of the MEC, while some data point to a laminar specificity.

To accomplish this goal, our study involved a substantial sample, encompassing 63 FIB/SEM stacks of images, each consisting of 229 to 319 images, totaling around 18000 images, and a total examined volume of 28466 µm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>We have added an additional table (Supplementary file 1c) detailing the sampling volume for each layer, including both the range and the total number of images per stack in each layer.</p><p>From our point of view, multiple sampling using volume electron microscopy is crucial when examining human brain tissue, not only because of the large size of the brain and extension of particular brain regions, but also because interindividual variability is more pronounced than in animal models. Thus, to explore the synaptic characteristics present in a given region, our first-choice approach is to determine the range of variability by sampling relatively small volumes of the region of interest multiple times and in several individuals.</p><p>Respectfully, we consider our sampling to be adequate to study the synaptic characteristics of the MEC neuropil and we believe that our study is of great significance. As far as we know, the results of this study constitute the largest synaptic dataset collected to date in the medial part of the human entorhinal cortex obtained from truly control brain samples.</p><p>Moreover, as discussed in Merchan-Perez et al. (2009), it is expected that the variation among the ultrastructural characteristics will also fall within narrow windows or, at least, the statistical distribution of that variation may be modeled. The estimation of this distribution can be achieved by means of spatial sampling strategies (e.g., Lafratta, 2006). We believe reconstructing the entire layer within a cortical region is unnecessary and impractical for defining the absolute synaptic number, type, and other ultrastructural characteristics. Multiple sampling of relatively small volumes within the region is sufficient to capture the range of variability.</p><p>Since our data showed remarkably little variability between layers (3 stacks of images per layer), we are confident that our sampling method accurately represents the reality of the synaptic characteristics within each layer of the MEC.</p><p>As we stated in our Response 1b, to better illustrate sampling variability, we have changed the plots to include the data from every stack of images from each individual per layer (similar to the format used for Figure 3C). In addition, we have performed an analysis of the coefficient of variation to examine the variability of the different stacks of images for each analyzed parameter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although data acquisition and annotation have been carefully executed in this work, there are several aspects of synapse selection and annotation that should be more thoroughly described, since these factors may have impacted the authors' findings. In particular;</p><p>2a) The authors appear to annotate active zones and postsynaptic densities by thresholding synapse images at some user-defined pixel intensity value, taking only pixels darker than that threshold as their annotations (Lines 806 – 812). This technique seems like it could be prone to producing noisy annotations, particularly since in the EM images provided (Figures S11-16) the pixel intensities of active zones/postsynaptic densities and surrounding neuropil do not appear to be highly distinct.</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to note that the applied software in this study, EspINA, does not automatically identify any structure, it is a supervised software tool that performs the automated segmentation of synapses identified by experts. The identification of synapses was manually performed by an expert (in case of doubt, by the consensus of several experts). Then, the segmentation of each synapse was automatically performed by EspINA based on grayscale intensity. Each synapse segmentation was revised and validated by the user. In addition, synapse segmentations can be manually edited if necessary to accurately delimitate the active zone and postsynaptic density of each synapse. In other words, EspINA significantly accelerates 3D reconstruction, allowing users to supervise the process, adjust parameters, and validate the results.</p><p>To confirm the identity of inhibitory synapses (symmetric synapses), we traced their axons through the image stack and examined each synapse they formed. 3D reconstruction facilitated this process by allowing navigation and examination of both pre- and postsynaptic elements for each synapse.</p><p>To be clearer on this matter, we have changed the following paragraph in material and methods. It now reads:</p><p>“[…] EspINA software allows the user to supervise the result of segmentation and reconstruction; each synapse segmentation is revised and validated by the user, and the segmentation can be manually edited if necessary to accurately delimitate the active zone and postsynaptic density of each synapse.”</p><p>Please see the new Figure 12 to illustrate synapse segmentation, 3D reconstruction and extraction of the synaptic apposition surface.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2b) The authors note that they have excluded synapses formed onto cell somata or proximal apical dendrites in their analyses. However, this choice may have resulted in disproportionate exclusion of inhibitory synapses, as inhibitory neurons are more likely to form synapses directly onto somata or dendritic shafts. The authors should quantify the number of synapses that were excluded as a result of this approach and should comment about potential impacts on their findings (for example the fraction of asymmetric synapses observed to form on dendritic shafts of spiny neurons as shown in Figure 6).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that in the present study, we focused on the examination of the neuropil. The neuropil is where the vast majority of synapses are found (90–98%; Alonso-Nanclares et al., 2008; DeFelipe, 1999). It has been described that the neuropil comprises approximately 90% of the grey matter of the human temporal neocortex (Cano-Astorga et al., 2023; Shapson-Coe et al., 2024) and the present results in MEC showed similar values (Supplementary file 1a). Accordingly, the exclusion of the somata and proximal segments of axon and dendrites might comprise a maximum of around 10% of the total synapses. So, the present data on the number of SS can be interpreted as a good estimation of putative GABAergic synaptic contacts in the neuropil, but not in the perisomatic region.</p><p>While understanding axo-somatic and axo-axonic innervation is crucial for inhibitory control in cortical circuits, our FIB/SEM image stacks lack information on neuronal somata and proximal dendrites, thus limiting our ability to analyze the synaptic contribution specifically in neuronal somata. In this regard, our FIB/SEM stacks might include axo-axonic synapses by chance, but due to their rarity, random sampling would not be ideal for accurate estimates. Studying axo-somatic synapses would require a different approach. Since cell somata are large structures, especially compared to the high magnification needed for synapse identification with EM, a single image might only capture a portion of the soma, potentially missing some axo-somatic synapses. Techniques like light microscopy with specific markers could be useful for analyzing these connections (see Ostos et al., 2023. Quantitative analysis of the GABAergic innervation of the soma and axon initial segment of pyramidal cells in the human and mouse neocortex. Cereb Cortex 33(7):3882-3909. doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhac314). Indeed, to analyze the axon initial segments, we must obtain FIB/SEM stacks just below the soma of pyramidal cells (where the axon initial segment originates), whereas for the analysis of the soma, we have to reconstruct the membrane surface of the soma of neurons, by selecting this particular region of the neuron.</p><p>We would like to point out that for the present study, it took over three years to obtain and analyze the data to prepare this article. This gives an indication of just how time-consuming this type of research can be and highlights why it is necessary to focus on specific objectives and avoid widening the scope of the study excessively. Hopefully, segmented images of the temporal human neocortex released in Neuroglancer by Shapson-Coe et al. (2024) could be examined to address this issue.</p><p>We have added the following paragraph to the Discussion section:</p><p>“[…] The reason for this is that our FIB/SEM stacks of images may include axo-axonic synapses by chance, but, since these synapses are very infrequent, random sampling of FIB/SEM stacks in the neuropil would not be the most appropriate strategy. Investigating perisomatic innervation would undoubtedly enhance our comprehension of the synaptic organization of these cortical circuits. The study of the axo-somatic synapses on neuronal somata would require a different technical approach. Since neuronal somata are large structures, particularly in relation to the high magnification of EM necessary to identify the synapses, a soma may occupy a significant part (if not all) of any given EM image and there would clearly be very few —if any— synapses to be analyzed. Thus, to analyze both axo-axonic and axo-somatic synapses, different technical approaches would need to be applied (for example, see Ostos et al., 2023).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Much of the value of this study derives from the data itself, and further, in order to fully reproduce the findings in this work, the image volumes, corresponding synapse segmentations, and metadata should be made readily available (pending any agreements that may be needed for sharing human tissue data). Currently, it appears that segmentations and annotations, but not the image volumes, have been made available at the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph. Further, while not essential, it would substantially increase the usability of this dataset if it were deposited in a form compatible with industry standard tools for electron microscopy, like Neuroglancer or cloud-volume, and the authors are encouraged to consider this option.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the complete raw dataset obtained from our FIB/SEM images which was used to calculate all the measurements and analysis presented as Supplementary file 2. Since we are still working on the examination of some subcellular elements to be further analyzed, a deposit of the original stacks of images is not yet available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific Recommendations and Concerns</p><p>1) The concept of &quot;synaptic organization,&quot; as introduced on Line 122, is a key part of the framing but it is not clear what specifically the authors aim to measure. Some meanings could indeed be a &quot;crucial aspect&quot; but some might not. This matters when making claims about views of the &quot;best strategy.&quot; There are many aspects to the synaptic organization of the nervous system that require whole-cell scale reconstruction and are completely unavailable to small cutouts or, indeed, anything less than whole-brain datasets. There are other aspects of synaptic organization, such as the ones considered in this work, where smaller cutouts are sufficient, and it is thus possible to generate better sampling. It is misleading to suggest that the detailed goals of and the observations produced by circuit-scale connectomics and small-cutout volume EM are the same, but that is not to say that one is any better than the other. The useful descriptions would be better served if the authors argued concretely why these properties they measure are important.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there are many aspects to the synaptic organization that require whole-cell scale analysis. We are sorry we were not clear enough using the term “synaptic organization”. We have now added the following definition to the Introduction section:</p><p>“We can distinguish two major goals in studying synaptic organization. First, studying connections between identified neurons, which consists of identifying the specific presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons involved in each synapse. Second, studying synaptic features in general, which involves quantifying synaptic density, identifying different types and sizes of synapses, and determining their postsynaptic targets (dendrites, somas, or other structures). In the present study, we focused on the second goal, but for simplicity, we refer to it as &quot;synaptic organization&quot; throughout the text.”</p><p>Regarding the importance of the synaptic properties examined in the present work, we consider that the provided dataset is useful not only for understanding local connectivity, but also for defining the MEC from a functional perspective.</p><p>To point out the importance of the synaptic properties analyzed, the following paragraphs have been added to the Introduction and Discussion sections:</p><p>“[…] Assessing the synaptic density in a particular brain region is crucial for understanding both connectivity and functionality. In particular, both the synaptic density (number of synapses per volume) and excitatory/inhibitory proportions are meaningful parameters to describe the synaptic connections of a particular brain region, which can be considered useful for understanding the synaptic circuits of any brain region.”</p><p>“Determination of the individual synaptic characteristics (such as synaptic size and shape) provides crucial data on the functionality of the synapses, regarding both synaptic transmission efficiency and dynamics. It has been proposed that synaptic size correlates with release probability, synaptic strength, efficacy, and plasticity (see Chindemi et al., 2022 and references therein). It has been demonstrated that synaptic size correlates with the number of receptors in the PSD; larger PSDs have more receptors (as reviewed in Lüscher et al., 2000; Lüscher and Malenka, 2012; Toni et al., 2001; Magee and Grienberger, 2020; Sumi and Harada, 2020).</p><p>[…] However, it has been reported that some receptors can be found both synaptically and extra-synaptically (Palomero-Gallagher and Zilles, 2019). Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering potential correlations between receptor densities, number of synapses and/or synaptic size.”</p><p>“Examining the postsynaptic target for each 3D reconstructed synapse may allow us to identify variations in the proportion of synapses on dendritic spines and shafts. These differences might signify a microanatomical specialization of the examined cortical layers. Such variations could have significant functional implications for information processing. Studies have shown (e.g., Cornejo et al., 2022) that the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron is modulated differently depending on whether a synapse is established on a dendritic spine or a dendritic shaft. Consequently, variations in the proportions of these synaptic targets have clear functional significance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The most impressive part of this study is the sampling across multiple individuals, which is often not feasible in larger-scale EM studies, and the most consistent result is the similarity across them. However, the choice of data representation is inconsistent with regards to the replicates within and between individuals, which dilutes the ability to assess these trends. For example, Figure 3C very nicely shows each sample from each individual, while Figure 1A appears to group samples but still shows each individual, while panels like Figure 1B and Figure 4B-E omit these distinctions entirely. A more consistent and complete visualization of the inter-sample and inter-individual data throughout would strengthen the arguments of the paper. Much of this is already done in the supplementary figures, but could be brought more fully into the results and discussion (for example, variability is largely not discussed in terms of synapse shape or size).</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the reviewer’s advice. Please seerResponses to 1a and 1b to the Essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While synapses onto excitatory dendrites are generally straight-forward to classify into asymmetric and symmetric synapses, the postsynaptic densities of synapses onto inhibitory dendrites are not as clearly defined in my experience. Similarly, experience has shown that manual detection of small synapses can be quite difficult even after several passes. It would be useful to know how the authors approached and mitigated these specific problems in their tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to 2a to Essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I was surprised by the relatively large value of asymmetric synapses onto dendritic shafts of spiny neurons (10-20%, in most cases 4-5 times the number of symmetric synapses onto spiny shafts), and the consistency across layers, as shown in Figure 6. It does not match my experience in mammalian cortex that excitatory inputs onto excitatory shafts significantly outnumber inhibitory inputs onto shafts. Is this a difference between mouse/rodent and human MEC?</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, there are no volume EM studies performed on the mouse EC. In a study performed in the mouse somatosensory cortex (S1HL region) using the same techniques (FIB/SEM) and considering only synapses established on spiny shafts, asymmetric synapses slightly outnumbered symmetric synapses: 10.25% for AS and 7.35% for SS (Turégano-López, 2022).</p><p>In the human, this ratio has been described to be more variable. For example, in layer III of associative (BA21; BA24 and BA38) and primary cortex (BA3b and BA4) of the human cortex, the percentage of AS on spiny shafts was around 10–14%, whereas the percentage of SS on spiny shafts was 2–3% (Cano-Astorga et al., 2024, biorxiv), which is in line with the results shown here for the MEC. In the human CA1 region of the hippocampus, while the <italic>stratum oriens</italic> exhibited a slightly higher number of AS than SS established on spiny shafts, in the rest of the CA1 layers, the numbers of AS and SS on spiny shafts were quite similar, if not higher for SS (Montero-Crespo et al., 2022).</p><p>In fact, quantitative analyses of synapses in the neuropil of different mammals, including human, have shown that most synapses on dendritic shafts are AS (∼80%), with relatively few being SS (∼20%; Beaulieu et al., 1992; Peters et al., 2008; Hsu et al., 2017; Calì et al., 2018; Santuy et al., 2018b; Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2019, 2021a,b; Yakoubi et al., 2019b; Montero-Crespo et al., 2020, 2021; Cano-Astorga et al., 2021, 2023; Alonso-Nanclares et al., 2023). This is in line with the results presented here, where the vast majority of synapses on shafts were AS (87%, please see Figure 6—figure supplement 1, panel B).</p><p>To be clearer on this matter, we have added an additional table showing data on the distribution of synapses established on the different postsynaptic targets from a variety of mammal species and brain regions (Supplementary file 1o).</p><p>Additionally, we have modified Figure 6 to include the proportion of AS established either on dendritic spines or shafts, as well as the proportion of SS on dendritic spines or shafts, for each MEC layer. Accordingly, we have also included the following in the Results section:</p><p>“We also analyzed the proportion of excitatory (AS) and inhibitory (SS) synapses separately, categorized by their location on dendritic spines (heads or necks) or dendritic shafts. The proportion of AS formed on the different postsynaptic targets greatly resembled the general distribution of synapses established on the postsynaptic targets described above, given the greater number of AS than SS. In all layers of the MEC, AS were mostly established on dendritic spine heads (63%), followed by AS established on dendritic shafts (36.5%; 17.6% on spiny shafts and 18.9% on aspiny shafts) and, lastly, we found a small percentage of AS formed on dendritic spine necks (0.6%; Supplementary file 1k). Our analysis revealed significant differences between MEC layers regarding the proportions of AS synapses established on dendritic spine heads. Layer VI exhibited the highest proportion of AS on spine heads (80%), whereas layer Va/b had the lowest proportion (55%; χ2, p&lt;0.0001). These findings are illustrated in Figure 6 and Supplementary file 1k.</p><p>The distribution of SS on different postsynaptic targets differed significantly from that observed for AS. The majority of SS were found on dendritic shafts (85.7%), with 47.6% on shafts containing dendritic protrusions (spiny shafts) and 38.1% on smooth dendritic shafts (aspiny shafts). A smaller proportion of SS were established on dendritic spine heads (12.1%) and spine necks (2.2%). Due to the low number of SS identified as axospinous in each layer (ranging from 3 in layer Va/b to 17 in layer Vc), statistical comparisons of this proportion between layers were not performed. However, we observed some variations between layers. Layer Va/b had the highest proportion of SS on dendritic shafts (92.3%), whereas layer Vc exhibited the lowest percentage of SS formed on shafts (77.4%; Figure 6; Supplementary file 1k).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Much of the value of this study derives from the data itself. It would be extremely beneficial for the authors to deposit the image volumes, synapse segmentations, and metadata online in a form that could be visualized in industry standard tools like Neuroglancer and read by software such as cloud-volume. This could be especially nice if integrated into the tissue coordinates identified from the light level analysis to create a multiscale dataset. I do see the synapse segmentations on the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph platform, but not the associated imagery. Moreover, the.seg format is for Espina, which appears to not be available for Mac OS. Given that the authors are engaging on a series of similar studies.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have now included the complete raw dataset obtained from our FIB/SEM images which was used to calculate all the measurements and analysis, presented in the manuscript as Supplementary file 2.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We thank the authors for the improvements made to the new manuscript, which have addressed many of our comments. We note that the authors have clarified the Results text, added some statistical test data, satisfactorily clarified their synapse annotation methods, and reformatted their plots to meet most of the Essential Revisions stipulations.</p><p>However, several points in the Essential Revisions still need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>(1) As stipulated in Essential Revision 3, the authors are required to include a way to access their EM data in their Data Availability statement. Although we understand the authors' concerns, sharing raw data is journal policy.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the importance of data sharing and have made significant efforts to comply with the journal's policy. As requested, we have included the complete raw data used for our analysis as Supplementary File 4. Additionally, the derived datasets generated by our software analysis are accessible through links to the EBRAINS repository, as detailed in the Data and Materials Availability section. We believe these data provide sufficient information to verify our findings and interpretations.</p><p>If the journal specifically requires the EM image stacks, we would like to clarify that while committed to data transparency, we are currently unable to share the complete EM image stacks due to ongoing segmentation and analysis processes. Premature release of these stacks could compromise these efforts. Extracting valuable information from these stacks is a time-consuming process that requires significant human resources, which are currently limited in our laboratory. However, we are exploring options to make these stacks accessible upon specific request, while still protecting our ongoing research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) As stipulated in Essential Revision 1, the authors are required to present an explicit quantification of variability for each synapse measurement, in two respects:</p><p>* Essential Revision 1a): between the 3 image stacks collected per donor+layer.</p><p>* Essential Revision 1b): between donors per layer.</p><p>We appreciate several revisions and responses made by the authors with respect to these requirements (below). We would like to clarify what additional changes are required to satisfy Essential Revisions 1a) and 1b) beyond these updates.</p><p>– The authors have included a of coefficient of variation for each synapse measure by layer (using aggregated donor/stack data).</p><p>– While the coefficient of variation is a useful quantification of the per-layer data assuming it is well-mixed, on its own it unfortunately does not address our main concerns of whether the data itself is well-mixed for each layer, across individual stacks per donor and across donors.</p><p>– Data visualizations now show inter-stack variability to a much greater extent, with most properties plotted in the format of Figure 3C (Figure 1C, 3A,C, 4C,E; Figure 1S1A, 4S3A,C).</p><p>- This represents a substantial improvement but does not include sufficient information to assess data mixing. The image stack means are provided without a measure of variance, but the combination of both mean and variance is necessary for visualizing cross-stack variability. Currently, error bars correspond to per-layer aggregated data, which is useful for the across-layer comparisons but does not address the issue of variability we raised.</p><p>– The authors have noted in their response (Essential Revisions 1c) that sampling of multiple small image stacks within a tissue can be sufficient to capture the distributions of synapse properties, citing Merchan-Perez et al. 2009 (which studied synapse numbers in the cerebral cortex).</p><p>– We agree that sampling can be a reasonable strategy for the measurement of anatomical synapse properties and that reconstruction of an entire tissue is not necessarily preferable in these cases. However, given that every donor, tissue type/sample, and synapse property is subject to different variability, it is essential to perform a quantitative analysis of the data itself to show that sampling is sufficient for the synapse properties measured. One piece of this analysis would be a demonstration that stacks are well-mixed, which we are requiring. An additional piece would be a power analysis.</p><p>With these points in mind, the following changes are required:</p><p>2A) Essential Revision 1a): in Figures1C, 3A,C, 4C,E 1S1A, and 4S3A,C, each data point must be given its own error bar to allow visual comparison of stacks (+/-standard deviation is fine). Additionally, statistical comparisons of the 3 image stacks per donor+layer should be explicitly reported for each synapse measure. A nonparametrical test that compares distributions, like the Mann-Whitney/Kruskal Wallis (used by the authors elsewhere in the manuscript) is appropriate and should be used. Test results (p-values) can be reported in a supplemental table; any cases in which stacks for a donor+layer significantly differ should be noted in the figure legends. Some kind of commentary on these results should also be provided in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have consulted experts on statistical analysis (Unidad de Tecnologías Ómicas at Instituto Cajal) regarding this issue. We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion to conduct statistical comparisons between the three image stacks per donor+layer for each synapse measure. However, synaptic density and intersynaptic distance are each represented by a single count (or ratio) per stack, making traditional statistical comparisons inappropriate [1]. While inter-donor variability was assessed, as detailed in response 2B, we acknowledge that non-parametrical tests to compare distributions of large samples (each stack of images contains hundreds of synapses) can easily detect as significant non-meaningful differences expected from minimal variability between biological samples [2,3].</p><p>Please note that for synapse size, our primary interest lies in comparing differences between donor-layers. Although variability between stacks within the same donor-layer exists, as is expected in biological samples, we believe that focusing on differences between donor-layers is more critical to addressing our research question. To further clarify this point, we have included new figures in the revised manuscript to illustrate inter-individual variability for all the synaptic parameters (please see response 2B).</p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Jiang, J.

Unfortunately, Dunn's test can fail to detect differences for several reasons (it applies a z-score approximation to each donor distribution, and it can use conservative p-value corrections). For this reason, Dunn test p-values should be considered alongside their corresponding KW test p-value.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this recommendation, p-values for the KW tests have been added to the Supplementary Table 3. The final results remain unchanged, as no additional differences were detected in the Kruskal-Wallis test. To be clearer on this matter, we have changed the following paragraph in “Synaptic parameters show little variability” section. It now reads:</p><p>“Statistical analyses only showed significant differences in two particular comparisons: SAS area of AS in layer II-is (KW, p&lt;0.05) and SAS area of complex AS in layer VI (KW, p&lt;0.01); in both analysis, differences were found between AB2 and AB7 (Dunn’s test, p&lt;0.05; Figure 3—figure supplement 1; Figure 4—figure supplement 5; Supplementary File 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The Discussion section should be condensed substantially (one notable part is Lines 516-568), as this version is still difficult to read through.</p></disp-quote><p>Discussion has been shortened in the suggested section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Line 571: it is stated that synapses &quot;were randomly distributed&quot;, but the statistical testing used only implies that no differences could be distinguished from random distributions, which is a different conclusion. Please adjust this phrasing to more accurately reflect the conclusions of these tests.</p></disp-quote><p>This section has been rephrased as suggested. Thank you for the feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Please place a scale bar in each panel of Figure 9 separately, to help readers more easily interpret these images (currently the authors use one scale bar for all panels, and this makes it difficult to visualize sizes in some panels).</p></disp-quote><p>A separate scale bar has been added to each panel in Figure 9 to facilitate the interpretation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
