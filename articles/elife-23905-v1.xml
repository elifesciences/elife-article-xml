The intracellular pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> manipulates autophagy by delivering the effector protein RavZ to deconjugate Atg8/LC3 proteins coupled to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on autophagosomal membranes. To understand how RavZ recognizes and deconjugates LC3-PE, we prepared semisynthetic LC3 proteins and elucidated the structures of the RavZ:LC3 interaction. Semisynthetic LC3 proteins allowed the analysis of structure-function relationships. RavZ extracts LC3-PE from the membrane before deconjugation. RavZ initially recognizes the LC3 molecule on membranes via its N-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif. The RavZ α3 helix is involved in extraction of the PE moiety and docking of the acyl chains into the lipid-binding site of RavZ that is related in structure to that of the phospholipid transfer protein Sec14.

To stay on top of the game, cells use many ways to defend themselves. Autophagy, for example, is a process that breaks down unwanted or damaged molecules inside cells, which has also been linked to fighting infections caused by disease-causing microbes. During this process, structures called autophagosomes engulf the molecules or microbes, and digest them with the help of enzymes.</p><p>Forming an autophagosome is a complex process that requires several steps and molecules. First, cells create a growing membrane sac that collects the debris and eventually seals to form the autophagosome. One of the key proteins that expands the membrane is the protein LC3, which is located on the both sides of the autophagosome’s membrane. LC3 must be linked to an oily molecule (or lipid), known as PE for short, in order to interact with this membrane. The combined molecule LC3-PE then provides a docking station for receptor proteins that collect and deliver the debris, including microbes, into the growing autophagosome. A specific part of these receptors called LIR, short for LC3-interacting region motif, connects the receptors to LC3.</p><p>Some bacteria have evolved mechanisms to avoid autophagy or can even hijack the process to survive in the host cell. For example, the bacterium <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, which causes Legionnaire’s disease, manipulates the main molecular pathways involved in autophagy to avoid being digested by the host cell. The bacterium injects a protein called RavZ into the cell, which splits the lipid component from LC3-PE. It was still unknown, however, how RavZ can recognize and split LC3-PE.</p><p>Yang et al. created LC3 proteins with different PE fragments to study the molecular pathways underlying this process. The experiments revealed that RavZ also contains LIR motifs that it uses to recognize and attach to LC3. After RavZ binds, it extracts LC3-PE from the membrane of autophagosomes and integrates the PE part into its own lipid-binding site. RavZ then splits LC3-PE by removing the lipid component of the protein. Building on this knowledge, Yang et al. were able to experimentally prevent RavZ from breaking up LC3-PE. This suggests that hindering RavZ from binding by blocking its LIR motif could represent a potential pharmaceutical approach to stop <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> from avoiding autophagy.</p><p>A next step will be to confirm if blocking RavZ could indeed support autophagy. It will also be useful to find out if other microbes use the same mechanisms as <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> to avoid autophagy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23905.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23905.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic></kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>host-pathogen interaction</kwd><kwd>native chemical ligation</kwd><kwd>Sec14</kwd><kwd>GDI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Introduction of Innovative R&amp;D Team Program of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2009010058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Aimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 1623</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Yao-Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ChemBioAP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Yao-Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Behren-Weise Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Yao-Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Legionella</italic> effector RavZ evades host autophagy by extracting LC3-PE from the membrane before deconjugation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular degradation process in eukaryotes, which is essential for cellular homeostasis in response to various environmental and cellular stresses. During autophagy, a double-membrane structure, termed as phagophore (or isolation membrane) engulfs the cytosolic components and closes to form an autophagosome, which subsequently fuses with a lysosome, resulting in degradation of internal contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mizushima and Komatsu, 2011</xref>). Autophagosome formation is the key process in autophagy. The biogenesis of autophagosomes is believed to be dependent on the formation of lipidated Atg8. Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and GABARAP family proteins are the orthologs of yeast Atg8 in mammalian cells. Lipidated and membrane-associated Atg8/LC3 has been used as a bona fide marker of autophagosomes and progression of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sou et al., 2008</xref>). Production of lipidated Atg8/LC3 is controlled by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems. Newly synthesized Atg8/LC3 is processed by a protease, Atg4, to expose a C-terminal glycine. The resulting Atg8/LC3 is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) through a ubiquitin-like conjugation reaction controlled by Atg7, Atg3 and the Atg12-Atg5:Atg16 complex. The Atg12-5:16 complex is generated by another ubiquitin-like conjugation system controlled by Atg7 and Atg10. Atg4 releases lipidated Atg8/LC3 from the surface of autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kirisako et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tanida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xie et al., 2008</xref>). However, the role of Atg8-PE and its regulators in autophagosome formation remain poorly understood.</p><p>Autophagy also serves as a defense mechanism against invading pathogens (termed xenophagy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deretic, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levine, 2005</xref>). Xenophagy recognizes bacteria through autophagy receptors that contain two crucial domains, the ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) and LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs, which are important for cargo recognition and interaction with the LC3 proteins, respectively. The receptor binds to the ubiquitinated pathogen through its UBD and recruits it to the autophagosome membrane via the interaction of the LIR motifs to LC3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirkin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Korac et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mostowy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thurston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von Muhlinen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wild et al., 2011</xref>). LIR motifs are also present in receptor and scaffold proteins involved in other selective autophagy processes and play an essential role in recruiting components of the autophagy machinery to phagophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klionsky and Schulman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noda et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is not clear how LIR motifs selectively recognize mammalian Atg8 family members.</p><p>Some bacteria have evolved specific mechanisms to avoid autophagy or even hijack the autophagy machinery in order to survive in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choy and Roy, 2013</xref>). The pathogenic bacterium <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, which causes Legionnaire’s disease, manipulates the core machinery of autophagosome formation to evade host autophagy. <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> inhibits autophagy by injecting an effector protein called RavZ into the cytoplasm. RavZ functions as a cysteine protease and irreversibly deconjugates mammalian Atg8s from PE to inhibit autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choy et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike Atg4 that cleaves the amide bond between terminal glycine and PE, RavZ cleaves the amide bond before glycine. As a consequence, the RavZ-cleaved Atg8 proteins cannot be relipidated, leading to inhibition of autophagy. RavZ represents an interesting pathogenic effector, functional characterization of which will shed light on the mechanism of autophagosome biogenesis.</p><p>To date, how RavZ recognizes and deconjugates LC3-PE is not known. This is largely due to the previously insurmountable difficulties in recombinant preparation and handling of lipidated LC3 proteins. Herein, semi-synthetic LC3 proteins make it possible to elaborate the mechanism of RavZ function. We have used chemical methods to produce LC3 proteins with different C-terminal modifications, enabling the analysis of structure-function relationships of LC3-deconjugation by RavZ, allowing formulation of a membrane extraction model. We find that RavZ extracts LC3-PE from membranes and then deconjugates C-terminal Gly-PE. We show that the second N-terminal LIR motif (LIR2) is required for RavZ activity and RavZ:LC3 interaction. The crystal structures of RavZ:LC3 and LIR2:LC3 complexes and interaction analysis suggest RavZ initially recognizes LC3 mainly via its LIR2 motif. We identify the lipid-binding site (LBS) of RavZ, which shows a similar fold to that of the LBS of yeast phospholipid transfer proteins (Sec14 family). The LBS involves a highly dynamic and hydrophobic helix α3 that is engaged in association with the membrane and plays an essential role in extraction of the conjugated PE from the membrane. Therefore, by a combination of chemical, biophysical and cell biological approaches, we gain insights into a novel mode of host-pathogen interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Semi-synthesis of LC3 proteins with various C-terminal modifications</title><p>Advances in protein ligation methods have provided a powerful tool for studying post-translational modified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dawson and Kent, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hackenberger and Schwarzer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vila-Perelló and Muir, 2010</xref>).

RavZ only cleaved LC3-PE but not pro-LC3, whereas Atg4 cleaved both substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In keeping with previous studies, Atg4B treatment led to LC3<sup>1–120</sup>, whereas RavZ-mediated deconjugation resulted in LC3<sup>1–119</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In a previous report, RavZ deconjugated LC3-PE from membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choy et al., 2012</xref>). However, our results suggest that RavZ can cleave LC3-PE without the requirement for membranes.</p><p>The question then arises as to how RavZ recognizes LC3-PE. Based on the results shown above, two possible hypotheses could be made. First, RavZ would recognize a certain soluble fragment derived from the PE rather than the lipid chain, which could not be ‘seen’ by RavZ when it is buried in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Second, the fatty acid chain would be required for binding to RavZ. In this case, LC3-PE would have to be extracted from the membrane by RavZ before proteolytic cleavage could occur. To distinguish these scenarios, a structure-function relationship study of RavZ-mediated deconjugation is required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The semisynthetic LC3 proteins make it possible to perform such an analysis. LC3 proteins with different C-terminal modifications were subjected to RavZ and Atg4B treatment. The measurements showed that RavZ cannot cleave LC3 proteins containing soluble fragments derived from PE, while Atg4B is active toward these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). RavZ only cleaves PE-modified LC3 proteins, with a preference for long fatty acid chain. Enzyme kinetic data show that the catalytic efficiency of RavZ for LC3-PE (16:0) (<italic>k<sub>ca</sub></italic><sub>t</sub>/<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 1140 M<sup>−1</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup>) is 12 times higher than that for LC3-PE (6:0) (<italic>k<sub>ca</sub></italic><sub>t</sub>/<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 93.8 M<sup>−1</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). LC3-C16 cannot be processed by RavZ, suggesting that LC3 with a single fatty acid chain is not sufficient for hydrolysis by RavZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In contrast, Atg4B can cleave all modified LC3 proteins tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and E</xref>). Taken together, in contrast to Atg4B activity that does not require any specific structure downstream of the C-terminal glycine, RavZ activity is strictly dependent on conjugated PE structures. Therefore, it is conceivable that RavZ contains a lipid-binding site and can extract LC3-PE from the membrane before cleavage. This extraction model is further confirmed in later experiments.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23905.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structure-function relationship of LC3-deconjugation by RavZ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of proteo-membrane containing LC3-PE.

Both RavZ wt and RavZ<sup>C258A</sup> significantly inhibited GFP-LC3 puncta formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). However, the inhibitory effect of RavZ<sup>C258A</sup> was not observed in a previous report, where GFP-LC3 and RavZ<sup>C258A</sup> were transiently expressed in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choy et al., 2012</xref>). We repeated the experiment using cells transiently expressing GFP-LC3. We also find that RavZ wt but not RavZ<sup>C258A</sup> inhibits GFP-LC3 puncta formation under these conditions, probably due to the high expression level of GFP-LC3 in transient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–1E</xref>). RavZ wt but not RavZ<sup>C258A</sup> led to decrease in LC3-II level in GFP-LC3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–3F</xref>). Moreover, lipidated LC3 was found in the soluble fraction in RavZ<sup>C258A</sup>-expressing cells, which is in contrast to the control, where lipidated LC3 is only found in the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Both RavZ wt and RavZ<sup>C258A</sup> significantly inhibited p62 degradation, a marker for autophagy flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and G</xref>). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of RavZ<sup>C258A</sup> is a result of extraction of lipidated LC3 molecules from membranes, leading to accumulation of LC3-II in the cytosol and reduction of membrane-localized LC3 proteins. This scenario is quite different from the effect of overexpression of Atg4B<sup>C74A</sup> (a protease-deficient mutant), which inhibits LC3 lipidation by sequestration of unlipidated LC3 through formation of stable complexes in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>). Since the lipidated LC3 level is not changed in RavZ<sup>C258A</sup>-expressing cells, RavZ<sup>C258A</sup> inhibits autophagy by sequestrating lipidated LC3 proteins rather than unlipidated LC3 proteins. These findings indicate that RavZ does not interfere with autophagy machinery upstream of Atg8/LC3 but specifically processes lipidated LC3 proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The LIR motif is essential for RavZ activity</title><p>The importance of the LIR motif for recognition of Atg8/LC3 in selective autophagy prompted us to identify LIR motifs in RavZ. The LIR motif is composed of conserved W/Y/FxxL/I/V sequence. The binding of LIR motifs with Atg8/LC3 proteins is quite conserved, with two key hydrophobic residues playing an essential role in interaction with the hydrophobic pocket of the Atg8s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ichimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noda et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2010</xref>). Three potential LIR motifs of RavZ were identified by the iLIR online server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalvari et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The first and second LIR motifs are located at the N-terminal region of RavZ (residues 14–19, LIR1; and 27–32, LIR2), while the third motif is in the C-terminal region (residues 433–438, LIR3). To identify which LIR motif is involved in RavZ activity and to map the catalytic domain of RavZ, RavZ was dissected into fragments and subjected to the in vitro LC3-PE cleavage assay and to measurement of binding with LC3 by a fluorescence polarization assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Truncation of LIR1 (20–502) and LIR3 (1–431) did not influence RavZ activity and led to only up to ca. twofold reduction of binding affinity with LC3, whereas simultaneous truncation of LIR1 and LIR2 (33–502 and 55–487) completely abolished cleavage activity and reduced the binding affinity with LC3 by 2–4 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Mutation of the key aromatic residue (F29A) of LIR2 led to dramatic reduction of RavZ activity, whereas mutation of LIR1 (F16A) did not affect RavZ activity. The RavZ<sup>F16/F29A</sup> mutant showed the same effect as RavZ<sup>F29A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). These results demonstrate that LIR2 is crucial for RavZ activity. However, fragments containing one of the LIR motifs can still form stable complexes with LC3. In contrast, RavZ fragments (55–430 and 55–331) without LIR motifs completely lost their binding ability to LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Therefore, LIR2 is crucial for both binding and cleavage activities. Indeed, RavZ fragment 20–331 that contains only LIR2 can cleave LC3-PE with only twofold decrease in binding affinity to LC3. Thus, RavZ<sup>20-331</sup> represents the minimal catalytic domain. Prompted by these results, we tested binding of the LIR2 peptide (DIDEFDLLEGDE) to LC3 by ITC and binding of the fluorescein-labeled LIR2 peptide to LC3 by fluorescence polarization, leading to dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) of 360 nM and 550 nM, respectively, which is comparable with that of RavZ:LC3 complex (K<sub>d</sub> = 260 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Therefore, the LIR2 motif of RavZ contributes the major binding energy for RavZ:LC3 interaction.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23905.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The LIR motif is essential for RavZ:LC3 binding and cleavage activity of RavZ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of RavZ fragments showing LIR motifs and the catalytic residue Cys258.

RavZ shows two major domains, the N-terminal catalytic domain (residues 49–320, catalytic triad: C258, H176, D197) and the C-terminal domain (329-423). In line with the crystal structure, RavZ<sup>1–331</sup> showed similar LC3-binding affinity and catalytic efficiency to the wild-type RavZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting the catalytic domain is sufficient for deconjugation of LC3-PE.

The complex shows 1:1 stoichiometry. However, the complex displays only a relatively small binding interface (300 Å<sup>2</sup>). Nevertheless, the structure of RavZ in the complex shows a well-defined resolution of flexible loops, which are missing in the free-structure. The loop (249–253), loop (278–287) and the α8-α9 loop (346–356) are now visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Importantly, the N-terminal loop containing the LIR2 motif (residues 25 to 48) is resolved in the structure. LIR2 of RavZ interacts with the α2-β3 loop of LC3 instead of the canonic LIR-binding site that involves hydrophobic pockets located in β1, β2 and α3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noda et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2010</xref>). Further analysis of the crystal contacts between symmetry-related RavZ molecules (RavZa and RavZb) shows that LIR2 of RavZa interacts extensively with RavZb, involving the α3 loop and the β6-β7 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Comparing with the free-RavZ structure, the α3 loop in the complex moves ca. 9 Å inward, suggesting a dynamic nature of this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Key hydrophobic interactions include F29 (RavZa) with Y211 (RavZb), L31 (RavZa) with I170 (RavZb), L208 (RavZb) and F212 (RavZb). It is conceivable that the crystal packing led to a low-energy binding configuration involving interaction of LIR2 with the α3 loop of its symmetric mate. Such an interaction is less likely to exist outside the crystal, because the affinities of the α3 mutant (Y211D/F212D/Y216D) and the wild-type RavZ toward LC3 are identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Both structures are identical and solved in the same space group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). There are two molecules (molecule A and B) of the LIR2-LC3 fusion in one asymmetric unit with LIR2 of each molecule interacting with its symmetry-related LC3 molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The hydrophobic interaction of LIR2 with LC3 is conserved and adopts the classical LIR-LC3-binding mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klionsky and Schulman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noda et al., 2010</xref>). The first aromatic residue, F29, of LIR2 interacts with the first hydrophobic pocket (HP1) consisting of I23, P32, L53, F108 and the alkyl sidechain of K51 and the second aromatic residue L32 interacts with the second hydrophobic pocket (HP2) consisting of F52, V54, P55, V58, L63 and I66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). The salt bridge interactions of residues LIR2<sup>E28</sup> with LC3<sup>K51</sup> and LIR2<sup>D30</sup> with LC3<sup>R70</sup> are observed in both structures. We further investigate whether RavZ shows preference on binding to individual Atg8 family proteins, we tested binding of LIR2 peptide with three Atg8 members (representing two subfamilies), LC3B, GABARAPL1 and GATE16. No significant difference in binding affinities was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, RavZ has no preference in binding to Atg8 proteins.</p><p>To verify the interaction of LIR2 with LC3 seen in the crystal structure, we mutated the interacting residues on LC3, hydrophobic residues (F52 and L53) and charged residues (K51 and R70), to alanine. The mutants were subjected to binding analysis with the LIR2 peptide by fluorescence polarization. F52A mutation led to the reduction of LIR2 binding by about sixfold (K<sub>d</sub> = 3.14 µM), while R70A mutation reduced binding affinity about 15-fold (K<sub>d</sub> = 8.10 µM). L53A and K51A mutation led to only residual effect on binding to LIR2. No binding of the free LIR2 peptide with the LIR2-LC3 fusion protein was observed under these conditions, suggesting that the LIR2 peptide competes with the conjugated LIR2 peptide for binding to the LIR-binding site of LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, RavZ and the LIR2 peptide bind to LC3 in a competitive manner, as shown by the competitive titration and enzymatic inhibition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Therefore, RavZ recognizes LC3 mainly via its N-terminal LIR2 motif by binding to the LIR-binding site in LC3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Molecular basis of LC3-PE extraction by RavZ</title><p>In order to understand the thermodynamic basis of RavZ extraction, we sought to determine the binding affinity of RavZ<sup>C258A</sup> with LC3-PE and LC3<sup>1–119</sup> by microscale thermophoresis (MST) technique. To make LC3-PE soluble in solution without detergent, MBP tag was left intact. The measurements showed that RavZ<sup>C258A</sup>binds to MBP-LC3-PE and MBP-LC3<sup>1–119</sup> with dissociation constants (Kd) of 23 ± 4 nM and 69 ± 5 nM, respectively, which suggests that RavZ binds to lipidated LC3 in three times higher affinity than unlipidated LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for RavZ extraction is modest but still favorable.</p><p>Based on our model, there should be a lipid-binding site (LBS) in RavZ. The amino acid sequence of RavZ does not give any hint of the LBS. We superimposed the free RavZ structure with the phospholipid-binding domain of Sec14 proteins (PDB: 1AUA and 3B74), which are the major yeast phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)/phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) transfer proteins and are essential for lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schaaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Welti et al., 2007</xref>). Structural alignment indicated that part of the N-terminal catalytic domain of RavZ (α2–α4, β6–β9) shows a similar fold to that of the core-lipid-binding domain of Sec14, consisting of 5 β-strands and 4 α-helices (α7–α10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schaaf et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The β sheets of Sec14 serve as the floor of hydrophobic binding pocket, along helices α7-α10 that gate the Sec14 pocket, forming extensive van der Waals contacts with the bound fatty acid chains. Helices α9–α10 act as lid helices, which move toward helix α8 upon lipid binding to form a closed conformation to capture lipid into the binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Welti et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly in RavZ, helices α2 (corresponding to α7 of Sec14) and α4 (corresponding to α8 of Sec14) along β sheets form a large hydrophobic interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). However, the hydrophobic pocket is closed in RavZ, suggesting that a conformational change may be required to accommodate the fatty acid chains. A lid helix in RavZ is not clearly observed based on the structural alignment. However, due to the highly dynamic and hydrophobic nature of α3, it is possible that α3 may resemble the function of the lid helix and may undergo substantial movements to interact and stabilize the lipid moiety in the LBS upon binding of PE.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23905.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Identification of the lipid-binding site (LBS) of RavZ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural alignment between the lipid-binding sites of yeast Sec14 homolog (Shf1) (PDB: 3B74) and RavZ.

The In vitro LC3-PE cleavage assay showed that most of the mutants affect the cleavage activity of RavZ. The double mutation (Y211D/F212D, α3-m2) or triple mutation (Y211D/F212D/Y216D, α3-m3) in α3 completely abolished the cleavage activity. A single mutation scan shows that F211D, Y212D and L208D dramatically reduce the cleavage activity, whereas the Y216D mutant largely retains activity. Triple mutation of the gate residues on α4 (L224D/I288D/L232D) and the α4-β9 loop (F242D/L239D/F237D) led to significant reduction in cleavage activity. To confirm the floor residues of the hydrophobic pocket of RavZ, we mutated hydrophobic residues on α2 (L139D/L143D) and β7 (L180D/I182D). Again, these mutations significantly reduced cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the deconjugation activity of RavZ mutants in cells, GFP-LC3 cells were transfected with different mCherry-RavZ mutant constructs. An additional mutant RavZ<sup>F163D</sup> (F163 on β6 located inside of the hydrophobic cavity) was also included in the assay. The level of LC3-II was evaluated by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and GFP-LC3 puncta assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Cells expressing RavZ mutants displayed a significant increase in the ratio of endogenous LC3-II/LC3-I as well as the ratio of GFP-LC3-II/GFP-LC3-I and in the number of GFP-LC3 puncta, compared to those expressing wild-type RavZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that deficient activity of RavZ mutants results in decreased deconjugation of LC3-PE in cells. Moreover, the α3-m2 mutant completely abolished RavZ deconjugation activity in vivo. These results are in line with those obtained by the in vitro LC3-PE cleavage assay.</p><p>To further examine the extraction activity of RavZ mutants, GFP-LC3 cells were transfected with mCherry-RavZ<sup>C258A</sup> mutant constructs. In keeping with the deconjugation results, a significantly higher number of GFP-LC3 puncta was observed in cells expressing RavZ<sup>C258A</sup> mutants than those expressing RavZ<sup>C258A</sup>, indicating less extraction activity of these mutants in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Consistently, the α3-m2 and α3-m3 mutants completely lost extraction activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). Moreover, all RavZ mutants bind to LC3 with similar K<sub>d</sub> values to those of the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and display similar secondary structure with comparable α helix content to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Therefore, the mutations do not significantly affect protein folding and binding to LC3. Taken together, we conclude that the LBS of RavZ, consisting of α2, α3, α4, α4–β9 loop and β sheets (β6–β9), accommodates the fatty acid chains of PE. The LBS plays an essential role in extraction and cleavage of LC3-PE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In previous studies, the substrate LC3-PE was produced on liposomes by recombinant reconstitution of the ubiquitin-like conjugation system (i.e. mammalian Atg7, Atg3 and Atg8s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choy et al., 2012</xref>). The question then arises whether RavZ activity requires membranes or not. However, production of liposome-free LC3-PE and manipulation of LC3-PE structures are difficult using the recombinant approach. In this study, the semisynthetic approach makes it possible to address these inherent problems in the analysis of post-translationally modified proteins. We have used chemical approaches to prepare LC3 proteins with various modifications in a membrane-free manner.</p><p>Using semisynthetic LC3 proteins modified with various PE fragments, we analyzed the structure-function relationship of LC3 deconjugation by RavZ. We demonstrate that RavZ activity is strictly dependent on the lipid structure of the substrate and RavZ cleaves LC3-PE without requirement for membranes. These observations indicate an extraction model of RavZ function, which is further proved by the extraction assay using protease-deficient RavZ. This is the first-time identification of such an action mode for host-pathogen interactions. Although the N-terminal catalytic domain is sufficient to bind and cleave LC3-PE in solution, its extraction activity and thereby its deconjugating activity in vivo are attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). Therefore, association of RavZ with membranes via its C-terminal PI3P-binding domain is also required for efficient extraction in vivo, probably by targeting RavZ to the autophagosome membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Horenkamp et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> may have evolved both functions simultaneously, that is extraction and cleavage. The former determines the specificity and the latter confers the turnover. Without retrieval of LC3-PE from membranes RavZ cannot perform proteolytic activity. However, although extraction alone is sufficient to inhibit autophagy, it requires a much higher amount of RavZ molecules because it is driven by stoichiometric binding between RavZ and LC3-PE. The proteolytic function of RavZ drives turnover of LC3-PE molecules, so that less than stoichiometric amounts of RavZ molecules are needed. It is possible that the extraction model may be present in other host-pathogen interactions, such as <italic>Shigella</italic> effector IpaJ with N-myristoylated Arf GTPases and <italic>Yersinia</italic> effector YopT with prenylated RhoA GTPases, since these effectors also recognize the lipid group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burnaevskiy et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shao et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2003</xref>).</p><p>We have demonstrated that the LIR2 motif (residue 27–32) plays an essential role in RavZ activity and RavZ:LC3 interaction. Interestingly, the LIR motif at the N-terminal tail of Atg4B is involved in regulation of Atg4B activity. Binding of the LIR motif with the second non-substrate LC3 molecule leads to an open conformation, which is required for deconjugation of LC3. Atg4B lacking the N-terminal tail shows higher processing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Satoo et al., 2009</xref>). It is not clear whether such interaction occurs in vivo. However, the LIR2 motif of RavZ is required for initial recognition of LC3. The LIR-LC3 binding constitutes the major interaction between RavZ and LC3 before extraction of the PE moiety from the membrane. Therefore, LIR2 is involved in recognizing and orienting the LC3 molecule to facilitate subsequent extraction and cleavage of LC3-PE. According to this model, it is not surprising that RavZ does not process PE-peptides containing C-terminal amino acid residues of LC3 and the Rab7-CQETFG-PE chimeric protein, due to the lack of LIR binding. In contrast, <italic>Shigella</italic> effector IpaJ and <italic>Yersinia</italic> effector YopT can process the lipidated peptides containing an N-myristoylated glycine and a C-terminally prenylated polybasic sequence, respectively, suggesting a unique manner of recognizing substrate for RavZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burnaevskiy et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shao et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2003</xref>). Based on this finding, we are able to inhibit RavZ activity by the LIR2 peptide (IC<sub>50</sub> = 43 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that suppression of LIR-LC3 binding could be beneficial for attenuating inhibition of host autophagy by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>.</p><p>Through structural alignment with yeast lipid transfer proteins and mutagenesis studies, we have identified the LBS of RavZ, involving α2, α3, α4, the α4–β9 loop and β sheets (β6–β9). The LBS is required for both extraction and cleavage of LC3-PE. Therefore, LIR2:LC3 and LBS:PE interactions may constitute two major binding interfaces for RavZ:LC3-PE complex, which place the C-terminal tail of LC3 at the correct position of the active site of RavZ for cleavage. However, such a LBS is not observed in Atg4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>), consistent with the observation that Atg4B has no specificity toward structures C-terminal to the scissile bond. This could be one of the explanations for the distinct modes of action of Atg4 and RavZ. The fold of the N-terminal catalytic domain of RavZ is closely related to cysteine proteases in the ubiquitin-like (Ubl)-specific protease (Ulp) family that is specific for de-conjugating Ubl proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mossessova and Lima, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen et al., 2005</xref>). A similar LBS fold is also found in Ulp proteins (NEDP1, PBD: 2BKR), but this fold is lack of the α3 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). It should be noted that the LBS of RavZ is closed without showing a binding pocket for lipid, whereas a clear hydrophobic binding cavity that can accommodate fatty acid chains is observed in free Sec14 structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Because the PE moiety involves interaction with residues located deep in the LBS fold, there must be a conformational change to open the lipid-binding site, for example, by outward movement of α4. Because α4 is connected to β9 <italic>via</italic> the highly dynamic α3 loop, such a movement could be made possible. These findings are in keeping with the important role of the α3 loop in RavZ activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–6F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). The hydrophobic and dynamic features of α3 are in agreement with this proposed function. The association of α3 with the membrane, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Horenkamp et al., 2015</xref>), may facilitate initial interaction of α3 with the conjugated PE in the membrane. Subsequently, the lipid-binding site of RavZ is open and able to accommodate the PE moiety that is dug out of the membrane by α3, which moves toward the LBS. The α3 may serve as a lid for the lipid-binding pocket to confer the binding of fatty acid chains.</p><p>Intracellular molecules with analogous feature, that is extraction of lipidated proteins, are GDP-dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) and the GDI-like molecule PDEδ, which serve as recycling factors for prenylated Ras GTPase family proteins (Ras, Rho and Rab) between membranes and the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ismail et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tnimov et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the lipid-binding site of isolated RabGDI is also closed and undergoes a conformational change involving an outward movement of an α helix to open the LBS for accommodating the prenyl moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rak et al., 2003</xref>). The opening of the LBS is induced by binding to a Rab molecule rather than the prenyl group per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ignatev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, RavZ has evolved a GDI-like mechanism to extract LC3-PE from membranes. Taken together, we propose a working model of RavZ function as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23905.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Working model of RavZ-mediated LC3-PE deconjugation on the membrane.</title><p>RavZ (deep teal) recognizes LC3 molecule (green) on the membrane <italic>via</italic> its LIR2 motif (magenta).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kim Orth (Reviewer #2); Hubert Hilbi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Yang et al. analyze the mode of action of the <italic>Legionella</italic> protein RavZ. This translocated effector protein has previously been shown to irreversibly deconjugate Atg8/LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), thus inhibiting the autophagy pathway. The authors use semi-synthesis approaches to produce LC3 proteins modified with different PE derivatives. These substrates are then employed to assess binding, catalytic activity and structure-function relationships of the RavZ-LC3 complex. The study shows that RavZ (i) specifically cleaves LC3-DPPE and LC3-DHPE in vitro, (ii) extracts LC3-PE from membranes prior to cleavage, and (iii) binds to LC3 through an N-terminal LIR motif, which is composed of conserved aromatic/hydrophobic amino acids and required for substrate cleavage. Moreover, (iv) the crystal structure of a RavZ:LC3 complex indicated that RavZ forms a lipid binding site homologous to the eukaryotic lipid transfer protein Sec14, and (v) the functional relevance of this lipid binding groove was tested by mutational analysis and in vitro LC3-PE cleavage assays.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this is a very interesting study. However, several points were raised that are listed below. In particular, certain information is missing from some of the figure legends and the model should be improved.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) &quot;Apo-protein/-enzyme&quot; is canonically used to designate a protein/enzyme lacking its non-proteinaceous co-factor. Accordingly, the terms &quot;apo-structure&quot;, &quot;apo-RavZ structure&quot; and &quot;apo-Sec14 structure&quot;, which are used in the manuscript to describe proteins/structures in absence of a (lipo-)protein binding partner, seems misleading.

We have now performed microscale thermophoresis (MST) measurements to compare the direct interaction of RavZ with LC3-PE and LC3. To make LC3-PE soluble in solution without detergent, MBP tag was left intact. The measurements showed that RavZ<sup>C258A</sup> binds to MBP-LC3-PE and MBP-LC3<sup>1-119</sup> with dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) of 23 ± 4 nM and 69 ± 5 nM, respectively, which suggests that RavZ binds to lipidated LC3 in 3 times higher affinity than unlipidated LC3. Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for RavZ extraction is modest but still favorable.
