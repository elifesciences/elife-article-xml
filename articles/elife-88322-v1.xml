remain unknown. To test the idea that circulating factors mediate age-dependent changes in peripheral rhythms, we compared the ability of human serum from young and old individuals to synchronize circadian rhythms in culture. We collected blood from apparently healthy young (age 25–30) and old (age 70–76) individuals at 14:00 and used the serum to synchronize cultured fibroblasts. We found that young and old sera are equally competent at initiating robust ~24 hr oscillations of a luciferase reporter driven by clock gene promoter. However, cyclic gene expression is affected, such that young and old sera promote cycling of different sets of genes. Genes that lose rhythmicity with old serum entrainment are associated with oxidative phosphorylation and Alzheimer’s Disease as identified by STRING and IPA analyses. Conversely, the expression of cycling genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis increased in the cells entrained with old serum. Genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription/translation remain rhythmic in both conditions. We did not observe a global difference in the distribution of phase between groups, but found that peak expression of several clock-controlled genes (<italic>PER3, NR1D1, NR1D2, CRY1, CRY2,</italic> and <italic>TEF</italic>) lagged in the cells synchronized ex vivo with old serum. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that age-dependent blood-borne factors affect circadian rhythms in peripheral cells and have the potential to impact health and disease via maintaining or disrupting rhythms respectively.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian rhythms</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5UL1TR001878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sehgal</surname><given-names>Amita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00HL147212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Shirley L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-NS105607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Jessica E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH NS48471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Jessica E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gilliam Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Jessica E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sehgal</surname><given-names>Amita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Blood-borne factors contribute to changes in the circadian transcriptome with age.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circadian rhythms are known to regulate homeostatic physiology including sleep:wake, hormone production and body temperature, and their dysregulation with aging is accompanied by adverse health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monk et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Monk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hood and Amir, 2017</xref>), raising the possibility that health decline with age is caused in part by circadian dysfunction. Although the mechanisms responsible for age effects on circadian rhythms are unknown, signals from the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) dampen with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hood and Amir, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farajnia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakamura et al., 2011</xref>) and rhythms change in peripheral tissues in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamazaki et al., 2002</xref>). Here, we aimed to develop a cell culture model to study the effect of aging on human rhythms of peripheral tissues. Given that serum can reset the clock in peripheral fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerber et al., 2013</xref>), we questioned the extent to which serum factors normally contribute to peripheral rhythms of gene expression and how they might affect rhythms with age, given that blood-borne factors can influence other aspects of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katsimpardi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Using an established clinical study paradigm that sampled blood at 14:00 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pagani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qin et al., 2020</xref>), we collected blood from young (age 25–30) and old (age 70–76) apparently healthy individuals with behavioral and physiological outputs quantified by wearable devices, and we tested the hypothesis that age-dependent factors in the sera affect circadian rhythms in cultured fibroblasts. In support of this hypothesis, we show here that genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial functions lose rhythmicity in fibroblasts exposed to aged serum factors. We also find evidence of reduced entrainment in terms of altered expression of several molecular clock genes (<italic>PER3, NR1D1, NR1D2, CRY1, CRY2,</italic> and <italic>TEF</italic>) when synchronized with aged serum. These findings suggest that age-related changes in blood borne factors contribute to impaired circadian physiology and the associated disease risks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We enrolled eight old and seven young human subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), whose demographics are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

On average, a lower rhythm-adjusted mean (mesor) heart rate of 55.8±3.5 bpm was found in old compared to 69.7±5.0 bmp in young, along with a higher heart rate variability (RR intervals) of 1106.7±80.5ms compared to 893.2±61.8ms, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

An additional rationale for using this line is that it derives from normal human tissue, providing an advantage in studying normal physiology when compared to the commonly used U2OS line which is a genomically unstable osteosarcoma with chromosomal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Romaih et al., 2003</xref>).

When comparing the circadian transcriptome entrained by either young or old sera (n=4 sera per group), 1519 genes lost rhythmicity with age (B, top) while only 637 genes gained rhythmicity with age (B, bottom). Weighted BIC criterion with a threshold of 0.75 was used to assess rhythmicity (<bold>B</bold>). The number of genes rhythmic in young and old (according to weighted BIC &gt; 0.75 criterion) that show a detectable change in MESOR (q&lt;0.05 criterion for MESOR difference) is 568, with MESOR increasing in 163 and decreasing in 405 genes. Out of these, 40 genes with increased MESOR (red) and 98 genes with decreased MESOR (blue) also satisfy the condition |log₂ FC|&gt; 0.25 (<bold>C</bold>). We were only able to detect change in amplitude for a small number of genes, 39 genes had decreased amplitude in old and 2 had increased amplitude using CircaCompare.

This is not surprising because the first day includes acute responses of the fibroblasts to serum, which can mask circadian rhythms, and so the second day is expected to reveal differences in endogenous rhythms between samples. Day 2 also revealed different phases of cyclic expression between young and old subjects for a larger number of genes. We proceeded to collect fibroblasts synchronized by sera from eight different subjects (four old, four young with two male and two female per group) at 2-hr intervals, from 32 to 58 hr post serum addition. This added an extra two timepoints to the second day to facilitate the calculation of rhythmicity. Using CircaCompare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parsons et al., 2020</xref> and a weighted Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)&gt;0.75 cutoff, a significant number of genes were found to lose (1519 genes) or gain (637 genes) rhythmicity with age, underscoring the impact of age on the ability of serum to synchronize circadian rhythms, while 1209 genes were rhythmic in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). Additionally, we used CircaCompare to estimate MESORs, amplitudes, and phases of gene oscillatory patterns in young and old groups, and to compare these cosinor parameters between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). Of the genes that were rhythmic in both groups, many also showed changes with age. For instance, 568 cyclically expressed genes showed a change in MESOR with age (q&lt;0.05 for MESOR differences), with MESOR values increasing for 163 genes and decreasing for 405 genes in the old serum-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, right).

STRING analysis revealed that the dominant pathways associated with genes rhythmic in both young and old conditions, cell cycle and DNA replication, demonstrate a decrease in MESOR with old serum.

By STRING analysis, 24 out of the 26 genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation overlap with the Alzheimer’s Disease KEGG pathway highlighting the disease relevance of this class of genes that loses cycling in older individuals. Given that Alzheimer’s pathology is closely associated with the accumulation of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holubiec et al., 2022</xref>), it is possible that loss of cycling contributes to oxidative damage. An additional 31 genes in the Alzheimer’s Disease KEGG pathway lose rhythmicity with aged serum; these include amyloid precursor protein (APP) and apolipoprotein E (APOE). APP is by definition the precursor of amyloid beta, which accumulates in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sehar et al., 2022</xref>). While APOE plays an important role in lipid transport, specific variants of this gene are strongly associated with AD risk as APOE interacts with amyloid beta in amyloid plaques, a hallmark of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raulin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether aged serum modifies the activity of specific transcription factors, we performed an epigenetic Landscape In Silico deletion analysis (LISA), a computational tool designed to predict changes in transcription factor activity based on gene expression. Using a comprehensive database of known transcription factor binding profiles of fibroblasts, we identified altered gene expression corresponding to 59 total transcription factors (q&lt;0.05) in our young-versus-old cycling dataset. Potential changes in the activity of these transcription factors are associated with the following five categories of cycling phenotypes: decreased MESOR, increased MESOR, phase delay, gain of rhythmicity, and loss of rhythmicity, as were defined above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Twenty-six transcription factors were represented in all groups, and included those implicated in diseases such as cancer (MYC, TP53, YAP1, RBL2, E2F7, BRD4, MXl1), inflammation (CEBPB, BHLHE40), oxidative stress (NFE2L2), and neurological conditions (NEUROG2, SUMO2).</p><p>Lastly, several clock genes showed differences in expression with the aged serum, most notably genes in the Circadian Rhythm KEGG pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

However, whether age-related changes in systemic signaling impact tissue/organ clocks has yet to be elucidated. We demonstrate here that while the core clock continues to cycle in cultured fibroblasts synchronized with serum from old volunteers, the circadian transcriptome is different from that seen in cells treated with serum from young individuals. Through this analysis of the role of serum in age-induced changes in circadian rhythms, we suggest a potential mechanism for observations where specific genes showed a loss, gain, or maintenance of rhythmicity with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuintzle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Solanas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blacher et al., 2022</xref>). This phenomenon, known as circadian reprogramming, may illuminate which pathways are affected by or become more impactful for changes in cellular integrity through aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wolff et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In order to study the effect of circulating factors on age-related changes of the circadian transcriptome, we utilized the well-established serum starvation-serum addition protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerber et al., 2013</xref>) to synchronize cells in culture. Cultured fibroblasts from old and young subjects have robust clocks and respond similarly to synchronization with dexamethasone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pagani et al., 2011</xref>); however, when synchronized with dexamethasone in a media containing old serum, they reportedly exhibited shortened circadian periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pagani et al., 2011</xref>). This effect was reversed by heat inactivating old serum. We did not observe a significant difference in period length between young and old serum synchronization in our <italic>BMAL1-luciferase</italic> experiment, perhaps because dexamethasone was not utilized. Our use of serum to synchronize allowed us to more closely simulate in vivo conditions where blood is an important mode by which central clocks can entrain peripheral clocks to maintain synchrony with the day:night cycle. Previously, serum factors were shown to activate the immediate early transcription factor, SRF, in a diurnal manner to confer time of day signals to both cells in culture and to mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerber et al., 2013</xref>). We show here that effects of age are also mediated by serum.</p><p>We find that while the number of rhythmic transcripts (weighted BIC &gt; 0.75) in the young serum condition (~18%) is higher than the old serum condition (~12%), both conditions demonstrate a much larger number of cycling transcripts in these cultured fibroblasts than in other cell culture studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duffield et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grundschober et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jang et al., 2015</xref>). In mammals, up to 20% of transcripts can cycle in a given tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), and the low number of cycling transcripts in culture has been cited as a major limitation of the culture model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes et al., 2009</xref>). While our analysis used a normal human fibroblast cell line (BJ-5TA) we had higher statistical power, given that we had four different biological replicates at every 2 hr timepoint. However, a major contributing factor to the high rhythmicity might be the use of human serum as the synchronization signal. In this way, our model of mimicking signaling to peripheral tissues by using serum directly from humans may more accurately recapitulate the human condition. In this study, we focused only on the effects of serum synchronization on fibroblasts, but it is likely that factors circulating in serum act on several tissues, and so their effects are relatively broad. However, we acknowledge that in order to support this claim future studies should investigate other peripheral tissue cell types. Additionally, in the future we intend to analyze the serum using a combination of fractionation and either proteomics or metabolomics to identify relevant factors for the regulation of peripheral rhythms.</p><p>Interestingly, many of the genes in the circadian transcriptome that exhibit age-related changes are independently implicated in aging. For instance, some of the genes that lose rhythmicity in the aged condition are involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function, both of which decrease with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lesnefsky and Hoppel, 2006</xref>). Previous work in the field demonstrates that synchronization of the circadian clock in culture results in cycling of mitochondrial respiratory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scrima et al., 2020</xref>) further underscoring the different effects of old serum, which does not support oscillations of oxidative phosphorylation associated transcripts. Age-dependent decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and increase in mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lesnefsky and Hoppel, 2006</xref>) is seen also in aged fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greco et al., 2003</xref>) and contributes to age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Federico et al., 2012</xref>). We suggest that the age-related inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is conferred by serum signals to the cells such that oxidative phosphorylation cycles are mitigated. On the other hand, loss of cycling could contribute to impairments in mitochondrial function with age.</p><p>Both pathway analyses utilized here identified increased MESORs of steroid biosynthesis components in the aged sera condition. In particular, the genes identified in this pathway are associated with cholesterol biosynthesis. Since elderly individuals typically have lower levels of cholesterol biosynthesis and higher levels of circulating cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertolotti et al., 2014</xref>), we were surprised to see increased expression of biosynthesis transcripts. Perhaps, the cholesterol synthesis related RNA levels are high as a response to low levels of cholesterol synthesis proteins within the cell. Previous studies in cultured hepatocytes demonstrated that increased reactive oxygen species resulted in higher levels of transcripts associated with cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seo et al., 2019</xref>). Given that deficits in oxidative phosphorylation are already implicated in these findings, it is possible that oxidative stress plays a role in the increase of cholesterol biosynthesis transcripts.</p><p>Although our findings are largely supported by the aging literature, the relatively small sample size of our study necessitates follow up studies to control for individual differences between subjects. We observed variations in luminescence and transcript traces across individuals and while we did not see changes that could account for the overall significant differences in transcript cycling between young and old subjects, we cannot exclude the possibility that factors other than aging contribute to these data.</p><p>Together, these findings indicate that at least some of the age-related changes in the cultured fibroblast circadian transcriptome are derived from signals circulating in the serum and not the age of the cells. This has profound implications for understanding and treating circadian disruption with age, and could also be relevant for other age-related pathology, given established links between circadian disruption and diseases of aging. Notably, many of the genes whose cycling is affected by old serum contribute to age-associated disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Clinical research study</title><p>This clinical research study enrolled apparent healthy participants from the volunteer pool maintained by the Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics (ITMAT), University of Pennsylvania.

Briefly, LentiX 293T cells (Clonetech) were transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 PLUS (Life Tech) using manufacturer instructions. The transfection included 18 µg of DNA per reaction and the plasmid (BMAL1-dLuc-GFP) to packaging vector (DVPR, Addgene) to envelope (VSV-G, Addgene) ratio was 10:1:0.5.

Supernatant with the virus was collected at 48 hr and 72 hr post transfection and spun down at 3000 RPM for 5 minutes (to eliminate any cells/debris). BJ-5TA cells were infected with fresh virus upon virus collection. Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 mg/mL) was also added to aid with infection. Transduced BJ-5TA cells (&gt;2000 cells) were sorted (FACSMelody, BD Biosciences) for high GFP expression. Once the cell line was established, blasticidin was added to the culture at 2 µg/ml.

Upon sample collection wells were place on ice and rinsed with cold DPBS and then put in cold RLT buffer with 2-Mercaptoethanol (10μL/mL). Samples were frozen at –80 overnight and sent to Admera for RNA extraction and sequencing. Total RNA was extracted with RNeay mini kit (QIAGEN). Isolated RNA sample quality was assessed by High Sensitivity RNA Tapestation (Agilent Technologies Inc, California, USA) and quantified by Qubit 2.0 RNA HS assay (Thermo Fisher, Massachusetts, USA). Paramagnetic beads coupled with oligo d(T)25 are combined with total RNA to isolate poly(A)+transcripts based on NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module manual (New England BioLabs Inc, Massachusetts, USA). Prior to first strand synthesis, samples are randomly primed (5 ́ d(N6) 3 ́ [N=A,C,G,T]) and fragmented based on manufacturer’s recommendations.

Only rhythmic genes were taken into consideration in pathway and other analyses involving MESORs and phases. The criterion for rhythmicity was either based on (BH adjusted) p-values reported by CircaCompare, or weighted BIC values, obtained by an approach similar to dryR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weger et al., 2021</xref>). In the latter approach we fitted four models of rhythmicity, one modeling gene expression that is rhythmic in both cells treated with young or old sera, another modeling gene expression rhythmic in neither cells treated with young nor old sera, and two modeling gene expression rhythmic in either young or old sera-treated cells, respectively. The BIC values were calculated for the four models and were weighted to obtain numbers between 0 and 1.

However, mechanisms by which rhythms are altered remain unknown. Here authors tested the hypothesis that age-dependent factors in the sera affect the core clock or outputs of the core clock in cultured fibroblasts. They find that both sera from young and old donors are equally potent at driving robust ~24h oscillations in gene expression, and report the surprising finding that the cyclic transcriptome after stimulation by young or old sera differs markedly. In particular, genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription/translation remain rhythmic in both conditions, while genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and Alzheimer's Disease lose rhythmicity in the aged condition. Also, the expression of cycling genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis increases in the cells entrained with old serum.

However, mechanisms by which rhythms are altered remain unknown. Here authors tested the hypothesis that age-dependent factors in the sera affect the core clock or outputs of the core clock in cultured fibroblasts. They find that both sera from young and old donors are equally potent at driving robust ~24h oscillations in gene expression, and report the surprising finding that the cyclic transcriptome after stimulation by young or old sera differs markedly. In particular, genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription/translation remain rhythmic in both conditions, while genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and Alzheimer's Disease lose rhythmicity in the aged condition. Also, the expression of cycling genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis increases in the cells entrained with old serum. Together, the findings suggest that age-dependent blood-borne factors, yet to be identified, affect circadian rhythms in the periphery. The most interesting aspect of the paper is that the data suggest that the same system (BJ-5TA), may significantly change its rhythmic transcriptome depending on how the cells are synchronized. While there is a succinct discussion point on this, it should be expanded and described whether there are parallels with previous works, as well as what would be possible mechanisms for such an effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve expanded our discussion in the manuscript to discuss possible mechanisms and also how the genes/pathways implicated in our study relate to other aging literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>Fig 1 and Table S1. Serum composition and levels of relevant blood-borne factors probably change in function of time. At what time of the day were the serum samples from the old and young groups collected? This important information should be provided in the text and added to Table S1.</p></disp-quote><p>We made sure to highlight the collection time in the abstract of the manuscript “We collected blood from apparently healthy young (age 25-30) and old (age 70-76) individuals at 14:001 and used the serum to synchronize cultured fibroblasts.” The time of blood draw is also in sections of the paper (Intro and Methods). Since Table S1 is demographic information, we did not think that the blood draw time fit best there, but hopefully it is now clear in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 2A.

Are there similarities between the rhythmic transcriptomes of the BJ-5TA cells and that of U2OS cells or other human cells? This could easily be assessed using published datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>The original rationale to use BJ-5TA fibroblast cells was that we were aiming to build upon an observation found in a previous study2 which showed that circadian period changes with age in human fibroblasts. While our findings did not match theirs, we think an added benefit of using the BJ-5TA line is that unlike U2OS cells, it is not a carcinoma derived cell line. We’ve added this point in lines 98-101.</p><p>Our study finds many more rhythmic transcripts compared to the previous studies examining U2OS cells. This can be attributed to several factors including differences in methods, including the use of human serum in our study, cell type differences, or decoupling of rhythms in some cancer cells. While a comparison of BJ-5TA cells and U2OS cells could be interesting, a proper comparison requires investigation of many data sets, since any pair of BJ-5TA and U2OS data sets will most likely differ in some detail of experimental design or data processing pipeline, which could contribute to observed differences in rhythmic transcripts.</p><p>That being said, we compared clock reference genes (see Author response image 1) between BJ-5TA and U2OS cells, comparing circadian profiles obtained from our data with those available on CircaDB. These circadian profiles exhibit many similarities and a few differences. The peak to trough ratios (amplitudes) are quite similar for ARNTL, NR1D1, NR1D2, PER2, PER3, and are about 25% lower for CRY1 and somewhat higher for TEF (about 15%) in our data. We find that the MESORS are generally similar with the exception of NR1D1 which is much lower and NR1D2 which is much higher in our data.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>BJ-5TA and U2OS Cells Exhibit Similar Profiles of Circadian Gene Transcription.</title><p>We compared the transcriptomic profiles of the BJ-5TA cells in young and old serum (left) to the U2OS transcriptomic data (right) available on CircaDB, a database containing profiles of several circadian reference genes in U2OS cells.

We find that the peak to trough ratios (amplitudes) are similar for ARNTL, NR1D1, NR1D2, Per2, PER3, and that the MESORS are similar (with the exception of NR1D1 which is much lower and NR1D2 which is much higher in the BJ-5TA cells). We find that the amplitudes of CRY1 is ~25% lower and TEF is ~15% higher for the BJ5TA cells.

Given our previous data showing that the cell cycle gene cyclin D1 is regulated by clock transcription factors3, we believe the circadian oscillator drives, or at least contributes, to rhythms of cell cycle genes.

This is consistent with the decreased proliferation previously observed in aged human tissue4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the reduction of rhythmicity in the old serum for oxidative phosphorylation transcripts is very interesting and fits with the general theme that metabolic function decreases with age, it is puzzling that the recipient cells are the same, but it is only the synchronization by the old and young serum that changes. Are the authors thus suggesting that decrease of metabolic rhythms is primarily a non cell-autonomous and systemic phenomenon? What would be a potential mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>We are indeed suggesting this, although it is also possible that it is not cycling <italic>per se</italic>, but rather an overall inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation that is conveyed by the serum. Relating other work in the field to our findings, we’ve added the following to our discussion: “Previous work in the field demonstrates that synchronization of the circadian clock in culture results in cycling of mitochondrial respiratory activity5,6 further underscoring the different effects of old serum, which does not support oscillations of oxidative phosphorylation associated transcripts. Age-dependent decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and increase in mitochondrial dysfunction7 has been seen in aged fibroblasts8 and contributes to age-related diseases9. We suggest that the age-related inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is conferred by serum signals to the cells such that oxidative phosphorylation cycles are mitigated. On the other hand, loss of cycling could contribute to impairments in mitochondrial function with age.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The delayed shifts after aged serum for clock transcripts (but not for Bmal1) are interesting and indicate that there may be a decoupling of Bmal1 transcript levels from the other clock gene phases. How do the authors interpret this? could it be related to altered chronotypes in the elderly?</p></disp-quote><p>One possible explanation is that the delay of NPAS2, BMAL1’s binding partner, results in the delay of the transcription of clock controlled genes/negative arm genes. Since the RORs do not seem to be affected, Bmal is transcribed/translated as usual, but there isn’t enough NPAS2 to bind with BMAL1. In this case downstream genes are slower to transcribe causing the phase delay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Schwarz et al. have presented a study aiming to investigate whether circulating factors in sera of subjects are able to synchronize depending on age, circadian rhythms of fibroblast. The authors used human serum taken from either old (age 70-76) or young (age 25-30) individuals to synchronise cultured fibroblasts containing a clock gene promoter driven luciferase reporter, followed by RNA sequencing to investigate whole gene expression.</p><p>This study has the potential to be very interesting, as evidence of circulating factors in sera that mediate peripheral rhythms has long been sought after. Moreover, the possibility that those factors are affected by age which could contribute to the weaken circadian rhythmicity observed with aging.</p><p>Here, the authors concluded that both old and young sera are equally competent at driving robust 24 hour oscillations, in particular for clock genes, although the cycling behaviour and nature of different genes is altered between the two groups, which is attributed to the age of the individuals. This conclusion could however be influenced by individual variabilities within and between the two age groups. The groups are relatively small, only four individual two females and two males, per group. And in addition, factors such as food intake and exercise prior to blood drawn, or/and chronotype, known to affect systemic signals, are not taken into consideration. As seen in figure 4, traces from different individuals vary heavily in terms of their patterns, which is not addressed in the text. Only analysing the summary average curve of the entire group may be masking the true data. More focus should be attributed to investigating the effects of serum from each individual and observing common patterns. Additionally, there are many potential causes of variability, instead or in addition to age, that may be contributing to the variation both, between the groups and between individuals within groups. All of this should be addressed by the authors and commented appropriately in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of any specific feature distinguishing the subjects (other than age) that could account for the differences between old and young. The fact that we see significant differences between the two groups, even with the relatively small size of the groups, suggests strongly that these differences are largely due to age. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that individual variability can be a contributing factor. For instance, the change in phase of clock genes appears to be driven largely by two subjects. We have commented on this and individual differences, in general, in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also note in the introduction that rhythms in different peripheral tissues vary in different ways with age, however the entire study is performed on only fibroblast, classified as peripheral tissue by the authors. It would be very interesting to investigate if the observed changes in fibroblast are extended or not to other cell lines from diverse organ origin. This could provide information about whether circulating circadian synchronising factors could exert their function systemically or on specific tissues. At the very least, this hypothesis should be addressed within the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>It is likely that factors circulating in serum act on several tissues, and so their effects are relatively broad. However, this would require extensive investigation of other tissues. We now discuss this in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the limitations indicated above I consider that the data of the study is an insufficiently analysis beyond the rhythmicity analysis. Results from the STRING and IPA analysis were merely descriptive and a more comprehensive bioinformatic analysis would provide additional information about potential molecular mechanism explaining the differential gene expression. For example, enrichment of transcription factors binding sites in those genes with different patters to pinpoint chromatin regulatory pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed LinC similarity analysis (LISA) to study enrichment of transcription factor binding.

Specifically, the main conclusion of the manuscript could be significantly influenced by individual variabilities within and between the two age groups. This is of particular concern, as the groups are relatively small (four individual two females and two males, per group). In addition, the consideration of factors such as food intake and exercise prior to blood drawn, or/and chronotype, known to affect systemic signals should be more adequately explained. The lab is an experienced chronobiology lab, and thus we are confident that these factors had been thought of, but this needs to be better made clear.</p><p>As seen in Figure 4, traces from different individuals vary heavily in terms of their patterns, which is not addressed in the text.

First, the change in amplitude of clock genes is lower in vitro compared to in vivo samples. For example, in U2OS cell cultures the fold change in the cycling of Nr1d1 is only 2 fold and is not significantly different from the fold change we observe (as shown in the U2OS data from CircaDB plotted in Figure 1R). Second, the method of synchronization contributes to the strength of the rhythms. Serum synchronization is generally less effective at driving strong clock cycling than forskolin or dexamethasone although, as noted in the manuscript, it may promote the cycling of more genes. Lastly, rhythm amplitude is also dependent on the cell type in question so cell to cell variability also contributes to differences. However, overall, we do not find major differences in comparing the U2OS data and ours.

Given that only one technical replicate in one run of the experiment had to be excluded for one old and one young individual out of all the samples assayed, this supports the idea that young and old serum drive robust oscillations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 373 - Should list which active interaction sources were used for analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>In this manuscript we used STRING (search tool for retrieval of interacting genes) analysis to identify relevant pathways.
