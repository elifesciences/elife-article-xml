deglycosylating enzyme. Loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>NGLY1</italic> gene cause NGLY1 deficiency, which is characterized by developmental delay, seizures, and a lack of sweat and tears. To model the phenotypic variability observed among patients, we crossed a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of NGLY1 deficiency onto a panel of genetically diverse strains. The resulting progeny showed a phenotypic spectrum from 0 to 100% lethality. Association analysis on the lethality phenotype, as well as an evolutionary rate covariation analysis, generated lists of modifying genes, providing insight into NGLY1 function and disease. The top association hit was <italic>Ncc69</italic> (human <italic>NKCC1/2</italic>), a conserved ion transporter. Analyses in <italic>NGLY1</italic>-/- mouse cells demonstrated that NKCC1 has an altered average molecular weight and reduced function. The misregulation of this ion transporter may explain the observed defects in secretory epithelium function in NGLY1 deficiency patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rare disease</kwd><kwd>ERAD</kwd><kwd>glycosylation</kwd><kwd>ion transporter</kwd><kwd>gwas</kwd><kwd>natural variation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM124780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chow</surname><given-names>Clement Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK110358</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodan</surname><given-names>Aylin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HG009299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Nathan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Glenn Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chow</surname><given-names>Clement Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HG008962</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Talsness</surname><given-names>Dana M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hope</surname><given-names>Kevin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Might family</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bertrand T Might Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Talsness</surname><given-names>Dana M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Owings</surname><given-names>Katie G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An ion transporter is hyperglycosylated and 50% less functional in NGLY1-deficient cells, potentially explaining several symptoms of NGLY1 deficiency such as lack of sweat and tears.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>NGLY1 deficiency (OMIM 615273) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>NGLY1</italic> gene. Patients with NGLY1 deficiency have a variety of symptoms, including developmental delay, seizures, liver dysfunction, central and peripheral nervous system abnormalities, sweat gland abnormalities, and a lack of tears (alacrima) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Enns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lam et al., 2017</xref>). While the first NGLY1 deficiency patient was only recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Need et al., 2012</xref>), there have been rapid research advances thanks to the support of two patient organizations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ngly1.org/">NGLY1.org</ext-link> and Grace Science Foundation). Even though a great deal has been learned about the genetic disorder in a short amount of time, there are currently no cures or approved treatments for NGLY1 deficiency.</p><p>The <italic>NGLY1</italic> gene encodes the N-Glycanase protein (NGLY1). NGLY1 functions as part of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Associated Degradation (ERAD) pathway as evidenced by its association with other ERAD components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katiyar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McNeill et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2001</xref>). The ERAD pathway retrotranslocates misfolded proteins from the ER lumen to the cytoplasm where they are degraded by the proteasome (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). NGLY1 is localized to the cytoplasm where it is thought to remove N-linked glycans from misfolded proteins prior to their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirsch et al., 2003</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that this deglycosylation is required for retrotranslocation for at least some protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galeone et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether NGLY1 is required to deglycosylate all misfolded proteins, or just a subset, or if it is necessary for protein degradation at all. It has been shown that model substrates can be degraded regardless of glycosylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirsch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kario et al., 2008</xref>). While a recent report showed that ER stress markers were increased in NGLY1 -/- MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galeone et al., 2020</xref>), other experiments such as RNAi knockdown (KD) of NGLY1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Owings et al., 2018</xref>) and loss of NGLY1 function in mouse, rat, and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asahina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mueller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tambe et al., 2019</xref>) have shown no evidence of ER stress. ER stress is often observed when there are mutations in proteins that are necessary for ERAD due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. It may be that NGLY1 is not necessary for ERAD, or it is involved in a non-canonical ERAD function, or it may be deglycosylating cytoplasmic proteins for an entirely different purpose. These hypothesized functions are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>NGLY1 has been shown to deglycosylate various exogenous model substrates such as TCR-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirsch et al., 2003</xref>) and RNaseB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kario et al., 2008</xref>). To identify endogenous substrates several mass spectrometry experiments have been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujihira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosomi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maynard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zolekar et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, the first high-confidence substrate of NGLY1 deglycosylation, NRF1 (gene: <italic>NFE2L1</italic>), was discovered in a <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> genetic screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lehrbach and Ruvkun, 2016</xref>). NRF1 mediates a proteasome ‘bounce-back’ response. NRF1 is constitutively degraded by the proteasome through the ERAD pathway, until the proteasome is inhibited or overwhelmed by protein load. During this proteasome stress, NRF1 accumulates and is deglycosylated by NGLY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tomlin et al., 2017</xref>). Rather than targeting the protein for degradation, the deglycosylation activates NRF1 by converting asparagine to aspartic acid residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehrbach et al., 2019</xref>). NRF1 can then be imported into the nucleus to act as a transcription factor for proteasome subunits. The lack of NRF1 activation in NGLY1-deficient patients likely explains some of the disorder’s symptoms such as motor dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi et al., 2011</xref>) and cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, it was found that the protein BMP4 is deglycosylated by NGLY1 when overexpressed in either <italic>Drosophila</italic> or mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galeone et al., 2020</xref>). BMP4 is a signaling molecule and could explain several of the developmental symptoms of NGLY1 deficiency. However, not all symptoms can be explained by these two targets and therefore there is a pressing need to identify and validate more substrates of NGLY1 deglycosylation.</p><p>In addition to discovering new NGLY1 targets, there is a need to understand how background genetic variants affect the number and severity of symptoms in patients. While the majority of patients harbor two complete loss-of-function mutations in <italic>NGLY1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2015</xref>), there are many symptoms such as seizures and scoliosis that are only reported in a subset of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Enns et al., 2014</xref>). All patients experience developmental delay, but it ranges from slightly below average IQ to completely non-verbal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lam et al., 2017</xref>). This variability based on background genetics was also observed in the lab when an NGLY1 deficiency mouse model was crossed onto an outbred mouse strain which partially rescued the lethality of the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujihira et al., 2017</xref>). In order to identify components of the genetic background that affect the range of symptoms and severity of disease, we have utilized a collection of genetically diverse <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains known as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mackay et al., 2012</xref>). By crossing a fly model of NGLY1 deficiency onto the panel, we recapitulated the variable phenotype seen in the human population. Here, we report the results of this cross and a list of candidate modifier genes derived from the genome-wide association (GWA) of the cross. To contextualize the candidate modifier list, we also performed an evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) analysis to identify genes that are co-evolving with <italic>NGLY1</italic>. Together these two genetic analyses have generated a list of genes that (1) may explain some of the variation seen between NGLY1 patients, (2) may encode proteins that physically interact with NGLY1 in ERAD or other cellular processes, and (3) may be direct deglycosylation targets of NGLY1. The top candidate modifier gene from the GWA is <italic>NKCC1</italic>, a conserved Na/K/Cl ion co-transporter. We found that <italic>NKCC1</italic> modifies multiple phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and in <italic>NGLY1 -/</italic>- mammalian cells, NKCC1 displays abnormal average molecular weight and has reduced activity. The misregulation of NKCC1 likely explains several prominent secretory epithelium-related phenotypes observed in NGLY1 deficiency patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Variation in lethality associated with NGLY1 deficiency</title><p>We crossed a fly model of NGLY1 deficiency (<italic>Pngl</italic> in flies, hereon referred to as <italic>NGLY1</italic>) onto 163 strains of the DGRP in order to assess the effect of natural variation on loss of <italic>NGLY1</italic> function. We have previously validated this NGLY1 deficiency model where an <italic>NGLY1</italic> RNAi reduces <italic>NGLY1</italic> transcript by &gt;95% when driven by the ubiquitous <italic>Tubulin-</italic>GAL4 driver transgene (<italic>Tubulin &gt; NGLY1</italic> RNAi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Owings et al., 2018</xref>).

To do this, a <italic>Tubulin-</italic>GAL80 transgene, which represses the effect of GAL4, was crossed onto the <italic>Tubulin &gt; NGLY1</italic> RNAi background, such that RNAi is not expressed and flies from this parent strain are healthy and viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

If no lethality is present, Mendelian segregation should produce the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio of the genotypes. Given that there is a very low level of lethality associated with each balancer, the largest balancer class is the closest to the expected, and was used to calculate the ratio of lethality for <italic>NGLY1</italic> KD. Results of the screen reveal that survival to adulthood was strongly influenced by DGRP genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), with proportion of surviving flies ranging from 0.0 to 0.967. Survival to adulthood was not correlated with efficiency of RNAi, as there was no difference in KD efficiency in flies from either end of the phenotypic distribution (low surviving: 92.0% ± 3.7; high surviving: 94.8% ± 3.7; p=0.4). There was no correlation between proportion of surviving flies and the absolute number of flies in the balancer class (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.02; p=0.14), indicating that the ratio is not driven by the number of the balancer control flies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genome-wide association</title><p>We hypothesized that the observed variable survival to adulthood in <italic>NGLY1</italic> KD flies was due to the underlying genetic variation in the DGRP.

We used a linear mixed model to test 2,007,145 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We recognize that our study suffers from a multiple testing problem, making it difficult to interpret the role of any single SNP identified. Instead, the location of SNPs was used to identify candidate modifier genes. This type of approach has worked well in the past for other disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahlers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chow et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chow et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lavoy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palu et al., 2019</xref>) and provides an unbiased list of candidate genes that can be functionally tested for interactions with <italic>NGLY1</italic>.</p><p>At a nominal p-value of p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>, 125 variants are associated with survival to adulthood. Of these 125 variants, 21 fall outside of a gene region (+/- 1 kb from the 5’ or 3’ UTRs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The remaining 104 variants map to 61 protein coding candidate genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Eighty-five of these 104 variants are in noncoding regions (UTRs, introns, or upstream or downstream) and 19 are in coding regions. Of these 19, 12 are synonymous changes and 7 are nonsynonymous (<italic>exp, hiw, CG30048, SP2353, CG31690, Hrd3,</italic> and <italic>blue</italic>). When multiple testing correction is applied to all the variants, the top 12 remain significant. Nine of these SNPs reside in an intron of the <italic>Ncc69</italic> gene. All nine SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other, which is quite unusual for the DGRP. When we analyzed <italic>Ncc69</italic> expression levels using previously published RNAseq data from the DGRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Everett et al., 2020</xref>), we found there was no

NSFL1C and NGLY1 interact with the VCP/P97 AAA-ATPase complex involved in delivering misfolded proteins from the ERAD complex to the proteasome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kondo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McNeill et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Hrd3</italic> is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of <italic>SEL1L</italic>. SEL1L is a component of the ERAD complex required for retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytoplasm for degradation. Recently, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of <italic>NGLY1</italic> and <italic>SEL1L</italic> were both identified as modifiers of NRF1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lehrbach and Ruvkun, 2016</xref>).

Therefore, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which assigns each variant to the closest gene and generates a per gene metric for p-value enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). Given a defined set of genes annotated with a certain GO function, GSEA determines whether the members of that set are randomly distributed throughout the ranked list or if they are found primarily at the top or bottom of that list. We identified 21 gene sets positively associated with the ranked gene list (≥5 genes;&gt;0.25 enrichment score; p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

These processes, however, are difficult to test and require long-term investigation, beyond the scope of this study. Circadian rhythm, on the other hand, is a specific and testable category. The enriched category for circadian rhythm function contains a number of genes that directly modulate circadian rhythm, including, <italic>clock</italic>, <italic>period</italic>, <italic>timeless</italic>, and <italic>cycle</italic>. We hypothesized that if variation in circadian rhythm function modifies lethality associated with loss of NGLY1 function then NGLY1 must affect the circadian rhythm. To test this, we knocked down <italic>NGLY1</italic> in the LNv pacemaker neurons in the central nervous system using the <italic>Pdf-</italic>GAL4 driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Renn et al., 1999</xref>) and assayed rhythmicity of locomotor activity in constant darkness over 8 days in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Activity Monitors (DAM).

Indeed it has been reported that patients with NGLY1 deficiency experience disturbed sleep patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Enns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lam et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Evolutionary rate covariation</title><p>Many of the GWA and GSEA results are intriguing, but appear far removed from the currently known functions of NGLY1. We hypothesized that we could contextualize some of the gene and network results by discovering which of them might be co-evolving with NGLY1. Therefore, we employed evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wolfe and Clark, 2015</xref>). Gene pairs with high ERC values have correlated rates of substitution and are thought to function together in protein complexes or related pathways. ERC analysis identified hundreds of protein-coding genes with integrated ERC scores exceeding two with <italic>NGLY1</italic> (column ‘sumnlogpvbest’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Of the 38 GWA candidates that have human orthologs, two were found in this group with elevated NGLY1 ERC values, <italic>CG4374</italic> (<italic>many</italic>) and <italic>esn</italic> (<italic>PRICKLE1)</italic>. While this overlap is not enriched above background, co-evolution suggests that these two genes might have a particularly important interaction with <italic>NGLY1</italic>.</p><p>GO analysis was used to determine if there was enrichment in any biological pathways among <italic>NGLY1</italic> co-evolving genes. Among the top enriched pathways were ‘rRNA/ncRNA/ribosome biogenesis/metabolism-related functions’ and ‘functions related to nuclear pore complex’. This is particularly exciting as both processes overlap with the top GO enrichment categories observed in the GSEA analysis, suggesting that the same functional categories that contribute to variation in <italic>NGLY1</italic>-related lethality also appear to contain genes that co-evolve with <italic>NGLY1</italic>. The rRNA processing category (GO:0006364) contained six genes overlapping between the two analyses. This overlap is higher than expected, given two equally sized random groups of genes (GSEA: 23 genes; ERC: 37 genes; p&lt;2.6×10<sup>−12</sup>). Among other ncRNA-related enriched GO categories from the ERC analysis are ncRNA metabolic process (GO:0034660), ncRNA processing (GO:0034470), tRNA metabolic process (GO:0006399), ribosome biogenesis (GO:0042254), and tRNA modification (GO:0006400). The functions related to the nuclear pore included nuclear export (GO:0051168), nuclear pore organization (GO:0006999), nuclear transport (GO:0051169), and nuclear pore complex assembly (GO:0051292). While there was no overlap between ERC and GSEA for exact nuclear pore function categories, GSEA results were enriched for functions related to nuclear import (GO:0042306 and GO:0006606). Together, these observations suggest previously unknown roles for NGLY1 in ncRNA and nuclear pore functions.</p><p>NGLY1 deficiency is part of a larger category of disorders known as Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG), with NGLY1 being the only protein that actually <italic>de</italic>glycosylates substrates. There are 151 known CDG genes. GO analysis of the ERC results identified enrichment of the GPI anchor biosynthetic process, which contains several of these CDG genes, leading us to believe that other CDG genes may have been ERC hits. However, the 151 CDG genes do not fall into one functional GO category, therefore, we manually curated the ERC list and identified 26 CDG genes that co-evolve with NGLY1 (see color coding in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). This represents a significant overlap above what is expected by chance (p&lt;7.6×10<sup>−10</sup>). In particular, 5 of the 21 genes involved in N-linked glycosylation and 9 of the 29 genes involved in GPI-anchor biogenesis are co-evolving with <italic>NGLY1</italic>.

The expected weight of mouse NKCC1 without any post-translational modifications is 130 kDa indicating that all post-translational modifications are likely N-linked glycans. This is in accordance with the prediction of two canonical N-linked glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Payne et al., 1995</xref>). The fact that there is no difference in molecular weight between the +/+ and -/- after treatment indicates the difference observed in the untreated state was eliminated by the PNGase enzyme. Treatment with O-Glycosidase had no effect on the molecular weight of the band in either the +/+ or -/- lysates. Although O-Glycosidase does not cleave every type of O-linked glycan, these results coupled with the PNGase results indicate there are likely no O-linked glycans on NKCC1. Finally, to determine the maturation state of the N-linked glycans Endoglycosidase H was used. No change in molecular weight was seen, indicating the N-linked glycans are no longer in the high-mannose state in both the +/+ and -/- cells.</p><p>The most well-studied substrate of NGLY1, NRF1, is degraded by the proteasome under normal conditions, and only when the proteasome is stressed or inhibited does NRF1 become active. Indeed, NGLY1 is thought to act in the ERAD pathway and therefore all its substrates may be regulated in some way by proteasomal degradation. To test if NKCC1 abundance is affected by the proteasome, MEFs were treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Bz). As expected, there was an increase in NRF1 abundance during proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, there was no noticeable increase in NKCC1 protein for either the +/+ or -/- MEFs, indicating proteasomal degradation is not a major regulator of NKCC1.</p><p>Given the altered glycosylation state of NKCC1 observed in <italic>NGLY1</italic> -/- MEFs, we wanted to determine the functionality of NKCC1 in these cells. Previous reports have shown that inhibiting N-linked glycosylation can decrease functionality for both NKCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singh et al., 2015</xref>) and for NKCC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Paredes et al., 2006</xref>), and therefore, we hypothesized that the misglycosylation might also decrease function. The NKCC proteins and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase can both transport Rb<sup>+</sup> in place of K<sup>+</sup>, so we incubated cells with radioactive <sup>86</sup>Rb and measured cellular uptake. Cells were assayed in the presence or absence of 10 μM bumetanide, an NKCC inhibitor, or 100 μM ouabain, a Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitor, as compared to vehicle control. When the ouabain-sensitive and bumetanide-sensitive activities were summed, they accounted for all of the <sup>86</sup>Rb flux observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that bumetanide-sensitive <sup>86</sup>Rb flux, but not ouabain-sensitive flux, was impaired by ~50% in the -/- MEFs, indicating a specific defect in NKCC1 activity without impairment in the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

This often limits how we understand the connection between a particular disease and other pathways. For NGLY1 deficiency specifically, basic research and potential therapies have focused intensely on NRF1, the first well-established substrate of NGLY1 deglycosylation. Motivated by the extensive phenotypic variation among NGLY1 deficiency patients, we took advantage of natural genetic variation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to identify modifiers of NGLY1 deficiency. This unique screen demonstrated that (1) we can model the extensive phenotypic variation observed and (2) that genetic variation can cause this phenotypic variability. Association analysis then identified a number of exciting candidate modifier genes. Here, we have validated the novel and conserved modifier <italic>NKCC1</italic> (<italic>Drosophila Ncc69</italic>), a new potential therapeutic target for NGLY1 deficiency.</p><p>A major advantage of screens is the identification of previously unanticipated biological connections. First, our association analysis of the lethality screen has generated a list of 61 genes that we hope the scientific and patient communities will be able to use. Second, GSEA identified several pathways, including rRNA metabolism and nuclear transport that are surprising based on known NGLY1 functions. Third, ERC analysis identified genes that are coevolving with NGLY1 across the animal kingdom, including both rRNA/ncRNA pathways and nuclear transport. It appears that rRNA metabolism and nuclear transport are likely important to NGLY1 function, yet it remains unclear how NGLY1 is connected to these pathways. Components of the ribosome and the nuclear pore are often O-glycosylated. While there is no direct connection between NGLY1 and O-GlcNAcylation, we have previously demonstrated that loss of NGLY1 impacts UDP-GlcNAc levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Owings et al., 2018</xref>). It is highly plausible that a misregulation of UDP-GlcNAc levels could affect O-GlcNAcylated proteins. More work is needed to determine exactly how NGLY1 is connected to these unexpected pathways. Finally, the ERC analysis also identified 26/151 known Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) genes. While NGLY1 is also classified as a CDG, it is unclear why there might be co-evolution with other CDG genes. Perhaps, there is a feedback mechanism, again, related to UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis that connects these genes. These results suggest that there is a previously unknown connection between these loosely connected CDG genes.</p><p>When analyzing the list of modifier genes, it is apparent that many of the candidates are involved in ERAD. This offers a proof-of-principle that this screen is well suited for identifying bona fide biologically relevant modifiers. Several previous studies linked NGLY1 with the ERAD process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bebök et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katiyar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2001</xref>). Yet, NGLY1 does not appear to be required for proper ERAD function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirsch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Misaghi et al., 2004</xref>). While perturbations to ERAD often result in ER stress, we have previously reported that there was no functional or transcriptome evidence for ER stress in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of NGLY1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Owings et al., 2018</xref>). Others have reported no ER stress in NGLY1 -/- human cells, mice, and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asahina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mueller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tambe et al., 2019</xref>). However, there is conflicting evidence for ER stress as it was recently reported that ER stress markers were upregulated in NGLY -/- MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galeone et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, in our current screen, we did not identify any genes involved in canonical ER stress responses, suggesting that ER stress might not play a large role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Here, we have reported that NKCC1 is altered in NGLY1 -/- cells, however we found that inhibiting the proteasome had no effect on the protein abundance. Thus, it may be that NGLY1 functions to regulate proteins in various ways that are closely related to ERAD, but that do not result in direct proteasomal degradation, and thereby, do not cause an accumulation of misfolded protein and ER stress.</p><p>As with most hypothesis-free approaches, our analyses produced many exciting new avenues for exploration. In order to keep our work relevant and translatable to the clinic, we have focused our follow up experiments on genes with human orthologs. In this report we began with our top hit, <italic>Ncc69</italic> (human <italic>NKCC1/2</italic>), which encodes an SLC12 Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>-</sup> transporter. In cells derived from an NGLY1 -/- mouse model, we found that NKCC1 protein migrated at a higher average molecular weight relative to +/+ cells. We found this altered glycosylation was accompanied by a ~ 50% reduction in NKCC1 activity.</p><p>NKCC1 contains two canonical N-linked glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Payne et al., 1995</xref>) similar to those validated in NKCC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Paredes et al., 2006</xref>). As expected, both sites are in an extracellular loop, and therefore, these sites face the lumen of the ER during protein translation and maturation. Because of this arrangement, these two sites are not predicted to be accessible by NGLY1, which is localized to the cytoplasm. However, recent work indicates that NGLY1 can deglycosylate proteins prior to their complete retrotranslocation out of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galeone et al., 2020</xref>). NGLY1 is recruited to the cytosolic surface of the ER where it deglycosylates BMP4, which is in fact necessary for its retrotranslocation to the cytoplasm. Perhaps NKCC1 is being deglycosylated on one of its two canonical N-linked glycosylation sites through a similar mechanism. Alternatively, it may be that NGLY1 is acting on a non-canonical, cytoplasmic N-linked glycosylation site. Sequence analysis reveals three other asparagine residue within the necessary N-X-S/T sequence for N-linked glycosylation, however, two are predicted to be in transmembrane domains; the third (human NKCC1 residue N168) is located in the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the protein. The recent Cryo-EM structure determined that the amino-terminal tail is disordered and that the carboxy-terminal tail acts as a regulatory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chew et al., 2019</xref>). Although rare, there have been reports of cytosolic N-linked glycosylation, including on the dog kidney Na+, K+-ATPase pump (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hart et al., 2017</xref>). In all these cases, and in our case here, the mechanism for cytoplasmic glycosylation remains unknown. Determining if one of the two canonical sites is altered or if a non-canonical, cytoplasmic site is altered is a top priority for future work.</p><p>While we observe a glycosylation difference on NKCC1, and NGLY1 is a deglycosylating enzyme, we cannot eliminate the possibility that this NKCC1 regulation is a secondary effect. NGLY1 may be regulating an intermediary protein that in turn, regulates NKCC1. This was recently found to be the case for aquaporins in NGLY1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tambe et al., 2019</xref>). NGLY1 was found to regulate the abundance of transcription factors Atf1/Creb1 independent of its enzymatic activity. Atf1/Creb1 then, in turn, regulates the transcription of several aquaporin subunits. Given that we show the abundance of NKCC1 does not change, but rather NKCC1 has a molecular weight shift, it is likely that the altered state is due to some difference in a post-translational modification. If this effect is secondary, it may be that NGLY1 is directly affecting Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases that in turn modify the already present glycans. Or that NGLY1 is altering the function of a sialyltransferase, thereby altering sialic acid residues on NKCC1 which are known to cause significant changes in migration on SDS-PAGE. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that Endo H treatment did not affect NKCC1 from either +/+ or -/- cells, indicating that NKCC1 has been fully processed through the Golgi. Future work to test this hypothesis could entail mass spectrometry analysis to determine the specific glycan structures on NKCC1.</p><p>Identification of targets and modifier genes should provide insight into the pathogenesis of a disease and help explain some of the patient phenotypes. When NRF1 was identified as the first target of NGLY1, it provided insight into some of the molecular defects observed in NGLY1-deficient cells, including deficits in proteasomal function and expression. These cellular phenotypes, however, did not translate well into insight into the complex patient symptoms. In contrast, decreased NKCC1 activity may explain some of the prominent features of NGLY1 deficiency. NKCC1 functions in many secretory epithelia, such as the salivary, sweat, and lacrimal glands, to allow basolateral ion uptake and subsequent secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delpire and Gagnon, 2018</xref>). Therefore, a decrease in NKCC1 activity could well explain the alacrima and reduced saliva and sweat production seen in NGLY1 deficiency. Strikingly, a recent clinical report describes a patient with a homozygous deletion in <italic>NKCC1</italic> (null) who has many overlapping features with NGLY1 deficiency patients, including absence of saliva, tears, and sweat (Kilquist syndrome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macnamara et al., 2019</xref>). The <italic>NKCC1</italic> null mouse also displays defects in salivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2000</xref>). Other notable, but perhaps less specific, features in the NKCC1-deficient child, including developmental delay and gastrointestinal problems, also overlap with those observed in NGLY1 deficiency. The NKCC1-deficient patient also had severe hearing loss, cochlear defects, and abnormal auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). Several patients with missense mutations in NKCC1, rather than complete loss-of-function mutations, display bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McNeill et al., 2020</xref>). NGLY1 deficiency patients do not have severe hearing loss, but do report abnormal ABRs. This difference may be explained by a 50% reduction in NKCC1 activity, rather than complete loss of activity. The overlap in a majority of the symptoms between this new syndrome and NGLY1 deficiency strengthens the case for both a genetic and functional connection between NGLY1 and NKCC1.</p><p>NKCC1 may be a promising target for the development of NGLY1 deficiency therapies. Given that it is a transporter and partially exposed to the extracellular space, NKCC1 could be particularly amenable to modulation by small molecules. Based on our work reported here, we predict that increasing function of NKCC1 may ameliorate some symptoms. Quercetin, a flavonoid, is a readily available molecule that has been shown to enhance NKCC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakajima et al., 2011</xref>). These studies demonstrated that quercetin significantly increased <sup>86</sup>Rb uptake in cell culture and that this increase was bumetanide-sensitive, indicating specificity to NKCC1. This is similar to other studies showing flavonoids increasing the activity of channels, such as the flavonoid genistein increasing activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugawara and Nikaido, 2014</xref>), and several flavonoids targeting cardiovascular channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scholz et al., 2010</xref>). These quercetin studies, however, are in the context of normal functioning NKCC1 protein. In our study, NKCC1 is altered from the WT state and it is unknown whether quercetin would be able to modulate the activity of an altered NKCC1. Strikingly, however, quercetin was recently discovered in a drug screen to provide benefit to NGLY1-deficient <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iyer et al., 2019</xref>). These results coupled with our discovery of NKCC1 as a NGLY1 substrate offer an exciting new avenue of treatment for NGLY1 deficiency patients. Targeted studies are needed to determine if quercetin or other molecules could specifically enhance NKCC1 function in the context of NGLY1 deficiency.</p><p>In this study, we took a series of unbiased approaches in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to identify modifiers of NGLY1 deficiency. This resulted in a number of new insights into the potential pathogenesis of NGLY1 that we hope others will also investigate. With rare diseases like NGLY1 deficiency, unbiased and forward genetic approaches are an efficient method for expanding possible avenues of investigation and therapeutic development. This study also highlights the power of using model organisms like <italic>Drosophila</italic> to uncover pathways and genes that can be validated in mammalian systems and targeted for therapeutic development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Pngl</italic></td><td>GenBank</td><td>ID:35527 <break/>Dmel_CG7865</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Ncc69</italic></td><td>GenBank</td><td>ID: 39410 <break/>Dmel_CG4357</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>NGLY1</italic></td><td>GenBank</td><td>ID: 59007</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>NKCC1</italic></td><td>GenBank</td><td>ID: 20496</td><td><italic>Slc12a2</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Pngl</italic>-RNAi</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_54853">BDSC_54853</ext-link></td><td>y1 v1;

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are all positive about your screen and clearly appreciate your work. However they question the mechanism that you propose. I suggest that you carefully read their critiques. As you will notice they are all three experts in the glycosylation field and make some excellent suggestions. If you think you can address their concerns, please write a rebuttal letter and I will share it with the reviewers.

The authors started by an elegant genetic screen to ask whether any of the natural variations found in 163 genetically heterogeneous fly strains from the DGRP collection can suppress the lethality associated with ubiquitous NGLY1 knock-down. The screen helped them identify a number of DGRP strains that can reduce the lethality of NGLY1-KD in a rather wide range, some to astonishingly high levels (up to ~97% survival). They next performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify variants in these strains that show statistically significant association with the survival of NLGY1-KD animals. This resulted in the identification of variants in or close to a number of genes, some of which are related to pathways like ERAD and proteasomal degradation to which NGLY1 has previously been linked. As proof of principle, they chose one category (circadian rhythm) and performed tissue-specific RNAi to show that indeed NGLY1-KD in brain pacemaker neurons results in altered circadian rhythm in flies. As a complementary approach to the above screen, the authors performed evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) analysis and identified several interesting GO categories that seem to co-evolve with NGLY1, suggesting potential functional links. Moreover, two of the top ranking GWAS candidates from the genetic screen were also found in the ERC analysis.</p><p>The authors then chose the top ranking GWAS candidate with a human homolog for functional studies. This gene is called Ncc69 in flies and encodes a glycoprotein homologous to mammalian cation-chloride co-transporters NKCC1 and NKCC2. Based on two sets of double-KD experiments, the authors concluded that Ncc69 genetically interacts with NGLY1 in flies. They then performed Western blots on NGLY1-mutant and control MEFs with or without glycosidase treatment or proteasome inhibitor treatment, and concluded based on the data that NKCC1 (the homolog expressed in MEFs) is a substrate for deglycosylation by NGLY1. Finally, they used the transport of radioactive rubidium as a functional readout for NKCC1 activity and provided evidence suggesting that the NKCC1 activity is reduced ~50% in NGLY1-mutant MEFs. Based on all these data, the authors concluded that deglycosylation of NKCC1 by NGLY1 is required for NKCC1's full activity. Finally, the authors discussed the potential new avenues that their work can open in the NGLY1 field, the possibility that some NGLY1 deficiency phenotypes like lack of tears are due to reduced NKCC1 function, and that this ion transporter might be a novel therapeutic target for this disease.</p><p>The genetic screen and the follow-up GWAS analysis reported in this manuscript provides a beautiful example of the broad and sometime extreme effects of genetic background on a developmental phenotype and the possibility of identifying novel potential modifiers of a disease gene phenotype in an unbiased manner by these techniques. This also seems to be the first report on the circadian rhythm abnormalities in an animal model of NGLY1 deficiency, with potential mechanistic link to the sleep abnormalities that are commonly seen in the affected patients. Moreover, the GWAS and ERC datasets presented in this work are likely to be help push the research in this field forward. Unfortunately, there are a number of issues with the experiments performed on Ncc69/NKCC1, which in my opinion cast doubt on the conclusions of the manuscript. This is in part due to lack of sufficient controls in some experiments.</p><p>Genetic interaction between NGLY1 and Ncc69 in flies</p><p>The authors have used a double KD strategy to examine the genetic interaction between NGLY1 and Ncc69. They state that NGLY1 KD with tubulin-Gal4 did not cause significant lethality (Figure 3A). Wasn't the same genotype used in the genetic screen and mentioned to show lethality, prompting the authors to use a tubulin-Gal80 in the background? The authors' previous work (Owings et al) also indicated only ~30% eclosion to adulthood in tubulin-Gal4 UAS-Ngly1-RNAi. The authors should address the reason for this discrepancy and repeat the genetic interaction studies in the same context as the original screen. Moreover, given the potential off target effects with RNAi, the genetic interaction should be confirmed by either rescue by an RNAi-resistant transgene of one of these genes (for example, the human homolog), or by using loss-of-function allele(s) (or at least by using additional independent RNAi strains for each gene). If I understood correctly, the authors have found Ncc69 SNPs in 9 of the DGRP strains which modified the NGLY1 KD lethality. How are these 9 strains distributed across the data shown in Figure 1B? Based on the statement (&quot;that deletions encompassing these nine Ncc69 intronic SNPs result in a null allele&quot;) and in light of the genetic interaction suggested in Figure 3A, one would think that Ncc69-lines from DGRP would show a high degree of lethality when combined with NGLY1-KD. Do the authors find it surprising that so many SNPs in this gene were actually associated with survival to adulthood in NGLY1 KD animals? This might be caused by an increase in Ncc69 expression in those strains and should be tested. In fact, if what I have written above is correct, it would have been better to show that Ncc69 overexpression can rescue the lethality of NGLY1-KD animals.</p><p>The data in Figure 3B seems to be in the same direction as the results of the genetic screen. However, it has the same technical issues as 3A, in the sense that only one RNAi has been used for each gene and the degree of KD is not known. In this case, it will be more difficult to determine KD efficiency, so using independent RNAi lines and/or heterozygosity for NGLY1 in an Ncc69-KD background might be good alternatives. For 3B, please show a control or state the percentage of the control animals that show bang sensitivity.</p><p>NKCC1 as a direct target of NGLY1</p><p>There is discrepancy between the data shown in Figure 4A and 4D. In 4A, the NKCC1 bands show a bigger apparent size in Ngly1-/- cells compared to control cells, compatible with the idea that NGLY1 normally deglycosylates some NKCC1 molecules. However, in control lanes of 4D for all three digestions, the NKCC1 bands in Ngly1-/- and control cells look similar to each other. It is hard to explain these data, and they make the digestion results inconclusive. The idea is that in Ngly1-/- cells, NKCC1 becomes bigger (N-glycan retention) and then upon PNGase F and potentially Endo-H digestion it loses N-glycans and becomes the same size as the NKCC1 from wild-type cells. But if the two cells start with the same pattern for a potential target protein, then the glucosidase digestion results apply to those N-glycans that would not normally be removed by NGLY1 (i.e., N-glycans on properly folded NKCC1 molecules) and therefore cannot be used to conclude that the protein is normally deglycosylated by NGLY1. In addition, given that ERAD substrates do not traffic to Golgi, they should harbor high mannose glycans. Therefore, when an NGLY1 target is not deglycosylated in Ngly1-/- cells, the retained glycans should be Endo-H sensitive, not Endo-H resistant.</p><p>On a related note, the authors wrote &quot;Together these data indicate that NGLY1 has deglycosylation activity that is independent of both the retrotranslocation and the degradation components of the ERAD pathway.&quot; This conclusion is against everything so far discovered about NGLY1. The authors are cognizant of this issue and hypothesize in the paragraph following this sentence that an asparagine in the cytoplasmic region of NKCC1 might be N-glycosylated by an unknown enzymatic machinery and deglycosylated by NGLY1. They refer to a dog kidney sodium pump as an example of a protein with a cytoplasmic N-glycosylation. However, to my knowledge, presence of N-glycans on this protein or any other cytoplasmic protein has not been confirmed by mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis (please provide references to relevant research articles if there are such reports). Moreover, the identity of the cytoplasmic enzymes that would presumably add N-glycans to cytoplasmic proteins remains unknown. This is not to say that we should not consider any idea that is outside of what has been proposed about N-glycosylation and NGLY1 function. However, to make this argument, the authors need to at least make a mutation in that site (N168) and test whether NKCC1-N184Q shows a decrease in apparent molecular weight compared to NKCC1-WT in control cells, fails to shift up in Western blots in Ngly1-/- cells, and ideally whether NKCC1-N184Q can rescue the effect of NGLY1 loss on the function of NKCC1. Similar experiments on the two confirmed N-glycosylation sites of this protein would make the authors' conclusion about NKCC1 being a target of NGLY1 much stronger.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript presents a powerful approach for identifying modifying genes that may be relevant to a human genetic disease whose clinical presentation is very heterogeneous. The background, results, and data discussion are well organized and clearly written. In general, the conclusions are supported by the data. Although additional discussion and consideration of alternative hypotheses could be expanded. Substantive concerns are as follows:</p><p>1) Tadashi Suzuki's group identified and published the importance of genetic background for NGLY1 deficiency in mouse in 2017. The authors cite this work (Fujihara, et al.) in their Introduction, but only in relation to the identification of endogenous NGLY1 substrates by mass spectrometry. Additional credit and discussion should be given to the Suzuki observations related to the impact of genetic background, a major aspect of this current manuscript.</p><p>2) The authors pursue orthogonal validation and further characterization of one of their top modifier hits, NKCC1. This work is well done, includes appropriate controls, and is described clearly. However, the authors provide little insight into how NKCC1, a cell surface protein modified with complex glycans (according to the authors), is able to come into contact with NGLY1. The authors assert that it must because the mass of the protein revealed by SDS-PAGE and western blot is larger in the KO MEFs than in control MEFs. The authors initially propose that NKCC1 carries two glycans in the KO and only 1 in the control. Based on the topology model for the protein and the canonical sequence (uniprot accession P55012-1) two N-liked sequons sit very close to each other in an extracellular loop and three other sequons are predicted to be on cytoplasm-oriented loops. The sequon information is summarized at GlyGen Protein Detail page:</p><p>https://www.glygen.org/glycoprotein_detail.html?uniprot_canonical_ac=P55012-1&amp;listID=8dd9dc26a96c1912593c86492827bbb7&amp;gs=NKCC1</p><p>The authors recognize a sequon at N163, predicted to be cytoplasm oriented and suggest that a cytoplasmic glycosylation event may occur by an unidentified enzyme or mechanism. Glycosylation at this site would seem to bring the total to 3 sites, not 2. They do not mention the other cytoplasmic glycosylation sequons at N599 and N683. These Asn residues would also seem to be reasonable candidates for cytoplasmic N-glycosylation if such a process exists. The problem that the authors need to more effectively discuss is that no such process is known. In order for a complex glycan to be placed on a cytoplasmic sequon, not only would the unknown enzyme have to transfer a precursor from a Dol-P-donor (localized to the ER lumen), but that modification would then have to be accessible to the entire secretory pathway to be processed toward EndoH resistance. How do the authors envision this happening?</p><p>The only definitive way to test this hypothesis is to obtain proteomic characterization of the protein expressed in wild type and KO MEFS. If any of the cytoplasmic sequon Asn residues can be shown to be converted to Asp residues in wild type but not in KO, the authors would have very strong support for their hypothesis. This sort of experiment falls into the category of perhaps beyond the resources or expertise of the authors and is probably an undertaking that would take significant effort. Nonetheless, it should be acknowledged somewhere in the Discussion that this sort of information would provide definitive support for the mechanism they propose.</p><p>In the absence of this proof, the proposal that a cytoplasmic glycosylation machinery may exist seems less likely than other possibilities that could be discussed. For instance, the authors do offer the possibility that NGLY1 has functions independent of its enzymatic activity. Perhaps one of those activities influences the efficiency of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex such that it is less likely to modify both of the extracellular Asn residues. Loss of NGLY1 might then lead to more efficient glycosylation of NKCC1. This mechanism does not require the invocation of an unknown cytoplasmic N-linked glycosylation machinery. A more well-reasoned discussion of other possibilities is warranted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors examined how genetic modifiers affect the phenotypes of flies where Pngl (fly homolog of NGLY1) is knocked down by RNAi. The authors crossed the Pngl knockdown flies with a collection of genetically diverse <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Genetic Reference Panel). Using GWA analysis, they identified 125 variants that associated with enhanced survival. After detailed analysis of their results (GSEA, ERC, GO), they chose to analyze one of the top hits, Ncc69, the fly homolog of the conserved ion transporters, NKCC1 and 2. They confirmed a genetic interaction between Pngl and Ncc69 by knocking both down, which resulted in synthetic lethality. They also knocked down Ncc69 alone in glial cells, which showed a &quot;bang&quot; seizure phenotype, which was partially rescued in the Pngl knockdown flies. Although the phenotypes were not consistent (rescue in the initial screen, synthetic lethality, rescue of seizure phenotype), these data suggested some sort of genetic interaction. To see if this held true in mammals, they analyzed NKCC1 in WT and NGLY1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Western blots showed NKCC1 migrating as a large smear in the WT cells, centering around 150 kDa, but the lower half of the smear was less intense in the NGLY-1 samples. PNGaseF digestions of both samples resulted in a band migrating at the same place, suggesting that the difference involved N-glycans. Lack of digestion with EndoH suggested the difference was in complex-type N-glycans. They also performed ion flux assays and showed that the NGLY1-null cells had a lower Bumetanide-sensitive ion flux (due to NKCC1) than the WT cells. Based on these data the authors concluded the NKCC1 is a direct substrate for NGLY1 de-glycosylation and that this de-glycosylation alters NKCC1 function.</p><p>1) Although most of this work is well done, the data does not support the conclusion that NKCC1 is a direct substrate for NGLY1. As the authors point out, the two predicted N-glycans are on an extracelluar loop of NKCC1 and are of the complex-type, so it is unlikely that a cytoplasmically localized NGLY1 could access the sites to de-glycosylate them. Instead, the authors invoked a cytoplasmic N-glycosylation event with an unknown cytoplasmic glycosyltransferase modifying N168, which is cytoplasmic. The authors reference a review by Hart and Wells, 2017, which describes a report that the α-subunit of the dog kidney sodium pump Na+, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is modified on a cytoplasmic domain with an N-glycan. The paper referred to was published in 1990 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2175915 ) and has not been rigorously confirmed using mutagenesis or mass spectral glycoproteomic site mapping. In the review, Hart and Wells conclude, &quot;This provocative claim has remained unresolved&quot;. In addition, the large shift in size in Figure 4A, estimated to be as much as 20 kDa (Figure 4C) suggests that the change is much more than a simple complex-type N-glycan. A typical biantennary complex N-glycan with two sialic acids has a mass of just over 2 kDa. This suggests that the N-glycans on the extracellular loop of NKCC1 are extended in some way, possibly by poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine repeats or polysialic acid. Thus, a much simpler explanation for the change in molecular weight in Figure 4A is that loss of NGLY1 in these cells induces, indirectly, expression of glycosyltransferases responsible for enhanced extension of the 2 N-glycans on the extracellular loop of NKCC1. Without more experimentation, the authors cannot conclude that NKCC1 is a direct substrate of NGLY1. Other possibilities are more likely.</p><p>2) It is not clear why KD of Ncc69 rescued the Pngl phenotype in the initial screen while KD of both in Figure 3A caused synthetic lethality.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A <italic>Drosophila</italic> screen identifies NKCC1 as a modifier of NGLY1 deficiency&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The revised manuscript is improved, as most of the statements made in the manuscript are supported by the data. The mechanistic link between NGLY1 and NKCC1 remains largely unknown, and this makes several paragraphs in the Discussion section rather speculative. However, the fly and bioinformatic screens, the genetic interactions, and the reduced NKCC1 function in Ngly1 mutant MEF cells, combined with the phenotypic similarities between NKCC1 and NGLY1 mutants in humans and mice, are important contributions to our understanding of NGLY1 biology and potentially the pathophysiology of NGLY1 deficiency.</p><p>Please address the following points:</p><p>Impact statement: Please add &quot;potentially&quot; before &quot;explaining several symptoms of NGLY1 deficiency such as lack of sweat and tears.&quot;.</p><p>The authors write &quot;there is no evidence of ER stress upon RNAi knockdown of NGLY1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, (Owings et al., 2018) or upon loss of NGLY1 function in mouse, rat, and human cells (Asahina et al., 2020; Mueller et al., 2020; Tambe, Ng and Freeze, 2019).&quot; Also, in the Discussion a similar statement has been made. Loss of Ngly1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts has recently been shown to significantly increase the level of several ER stress markers (BiP, phopho-IRE1α and OS9), and this was further enhanced when an NGLY1 substrate was overexpressed in these cells (Galeone et al., 2020).

Sometimes adding a second UAS transgene (with or without RNAi) can dilute the effects of a GAL4 driver on a specific RNAi line. In other words, to prove that the partial rescue of the Ncc69 KD phenotype by adding UAS-Ngly1-RNAi chromosome is due to simultaneous Ngly1 KD (shown in Figure 3B), it would have been better to use a UAS-GFP line (to generate UAS-GFP; UAS-Ncc69-RNAi; repo-GAL4 animals) to show that it's the Ngly1 KD that is partially rescuing, not the UAS element. This only becomes important when the second transgene improves the phenotype of the first transgene (like 3B) and is not necessary when the phenotype is enhanced (like 3A).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57831.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

They state that NGLY1 KD with tubulin-Gal4 did not cause significant lethality (Figure 3A). Wasn't the same genotype used in the genetic screen and mentioned to show lethality, prompting the authors to use a tubulin-Gal80 in the background? The authors' previous work (Owings et al) also indicated only ~30% eclosion to adulthood in tubulin-Gal4 UAS-Ngly1-RNAi. The authors should address the reason for this discrepancy and repeat the genetic interaction studies in the same context as the original screen.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that this same NGLY1 RNAi line showed ~30% eclosion in our previous publication (Owings et al., 2018). In the process of preparing this manuscript, we were also surprised by the significant change in lethality for this line (multiple experiments were consistent). After receiving the reviews, we suspected contamination of the original NGLY1 RNAi line, to correct this we re-ordered the strains and repeated these crosses. Our new results show ~25% eclosion, similar to our previous publication. We have replaced Figure 3A and the wording in the Results section.</p><p>It should be noted that the potential contamination does affect the screen data, as that was performed in 2016 and the follow-up experiments in question were performed in 2019.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data in Figure 3B seems to be in the same direction as the results of the genetic screen. However, it has the same technical issues as 3A, in the sense that only one RNAi has been used for each gene and the degree of KD is not known. In this case, it will be more difficult to determine KD efficiency, so using independent RNAi lines and/or heterozygosity for NGLY1 in an Ncc69-KD background might be good alternatives.</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>NGLY1</italic> RNAi was previously validated (Owings et al., 2018). In that publication we used multiple <italic>NGLY1</italic> RNAi lines which showed similar results. We have added this explanation into the Results section of the manuscript. The <italic>Ncc69</italic> RNAi line was validated by another group (Leiserson, Forbush and Keshishian, 2011) and we have added this reference to the manuscript as well. As far as using heterozygous <italic>NGLY1</italic>-null animals, we have found that they do not have seizures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For 3B, please show a control or state the percentage of the control animals that show bang sensitivity.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not adding in this data. The percentage of control animals that show bang sensitivity is 0%, and we have added this control group into Figure 3 and in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, given the potential off target effects with RNAi, the genetic interaction should be confirmed by either rescue by an RNAi-resistant transgene of one of these genes (for example, the human homolog), or by using loss-of-function allele(s) (or at least by using additional independent RNAi strains for each gene). If I understood correctly, the authors have found Ncc69 SNPs in 9 of the DGRP strains which modified the NGLY1 KD lethality. How are these 9 strains distributed across the data shown in Figure 1B?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clear. There were not 9 DGRP strains that contained SNPs, rather there were many strains that contained a number of these 9 SNPs. These 9 SNPs are not independent, rather, they are contained in a 54 bp region and are in near perfect linkage disequilibrium. We have revised this section so that it is more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on the statement (&quot;that deletions encompassing these nine Ncc69 intronic SNPs result in a null allele&quot;) and in light of the genetic interaction suggested in Figure 3A, one would think that Ncc69-lines from DGRP would show a high degree of lethality when combined with NGLY1-KD. Do the authors find it surprising that so many SNPs in this gene were actually associated with survival to adulthood in NGLY1 KD animals? This might be caused by an increase in Ncc69 expression in those strains and should be tested. In fact, if what I have written above is correct, it would have been better to show that Ncc69 overexpression can rescue the lethality of NGLY1-KD animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for being very unclear in this section. These 9 linked SNPs are in a region encompassed by a much larger deletion allele of the <italic>Ncc69</italic> gene. This statement was imprecise and was simply meant to convey that this region was deleted as part of a larger deletion and not meant to convey that these 9 SNPs are causative of the deleted allele. We eliminated this statement to prevent further confusion. Additionally, we have analyzed <italic>Ncc69</italic> expression levels in the DGRP strains using previously published RNAseq data from the 200 strains. We found that there was no correlation between Ncc69 expression and survival and have included the data in the text and as Figure 1—figure supplement 1. This lack of correlation is not particularly surprising, as the expression data available is from whole, adult flies and we are not sure which time points or tissues are most important for the genetic interaction we identified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>NKCC1 as a direct target of NGLY1</p><p>There is discrepancy between the data shown in Figure 4A and 4D. In 4A, the NKCC1 bands show a bigger apparent size in Ngly1-/- cells compared to control cells, compatible with the idea that NGLY1 normally deglycosylates some NKCC1 molecules. However, in control lanes of 4D for all three digestions, the NKCC1 bands in Ngly1-/- and control cells look similar to each other. It is hard to explain these data, and they make the digestion results inconclusive. The idea is that in Ngly1-/- cells, NKCC1 becomes bigger (N-glycan retention) and then upon PNGase F and potentially Endo-H digestion it loses N-glycans and becomes the same size as the NKCC1 from wild-type cells. But if the two cells start with the same pattern for a potential target protein, then the glucosidase digestion results apply to those N-glycans that would not normally be removed by NGLY1 (i.e., N-glycans on properly folded NKCC1 molecules) and therefore cannot be used to conclude that the protein is normally deglycosylated by NGLY1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the controls for the enzyme digestion make it difficult to interpret the results. The size difference observed in Figure 4A is very reproducible (also see Figure 4E). We have since repeated this experiment in Figure 4D multiple times with very similar results. We believe that incubating the lysate at 37°C for 60 minutes decreases the integrity of the 150kDa, 12-pass membrane, glycoprotein NKCC1 and therefore it is difficult to see the size difference in the untreated state. Because the difference is not an “all or none” difference in Figure 4A, we think that this instability makes it even harder to observe in the control treatments. However, we believe that in our most recent Endo H treatment the size difference is more visible and therefore we have replaced this blot in Figure 4D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, given that ERAD substrates do not traffic to Golgi, they should harbor high mannose glycans. Therefore, when an NGLY1 target is not deglycosylated in Ngly1-/- cells, the retained glycans should be Endo-H sensitive, not Endo-H resistant.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that our language made it sounds as if NKCC1 was an ERAD substrate. We believe that by eliminating all of the language about NKCC1 being a direct substrate of NGLY1 deglycosylation, that we have also removed the assumption that it is undergoing ERAD, and therefore it is completely plausible that they should be Endo-H resistant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a related note, the authors wrote &quot;Together these data indicate that NGLY1 has deglycosylation activity that is independent of both the retrotranslocation and the degradation components of the ERAD pathway.&quot; This conclusion is against everything so far discovered about NGLY1. The authors are cognizant of this issue and hypothesize in the paragraph following this sentence that an asparagine in the cytoplasmic region of NKCC1 might be N-glycosyalted by an unknown enzymatic machinery and deglycosylated by NGLY1. They refer to a dog kidney sodium pump as an example of a protein with a cytoplasmic N-glycosylation. However, to my knowledge, presence of N-glycans on this protein or any other cytoplasmic protein has not been confirmed by mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis (please provide references to relevant research articles if there are such reports). Moreover, the identity of the cytoplasmic enzymes that would presumably add N-glycans to cytoplasmic proteins remains unknown. This is not to say that we should not consider any idea that is outside of what has been proposed about N-glycosylation and NGLY1 function. However, to make this argument, the authors need to at least make a mutation in that site (N168) and test whether NKCC1-N184Q shows a decrease in apparent molecular weight compared to NKCC1-WT in control cells, fails to shift up in Western blots in Ngly1-/- cells, and ideally whether NKCC1-N184Q can rescue the effect of NGLY1 loss on the function of NKCC1. Similar experiments on the two confirmed N-glycosylation sites of this protein would make the authors' conclusion about NKCC1 being a target of NGLY1 much stronger.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that site directed mutagenesis is the next step in this scientific story, and have noted such in the Discussion section. However, as we stated in our rebuttal letter, we believe that these experiments are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript presents a powerful approach for identifying modifying genes that may be relevant to a human genetic disease whose clinical presentation is very heterogeneous. The background, results, and data discussion are well organized and clearly written. In general, the conclusions are supported by the data. Although additional discussion and consideration of alternative hypotheses could be expanded. Substantive concerns are as follows:</p><p>1) Tadashi Suzuki's group identified and published the importance of genetic background for NGLY1 deficiency in mouse in 2017. The authors cite this work (Fujihara, et al.) in their Introduction, but only in relation to the identification of endogenous NGLY1 substrates by mass spectrometry. Additional credit and discussion should be given to the Suzuki observations related to the impact of genetic background, a major aspect of this current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We regret this oversight and we have added the following sentence into the Introduction, “This variability based on background genetics was also observed in the lab when an NGLY1 deficiency mouse model was crossed onto an outbred mouse strain which partially rescued the lethality of the model (Fujihira et al., 2017)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors pursue orthogonal validation and further characterization of one of their top modifier hits, NKCC1. This work is well done, includes appropriate controls, and is described clearly. However, the authors provide little insight into how NKCC1, a cell surface protein modified with complex glycans (according to the authors), is able to come into contact with NGLY1. The authors assert that it must because the mass of the protein revealed by SDS-PAGE and western blot is larger in the KO MEFs than in control MEFs. The authors initially propose that NKCC1 carries two glycans in the KO and only 1 in the control. Based on the topology model for the protein and the canonical sequence (uniprot accession P55012-1) two N-liked sequons sit very close to each other in an extracellular loop and three other sequons are predicted to be on cytoplasm-oriented loops. The sequon information is summarized at GlyGen Protein Detail page:</p><p>https://www.glygen.org/glycoprotein_detail.html?uniprot_canonical_ac=P55012-1&amp;listID=8dd9dc26a96c1912593c86492827bbb7&amp;gs=NKCC1</p><p>The authors recognize a sequon at N163, predicted to be cytoplasm oriented and suggest that a cytoplasmic glycosylation event may occur by an unidentified enzyme or mechanism. Glycosylation at this site would seem to bring the total to 3 sites, not 2. They do not mention the other cytoplasmic glycosylation sequons at N599 and N683. These Asn residues would also seem to be reasonable candidates for cytoplasmic N-glycosylation if such a process exists.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that there are three additional N-X-S/T sites in the mouse (and human) NKCC1. We have added this sentence to the Discussion to clarify our reasoning, “Amino acid analysis reveals three other asparagine residue within the necessary N-X-S/T sequence for N-linked glycosylation, however two are predicted to be in transmembrane domains; the third (human NKCC1 residue N168) is located in the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the protein.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The problem that the authors need to more effectively discuss is that no such process is known. In order for a complex glycan to be placed on a cytoplasmic sequon, not only would the unknown enzyme have to transfer a precursor from a Dol-P-donor (localized to the ER lumen), but that modification would then have to be accessible to the entire secretory pathway to be processed toward EndoH resistance. How do the authors envision this happening?</p></disp-quote><p>At this point, the exact mechanism is unclear. We apologize for jumping to conclusions that were not warranted by our data. We believe that by eliminating all of the language about NKCC1 being a direct substrate of NGLY1 that we have eliminated these concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The only definitive way to test this hypothesis is to obtain proteomic characterization of the protein expressed in wild type and KO MEFS. If any of the cytoplasmic sequon Asn residues can be shown to be converted to Asp residues in wild type but not in KO, the authors would have very strong support for their hypothesis. This sort of experiment falls into the category of perhaps beyond the resources or expertise of the authors and is probably an undertaking that would take significant effort. Nonetheless, it should be acknowledged somewhere in the Discussion that this sort of information would provide definitive support for the mechanism they propose.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the review of our manuscript, we were able to send a gel slice corresponding to the molecular weight range of NKCC1 for mass spec analysis. The analysis was able to identify several peptides mapping to NKCC1 (SLC12A2), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57831-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>However, these peptides gave only ~10% protein coverage, as was predicted by the personnel at our mass spec core given the hydrophobic nature of the 12-pass transmembrane domains. Unfortunately, none of the peptides included a potential N-linked glycosylation site. We plan to perform more mass spec analysis with varied parameters, but we believe this is beyond the scope of this manuscript. As suggested, we have added language to the Discussion about future mass spec analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the absence of this proof, the proposal that a cytoplasmic glycosylation machinery may exist seems less likely than other possibilities that could be discussed. For instance, the authors do offer the possibility that NGLY1 has functions independent of its enzymatic activity. Perhaps one of those activities influences the efficiency of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex such that it is less likely to modify both of the extracellular Asn residues. Loss of NGLY1 might then lead to more efficient glycosylation of NKCC1. This mechanism does not require the invocation of an unknown cytoplasmic N-linked glycosylation machinery. A more well-reasoned discussion of other possibilities is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion and we have added the following sentences to the Discussion:</p><p>“If this effect is secondary, it may be that NGLY1 is directly affecting an oligosaccharyltransferase complex that in turn modifies the already present glycans.
