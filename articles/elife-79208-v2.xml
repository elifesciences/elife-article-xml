PE is a multicomponent editing system that uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended PE guide RNA (pegRNA). Once reverse transcribed, the pegRNA extension functions as a repair template to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site. Here, we systematically compared the editing efficiencies of PE to conventional gene editing methods in hPSCs. This analysis revealed that PE is overall more efficient and precise than homology-directed repair of site-specific nuclease-induced double-strand breaks. Specifically, PE is more effective in generating heterozygous editing events to create autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. By stably integrating the nCas9-RT into hPSCs we achieved editing efficiencies equal to those reported for cancer cells, suggesting that the expression of the PE components, rather than cell-intrinsic features, limit PE in hPSCs. To improve the efficiency of PE in hPSCs, we optimized the delivery modalities for the PE components. Delivery of the nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated, chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs improved editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared with transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles. Finally, we demonstrated that this mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson’s disease in hPSCs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>From muscles to nerves, our body is formed of many kinds of cells which can each respond slightly differently to the same harmful genetic changes.

Currently, the predominant approach in hPSCs is to induce targeted DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) using highly active site-specific nucleases, such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jinek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mali et al., 2013</xref>) or protein engineering platforms including zinc finger nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hockemeyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soldner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zou et al., 2009</xref>) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cermak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hockemeyer et al., 2011</xref>). Such targeted DSBs have been shown to substantially increase genome editing efficiency over conventional homologous recombination. However, since nuclease-induced DSBs are in most contexts preferentially repaired by non-homologous end joining compared with homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanisms, DSB-mediated genome editing frequently generates undesirable compound heterozygous editing outcomes with one correctly targeted allele and insertion or deletion (indel) on the second allele, causing the disruption of the protein-coding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it has been challenging to generate disease-associated dominant mutations in a heterozygous setting. By contrast, PE has been shown to overcome this limitation in a wide variety of cell types, as it does not require a DSB but directly repairs a nicked DNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anzalone et al., 2019</xref>). PE is a multicomponent editing system composed of a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended prime editing (PE) guide RNA (pegRNA) that is reverse transcribed and functions as a repair template at the target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anzalone et al., 2019</xref>). While successful PE has been previously demonstrated in hPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chemello et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sürün et al., 2020</xref>), it remains unclear whether this approach has the potential to facilitate the generation of hPSC-based disease models. Here, we systematically compare different genome editing methods and show that PE is overall more efficient and precise to introduce heterozygous point mutations into hPSCs. Furthermore, by optimizing the delivery modality of the PE components, we were able to establish a highly efficient genome editing platform for hPSCs. By comparing plasmid, ribonucleoprotein (RNP), and in vitro transcribed mRNA delivery, we found that nucleofecting nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated and chemically modified pegRNAs yielded editing efficiencies exceeding 60%, which is comparable to efficiencies observed in tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anzalone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these data indicate that PE has the potential to become the preferred method for genome editing of hPSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To evaluate the potential use of PE to genetically modify hPSCs, we directly compared editing outcomes of PE to established CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN targeting approaches with the goal of introducing disease-relevant point mutations. Initially, we chose to target the leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (<italic>LRRK2</italic>) gene to introduce the G2019S (G6055A) mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilks et al., 2005</xref>), which is one of the most frequent pathogenic substitutions linked to Parkinson’s disease (PD). This mutation is found in approximately 4% of dominantly inherited familial PD cases, in both heterozygous and homozygous forms, and around 1% of sporadic PD cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Healy et al., 2008</xref>). To introduce the G2019S (G6055A) mutation into hPSCs, we generated plasmid-based CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN and PE reagents (without [PE2] or with secondary nicking guide RNAs [ngRNA; PE3]) using previously established optimized design and targeting procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anzalone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hockemeyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soldner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Soldner et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, we co-electroporated the human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line WIBR3 with the respective genome engineering components and an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing plasmid to allow for the enrichment of transfected cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Genome editing outcomes were evaluated in the transfected bulk cell population (EGFP-positive) 72 hr after electroporation and in single cell-derived subclones. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of amplicons spanning the G2019S (G6055A) region indicated that 2–4% of alleles carried the correct G2019S (G6055A) substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While we observed roughly comparable editing efficiencies using CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN, and PE (with secondary ngRNA [PE3]) gene targeting, all HDR-based approaches generated a significantly higher number of undesired editing outcomes with 19.6 and 3.3% indels for CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN, respectively, compared with less than 0.5% for PE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Genotyping of expanded single cell-derived clones showed higher efficiency in generating heterozygous correctly targeted cell lines using PE primarily due to a substantially higher number of compound heterozygous editing outcomes for CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN targeting with the correctly inserted G6055A sequence variant on one allele and indels on the second allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, as identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism [RFLP] and Sanger sequencing analysis).

While this approach results in slightly lower overall bulk editing efficiencies (as determined by NGS), most likely due to the lack of FACS-based enrichment of transfected cells, the substantially reduced number of cells required and the streamlined workflow allows for highly efficient, multiplexed generation of genome-edited hPSC lines in parallel in less than 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly for this work, the omission of FACS enrichment allowed us to systematically and simultaneously compare a larger number of delivery modalities, as described below.</p><p>To confirm the feasibility of using PE to introduce point mutations efficiently and robustly into hPSCs, we tested PE at additional genomic loci.

Similar differences in gene editing efficiencies between hPSCs, primary cells, and tumor cell lines have been commonly observed for other genome engineering approaches including CRISPR/Cas9 targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haapaniemi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ihry et al., 2018</xref>).

Bulk NGS revealed that the combination of in vitro transcribed mRNA-based delivery of the nCas9-RT with chemically modified synthetic pegRNAs and ngRNAs consistently increased editing efficiencies across all three tested loci up to 13-fold compared with plasmid- and 8-fold compared with RNP-delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Using this optimized in vitro transcribed mRNA-based delivery approach allowed us to achieve editing efficiencies up to 26.7% (for the <italic>SNCA</italic> locus).

Although not tested, we believe that the here described RNA transfection-based delivery modalities could be adapted to increase genome editing efficiencies for genome editing approaches other than PE. Considering that mRNA-based PE does not require specialized molecular or biochemical skills and consistently achieves high editing efficiency in hESC and hiPSC lines, we predict that this approach has the potential to greatly facilitate the generation of disease-specific hPSC models and will be widely adopted by researchers.</p><p>During the process of establishing this workflow, we made several key observations. We find that PE can be as efficient in hPSCs as has been reported for cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anzalone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2021</xref>). We demonstrate that this approach efficiently allows for the introduction or correction of heterozygous disease-related mutations in hPSCs with base-pair precision and without introducing undesired additional modifications on the second allele. The resulting cells showed a normal karyotype, consistent with low genotoxicity of PE due to the lack of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anzalone et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A recent study reported comparable high PE efficiencies in a doxycycline-inducible PE2-expressing hESC line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Habib et al., 2022</xref>). The authors observe that PE3-mediated PE is generally accompanied by the generation of indels around the target site caused by the combinatory activity of the RT and pegRNA. While we also find a certain degree of indels (impure PE [IPE] and by-products) at the target site using the PE3 approach, the frequency is usually low compared with the intended sequence modifications which is consistent with previous data in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anzalone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2021</xref>). While it has been shown that the frequency of undesired edits varies widely across genomic loci and is pegRNA dependent, it is possible that indel frequency is also affected by the different delivery modalities (e.g. different mRNA transfection of the PE component paired with the transfection of chemically modified guide RNAs has different kinetics and expression levels compared with other approaches). Due to the unique property of hPSCs to allow for the expansion of clonal cell lines, we do not believe that such on-target indels limit the use of PE for disease modeling approaches because undesired modifications can be easily excluded through targeted sequencing during quality control of individual clones.</p><p>In the past, generating such isogenic cell lines that differ exclusively at individual disease-causing sequence variants was highly laborious and an experimental bottleneck. Here we overcome this challenge by deploying PE via optimized delivery methods. We demonstrate that hPSCs can be subjected to several rounds of PE, eventually yielding up to 60% correctly targeted alleles. Importantly, PE efficiencies might be further increased by including mRNAs coding for DNA mismatch repair inhibiting proteins, a novel approach that has been recently shown to significantly improve the PE platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). These very high editing efficiencies without the need for selection of enrichment of targeted clones provide an intriguing platform to develop more robust in vitro disease models and potential therapeutic applications of PE in hPSCs or differentiated cell types. In our study, we successfully introduced three out of three familial PD point mutations into hPSCs using previously established algorithms to design pegRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsu et al., 2021</xref>). In each case, a classical protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) was present close to the intended amino acid substitution and we did not explore more complex or challenging genetic modifications. As is the case for all genome editing approaches, PE efficiencies vary widely depending on the specific genomic context and pegRNA design, and certain genetic modifications will require more extensive pegRNA testing and validation. However, we expect systematic approaches that establish optimized design parameters for PE, as recently described for cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2021</xref>) and the development of Cas9 variants with non-classical PAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chatterjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kleinstiver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller et al., 2020</xref>) will overcome these limitations and combined with the optimized protocols reported here will allow PE to become a general method of choice for genome editing in hPSCs.</p><p>The focus of this work was to establish a highly efficient platform for PE in hPSCs and although all generated prime edited cell lines showed a normal karyotype consistent with low genotoxicity of PE due to the lack of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anzalone et al., 2019</xref>), it is important to point out that we refrained from a detailed off-target analysis. We believe that there are already available substantial datasets in a variety of cell types indicating that PE is highly specific and shows much lower guide RNA-dependent or independent off-target effects compared with DSB-based CRISPR/Cas9 or base editing approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geurts et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Habib et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schene et al., 2020</xref>). Genome-wide off-target analyses of in vitro generated cell lines including whole genome sequencing-based approaches remain challenging even for conventional CRISPR/Cas9-based cutting approaches due to the substantial number of genetic alterations which occur during regular cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuijk et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, a key future step toward the development of clinical PE approaches will require the development of sophisticated off-target analyses tools that account for nCas9 single strand break-mediated and transient reverse transcriptase expression-mediated genetic alterations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>hPSCs culture</title><p>All hESC and hiPSC lines were routinely maintained on irradiated or mitomycin C-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layers as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Soldner et al., 2016</xref>).

A ~300 bp genomic region covering the designed mutation was amplified using primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) containing NGS barcode attachment sites (GCTCTTCCGATCT) from 2 µL cell lysis from each well with Titan DNA polymerase. Amplicons were purified at the UC Berkeley DNA Sequencing Facility, then i5/i7 barcoded in indexing PCR, pooled, and sequenced on 150PE iSeq in the NGS core facility at the Innovative Genomics Institute. CRISPResso2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clement et al., 2019</xref>) in PE mode was used to analyze the NGS data to identify wells containing the designed mutation, with the following criteria. Heterozygous candidates: number of reads aligned &gt;100, 70%&gt; mutant allele frequency &gt;20%, indels frequency &lt;5%; homozygous candidates: number of reads aligned &gt;100, mutant allele frequency &gt;70% and indels frequency &lt;5%. Cells in those identified wells were single-cell subcloned once to ensure clonality.

stem cells and demonstrate that prime editing is more efficient and precise, compared with double strand break-based methods. They also confirm the suitability of prime editing for the introduction of different mutations related to Parkinson’s disease as a model. In this process the authors noted a lower editing efficiency of human pluripotent stem cells, compared with tumour cell lines, and explored ways to improve it. Nucleofection of in vitro-transcribed mRNA-based delivery approach significantly increased the editing efficiency, without the need to select for targeted clones, and multiple rounds of mRNA-based prime editing could yield near complete editing of hPSCs, including disease-causing mutations. The proposed platform paves the way for future prime editing methods for hPSCs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79208.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Méndez-Ferrer</surname><given-names>Simón</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/013meh722</institution-id><institution>University of Cambridge</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Raya</surname><given-names>Angel</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0008xqs48</institution-id><institution>Institut d'Investigació Biomédica de Bellvitge</institution></institution-wrap><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.15.480601">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.15.480601v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

However, there are additional non-DSB-based genome editing approaches (e.g., based editors) which, dependent on the specific context, have been shown to efficiently introduce genetic modifications in hPSCs we refer to recent reviews for a detailed discussion of advantages and disadvantages of such approaches (Anzalone et al., 2020; Molla et al., 2021; Zeballos and Gaj, 2021). Although not tested, we believe that the here described RNA transfection-based delivery modalities could be adapted to increase genome editing efficiencies for genome editing approaches other than PE.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Previous studies have reported undesired on-target edits, such as indels, using the PE3 system. The authors should discuss the reasons for their different results.</p></disp-quote><p>In the discussion of our revised manuscript, we specifically address undesired on-target edits (Comment 2) in the context of the recently published study published by Habib et al., in NAR (PMID: 35018468). Comparable to previous reports, we observed to a certain degree undesired on-target edits in particular when using the PE3 approach. As has been shown before, undesired edits are locus and pegRNA design-dependent and vary widely across genomic loci (Anzalone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019; Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021; Nelson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). While the frequency of undesired on-target modifications in our work is low compared to the intended sequence modifications, our study was not designed to allow for a quantitative comparison to previous experiments. We therefore refrain from specifically discussing such differences; however, we point out that the frequency of undesired edits might be affected by the different delivery modalities (e.g., mRNA transfection of the PE component (nCas9-RT) paired with the transfection of chemically-modified guide RNAs has different kinetics and expression levels compared to other approaches). Due to the unique property of hPSCs to allow for the expansion of clonal cell lines, we do not believe that such on-target indels limit the use of PE for disease modeling approaches because undesired modifications can be easily excluded through targeted sequencing during quality control of individual clones. Based on the reviewers’ suggestions, we have added the following paragraph to discuss undesired on-target edits:</p><p>“A recent study reported comparable high PE efficiencies in a doxycycline-inducible PE2-expressing hESC line (Habib <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). The authors observe that PE3-mediated prime editing is generally accompanied by the generation of indels around the target site cause by the combinatory activity of the RT and pegRNA. While we also find a certain degree of indels (IPE and by-products) at the target site using the PE3 approach, the frequency is usually low compared to the intended sequence modifications which is consistent with previous data in other cell types (Anzalone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019; Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021; Nelson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). While it has been shown that the frequency of undesired edits varies widely across genomic loci and is pegRNA dependent, it is possible that indel frequency is also affected by the different delivery modalities (e.g., different mRNA transfection of the PE component paired with the transfection of chemically-modified guide RNAs has different kinetics and expression levels compared to other approaches). Due to the unique property of hPSCs to allow for the expansion of clonal cell lines, we do not believe that such on-target indels limit the use of PE for disease modeling approaches because undesired modifications can be easily excluded through targeted sequencing during quality control of individual clones.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Other potential limitations, such as the complexity of pegRNA design and its effect on editing efficiency, should be discussed as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewers’ suggestions, we modified the following paragraph in the discussion to include potential limitations related to complexity of pegRNA design. The new paragraph reads:</p><p>“As it is the case for all genome editing approaches, PE efficiencies vary widely depending on the specific genomic context and pegRNA design and certain genetic modifications will require more extensive pegRNA testing and validation. However we expect that systematic approaches that establish optimized design parameters for prime editing, as recently described for cancer cells (Kim et al., 2020b; Nelson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021) and the development of Cas9 variants with non-classical PAMs (Chatterjee et al., 2020; Kleinstiver et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2020) will overcome these limitations and combined with the optimized protocols reported here will allow PE to become a general method of choice for genome editing in hPSCs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While the authors do search for unwanted editions in the vicinity of the targeted area, no attempt is made at detecting and quantifying more distant undesired editing events, including off-target events. This information should be important to readers when selecting a protocol for generating isogenic controls. The authors should better estimate the safety of their PE protocol. Probably the easiest way to do this would be by WGS of some selected edited versus parental iPSC lines. Particularly informative would be any of the multi-targeted cells shown in Figure 4A (if individual clones were obtained) or any of the SNCA (A30P)-corrected clones shown in Figure 4C, searching for de novo SNVs or indels potentially arising from off-target PE or from overall genotoxicity of the procedure (aCGH karyotyping is not resolutive enough for this). Analyzing genome stability of the clones generated in Figure 2 would also be informative to assess the safety of constitutively expressing nCas9-RT in iPSC.</p></disp-quote><p>As already explained in detail above, we agree with the reviewers that an off-target analysis would “be important to the readers when selecting a protocol for generating isogenic controls.” However, we believe that there are already available substantial datasets in a variety of human cell-types indicating that Prime Editing (PE) is highly specific and shows much lower sgRNA-dependent or sgRNA-independent off-target effects compared to double-strand break (DSB)-based CRISPR/Cas9 or base editing approaches (Gao et al., 2021; Geurts et al., 2021; Habib <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022; Jin et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2020a; Schene et al., 2020). In our opinion, genome-wide off-target analyses, including whole genome sequencing of the vitro generated cell lines, as suggested by the reviewers, would be confounded by the substantial number of genetic alterations which occur during regular cell culture of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Recent analyses of clonal hPSC mutation estimates, indicate that individual cells lines acquire 3.5 base substitutions per population doubling, which amounts to hundreds of mutations between any clonal cell line after only a few weeks in culture (Kuijk et al., 2020). Therefore, it becomes impossible to distinguish in vitro culture mutations from PE-induced changes by simple whole genome sequencing of the correctly targeted clones. We believe that even sequencing all targeted clones and a comparable number of non-targeted subclones (which we would first have to generate) would not have sufficient statistical power to even detect common off-target sites. In our opinion, this analysis would be far beyond the scope of this paper. The key new finding here is the comparison of multiple delivery methods for PE reagents showing that synthetic mRNA is superior to other methods. This result should be of broad interest to scientific community interested in disease modeling in hPSCs.</p><p>It should be emphasized again that the focus of this work is to describe a novel and highly efficient platform for PE of hPSCs. We feel that based on the issues outlined above, a detailed off-target analysis, as suggested by the reviewers is not going to add much to the main findings in the current manuscript, since we are not using this method for human therapeutic editing. These experiments would be extremely complex, time consuming and require substantial resources and probably not add novel insights beyond what is already described in the literature about off-target modification of PE. While phenotypic effects resulting from off-target modifications in the context of disease modeling can and should be easily managed by simply analyzing multiple independently derived cell lines, a key future step towards the development of clinical prime editing approaches will require the development of sophisticated off-target analyses tools that account for nCAS9 single strand break-mediated and transient reverse transcriptase expression-mediated genetic alterations. Based on the reviewers’ comments, we have therefore added an additional paragraph to specifically discuss off-target modifications and why we didn’t include such an analysis in our manuscript. Again, we note that many previous published studies have shown that PE has many fewer “off-target” edits than either classic Cas9 editing and dCas9-base editing. The new paragraph reads:</p><p>“The focus of this work was to establish a highly efficient platform for PE in hPSCs and although all generated prime edited cell lines showed a normal karyotype consistent with low genotoxicity of PE due to the lack of DSBs (Anzalone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019), it is important to point out that we refrained from a detailed off-target analysis. We believe that there are already available substantial datasets in a variety of cell-types indicating that PE is highly specific and shows much lower sgRNA-dependent or independent off-target effects compared to DSB-based CRISPR/Cas9 or base editing approaches (Gao et al., 2021; Geurts et al., 2021; Habib <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022; Jin et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2020a; Schene et al., 2020). Genome-wide off-target analyses of in vitro generated cell lines including whole genome sequencing-based approaches remain challenging even for conventional CRISPR/Cas9-based cutting approaches due to the substantial number of genetic alterations which occur during regular cell culture (Kuijk et al., 2020). Thus, a key future step towards the development of clinical prime editing approaches will require the development of sophisticated off-target analyses tools that account for nCAS9 single strand break-mediated and transient reverse transcriptase expression-mediated genetic alterations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should discuss their findings in the light of a very similar study recently published by Habib et al., in NAR (PMID: 35018468).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not discussing this recent paper in our initial submission.
