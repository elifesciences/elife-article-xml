One approach to augment structural EM datasets is with the fluorescent immunohistochemical (IHC) localization of functionally relevant proteins. We describe a protocol that obviates the requirement of tissue permeabilization in thick tissue sections, a major impediment for correlative pre-embedding IHC and EM. We demonstrate the permeabilization-free labeling of neuronal cell types, intracellular enzymes, and synaptic proteins in tissue sections hundreds of microns thick in multiple brain regions from mice while simultaneously retaining the ultrastructural integrity of the tissue.

Recent improvements in automating the collection of 3D electron microscopy (EM) data have dramatically increased the tissue volumes that can be acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggman and Bock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eberle et al., 2015</xref>). Connectivity data derived from EM, however, does not alone contain sufficient information about the functional properties of neurons to fully constrain biologically plausible computational models. One approach to augment EM datasets with functional information is to physiologically record from neurons in a tissue sample prior to fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wanner and Friedrich, 2020</xref>). As a complementary approach, fluorescence immunohistochemistry (IHC) can be used to identify the constituent proteins of neuronal cell types and synapses that are key determinants of the functional properties of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coons et al., 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuello et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Post-sectioning IHC is typically employed for correlative EM because the sectioning process provides access to intracellular epitopes. For example, array tomography was developed to multiplex the labeling of numerous targets in ultrathin tissue sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Micheva and Smith, 2007</xref>). However, this approach is incompatible with <italic>en bloc</italic>-based methods for collecting 3D EM data that require pre-embedding IHC, as in the case of focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayworth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knott et al., 2008</xref>), gas cluster ion beam SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayworth et al., 2020</xref>), and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denk and Horstmann, 2004</xref>). For pre-embedding IHC, a membrane permeabilization step with nonionic surfactants such as Triton X-100 or polysorbate 20 (Tween 20) is typically performed to enable antibody penetration into thick tissue blocks, but at the cost of degraded tissue ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helenius and Simons, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Humbel et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>To address this limitation, we began with the observation that the preservation of extracellular space (ECS) during chemical tissue fixation improves the penetration of antibodies into the mammalian retina using minimal permeabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pallotto et al., 2015</xref>). Building on this finding, we developed a protocol that is capable of immunohistochemically labeling proteins throughout acutelyÂ fixedÂ brain tissue sections up to 1 mm thick without permeabilization. Here, we describe the key changes that were made in comparison to conventional IHC protocols, leading to improved ultrastructural preservation. In addition, we demonstrate several applications of the protocol including the labeling of cell-type-specific proteins in various brain regions and proof-of-principle correlative light microscopy (LM)/EM experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimization of a permeabilization-free protocol to label ECS-preserved tissue sections</title><p>Aldehyde-based fixation of the brain has been previously demonstrated to result in the loss of the 15â20% ECS volume fraction normally found in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Van Harreveld and Malhotra, 1967</xref>). The observation that detergent permeabilization is required for antibodies to penetrate into thick brain tissue sections has largely been based on such, usually perfusion-fixed, tissue in which ECS is not preserved. We began by demonstrating this requirement using a fluorophore-conjugated primary antibody for the neuronal soma marker, NeuN, as a representative antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mullen et al., 1992</xref>) and prepared 300-Î¼m-thick perfusion-fixed sections of mouse cerebral cortex. When detergent was omitted from the labeling protocol, we observed a gradient of fluorescently labeled somata that decreased in the center of sections, as expected, and the ultrastructural membrane integrity of the tissue remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). With the inclusion of a commonly used detergent, Triton X-100, neuronal somata were uniformly labeled throughout the depth of the sections but at the cost of severely degraded membrane integrity due to lipid solubilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Permeabilization-free labeling of NeuN in extracellular spaceÂ (ECS)-preserved cerebral cortex.</title><p>(<bold>a,Â b</bold>) 300-Âµm-thick sections from the cerebral cortex of a transcardially perfused mouse.

As with perfusion-fixed sections, the inclusion of a detergent in the protocol yielded uniform penetration of anti-NeuN at the expense of degraded membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). However, when detergent was omitted from the protocol, the labeling of neuronal somata in ECS-preserved sections remained uniform throughout the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the exclusion of a permeabilization step yielded intact lipid membranes based on electron micrographs from the same tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This result was repeatable in multiple cortical sections from two mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, see section âReplicatesâ). We noted a nuclear exclusion of the NeuN labeling in the non-permeabilized sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) compared to permeabilized sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), indicating nuclear membranes remained impermeant to the antibody.</p><p>Based on the observation that anti-NeuN can penetrate thick ECS-preserved tissue sections without permeabilization, we proceeded to optimize the parameters of the protocol and explore the boundary conditions of the labeling uniformity. The parameters we titrated included fixative composition and duration, antibody concentration and duration of incubation, IHC buffer composition and osmolarity, incubation temperature, and the use of a tissue-clearing protocol. The resulting optimized IHC protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) incorporates these systematic optimization steps. A balance between ultrastructural integrity and penetration depth was dependent on the concentrations of paraformaldehyde (PFA) and glutaraldehyde (GA) in the primary fixative solution as expected based on the different cross-linking properties of the two aldehydes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hopwood, 1985</xref>). A mixture of 4% PFA and 0.005% GA yielded a good compromise between penetration depth and EM quality, although small variations in the GA concentration led to similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). A second key parameter was the concentration of the primary antibody. Uniform labeling was achieved when using IgG primary antibody concentrations in the range of 33â66 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3a</xref>). Of the parameters we varied, the labeling uniformity was less sensitive to the duration of the initial fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3b</xref>) and the omission of blocking serums (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>), the utility of which has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchwalow et al., 2011</xref>). The ultrastructural quality was less sensitive to the duration of the initial fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3b</xref>) and the duration of the antibody incubations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Additional parameters were qualitatively determined: (1) the use of an antibody incubation buffer that was isotonic with the fixation buffer, (2) the ratio of NaCl to PB in the antibody incubation buffer, and (3) room temperature processing.Â For these three parameters, we observed adequate penetration and preservation of ultrastructure with the protocol described (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), but we did not extensively explore these parameter spaces. It is possible that a titration of these three parameters may be more optimal for different antibodies or tissues.</p><p>Because we prepared relatively thick fixed tissue sections, we were unable to image fluorescence throughout the depth of the sections and therefore employed a tissue-clearing method. Many of the tissue-clearing protocols recently described are not compatible with correlative LM/EM due to a degradation of tissue ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>). We therefore chose to use a refractive index-matching approach utilizing high-concentration fructose solutions, SeeDB, that does not involve the dissolution of membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ke et al., 2013</xref>). We confirmed that refixing the tissue with 2% PFA before serially incubating in fructose solutions retains ultrastructural quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref>). The use of SeeDB clearing allowed us to obtain two-photon (2P) excited fluorescence signals throughout the depth of 300 Î¼m fixed tissue sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denk et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>To explore the upper bound of the depth penetration achievable with the permeabilization-free protocol, we preparedÂ ~1-mm-thick mouse cortical coronal sections and varied the fixative buffer concentration to yield different ECS volume fractions as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pallotto et al., 2015</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The duration of the anti-NeuN incubation was increased from 72 hr (for 300 Î¼m sections) to 120 hr to allow sufficient time for penetration. We observed that the depth of penetration increased as the fixative buffer concentration increased and that the highest concentration we used yielded complete penetration through 1-mm-thick sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). As a result of the prolonged incubation duration, somatic nuclei near the edge of the section were occasionally labeled, whereas those nuclei in the center exhibited exclusion of the antibody, indicating a time dependence of the nuclear exclusion.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Antibody depth penetration increases with fixation osmolarity.</title><p>Approximately 2 Ã 1Â ÃÂ 1-mm-thick acute extracellular spaceÂ (ECS)-preserved sections from the mouse cerebral cortex, fixed with increasing buffer concentrations to yield (<bold>a</bold>) low (215 mOsm), (<bold>b</bold>) medium (360 mOsm), or (<bold>c</bold>) high (480 mOsm) osmolarities corresponding to increasing ECS volume fractions.

We were motivated to explore whether cholinergic axons could be labeled in brain regions distant from their respective somata. Using tissue sections from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), we achieved labeling of ChAT+Â axons both with and without permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,Â d</xref>) consistent with previous reports of the innervation patterns in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>).

We hypothesize that the incomplete axonal labeling may be due to a narrowing of the diameter of portions of the axons and therefore present a hindrance to the diffusion of the antibodies or, potentially, that myelination may limit penetration into axons. Both of these possibilities are consistent with the lipid-solubilizing effect of permeabilization that would improve penetration into axons, but at the cost of membrane integrity.</p><p>We then explored whether synaptic proteins in the mouse cortex could be labeled without permeabilization. We first attempted to label the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), but found poor labeling without permeabilization (data not shown). Among postsynaptic proteins, super-resolution microscopy has demonstrated that PSD-95 is within approximately 30 nm of the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dani et al., 2010</xref>). We hypothesized that, in the absence of solubilizing lipids with Triton, there may be a steric hindrance for antibodies to label proteins that are in such close proximity to the plasma membrane. We therefore attempted to label Homer, a protein found more distant, greater than 50 nm, from the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dani et al., 2010</xref>).

We took advantage of the availability of synaptophysin antibodies directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor (AF) molecules of different excitation wavelengths (AF488 and AF594). We first labeled mouse cortical sections with AF488 anti-synaptophysin without permeabilization and then labeled the same sections with AF594 anti-synaptophysin including Triton permeabilization.

To distinguish whether any presynaptic puncta were labeled following permeabilization that were not labeled prior to permeabilization, we quantified the co-localization of puncta in the two fluorescence channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Puncta intensities (nÂ =Â 150 puncta) were significantly correlated (linear regression t-test, p=1.5Ã10<sup>â8</sup>) compared to a 90Â° rotation of the images (p=0.86), which indicated the co-localized labeling of synaptophysin pre- and post-permeabilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Applicability of permeabilization-free labeling across different brain regions</title><p>In addition to the mouse cerebral cortex, we assessed antibody penetration in brain regions with different cytoarchitectures including the mouse hippocampus and olfactory bulb.

The method depends on the preservation of ECS during tissue fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), and we suggest that the simplest explanation for the improved labeling is that the diffusion spaces that are preserved allow antibodies to diffuse deep into tissue and travel to close proximity of their antigens. That is, rather than translocating across multiple plasma membranes in densely packed neuropil, an antibody in ECS-preserved tissue could, in principle, only need to cross one membrane to reach an epitope. The mechanism by which an antibody crosses a membrane that has not been permeabilized by a detergent is not clear to us, but we note a few observations. First, aldehyde fixation alone has been described to semi-permeabilize membranes due to their denaturizing effects on proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hopwood, 1985</xref>). Second, the hydrodynamic radius of an IgG antibody is approximately 5 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">JÃ¸ssang et al., 1988</xref>), meaning a small pore in a membrane of similar size is required to provide access to intracellular epitopes. We cannot rule out that the ECS preservation process itself leads to damage of some membranes allowing an antibody to enter through a damaged region and then diffuse along the intracellular cytosol of neurons. However, if such damage occurs, it has not prevented us from reconstructing neuronal morphologies and identifying synapses in ECS-preserved tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pallotto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Applying the method to high-pressure frozen tissue in which ultrastructure and ECS is preserved in a more native state may yield additional insights into the mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>). Freeze-thaw cycles (cryo-permeabilization) have been used to permeabilize single cells for IHC, but we are not aware of such a protocol being used to permeabilize thick tissue sections while still maintaining acceptable ultrastructural preservation.</p><p>A current limitation of the protocol is our inability to label antigens that are closely associated with lipid membranes such as the postsynaptic protein PSD-95. The postsynaptic terminal is densely packed with protein, and our ability to label the Homer protein, which is more distant from the postsynaptic membrane than PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dani et al., 2010</xref>), suggests a steric hindrance for antibody binding when a protein is in close proximity to the plasma membrane. In contrast, we were able to label the presynaptic protein synaptophysin located on the surfaces of vesicles that are relatively accessible within presynaptic terminals. Therefore, some degree of permeabilization may be a requirement for proteins that are located in close spatial proximity to the plasma membrane. One alternative would be to explore weaker detergents than Triton, such as low concentrations of Tween, which was previously used to label ECS-preserved retinal tissue with satisfactory ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pallotto et al., 2015</xref>). Alternatively, if the size of IgG antibodies is limiting the binding to postsynaptic targets, the use of physically smaller antibodies, such as nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993</xref>), may improve labeling in combination with our protocol. Nanobodies have recently been shown to label targets up to 100 Î¼m, but not deeper, from one surface of a tissue section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2018</xref>). The use of nanobodies in the future may also further improve the labeling of axonal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and perhaps transcription factors. Alternatively, organic dyes that bind to fusion proteins have been shown to facilitate the super-resolution localization of proteins combined with FIB-SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoffman et al., 2020</xref>). The diffusion of such small molecules would likely allow penetration into thick tissue sections as well, but, because such an approach requires the expression of a fusion protein, it is not compatible with the labeling of endogenous proteins that we have focused on here. A further limitation of our protocol is the reliance on immersion fixed tissue sections for ECS preservation. While we focused on section thicknesses up to 1 mm, an important future goal is to achieve ECS preservation by perfusion of a whole brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cragg, 1980</xref>) and uniform permeabilization-free antibody labeling throughout large tissue volumes.</p><p>To replicate the protocol, we emphasize that it is important to first confirm that ECS preservation during acute section immersion fixation was successful, ideally by inspection of EM images. The degree of ECS preservation varies by brain region as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pallotto et al., 2015</xref>) and needs to be calibrated for specific brain regions. The protocol also requires the typical optimization of IHC conditions for a given antibody such as concentration, buffer composition, and duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We have focused on proteins with known expression patterns for the optimization of the protocol. Our strategy was to compare the labeling pattern in permeabilized tissue to that of ECS preserved non-permeabilized tissue. For novel proteins, labeling specificity should be assayed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorincz and Nusser, 2008</xref>). We have not yet assessed whether antigen retrieval steps with proteases such as pepsin would further improve labeling while still maintaining ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watanabe et al., 1998</xref>) or whether multiplexing by repeated elution and relabeling, such as in array tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Micheva and Smith, 2007</xref>), is compatible with the protocol.</p><p>The ultimate test of the utility of this protocol is in 3D correlative LM/EM reconstructions, for which we demonstrated two proof-of-principle applications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We anticipate that permeabilization-free pre-embedding IHC could play an important role in adding functional information to anatomical datasets. The combination of cellular-resolution functional imaging, permeabilization-free IHC, and <italic>en bloc</italic>-based EM all within the same tissue would enable the correlation of function, cell-type identity, neuronal morphology, and synaptic connectivity within local circuits. Our protocol could also be further optimized for tissue from species in which fluorescent genetic tagging of proteins is not possible, including human tissue obtained from immersion fixed biopsies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tissue fixation</title><p>C57BL/6J male mice (age p30âp45) were used for all experiments except for the use of <italic>Cdhr1-cre</italic> mice (Gensat stock # 030952-UCD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nagai et al., 2005</xref>), age p50, to label mitral and tufted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and <italic>Olfr160-IRES-ChR2-YFP</italic> mice (JAX stock # 021206;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smear et al., 2013</xref>), age p42, to label interneurons in the mouse olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Permeabilization-free en bloc immunohistochemistry for correlative microscopy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Albert Cardona as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christel Genoud (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper by Fulton and Briggman shows how subtle alterations in the way that brain tissue is chemically fixed, altering the amount of space between cells and their processes, increases the penetration depth of antibodies. This allows different epitopes to be revealed hundreds of microns into the tissue, but without the use of detergents, or chemicals that would disrupt the ultrastructure for analysis with electron microscopy. The work is thorough and complete, and boasts a refreshingly honest and straightforward discussion on the strengths and limitations of the method, and its potential for future application.</p><p>This manuscript describes exhaustively and with all appropriate controls a new method to perform immunohistochemistry for fluorescence microscopy in thick tissue (up to 1 mm) by keeping extracellular space, without permeabilization and by preserving the ultrastructure of the mouse brain tissue. The authors show how the fluorescent label can be seen through the entire thickness of fixed sections of, as tested, up to 1 millimeter in thickness, and correlating these images with those from the same volume taken with block face scanning electron microscopy allows the observer to study the same structures with the two imaging modalities.</p><p>The issue of compromising the quality of tissue preservation so that antibodies can pick out molecules in the ultrastructure has dogged neuroscience researchers for a very long time. The method described could be a game changer to solve many scientific questions that could not be addressed so far due to the impossibility to keep ultrastructure good enough to reconstruct all neurons while at the same time having en-bloc immunostaining to localize key molecular components through the same volume.</p><p>In order to image the fluorescence signal through all the thickness of the tissue, a step of clearing has been added, which as demonstrated, does not compromise the ultrastructure of the tissue. Such a tissue preservation allows to perform serial-block-face SEM on the same piece of tissue and reconstruct neuronal arbors. By merging the images of the 2 modalities, authors are offering the potential to add molecular characterization to the ultrastructural information of a neuronal connectome.</p><p>The quality of the data is outstanding and allows reader to judge the impact of all the documented steps. Furthermore, the care to experiment and document many parameters makes it a reference article for future researchers optimizing immunohistochemistry on thick samples and clearing techniques. Text is focused, clear and perfectly organised.</p><p>However, the paper is less impressive as a method for large volume analysis. The figures 1 to 5 clearly describe the ECS method and provide an excellent description of how this is carried out. Multiple examples of staining through 300 Âµm of tissue are possible using a range of labels.</p><p>The examples used to illustrate the strengths of the method in Figure 6 fall short of being the most convincingly possible to demonstrate the power and novelty of the technique. The first example relies on GFP, a genetically encoded protein, while one strength of the method is that you can label molecules that are not/cannot be genetically labelled.</p><p>Studies have been published that do not need to preserve fluorescence (registration by blood vessel and cell bodies [Maclachlan et al. 2018 Front Neuroanat; https://doi.org/10.3389/fnana.2018.00088 ]), where there's no need to perform DAB due to near-infrared branding fiducials. But admittedly these aren't in thick tissue sections.</p><p>In addition, in Figure 6 where the correlative light-EM (CLEM) is demonstrated, examples are shown where it could be argued that the ECS method is unnecessary. In the first demonstration the authors reveal eGFP with immunocytochemistry inside a section from the olfactory bulb. It's not clear if this neurite was first selected in the slice from the light microscopy images, and then localized in the stack of EM images, or simply selected post hoc, once the tissue was embedded and cut. Therefore, its not clear what this adds to this paper describing a correlative method.</p><p>The second example in Figure 6 with anti-TH is more relevant but still consists in the labeling of entire axons rather than for example a synaptic marker, which would demonstrate the enriching of EM-connectome information with molecular detail. Furthermore, here it's not shown how deep this labelled axon is in the slice, and although its described as being 300 Âµm thick the volume imaged appears to be only 100 Âµm. What is more, the authors are targeting a large axon with clear morphology. This raises the question as to whether or not it would even be possible to find some of the smaller fluorescent labeling shown in the previous figures, and at a significant depth. For example, could the Homer labeling be correlated with features in serial EM images deep inside a tissue section?</p><p>While the reviewers agree that further experiments are most likely not necessary, we ask for a significant revision of figure 6, perhaps with additional data that the authors already have, including details on how were the samples selected and matched across imaging modalities, as well as including CLEM demonstrations on the thicker, up-to-1 mm samples, particularly for non-genetically encoded markers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please revise Figure 6 and associated text as suggested.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63392.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please revise Figure 6 and associated text as suggested.</p><p>In addition, in Figure 6 where the correlative light-EM (CLEM) is demonstrated, examples are shown where it could be argued that the ECS method is unnecessary.

Our intention was to demonstrate that, in addition to fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, a larger enzyme like HRP could be used as a reporter and remain compatible with the permeabilization-free protocol. This is an alternative to, for example, the expression of a genetically encoded peroxidase such as APEX-2. We have moved the GFP/HRP panels to Figure 5 and modified the associated text in lines 185 â 190 and the Figure 5 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second example in Figure 6 with anti-TH is more relevant but still consists in the labeling of entire axons rather than for example a synaptic marker, which would demonstrate the enriching of EM-connectome information with molecular detail.

The new data demonstrates the triple immuno-labeling of calretinin (CR), calbindin (CB), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expressing interneurons throughout a 300 Âµm thick section of the mouse olfactory bulb. We then processed the same section for EM and cut ultrathin sections until reaching approximately the middle of the section depth (~150 Âµm). We identified the corresponding immuno-labelled somas in the two-photon stack and a 35 nm EM section. We also provided additional details on how the alignment of the fluorescent stack and EM data was performed in the Methods section. We believe this addresses the reviewers concerns about the ability to correlate permeabilization-free labeling of proteins in large-volume samples. The new text describing this experiment can be found in lines 201 â 210 and in Methods sub-section âTriple labelling of olfactory bulbâ, lines 411 â 420.</p><p>For the CLEM experiment labeling TH<sup>+</sup> axons, we adjusted Figure 6, panel c, to show the full depth of the 300 Âµm thick section and the depth of the 3D SBEM volume with the section. We revised the relevant text and reported the depth of the axons traced in lines 217 â 227.</p></body></sub-article></article>
