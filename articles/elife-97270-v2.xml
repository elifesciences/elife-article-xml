small layers composed only of sparse neurons. Hippocampal hilar mossy cells (MCs) constitute such a typical bottleneck layer. However, how efficient information encoding is achieved within such constrained layers remains poorly understood. To address this, we focused on sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) – synchronous neural events originating in the CA3 region – and investigated functional diversity within MC populations using in vivo/in vitro patch-clamp recordings in mice. By combining machine learning algorithms, we developed a model to predict CA3 SWR waveforms based on the synaptic response waveforms of MCs, suggesting that SWR-related information is indeed encoded in their subthreshold activity. While individual MCs were generally associated with specific SWR clusters, partial overlap across some MCs was also observed, indicating that CA3 activity is distributed across the MC population. Our findings suggest that CA3 SWR activity is represented in a pseudo-orthogonal manner across MC populations, allowing the small MC layer to effectively compress and relay hippocampal information.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>sharp wave</kwd><kwd>ripple</kwd><kwd>mossy cell</kwd><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

travels through the various layers of the neural circuit, with the number of neurons in each layer varying from layer to layer. In general, a layer with a large number of neurons is assumed to be able to process larger and more complex information, while a layer with a small number of neurons must compress or otherwise trim the information. Neural processing with a small layer may be advantageous for dimensionality and feature extraction of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grezl et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Mossy cells (MCs) in the hippocampal formation serve as a good experimental model for such a bottleneck middle layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). They are the only excitatory neurons that exist in the dentate hilus, a small zone intercalated between the CA3 region and the dentate gyrus (DG). MCs receive synaptic inputs from CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scharfman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scharfman, 1994a</xref>), and their axons send synaptic outputs to DG granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckmaster et al., 1992</xref>). While it has been anatomically shown that axons from CA3 pyramidal cells project to the inner molecular layer and granule cell layer, it is not clear whether they actually form synapses and serve their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vivar et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, MCs are thought to relay neuronal activity from the CA3 region to the DG. An estimated 30,000 MCs reside in the rat hippocampal formation, whereas approximately 300,000 and 1,000,000 CA3 pyramidal and granule cells exist, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amaral et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jinno and Kosaka, 2010</xref>). Thus, the number of MCs is one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of CA3 pyramidal neurons and DG granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and MCs constitute a small relay layer.</p><p>Sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) consist of two distinct components: the sharp wave and the ripple. The sharp wave is a slow deflection in the local field potential (LFP), primarily originating from the synchronous burst firing of CA3 pyramidal neurons. The ripple is a high-frequency oscillation (80–200 Hz) that is most prominently observed in the CA1 region, though it is also present in the CA3 region. The ripple component is superimposed on the sharp wave. SWRs primarily occur during sleep or quiet wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buzsáki et al., 1992</xref>) and are thought to represent a mechanism for reactivating or consolidating recent experiences. These ‘replayed’ neural events allow information to be transferred from the CA3 region forward to the neocortex via the subiculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nitzan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>) or to the deep layers of the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1994</xref>). SWRs may also propagate backward to the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Penttonen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scharfman, 2007</xref>). In this case, SWRs generated by the population activity of CA3 pyramidal cells may propagate to the DG via synaptic inputs to MCs, which in turn provide excitatory input to GCs, forming a potential disynaptic pathway. The observation of delayed synaptic responses in GCs compared to MCs during SWRs supports the hypothesis that the CA3-DG backpropagation reflects SWR-associated excitatory activity mediated through MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scharfman, 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scharfman, 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scharfman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scharfman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ouchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swaminathan et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, both experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that the MC activity can be involved in memory processes such as spatial coding and pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Danielson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">GoodSmith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Myers and Scharfman, 2011</xref>). In addition, MC synaptic activity serves as temporary storage and encoding of information at the local circuit level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hyde and Strowbridge, 2012</xref>).</p><p>During SWRs, spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal firing in the hippocampus that resemble activity during an experience are replayed as rapid spike sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diba and Buzsáki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>). Different SWRs may reactivate different sequences of spikes, possibly encoding information that correlates with different experiences. Neural information in SWRs is manifested in the LFP waveforms of SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Navas-Olive et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taxidis et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, the characteristics of SWR waveforms, including their amplitudes and widths, exhibit heterogeneity across individual SWRs. Therefore, comparing the SWR waveforms with SWR-induced depolarizations in MCs provides us with a unique opportunity to investigate how neural information travels through a small layer.</p><p>In the present work, we performed patch-clamp recording from up to five MCs together with recording of CA3 SWRs and developed a neural network that associates SWRs with membrane potential (<italic>V</italic>m) dynamics in MCs. Our neural network was able to predict SWR waveforms from MC <italic>V</italic>ms. Strikingly, about 9% of the total SWR waveform could be predicted from even a single MC. Neural representations of MCs cover a wide range of the SWR repertoire with slight overlap between MCs, and as a result, the proportion of predictable SWRs increased sublinearly as the number of MCs used for prediction increased.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from hilar MCs in vitro and in vivo</title><p>Using mouse acute hippocampal slice preparations, we simultaneously recorded <italic>V</italic>m from multiple neurons in the hilus in a whole-cell current-clamp configuration, as well as LFPs from the CA3 pyramidal cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Specifically, if the RMSE predicted by the real datasets (RMSE<sub>real</sub>) was significantly lower than that predicted by the shuffled datasets (RMSE<sub>surrogate</sub>), where RMSE<sub>real</sub> and RMSE<sub>surrogate</sub> represent the RMSEs between the original SWR waveform and the SWR waveforms predicted by the neural networks trained with the real <italic>V</italic>ms of the MC and its surrogate <italic>V</italic>ms, respectively, then the SWR was defined as ‘predictable’ by the MC. The surrogate <italic>V</italic>ms were generated by randomly shuffling <italic>V</italic>ms across SWRs within the MC. The percentage of predictable SWRs to all SWRs recorded from the MC was 9.2 ± 4.8% (mean ± SD of 87 MCs, median = 8.01).

Therefore, the anatomical locations of MCs were linked with their percentage of the predictable SWRs; specifically, the lower blade of the DG included MCs with higher predictability. However, neither the membrane capacitances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) nor the membrane resistances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) of MCs were correlated with the percentage of predictable SWRs of the MCs.

We then calculated the correlation coefficient between the vectors of two MCs within each dataset. Data were pooled from a total of 113 MC pairs from 2 quintuple, 8 quadruple, and 15 triple recording datasets. The correlation coefficients varied mainly between 0 and 0.3, and their mean (0.054) was relatively small with SD = 0.105. Indeed, they did not differ from 0 as a whole distribution (<italic>Z=</italic>–0.002, p=0.998, <italic>Z</italic> test for single value comparison), indicating that a subset of SWRs that can be predicted by a given MC is nearly independent of that predicted by the other MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, information in CA3 SWRs is represented in a manner that is nearly mutually exclusive (i.e. pseudo-orthogonal) among individual MCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Prediction specificity of SWRs by MCs</title><p>Further analysis was performed to confirm the pseudo-orthogonality of the information code. Binary vectors were computed in the analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. The vectors for five representative MCs recorded from the same hippocampal slice containing a total of 178 SWRs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, indicating that sometimes different MCs were able to predict the same wave, sometimes not. The Venn diagram shows how the SWRs predicted by these five MCs overlapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The number of SWRs in each area of the Venn diagram is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. These data suggest that the more MCs recorded simultaneously, the greater the total number of predictable SWRs. Indeed, the pooled plot of a total of 88,925 SWRs recorded from 23 slices shows that the percentage of predictable SWRs increased as the number of simultaneously recorded MCs increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; p=1.00 × 10<sup>–38</sup>, Jonckheere-Terpstra test). However, predictable SWR did not increase completely linearly with the number of MCs, but tended to increase sublinearly. Here, for the relationship between the number of MCs and the predictable SWR, we considered the sublinear increasing function as a general partial overlap problem and fit the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> to the exponential saturation function (<italic>f</italic>=1 – <italic>α<sup>n</sup></italic>) by the least squares method.

If the coverage of SWRs by MCs assumes random sampling of SWRs, the value of 1 minus <italic>α</italic> should be equal to the mean ratio of predictable SWRs by a single MC, which can be obtained from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Indeed, the value was 0.080 (=1–0.920), which was not statistically different from the mean ratio of predictable SWRs (0.092±0.048; <italic>Z</italic>=0.250, p=0.401, <italic>Z</italic> test). Therefore, according to this approximation function, roughly 8 MCs can predict 50% of the total SWRs, and 27 MCs can predict 90% of the SWRs. This sublinearity arises because there exist a small number of cases where multiple MCs predicted the same SWR (overlapping SWR). We calculated the percentage of overlapping SWRs that were predictable by both of any two MCs to the total SWRs for each recording dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; median = 1.56, SD = 2.04, <italic>n</italic>=113 MC pairs). The percentage of overlapping SWRs was sparse from record to record but never exceeded 10%, and this result confirms again that overlapping SWRs were in the minority. To characterize the overlapping SWRs, we analyzed their waveforms. The amplitudes of overlapping SWRs had a slight but significant positive correlation with the number of MCs that could predict the SWRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, p=1.59 × 10<sup>–5</sup>, Jonckheere-Terpstra test), suggesting that smaller SWRs are covered by a smaller number of MCs, while larger amplitude SWRs are covered by a larger number of MCs. Other waveform properties, including the duration of SWRs, the peak oscillation frequency of ripples during SWRs, the fast Fourier transform power, and the area under the curve of SWRs, did not depend on the number of predicting MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Prediction specificity of sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) by mossy cells (MCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The representative quintuple recording in a total of 178 SWRs.

The accuracy of predicting SWR waveforms improved with the number of simultaneously recorded MCs, but the <italic>V</italic>ms of even a single MC could predict SWRs more accurately than expected by chance. Predictability was heterogeneous among SWRs, but a subset of SWRs predicted by one MC differed greatly from those predicted by another MC, and only a small fraction of SWRs was predictable by multiple MCs. As a result, the proportion of predictable SWRs increased efficiently with the number of simultaneously recorded MCs, and more than 30% of the total SWRs were predictable when five MCs were recorded.</p><p>In this study, we used a novel mathematical approach to correlate the upstream neural dynamics with the downstream neural response. In general, it is difficult to elucidate the relationships between the intracellular activity of neurons and the extracellular activity of neurons. In our preliminary studies, we performed several traditional experiments aimed at identifying a function that could correlate multiple <italic>V</italic>ms with LFPs. However, conventional multivariate and regression analyses proved insufficient to describe LFPs in relation to <italic>V</italic>ms. Specifically, although waveform prediction was possible using simple linear regression methods such as linear regression and ridge regression based on RMSE evaluation, it was not possible to reproduce the high-frequency band, which is an important feature of SWR. We therefore designed a neural network that was inspired by the autoencoder networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006</xref>). The autoencoders have a bottleneck hidden layer that extracts low-dimensional codes in high-dimensional input vectors and are applicable to efficient data compression. Our neural network contains a bottleneck layer with 500 nodes, while its input length depends on the number of MCs. Using this simple neural network, we were able to predict LFP waveforms more accurately than chance prediction from the <italic>V</italic>m dynamics of one to five MCs and were also able to reproduce the high-frequency band of the SWR. To evaluate the predictive performance of the model, we used RMSE as a key metric. We found that the RMSEs for predictions using real data were significantly lower than those obtained using shuffled data, demonstrating that MC <italic>V</italic>ms contain structured, SWR-specific information. Had no difference been observed, it would suggest that the MC activity might only reflect nonspecific background input rather than meaningful information about individual SWRs. Similar results were also observed in the single MC analysis. We then focused on SWRs for which predictions based on real data had significantly lower RMSEs than those from shuffled data and defined these as ‘predictable SWRs’, i.e., SWR events whose information is encoded in the <italic>V</italic>m dynamics of a given MC. Therefore, we quantified the proportion of SWRs that each MC could predict. Thus, we applied RMSE not only as a measure of prediction accuracy, but also as a quantitative proxy for the amount and diversity of SWR-related information embedded in the subthreshold activity of MCs.</p><p>In general, neural information diverges from the entorhinal cortex as it passes through the larger network formed by the granule cell layer and is subsequently compressed into the smaller network represented by the CA3 cell layer. This process inherently carries a risk of information loss. To counteract this, a backprojection mechanism via MCs has been proposed to prevent such loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Myers and Scharfman, 2011</xref>). These theoretical models incorporating this mechanism show improved pattern separation and memory capacity, with results more consistent with experimental data compared to models lacking backprojection. However, it remained unclear what specific information individual MCs receive during backprojection. Our results show that CA3 SWR is distributed and encoded in the MC population, and that even though the number of MCs is smaller than that in other regions, it is possible to reproduce about 30% of the SWR in CA3 from the membrane potential of only five MCs. Based on these results, we propose that MCs not only help prevent information loss through backprojection, but also receive specific, experience-related memories that have been reactivated and temporally compressed within the CA3 region during SWRs. Therefore, information in backprojection is based on internally generated memory traces and is likely fundamentally different from neural information transmitted via conventional feedforward pathways, such as the trisynaptic circuit (EC→DG→CA3→CA1), which primarily conveys self-motion and external environmental information as input from the neocortex via the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bicanski and Burgess, 2020</xref>). Our recent study has shown that neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex can encode the future projected location of animals, forming a predictive grid representation that supports forward planning during spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ouchi and Fujisawa, 2024</xref>). In contrast to such forward-looking representations, the backprojection of SWRs is thought to reflect the reverse transmission of internally generated sequences, suggesting a complementary mode of information flow within the hippocampal-entorhinal system. However, it is important to note that the analysis in this study is based on slice experiments and subthreshold activity. The types of memory information that are backprojected and distributed to the MC, and how they differ from memory information transmitted via feedforward pathways, require verification through in vivo experiments. These are open questions that need to be addressed in future experiments in awake animals.</p><p>In this study, we performed MC patch-clamp recording both in vivo and in vitro and clarified that SWR can be predicted from <italic>V</italic>m of MC in both cases. However, there are three caveats to the interpretation of these data. First, the in vivo SWR cannot be exactly the same as the in vitro SWR; note that in vitro SWR has some similarities to in vivo SWR, such as spatial and spectral profiles and neural activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hájos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pangalos et al., 2013</xref>). The same concern applies to MC synaptic inputs. The in vivo <italic>V</italic>m data may contain more information compared to the in vitro single MC data, because the entire projections that target MCs are intact, resulting in a complete set of synaptic inputs related to SWR activity, as opposed to slices where connections are severed. While we recognize these differences, it is also very likely that there are common ways of expressing information. Second, since the in vivo LFP recordings were obtained from the CA1 region, it is possible that the CA1-SWR receives input from the CA2 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oliva et al., 2016</xref>) and the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamamoto and Tonegawa, 2017</xref>). In addition, urethane anesthesia has been observed to reduce subthreshold activity, spike synchronization, and SWR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yagishita et al., 2020</xref>), making it difficult to achieve complete agreement with in vitro SWR recorded from the CA3 region. Finally, although we were able to record from MC <italic>V</italic>m during in vivo SWR in this study, we recorded from a single MC in our in vivo experiment, in contrast to the in vitro dataset where recordings from up to five MCs were obtained. To perform the same analysis as in the in vitro experiment, it would be desirable to record LFPs from the CA3 region and collect data from multiple MCs simultaneously, but this is technically very difficult. In this study, it was difficult to directly clarify the consistency between CA3 network activity and in vivo MC synaptic input, but the fact that the SWR waveform can be predicted from in vivo MC <italic>V</italic>m in CA1-SWR may be the result of some CA3 network activity being reflected in CA1-SWR. It is undeniable that more accurate predictions would have been possible if it had been possible to record LFP from the CA3 regions in vivo.</p><p>Our analysis focused on SWRs that could be predicted from individual MCs. The synaptic transmission to the MC is influenced by many factors, not only from the CA3 region, but also from other sources such as hilar interneurons, semilunar granule cells, and GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Larimer and Strowbridge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larimer and Strowbridge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scharfman and Schwartzkroin, 1990</xref>); note that it is known that there are projections from the CA3 region to inhibitory interneurons in the hilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kneisler and Dingledine, 1995</xref>). Conversely, in the case of MC, where there is much spontaneous activity, the fact that the SWR can be predicted from the shape of the EPSP at the time of SWR occurrence suggests that the information of the SWR is strongly reflected in the synaptic inputs of MC. However, an important consideration in interpreting this study is that the resting membrane potential of MCs is highly active even under normal conditions, often exhibiting barrage activity where EPSPs accumulate immediately after their generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scharfman, 1993</xref>). Barrages were occasionally observed in the MC EPSP used in this study during SWRs. Therefore, the possibility that these EPSPs included input from GCs cannot be ruled out. Thus, it should be noted that the MC EPSPs used for machine learning do not necessarily reflect input purely from CA3 SWR. Nevertheless, the robustness of decoding performance despite such confounds further supports the specificity of the CA3 SWR to MC backprojection. On average, each MC accounts for about 10% of the SWRs. This may be due to the fact that only a small number of MCs share the coding of SWRs. Surprisingly, we found that more than 30% of the SWRs were predictable by at least five MCs. On the other hand, since MCs are biologically vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scharfman, 2016</xref>), it is important that multiple MCs simultaneously take care of the same SWR to avoid the risk of information loss due to neuronal cell loss. We attribute the sublinear rather than linear increase in the percentage of predictable SWRs with increasing number of MCs to such overlapping MCs. Moreover, by applying the data to approximate functions, we found that about 8 MCs could predict 50% of the total SWR and 27 MCs could predict 90% of the SWR. Given that the hippocampal formation contains a total of 30,000 MCs, the number of MCs seems to be sufficient to cover the entire SWR information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amaral et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jinno and Kosaka, 2010</xref>) and instead of the amount of information we expected, the MCs received more information from the CA3 region. Therefore, the MC layer is likely to have both redundancy and independence in encoding information. In addition, the finding that SWR is more predictive when the recorded location of the MC is near the lower blade of the DG was unexpected. It cannot be ruled out that preparing the acute slices may have severed specific synaptic connections due to tissue dissection, thereby influencing the results.</p><p>SWRs originating in the CA3 region are likely to be reflected in the MC as synaptic activity and transmitted to the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Penttonen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swaminathan et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, it has also been observed in in vitro experiments that some, but not all, MC spikes are likely to be recruited during SWR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swaminathan et al., 2018</xref>); however, MCs are present in much smaller numbers than CA3 pyramidal cells and DG granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jinno and Kosaka, 2010</xref>). Thus, it is unclear how hippocampal information is efficiently encoded despite the limited capacity of the MC population. Previous studies have shown that SWRs are reflected as synaptic activity in MCs at single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ouchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swaminathan et al., 2018</xref>). We observed distributed coding by MC populations by simultaneously recording SWRs in CA3 regions and up to five MCs. Furthermore, SWRs with smaller amplitudes were processed by a smaller number of MCs, whereas SWRs with larger amplitudes were covered by a larger number of MCs. In addition, we found that virtually all MCs responded reliably to each SWR, suggesting that SWR information is not sparsely encoded, but encoded by one or more MCs. Given that different SWRs may encode information that correlates with different experiences, it is also possible that the activity of individual MCs may play a role in encoding different experiences via SWRs. Indeed, several in vivo studies have confirmed that MC activity is involved in the space encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Danielson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">GoodSmith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). However, in vivo experiments have not extensively investigated the relationship between SWR and MC. The significance of the fact that the SWRs recorded from CA3 are distributed and encoded in MC populations is that it not only shows the transmission pathway from CA3 to MC, but also reveals the information below the threshold that leads to firing, and in a broad sense, it approaches the mechanism by which information processing by neuronal firing. The expression of synaptic input to the MC is not uniform, but varies in a variety of ways according to the pattern of SWR. Based on previous research showing that diversity is important for information representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Padmanabhan and Urban, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tripathy et al., 2013</xref>), it is possible that this heterogeneity in membrane potential levels, rather than the all-or-none output of neuronal firing activity, is the key to encoding more precise information. In this respect, our research, which focuses on information encoding at the subthreshold level, may be able to extract even more information than information encoded by firing activity. This study not only provides important insights into the information processing of neural circuits at the bottleneck layer, but also introduces a new approach that employs machine learning to bridge different levels of time-series data, such as LFP and <italic>V</italic>m.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>Acute slices were prepared from the medial to the ventral part of the hippocampus.

Before training, the traces of the <italic>V</italic>ms and SWR waveforms were pre-processed by scaling them between 0 and 1. In the encoding operation for in vitro data, each <italic>V</italic>m trace for ±50 ms relative to the SWR peak time (size 2001) was initially concatenated and passed through a fully connected layer.

Our model was trained to produce the original SWR waveforms from <italic>V</italic>ms at the corresponding time points. To increase the number of datasets, we divided the quintuple, quadruple, and triple patch-clamp recording datasets into subsets with fewer MCs. Therefore, the analyzed data included predictions of the same SWR waveform with different MC combinations. To assess the model performance on the entire dataset, fivefold cross-validations were used. Each dataset was equally divided into 5 subsets in order of occurrence so that all SWRs would be test data at least once; 1 subset was used as the test data, while the remaining 4 subsets were further divided into 10 subsets (1 subset was used as the validation data, and the remaining 9 subsets were used as the training data). If the number of SWRs is not divisible by 5, to keep the number of SWRs used in the test data constant, some of the same SWRs are used as test data in the fourth and fifth rounds of cross-validation.

The variable used in the MDS algorithm is the matrix of RMSEs (i.e. dissimilarities) between simultaneously recorded SWRs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Semicircular diagrams of the DG</title><p>Data analyses were performed using ImageJ. The anatomical shape of the DG was normalized as a semicircular diagram based on Nissl staining in order to visualize the distribution of recorded MCs. The subgranular zone was defined as the innermost layer of the granule cell layer where cells are densely distributed. The location of each MC was determined by its angle and distance in the DG as follows. For the definition of the angle of each MC, the edge of the CA3 pyramidal cell layer was defined as the center of the hilus, a line connecting the hilus center with the suprapyramidal blade (i.e. the area closest to CA1) edge of the granule cell layer was defined as 0°, and the infrapyramidal edge was defined as 180°. For the distance of each MC in the hilus, the total distance from the edge of the CA3 pyramidal cell layer to the subgranular zone was determined, and the relative position of the MC was normalized to this distance. Using these methods, the angle and distance were determined for all MCs. Detailed information on this method is provided in the previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koyama et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Spatial entropy</title><p>Spatial entropy was calculated to investigate whether the distribution of recorded MCs in the semicircular diagram is related to the predictability of SWR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). The spatial entropy for the semicircular diagram was calculated by converting the polar coordinate values to Cartesian coordinate values and calculating the Euclidean distance between each two points. This resulted in an average of 5% predictable SWRs for each MC and its four nearest neighbors in the semicircular space. This procedure was repeated to collect averages for all MCs. The spatial bias of the average % predictable SWR was then quantified by spatial entropy. Spatial entropy was calculated as –ΣP<italic>i</italic> log2 P<italic>i</italic>, where P<italic>i</italic> is the probability frequency of the mean % predictable SWR of the MC with MC identification number <italic>i</italic>. The chance level of spatial entropy was estimated by 10,000 surrogates in which the value of % predictable SWR was permuted across the MCs. When the spatial entropy is significantly lower than the shuffle, the MCs that are more likely to predict SWR indicate a bias in anatomical location.</p><p>Next, to determine if there is a bias in the SWR that each MC can predict, the spatial entropy was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). For each spatial entropy predicted by a single MC, the prediction rate was computed from RMSE<sub>real</sub> and RMSE<sub>surrogate</sub>, where RMSE<sub>real</sub> and RMSE<sub>surrogate</sub> represent the RMSEs between the original SWR waveform and the SWR waveforms predicted by neural networks trained using real <italic>V</italic>ms and surrogate <italic>V</italic>ms, respectively. SWR was determined to be significantly predictive when RMSE<sub>real</sub> was significantly lower than RMSE<sub>surrogate</sub> calculated 100 times. For each SWR and its four nearest neighbors in the MDS space, their five binarized predictions were averaged. The calculation was replaced by 1 if the SWR was determined to be significantly predictive and 0.1 for otherwise. This procedure was repeated, and the averages were collected for all SWRs. Then, the spatial bias of the mean prediction scores was quantified by spatial entropy, which was calculated as –Σ<italic>P</italic>i log<sub>2</sub><italic>P</italic>i, where <italic>P</italic>i is the probability frequency of the mean binarized prediction of MCs with the SWR identity number <italic>i</italic>. SWR identity number is defined according to the order of SWRs occurring within the dataset. The chance level of spatial entropy was estimated by 1,000,000 surrogates in which SWRs were permuted within the MCs. If the spatial entropy is significantly lower than the shuffle, we interpret this as a bias in the SWR that can be predicted by the MC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed offline using custom-made MATLAB routines (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and the summarized data are reported as the means ± standard deviations (SDs) unless otherwise noted. p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions</p><p>1) Address the conceptual questions of Reviewers, especially Reviewer 1.</p><p>2) Clarify the deep learning approach as noted by all Reviewers.</p><p>3) Consider the statistical questions and revise as appropriate as noted by Reviewer 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Detailed additional concerns.</p><p>A ref is needed for CA3 neurons send input to MCs. I would suggest PMID: 7884451; PMID: 9157312 Note CA3 also sends input to hilar and GCL interneurons. For that I would cite PMID: 8008190, PMID 7473243, PMID: 8300905, PMID: 2358523.</p><p>Line 62</p><p>&quot;there is no direct axonal projection from CA3 pyramidal cells to DG granule cells Fujise and Kosaka, 1999&quot;</p><p>This is not likely to be true. Li et al. (PMID above) showed CA3 axons in the GCL and IML. However, I do not believe synapses were proven. Still, it is highly suggestive. Buckmaster showed similar findings in primate. PMID: 11135261</p><p>Line 63</p><p>&quot;An estimated 15,000 MCs reside in the rat hippocampal formation, whereas approximately 300,000 and 2,450,000 CA3 pyramidal and granule cells exist, respectively&quot;</p><p>I am not sure these numbers are correct. As a start, see PMID: 17765743, PMID: 17475251 Perhaps the authors are referring to a particular species and if so that should be discussed.. Finally, estimating GC numbers is very difficult because they overlap even in thin sections. So this needs to be considered carefully. See PMID: 29311853, PMID: 1793176, PMID: 3292009</p><p>Since it is not clear what the numbers are, it might be useful to show a range, and implement the deep learning with several possible values. If the results are the same that would make the results more convincing.</p><p>Line 66. Same caution needs to be made here</p><p>Line 103</p><p>I think the authors mean cells were excluded if capacitance was &lt;45pF (please explain the reason) and they were included if they had spines and thorns.</p><p>Refs are needed that these are characteristics of MCs.</p><p>Line 109</p><p>Consider excluding cells with such instability that they were not held &gt;1 min.</p><p>How were others designated healthy?</p><p>Line 465</p><p>Exposing mice to an enriched environment means what?</p><p>Why was this done? What were the effects? Was there a control?</p><p>Line 479</p><p>Why was -40 a cut off? That seems very depolarized and unhealthy.</p><p>How were MCs distinguished from CA3 or GCs? What about slow spiking hilar interneurons?</p><p>What were the brief inward currents exactly?</p><p>Line 480</p><p>What was the tungsten electrode exactly? What part of CA1 was recorded? Why? To record SW? If SW were recorded in CA1, the layer should be consistent. Was it checked?</p><p>Exactly how was DiI used?</p><p>Why were SW recorded in CA3 in vitro and CA1 in vivo?</p><p>Was the site in CA3 in vitro consistent across slices? How was it positioned so it was consistent?</p><p>Why is the term SW used, not SWR?</p><p>Line 503</p><p>'The detected events were scrutinized by eye and manually rejected if they were erroneously detected “</p><p>Please explain.</p><p>Line 500</p><p>Were definitions of SW similar in vivo and in vitro? Were the conclusions from SW in vitro confirmed by SWs in vivo? The data seem mainly from slices.</p><p>Please explain deep learning in more detail. One has to read the results to infer how this was done and many other aspects of the methods. The figure legends are not very helpful in this regard, making it hard to read the paper.</p><p>Please explain in the methods what the authors mean by:</p><p>spatial entropy</p><p>RMSE</p><p>MDS space</p><p>binarized prediction</p><p>significantly predictive</p><p>SW identity number</p><p>chance level of spatial entropy</p><p>SW permeation by MC</p><p>Line 562</p><p>How was the subgranular zone defined? Consider a supplemental figure showing the method.</p><p>If slices were transverse, the DG is not a semicircle. If horizontal sections were made, it is not either. Therefore explain how the DG was simplified to a semicircle.</p><p>How was the edge of CA3 defined without a stain?</p><p>Statistics</p><p>Please add means and SEMs where n is the number of mice. This could be done in supplemental material.</p><p>Stats are not explained at all. This is a serious omission. For example, what were the parametric and non parametric tests, and what were the tests of normality to make these decisions? Or was it assumed all data were normal? Were ANOVA's two-way and if so were there interactions?</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>SW are not clearly SW. The traces are too compressed to tell. What are the criteria in vitro?</p><p>What are the criteria in vivo? If animals do not have immobility but are forced to be immobile, what relationship are the SWs of slices and anesthetized animals to SW in vivo in awake behaving animals?</p><p>For the expanded traces in Figure 1B what is the voltage calibration?</p><p>The traces need to be decompressed to tell when during the SW the MC activity starts. That is important so that one can tell if it was possibly monosynaptic or polysynaptic. However, it is recognized that with field potentials the onset of CA3 activity will be hard to know precisely. Therefore monosynaptic CA3-MC connections will be hard to confirm. If polysynaptic circuits are involved this is very important because it might be CA3 only activates MCs when secondary pathways become involved. Importantly, polysynaptic transmission is always variable compared to monosynaptic transmission. Together there are many reasons MC responses to SWs are variable as discussed above.</p><p>If MCs have different resting potentials in Figure 1B it would seem logical and not very informative to point out that their depolarizations in response to a SW are variable. An analysis of variability as it relates to resting potential could help. One reason is at depolarized potentials NMDA receptors will become important and broaden EPSPs of MCs.</p><p>If it is variable in the same MC at the same resting potential, that is nice but it is (1) not clear how much this has been observed (2) if that is surprising since SWs themselves are variable.</p><p>Figure 1 and elsewhere. Please add number of mice throughout.</p><p>I can't see traces in C. Here and elsewhere they are too small. Please explain MDS1 and MDS2. Furthermore, what are the traces from? What does the sphere of dots signify?</p><p>D. Based on the comments above, consider a plot of depolarizations that Is just for cells at a small range of membrane potentials to see if there is more consistency. Also consider other factors: latency from the onset of the SW, duration, area under the curve. Are these just as a variable or not? If in variable it would be insightful. Can variability be reduced by use of APV to block NMDA receptors, cutting away CA3a so only CA3b and c are present, or just c, etc? One could also block GC transmission with DCG-IV and GABAergic transmission to reduce polysynaptic influences.</p><p>In D, what is Vm# on the Y axis? Was this just done for the one slice with 5 MCs? What about other data? Was it reproduced? What was the finding here? Just that there is variability?</p><p>E. Why z standardize? What were the weak correlations (I just see one R value only) and were they statistically significant? what was the test?</p><p>Why are data from MCs pooled? In other words, why equate the 87 cells if they were from 23 slices and even fewer mice?</p><p>Here and elsewhere there are numerous impressive recordings from more than 1 MC. However, how are the relationships interpreted in MCs of the same preparation if sometimes there are 1, 2, and other times up to 5? One wonders because totals are often cited as if everything is pooled. Moreover, there is a correlation between the number of cells recorded in the same preparation and some outcomes. Because of that finding, I don't see that pooling is justified.</p><p>Figure 2. In B there is no GluR2/3 stain in the inner molecular layer where MC axons are located.</p><p>Why was 100-250 Hz used as a filter and what was the type of filter? Presumably this is to study ripples. But ripples are not typically considered over 200 Hz and below 100 Hz is often included. Also the figure shows ripples besides the two SW events- what were these- small SWs?</p><p>The inset needs a voltage calibration.</p><p>Figure 3. In A, the neural network is not explained thoroughly. What were the assumptions based on? What does a full connected link mean relative to one that is not connected? Why is there only unidirectional flow in light of the complex circuitry? What is the take home message in B, F? In C, what were the statistics? Please make symbols in D large enough to see. Explain the box and whisker plots. Were these data from one slice? Were they reproduced?</p><p>Please explain E.</p><p>Figure 4 Please explain the title. In A, what is the count of? In C, please explain the method of analysis of spatial entropy. The methods are not clear and the relationship of what is said in the methods about entropy to Figure 4C is not clear.</p><p>It seems here that it does not matter where the MC is located. Is that the message?</p><p>In D, E how was the single SW selected?</p><p>In Figure 5, What is &quot;predicted deflection&quot;? &quot;dimensionally reduced&quot;? What is the threshold for defining a SW event was predictable in A?</p><p>B. What is the spatial bias of a rate? Change distribution? Are &quot;surrogates' the predicted events and non-surrogates are the actual SWs? What is the bottom line of this figure?</p><p>The very intriguing hypothesis in the abstract – i.e., a particular MC showed a more robust association with a particular SWR cluster, and the SWR cluster associated with one MC rarely overlapped with the SWR clusters associated with other MCs. – where is the evidence supporting this hypothesis? It seems only based on the complex analysis where there is a model driving the conclusions and the model may not be a good model.</p><p>Line 152. The authors find that the prediction error of real data was lower than shuffled data. Then they conclude from this that CA3 &quot;information during SWs was at least partially preserved in the Vm responses of MCs&quot; I see this as a major leap. All I see is that the deep learning had less of a prediction error for real data than shuffled data. Why is there an inference that this is meaningful in the way the authors state?</p><p>Line 160. The MCs were divided into subsets. Please explain what was done exactly. Why is it surprising that the more MCs are recorded simultaneously the better the prediction can be?</p><p>Line 169. Here the frequency range is 120-250 but in the figure it is 100-250.</p><p>Line 172. Please explain why the data suggest MCs &quot;retain more information about SWRs&quot;</p><p>Line 182. The SW waveform was predicted by the MCs but I am not sure that is interesting because the traces show that SWs are so similar from one example to the next. So it would be easy to predict.</p><p>Line 205. Only two intrinsic characteristics of MCs were examined so it seems hard to conclude that characteristics of MCs do not matter.</p><p>The fact that MCs in the area of the lower blade were more predictive could simply be due to greater connectivity with CA3 in that location. It would be good to investigate.</p><p>Line 211 What is meant by a dimensionality of SWs and reducing a SW to two dimensions?</p><p>The paragraph starting on page 224 is critical to the conclusion that is novel in the paper but it is not well explained. Therefore it is hard to be convinced. For example, is it justified to binarize prediction scores into 1 and 0? Is it reasonable to pool data from all MCs whether they were recorded with 1 other or 2 or more?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) Concerning more detailed model description</p><p>a – Details on model architecture: The manuscript briefly mentions the use of an encoder-decoder architecture with dense layers, but the rationale for choosing this architecture or the specific configuration of the layers used is not fully explained. The inclusion of such details, along with the rationale for the choice of activation functions (relu and sigmoid), would provide deeper insights into the model design.</p><p>b – Details on the training process: The paper would benefit from a more thorough explanation of the preprocessing steps applied to the data prior to training, as well as the rationale for the chosen loss function (root mean squared error, RMSE) and the detailed settings of the optimizer (e.g. learning rate, β values). This information is crucial for anyone attempting to replicate the study or apply the methodology to similar problems.</p><p>c – Details on data handling and evaluation metrics: Although cross-validation is mentioned, a clearer explanation of how the data sets were split and the criteria used for this split would be helpful.</p><p>d – Details on implementation and computational resources: Specifying the versions of TensorFlow, Keras and other dependencies used would help in replicating the computational environment. In addition, information about the required computational resources, such as GPU specifications (if applied), would provide practical insights into the feasibility of reproducing the study.</p><p>(2) Manuscript organization</p><p>The figures are effective in presenting the data, but the narrative in the text can be difficult to follow in places. Reorganizing the manuscript could facilitate better comprehension for readers. Specifically:</p><p>- Methodological descriptions should be confined to the Methods section.</p><p>- Theoretical and analytical concepts could benefit from succinct explanations where</p><p>they first appear.</p><p>- Transitions within the narrative should be smooth and well-motivated. For instance, the spatial analysis on page 7 requires a abrief introduction to provide context.</p><p>- A noteworthy result regarding the predictive value of MCs in relation to SWR information, currently discussed on page 11 (lines 300ff), could be more appropriately placed in the Results section.</p><p>(3) References</p><p>a – Hyde and Strowbridge (Nat Neurosci, 2012) have previously published research relevant to the topic; they used artificial stimuli to demonstrate encoding of temporal sequences into the MC network, suggesting mechanisms for short-term memory. The authors should acknowledge this study and discuss these earlier results in the context of their own findings.</p><p>b – Nitzan et al. (2020) undoubtedly serves as a valid reference for supporting the propagation of ripples from CA3/CA1 to cortical targets. However, since this phenomenon has previously been demonstrated and discussed, it would be preferable to cite earlier studies that originally identified or thoroughly investigated this propagation.</p><p>(4) Further comments</p><p>a – To maintain consistency in the literature, it is recommended that the authors align with established nomenclature. Specifically, 'SW' typically denotes slow waves, while 'SPW,' introduced by Buzsáki (1986) for sharp waves in the hippocampus, and SPW-R (or SWR), for sharp wave-ripple complexes, are the accepted terms. Using these conventions would enhance clarity and ensure alignment with the field's standard terminology.</p><p>b – &quot;Input&quot; versus &quot;Response&quot;: The manuscript's language at times implies an active role of mossy cells. However, the analysis primarily concerns *synaptic inputs* from CA3 to MCs, indicative of upstream network dynamics, rather than direct responses (that is, spiking activity) of MCs. Since responses of MCs in the true sense were not the focus of this study, I recommend a thorough review and revision of the manuscript to accurately reflect this distinction.</p><p>c -Line 222f: &quot;… a MC tended to predict a specific subset of SWs …&quot; – A more appropriate (precise) formulation would imply that it is not MCs that predict a specific subset of SPWs, but the synaptic input that an MC receives from the upstream network.</p><p>d – Line 293: &quot;Only a single MC was recorded in our in vivo study.&quot; – This sentence seems to be misleading: If I am not mistaken, the authors meant to write that their in vivo dataset consists of single MC recordings, as opposed to their in vitro dataset, which contains recordings of up to five MCs recorded simultaneously. Please rephrase this sentence.</p><p>e -Line 296: &quot;…because the nerve fibers are preserved without sectioning in the in vivo preparations.&quot; – This statement, while not incorrect, is somewhat unspecific; the authors should perhaps specify that in vivo, CA3 projections targeting MCs are intact, resulting in a complete set of synaptic inputs related to CA3 network activity, as opposed to slices where connections are severed.</p><p>f -Line 313: &quot;…the exponent α was 0.920 with a 99% confidence interval of [0.907,0.933].&quot; – Please check the mathematical terminology used in the description of your equation. In the context of the given equation p=1−α^n, α serves as the base of the exponential term, and n is the exponent.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors showed in their responses that they considered the concerns and took time to try to address the concerns. The efforts are appreciated. The manuscript is improved.</p><p>However, several of the concerns were not well addressed.</p><p>One issue that may not have been clear is that an explanation of the methods to construct a model of the network and the methods to use the model to develop the conclusions are not clear. This is critical so that the readers understand how the data were used to lead to the conclusions. In parts of the response some information is provided and this needs to be added to the manuscript. In addition, the additional methods need to be provided.</p><p>Some other fundamental concerns are raised by what the authors mention in their response:</p><p>If MCs were recorded for 55-367sec, how could the authors know (1) the cell was healthy, and (2) the cell was a MC? Regarding (1), how did the authors assess the health and stability of the recording? It would seem they could not so they simply assumed it was healthy, despite only keeping the recording for a short time which one would think implies the cell was not healthy. That should be stated in the methods, one would think. Regarding (2), it is stated that cells were filled with biocytin, and one is shown. If no time was available to determine if the cell was a MC by physiology, then the biocytin is critical to identify that the cell was a MC. Was it the case that all cells were identified as MCs by biocytin, or was it only a subset? If some cells were not stained or not stained well enough, why were they included? There are many large cells in the hilus that are not MCs so just the size of the soma is not a good way to tell if a hilar cell is a MC.</p><p>If MC depolarizations could not be analyzed by AUC or duration because there were barrages, this would be consistent with hilar cell physiology shown previously. The problem is that if barrages occur, one does not know if a SPWR caused a depolarization very well. This is because a SPWR has a duration that is 50-200 msec and barrages of EPSPs during that time will make it seem like MC depolarizations were caused by a SPWR but they actually occurred independently. A great way to make this easier is to use DCG-IV to stop the majority of MC spontaneous activity because it stops the GC input to MCs. If the authors do not choose to do this, then they need to make a better case that SPWRs induce MC depolarizations.</p><p>I apologize for not having read the Impact statement earlier. The current impact statement is quite complex, and the main message is not clear. Please revise.</p><p>There are several assumptions that are not clearly based on data in the literature</p><p>1. CA3 SPW-Rs are transmitted to the granule cells (GCs) via MCs. CA3 projects to both MCs and hilar GABAergic neurons. Together they innervate GCs, as well as each other. Therefore SPW-Rs in GCs are not necessarily a product of CA3 excitation of MCs alone. This was mentioned before and the authors added references that were suggested and content, which is good. But they added it in different locations. The Introduction still reads as if CA3 innervates MCs and MCs excite GCs, producing GC SPWRs. This is an oversimplification. Also, note that if the algorithm does not take into account the circuitry correctly it could make it seem like MCs are responsible for the events they call GC SPW-Rs and MCs are not solely responsible.</p><p>2. Please note it also is not clear to this reviewer that LFPs like SPWRs occur in the GC layer. What is it that the authors think are &quot;SPWRs&quot; in recordings of the GC layer? Depolarizations? Dentate spikes?</p><p>3. It is confusing if the term SWR is referring to the ripple or the SPW or both. This is because SWR is defined as a ripple 80-200 Hz in one location of the paper. Furthermore, if it is, how would MCs produce a ripple in GCs if GABAergic neurons are not invoked? This seems to be a major point of confusion.</p><p>4. What is the reason why &quot;MC ensembles&quot; are assumed? It seems there is no basis for this. MCs are not interconnected, or are not interconnected much. Perhaps the term &quot;ensembles&quot; is not what the authors mean?</p><p>On line 74-76, the references that are cited did not show that SPWRs travel from CA3 to the DG by MCs. Pentonnen et al. did not prove MCs were critical. It was merely suggested. Scharfman did not either.</p><p>Please explain the reasoning in the Introduction more clearly. For example, when are the authors discussing CA3 neurons and when are they discussion other neurons. When are they discussing the ripple and when are they discussing the sharp wave?</p><p>Please explain the meaning of overcapacity on line 424. Why do the authors state that MCs form a layer? They are heterogeneously distributed. Throughout the Discussion it seems that the authors are making statements of fact based on their network model and this is not appropriate. In the model, for example, if the make MCs a layer, that does not mean they are in vivo. Please specify in the Discussion that the results are what the neural network found, not the data (especially lines 418 and following)</p><p>Lines 434-437 are not clear. What the authors say they show is that CA3 has robust excitatory input to MCs, but this has been shown. Furthermore the authors seem to say they show MC activity occurs during SPWRs, but that has also been shown. On the other hand, one study did not find MC activity during SPWRs were not so consistent (Swaminathan et al.). The differences from the current study are not discussed.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>The response to the first comment is not very strong. The argument that the study proved connections between CA3 and MCs that have not been shown before is incorrect. Perhaps the authors are saying something else?</p><p>In response to the second point the authors say their study shows the extent to which SWRs are encoded in MCs. I do not see the authors showed this. That conclusion is based on a very simplified model and methods that they do not describe well.</p><p>Explanations in the response are not always added to the paper. Please do so.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed most of my points, but one of the major points is still unresolved.</p><p>Original comment 4: Although a mixed-effects model is preferable, the authors' new analyses are sufficient to show the same point, and this comment is considered resolved.</p><p>Original comment 5: The author's response is unsatisfactory. They acknowledge that the problem I raised was correct, but they continue to show the result of this flawed statistical analysis in Figure 3C. Instead, they add a new supplementary figure with a paired t test (the rebuttal letter and the main text (line 179) state that this is Figure 3-supp Figure 5, but I believe it is really Figure 3-supp Figure 1, as supp Figure 5 does not exist). They need to remove Figure 3C entirely from the paper, as it is an inappropriate test for the reasons described in the last review (and which the authors acknowledge). Instead, they should put Figure 3-supp Figure 1 in its place.</p><p>Original comment 6: The new discussion is a good addition. The authors should add Senzai and Buzsaki (2017) PMID: 28132824 and GoodSmith et al.

Identifying mossy cells electrophysiologically and morphologically.</p><p>The authors say that cells that &quot;…had a membrane capacitance higher than 45 pF and spines and thorny excrescences on proximal dendrites …are electrophysiological and morphological markers of MCs.&quot;</p><p>A cell capacitance over 45 pF is insufficient to define MCs electrophysiologically because it is also a characteristic of other cells. Spines do not characterize MCs because they are present on other cell types. Thorny excrescences do but all cells were not filled by biocytin (and we don't know how many were out of all those included).</p><p>Therefore, please add a limitation to the text that the approach may have included other cell types, but the authors do not think this is a serious concern because the cells they filled showed thorny excrescences.</p><p>2. Regarding the evidence that CA3 SPWRs cause MC depolarizations</p><p>The authors say that they have shown that synaptic transmission to the MC via mossy fibers in not affected by SPWRs. However, that was not the point of the suggestion. The point was that blocking mossy fiber transmission is a useful tool to reduce the non-CA3 input. If experiments were done in this condition, it would be more convincing if a SPWR caused a depolarization in MCs because the input that is not from CA3, the majority, would be removed.</p><p>3. Regarding the Impact statement that was unclear</p><p>It is still unclear. Why is it important that 30% of SWR waveforms were reconstructed. How would a synaptic response of a MC reconstruct a SPR? How would 5 MCs do this?</p><p>Is this the meaning?

We have added the following sentence to the discussion:</p><p>“In this study, we performed MC patch-clamp recording both in vivo and in vitro, and clarified that SWR can be predicted from <italic>V</italic>m of MC in both cases. However, there are three caveats to the interpretation of these data. First, the in vivo SWR cannot be said to be exactly the same as the in vitro SWR: note that in vitro SWR has some similarities to in vivo SWR, such as spatial and spectral profiles and neural activity patterns (Maier et al., 2009; Hájos et al., 2013; Pangalos et al., 2013). The same concern applies to MC synaptic inputs. The in vivo <italic>V</italic>m data may contain more information compared to the in vitro single MC data, because the entire projections that target MCs are intact, resulting in a complete set of synaptic inputs related to SWR activity, as opposed to slices where connections are severed. While we recognize these differences, it is also very likely that there are common ways of expressing information. Second, since the in vivo LFP recordings were obtained from the CA1 region, it is possible that the CA1-SWR receives input from the CA2 region (Oliva et al., 2016) and the entorhinal cortex (Yamamoto and Tonegawa, 2017). In addition, urethane anesthesia has been observed to reduce subthreshold activity, spike synchronization, and SWR (Yagishita et al., 2020), making it difficult to achieve complete agreement with in vitro SWR recorded from the CA3 region. Finally, although we were able to record MC <italic>V</italic>m during in vivo SWR in this study, the in vivo data set consisted of recordings from a single MC, in contrast to the in vitro dataset. To perform the same analysis as in the in vitro experiment, it would be desirable to record LFPs from the CA3 region and collect data from multiple MCs simultaneously, but this is technically very difficult. In this study, it was difficult to directly clarify the consistency between CA3 network activity and in vivo MC synaptic input, but the fact that the SWR waveform can be predicted from in vivo MC <italic>V</italic>m in CA1-SWR may be the result of some CA3 network activity being reflected in CA1-SWR. It is undeniable that more accurate predictions would have been possible if it had been possible to record LFP from the CA3 regions in vivo.” (Page 12, Line 357)</p><p>The inset of 1B has been magnified. Since only the time width is enlarged, the scale bar is omitted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The traces need to be decompressed to tell when during the SW the MC activity starts. That is important so that one can tell if it was possibly monosynaptic or polysynaptic. However, it is recognized that with field potentials the onset of CA3 activity will be hard to know precisely. Therefore monosynaptic CA3-MC connections will be hard to confirm. If polysynaptic circuits are involved this is very important because it might be CA3 only activates MCs when secondary pathways become involved. Importantly, polysynaptic transmission is always variable compared to monosynaptic transmission. Together there are many reasons MC responses to SWs are variable as discussed above.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising a very good point. We have added the following sentence to the discussion:</p><p>“The synaptic transmission to the MC is also influenced by many factors not only from the CA3 region, such as input from other hilar interneurons, semilunar granule cells, and GC (Larimer and Strowbridge, 2008; Larimer and Strowbridge, 2010; Scharfman and Schwartzkroin, 1990); note that it is known that there are projections from CA3 region to inhibitory interneurons in the hilus (Kneisler and Dingledine, 1995). Conversely, in the case of MC, where there is much spontaneous activity, the fact that the SWR can be predicted from the shape of the EPSP at the time of SWR occurrence suggests that the information of the SWR is strongly reflected in the synaptic inputs of MC.” (Page 13, Line 383)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If MCs have different resting potentials in Figure 1B it would seem logical and not very informative to point out that their depolarizations in response to a SW are variable.

Although we were able to confirm differences in the accuracy of the predictions for each cell, slice, and animal, since the accuracy of the predictions for the real data was better than that for the shuffled data in 75.9 % of the cases (Figure 3 —figure supplement 7), we can conclude that the results obtained from this model generally have common properties.

The spatial entropy for the semicircular diagram was calculated by converting the polar coordinate values to Cartesian coordinate values and calculating the Euclidean distance between each two points. This resulted in an average of five % predictable SWRs for each MC and its four nearest neighbors in the semicircular space. This procedure was repeated to collect averages for all MCs. The spatial bias of the average % predictable SWR was then quantified by spatial entropy.

Therefore, we asked whether the predictable SWR depends on the SWR features (i.e., whether they are clustered), and the spatial entropy was calculated to check whether the predictable SWRs (red) are partially agglomerated. If it does not depend on the SWR features, then the entropy will be large because the predictable SWRs (red) are distributed without bias. If the question is correct, the entropy will be smaller in the actual data than the shuffled positions of the red predictable SWRs (change distribution).

A similar procedure is performed with the quadruple, triple patch-clamp recording dataset.</p><p>Interpreting the results in Figure 6, the encoding of SWR by MCs is not perfectly orthogonal, and the predictable SWR may overlap between MCs recorded at the same time. In other words, it is expected that the prediction accuracy of SWR waveforms in neural networks can be improved when several different MCs encode the same SWR. Therefore, the result that prediction accuracy increases when many MCs can record simultaneously is consistent with the results of single-cell MC analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 169.

Because there are many factors that make SWR different, such as amplitude, duration, ripple power, etc. As a result, it was not possible to predict the SWR waveform close to the original using conventional linear regression, taking into account these factors. Thus, instead of predicting similar average waveforms, we constructed a new neural network system that could significantly reproduce the characteristics of each individual SWR based on the Vm information of the MC. We believe that the novelty lies in the fact that we were able to link upstream neural dynamics and downstream neural response using our originally constructed neural network system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 205.

The efforts are appreciated. The manuscript is improved.</p><p>However, several of the concerns were not well addressed.</p><p>One issue that may not have been clear is that an explanation of the methods to construct a model of the network and the methods to use the model to develop the conclusions are not clear. This is critical so that the readers understand how the data were used to lead to the conclusions. In parts of the response some information is provided and this needs to be added to the manuscript. In addition, the additional methods need to be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we added a new Method section called “Code Availability” to enable reproduction. Here, you can access URLs where you can find the data we used for analysis and details of the model (Page 27, Line 852). We have already described the model in detail in the section titled “Prediction of SWR waveforms <italic>V</italic>ms and the model architecture,” so please refer to that section for more information. (Page 24, Line 745)</p><p>Based on the comments from the reviewer, we added the following text to the Discussion section, focusing on how the RMSE results can be interpreted and lead to conclusion:</p><p>“To evaluate the predictive performance of the model, we used RMSE as a key metric. We found that the RMSEs for predictions using real data were significantly lower than those obtained using shuffled data, demonstrating that MC <italic>V</italic>ms contain structured, SWR-specific information. Had no difference been observed, it would suggest that the MC activity might only reflect nonspecific background input rather than meaningful information about individual SWRs. Similar results were also observed in the single MC analysis. We then focused on SWRs for which predictions based on real data had significantly lower RMSEs than those from shuffled data, and defined these as “predictable SWRs”— that is, SWR events whose information is encoded in the <italic>V</italic>m dynamics of a given MC. Therefore, we quantified the proportion of SWRs that each MC could predict. Thus, we applied RMSE not only as a measure of prediction accuracy, but also as a quantitative proxy for the amount and diversity of SWR-related information embedded in the subthreshold activity of MCs.” (Page 12, Line 346)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some other fundamental concerns are raised by what the authors mention in their response:</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding (1) as described in the Methods section, the data criteria were clearly defined. “The data criterion for series resistance before and after recording was &lt; 30%. The data were adopted when the mean resting membrane potential was &lt; -50 mV and when Z-scores of the mean membrane potentials for 30 s were between -2 and 2. (Page 22, Line 684)” We consider cells to be healthy when these criteria are cleared. The start and end of the recording period are at the experimenter's discretion. For example, after recording a single dataset for 55 seconds, we confirm that the cell is healthy and then resume recording. If the cell remains healthy, we record again, and during this period, the recording electrode remains continuously inserted into the cell. Therefore, prolonged electrode insertion time may potentially impair cell health. We continue recording while periodically assessing cell health and adopting the data accordingly. As mentioned in the main text, the median recording time is 301 seconds, with recordings primarily aimed at five minutes. During this time, cell checks are performed periodically. While 55 seconds is a relatively short recording time, in this case, the recording was accidentally stopped due to an operational error. However, since there were no abnormalities in the cell's condition before or after the recording and a sufficient number of SWRs were recorded, we included the data. It is difficult to record SWRs multiple times in such slice experiments, but since machine learning requires a large number of SWRs, we include data with shorter recording times in the dataset. The points explained above are summarized in supplementary file 1. Another minor correction: the shortest time was not 55 seconds, but 56 seconds, so we have corrected this.</p><p>Regarding (2), all recorded cells were stained with biocytin. Only cells determined to be MCs by electrophysiological and histological criteria were included in the data. Some putative MCs that could not be stained were excluded. And we have already described it in the Methods section. “Data were included in the analysis if the recorded cells had a membrane capacitance higher than 45 pF (Hedrick et al., 2017) and had spines and thorny excrescences on their proximal dendrites (Murakawa and Kosaka, 2001; Amaral, 1978; Frotscher et al., 1991), which are electrophysiological and morphological markers of MCs. ” (Page 22, Line 686)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If MCs were recorded for 55-367sec, how could the authors know (1) the cell was healthy, and (2) the cell was a MC? Regarding (1), how did the authors assess the health and stability of the recording? It would seem they could not so they simply assumed it was healthy, despite only keeping the recording for a short time which one would think implies the cell was not healthy. That should be stated in the methods, one would think. Regarding (2), it is stated that cells were filled with biocytin, and one is shown. If no time was available to determine if the cell was a MC by physiology, then the biocytin is critical to identify that the cell was a MC. Was it the case that all cells were identified as MCs by biocytin, or was it only a subset? If some cells were not stained or not stained well enough, why were they included? There are many large cells in the hilus that are not MCs so just the size of the soma is not a good way to tell if a hilar cell is a MC.</p><p>If MC depolarizations could not be analyzed by AUC or duration because there were barrages, this would be consistent with hilar cell physiology shown previously. The problem is that if barrages occur, one does not know if a SPWR caused a depolarization very well. This is because a SPWR has a duration that is 50-200 msec and barrages of EPSPs during that time will make it seem like MC depolarizations were caused by a SPWR but they actually occurred independently. A great way to make this easier is to use DCG-IV to stop the majority of MC spontaneous activity because it stops the GC input to MCs. If the authors do not choose to do this, then they need to make a better case that SPWRs induce MC depolarizations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already demonstrated that EPSPs associated with SWRs disappear when the CA3 region and hilus region are dissected prior to recording (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). This clearly establishes that the EPSPs observed in the MC are derived from SWRs. Our experimental data suggest that synaptic transmission to the MC via mossy fibers is not affected by SWRs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I apologize for not having read the Impact statement earlier.

CA3 SPW-Rs are transmitted to the granule cells (GCs) via MCs. CA3 projects to both MCs and hilar GABAergic neurons. Together they innervate GCs, as well as each other. Therefore SPW-Rs in GCs are not necessarily a product of CA3 excitation of MCs alone. This was mentioned before and the authors added references that were suggested and content, which is good. But they added it in different locations. The Introduction still reads as if CA3 innervates MCs and MCs excite GCs, producing GC SPWRs. This is an oversimplification. Also, note that if the algorithm does not take into account the circuitry correctly it could make it seem like MCs are responsible for the events they call GC SPW-Rs and MCs are not solely responsible.</p></disp-quote><p>We have never mentioned GC SWR, but rather that synaptic responses to SWR were observed in GC. However, to avoid possible confusion, we have revised the text as follows:</p><p>“The observation of delayed synaptic responses in GCs compared to MCs during SWRs supports the hypothesis that the CA3-DG backpropagation reflects SWR-associated excitatory activity mediated by a disynaptic pathway involving MCs (Ouchi et al., 2017; Swaminathan et al., 2018).”(Page 4, Line 90)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please note it also is not clear to this reviewer that LFPs like SPWRs occur in the GC layer. What is it that the authors think are &quot;SPWRs&quot; in recordings of the GC layer? Depolarizations? Dentate spikes?</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, LFP recordings from the GC layer were not performed. Furthermore, SWR was not mentioned as occurring in the GC layer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is confusing if the term SWR is referring to the ripple or the SPW or both. This is because SWR is defined as a ripple 80-200 Hz in one location of the paper. Furthermore, if it is, how would MCs produce a ripple in GCs if GABAergic neurons are not invoked? This seems to be a major point of confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to previous comments from the reviewers, this paper uses the term &quot;sharp wave ripples&quot; (SWRs) to refer to both sharp waves and sharp wave ripples. The difference between sharp wave and ripple has been added to the Introduction. (Page 3, Line 76)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. What is the reason why &quot;MC ensembles&quot; are assumed? It seems there is no basis for this. MCs are not interconnected, or are not interconnected much. Perhaps the term &quot;ensembles&quot; is not what the authors mean?</p></disp-quote><p>Since our paper mentions that multiple MC membrane potentials that are recorded simultaneously can carry diversity in SWR-related information, we believe that the term “ensemble” is conceptually appropriate.

The text has been revised overall in accordance with the comments of the reviewer, but please note that we wrote, &quot;SWRs may also propagate backward to the DG&quot;(Page 4, Line 86) so that we are also merely referring to a possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please explain the reasoning in the Introduction more clearly. For example, when are the authors discussing CA3 neurons and when are they discussion other neurons. When are they discussing the ripple and when are they discussing the sharp wave?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewer's comments, we have revised the relevant sections as follows:</p><p>“Sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) consist of two distinct components: the sharp wave and the ripple. The sharp wave is a slow deflection in the local field potential (LFP), primarily originating from the synchronous burst firing of CA3 pyramidal neurons. The ripple is a high-frequency oscillation (80–200 Hz) that is most prominently observed in the CA1 region, though it is also present in the CA3 region. The ripple component is superimposed on the sharp wave. SWRs primarily occur during sleep or quiet wakefulness (Buzsáki et al., 1992) and are thought to represent a mechanism for reactivating or consolidating recent experiences. These ‘replayed’ neural events allow information to be transferred from the CA3 region forward to the neocortex via the subiculum (Nitzan et al., 2020; Siapas and Wilson, 1998; Sirota et al., 2003) or to the deep layers of the entorhinal cortex (Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1994). SWRs may also propagate backward to the DG (Penttonen et al., 1997; Scharfman, 2007). In this case, SWRs generated by the population activity of CA3 pyramidal cells may propagate to the DG via synaptic inputs to MCs, which in turn provide excitatory input to GCs, forming a potential disynaptic pathway. The observation of delayed synaptic responses in GCs compared to MCs during SWRs supports the hypothesis that the CA3-DG backpropagation reflects SWR-associated excitatory activity mediated through MCs (Ouchi et al., 2017; Swaminathan et al., 2018). Furthermore, both experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that the MC activity is involved in memory processes such as spatial coding and pattern separation (Danielson et al., 2017; GoodSmith et al., 2017; Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017; Myers and Scharfman, 2011). In addition, MC synaptic activity serves as temporary storage and encoding of information at the local circuit level (Hyde and Strowbridge, 2012). In addition, MC synaptic activity serves as temporary storage and encoding of information at the local circuit level (Hyde and Strowbridge, 2012). ”(Page 3, Line 76)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please explain the meaning of overcapacity on line 424. Why do the authors state that MCs form a layer? They are heterogeneously distributed. Throughout the Discussion it seems that the authors are making statements of fact based on their network model and this is not appropriate. In the model, for example, if the make MCs a layer, that does not mean they are in vivo. Please specify in the Discussion that the results are what the neural network found, not the data (especially lines 418 and following)</p></disp-quote><p>In the Introduction section of the main text, it is mentioned that the MC cell population is considered to be a relay point in the transmission pathway from CA3 to DG, but due to its relatively small cell number compared to other areas, it is considered a good experimental model for a bottleneck middle layer. Therefore, as you pointed out, although it is anatomically somewhat inaccurate, we used the term “MC layer.” To avoid confusion, we have revised the relevant section as follows:</p><p>“Thus, it is unclear how hippocampal information is efficiently encoded despite the limited capacity of the MC population.” (Page 15, Line 449)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 434-437 are not clear.

On the other hand, one study did not find MC activity during SPWRs were not so consistent (Swaminathan et al.). The differences from the current study are not discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity.

The argument that the study proved connections between CA3 and MCs that have not been shown before is incorrect. Perhaps the authors are saying something else?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you again for your valuable feedback. We fully agree that the anatomical projections from CA3 pyramidal neurons to mossy cells (MCs) are already well established in the literature, and we apologize if our previous response suggested otherwise. Our aim was not to claim novel anatomical connectivity, but rather to highlight a physiological demonstration of functional heterogeneity in how CA3 SWR activity is represented across the MC population. Specifically, our findings show that individual MCs exhibit distinct subthreshold membrane potential dynamics in response to the same SWR. Using machine learning-based decoding, we further demonstrate that different MCs carry only marginally overlapping information about CA3 SWRs. Notably, our results show that as the number of recorded MCs increases, up to at least five, the amount of SWR-related information that can be extracted grows progressively, indicating distributed and complementary encoding among MCs. This functional divergence, while anatomically plausible, had not been directly quantified or physiologically validated at the single-cell level during spontaneous SWRs. This is because no previous studies have simultaneously recorded the threshold potentials of multiple MCs, and thus the heterogeneity of MC synaptic responses to the same SWR has not been investigated. Therefore, we believe that this study provides quantitative insights into the mechanisms by which known anatomical backprojections generate functionally distributed encoding within MC populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In response to the second point the authors say their study shows the extent to which SWRs are encoded in MCs. I do not see the authors showed this. That conclusion is based on a very simplified model and methods that they do not describe well.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our model is relatively simple in its structure, using an encoder-decoder network. However, we believe that this simplicity adds value in a different sense. That is, if even a relatively simple model can predict aspects of SWR waveforms from MC Vms significantly better than chance, then it demonstrates that MCs do encode at least this level of information. And, we believe that more precise methods could potentially extract more information than our simple model.</p><p>This part is closely related to the reviewer's first comment, so please refer to the relevant section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Explanations in the response are not always added to the paper.

Even if input from DG were superimposed, we believe it would not significantly impact the paper's claim. To support this assertion, we would like to organize the reviewer's concerns and our paper's claim as follows:</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, when input from the GC is involved in the MC EPSP via SWR, anatomically, the following two cases are conceivable.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(A) CA3 SWRs propagate backward simultaneously to the MC and GC, with the input being sent to the MC (Diagram A). In this case, inhibiting input from the GC to the MC via the DCG-IV pathway may allow comparison of the magnitudes of the CA3-to-MC and GC-to-MC inputs. However, our previous studies that recorded EPSPs in the MC or GC during CA3 SWR showed that the SWR-to-MC pathway is significantly faster than the SWR-to-GC pathway in terms of time lag (Modified Figure 1,3 from Ouchi et al., 2017). This implies that, when a barrage of MC EPSPs occurs due to a SWR, the fast component likely originates from direct input from CA3 to MC rather than via GC. Regarding the slow component, input from GC may be involved. However, based on the causal diagram A, both components originate from the CA3 SWR. Therefore, even if there were SWR driven input from the GC to the MC EPSP in this study, it would not significantly undermine the argument that the signal can reconstruct the SWR because it originates from the same source. (B) A case in which input from GC to MC occurs without being caused by the CA3 SWR (Diagram B). In Figure 1 —figure supplement 3, severing the connection between CA3 and the hilus eliminates the input from SWR to MC. Therefore, the non SWR driven input from GC to MC is considered to have little effect.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97270-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Based on the above, the DCG-IV experiment suggested by the reviewer can be considered a useful method for isolating the direct transmission of CA3 SWR to MC.This is achieved by suppressing input from the GC to the MC, thereby reducing non-CA3 input. However, our findings provide evidence that CA3 SWR are transmitted to MCs and are sufficiently encoded in their subthreshold responses to allow for reconstruction. Even in the presence of potential superimposed inputs from the GC, such additional activity would not negate the specific correspondence we observed between CA3 SWRs and MC EPSPs. Rather, the robustness of decoding performance despite such confounds further supports the specificity of the CA3 SWR to MC backprojection.</p><p>To clarify the paper, we have added the following sentences:</p><p>“However, an important consideration in interpreting this study is that the resting membrane potential of MCs is highly active even under normal conditions, often exhibiting barrage activity where EPSPs accumulate immediately after their generation (Scharfman, 1993). Barrages were occasionally observed in MC EPSPs used in this study during SWRs. Therefore, the possibility that these EPSPs included input from GCs cannot be ruled out. Thus, it should be noted that the MC EPSPs used for machine learning do not necessarily reflect input purely from CA3 SWR. Nevertheless, the robustness of decoding performance despite such confounds further supports the specificity of the CA3 SWR to MC backprojection” (Page 14, Line 418).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Regarding the Impact statement that was unclear</p><p>It is still unclear. Why is it important that 30% of SWR waveforms were reconstructed. How would a synaptic response of a MC reconstruct a SPR? How would 5 MCs do this?</p><p>Is this the meaning? Machine-learning algorithms combined with whole-cell patch-clamp of MCs and LFP recordings of SWRs showed MC EPSPs follow approximately 30% of SWRs?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion this may have caused. The previous impact statement could have been interpreted as the reconstruction of 30% of a single SWR waveform.</p><p>As shown in Figure 3A, SWR can be reconstructed based on the synaptic responses of MCs corresponding to the SWR. We then analyzed the proportion of the entire SWR that could be reconstructed by a single MC. Using the RMSE metric, we determined that SWR was significantly reconstructed when the prediction based on real data showed a significantly lower RMSE than the prediction based on shuffled data. A single MC could significantly reconstruct approximately 10% of the total of SWR. Furthermore, calculating the proportion of the SWR that was significantly reconstructed by each of the five simultaneously recorded MCs revealed that they collectively significantly reconstructed approximately 30% of the recorded SWR, despite some overlap (Figure 6B, C).</p><p>Despite the MC having a far smaller number of cells (30,000) compared to the CA3 region (300,000), we were surprised that approximately 30% of the total SWR could be reconstructed from the synaptic responses of just five MCs. We consider this an important finding, as it indicates that precise information is encoded within the synaptic responses of MCs.</p><p>Therefore, we revised the text as follows.</p><p>“Combining machine learning with whole-cell patch-clamp and LFP recordings reveals that synaptic responses from only five mossy cells, despite their limited population, can significantly reconstruct about 30% of the total hippocampal sharp wave-ripples, highlighting efficient distributed coding within subthreshold activities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Regarding the response starting with &quot;We have never mentioned GC SWR…&quot; The authors actually revised to say what this reviewer meant, so that is good. One minor point, which is about the references in the text the authors revised. It is that the back projection that is described in the sentence was originally shown by PMIDs 7931561, 7884451, 9157312 and evidence reviewed in PMID 17765742.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.
