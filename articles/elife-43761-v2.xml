Using retrograde tracing in macaque monkeys, we quantified projection strength by counting retrogradely labeled cells in each FC area. The projection from different FC regions varied across injection sites in strength, following different spatial patterns. Importantly, a site at the rostral end of the cingulate sulcus stood out as having strong inputs from many areas in diverse FC regions. Moreover, it was at the integrative conjunction of three projection trends across sites. This site marks a connectional hub inside the rACC that integrates FC inputs across functional modalities. Tractography with monkey diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) located a similar hub region comparable to the tracing result. Applying the same tractography method to human dMRI data, we demonstrated that a similar hub can be located in the human rACC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>frontal cortex</kwd><kwd>circuit integration</kwd><kwd>human anatomy</kwd><kwd>dMRI</kwd><kwd>network</kwd><kwd>monkey anatomy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH106435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Ziyi</given-names></name><name><surname>Lehman</surname><given-names>Julia F</given-names></name><name><surname>Haber</surname><given-names>Suzanne N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH045573</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Ziyi</given-names></name><name><surname>Lehman</surname><given-names>Julia F</given-names></name><name><surname>Haber</surname><given-names>Suzanne N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L009013/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jbabdi</surname><given-names>Saad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01-MH109589</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cottaar</surname><given-names>Michiel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000135</institution-id><institution>NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01-MH093765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grisot</surname><given-names>Giorgia</given-names></name><name><surname>Yendiki</surname><given-names>Anastasia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A hub in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex receives unusually high and functionally diverse inputs, providing a biological interface between motivation, incentive based learning, and decision making.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is composed of multiple regions that support a wide range of functions (emotion, motivation, higher cognition, and motor control), and thus, is in a position to use value-related information to help regulate flexibility, adaptation and top-down control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Etkin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kolling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shenhav et al., 2016</xref>). This functionally heterogeneous region is anatomically divided into the subgenual ACC (sACC), the rostral ACC (rACC), and the dorsal ACC (dACC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morecraft et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morecraft and Tanji, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ongür and Price, 2000</xref>). The sACC is connected to the motivation network consisting of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the amygdala. It is involved in visceral and emotional functions, an important mediator of motivation, and is critical for determining value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Camille et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jocham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kolling et al., 2016</xref>). The rACC is tightly linked with both the sACC and dACC, the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC and vlPFC), and is associated with cognitive control and choice of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kolling et al., 2018</xref>). Caudally, the dACC is connected with the action network consisting of motor control areas, including frontal eye fields (FEF) and premotor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morecraft et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ongür and Price, 2000</xref>). The dACC is associated with motor planning and action execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caruana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Picard and Strick, 1996</xref>). Importantly, there are no clearly defined borders between the sACC, rACC and dACC based on their anatomical connections. Regions that project strongly to an ACC subdivision also projects to the others, albeit to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morecraft and Tanji, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The rACC sits at the connectional intersection of the motivation and action control networks. Thus, it is in an important position in the transition from valuation, to choice, to action. An important question is how the transitions occur within the rACC. One possibility is that information processing changes sequentially across subregions within the rACC, from valuation in regions close to the sACC, to cognition at the center of the rACC, and then to action in regions close to the dACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kable and Glimcher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rangel and Hare, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shadlen et al., 2008</xref>). Alternatively, different functional processing may be integrated in a central location, or hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cisek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hunt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kolling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rushworth et al., 2012</xref>). In network theory, hubs are nodes of a network that have unusually high connectivity to other nodes (a.k.a. degree-centrality) and high connectivity to other hubs (a.k.a. eigenvalue-centrality). In the context of cortical networks, the connectivity that defines a hub is not simply the intersection of shared inputs from functionally similar or adjacent cortical regions. Rather, the connectivity of a hub is higher and more diverse than its neighbors. Hubs thus represent regions for integrating and distributing information from multiple regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013</xref>). In this regard, the entire rACC can be considered a hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckner et al., 2009</xref>). However, as the rACC is a large area, we sought to determine whether there is a specific region within it that is uniquely positioned to integrate signals across several functional domains. Networks in this study are based on anatomical connections, which allows for measurement of degree-centrality but not eigenvalue-centrality. We thus define the hub according to its high degree of inputs and its position in the network for cross-domain integration.</p><p>To determine whether a hub region exists in the rACC, we systematically placed tracer injections along the rACC in nonhuman primates (NHP), and quantified the input strength and patterns from the frontal cortex (FC) to each injection site. As expected, projections from the vmPFC were concentrated in the ventral rACC and those from motor control areas were found more dorsally and caudally. Projections from the vlPFC, dlPFC, dmPFC and OFC varied across sites. However, one site showed uniquely high degree-centrality with the FC, suggesting a hub region at this site. We verified that inputs to this site were from functionally diverse regions and were not a composition of inputs to the neighboring cytoarchitectonic areas. To test whether a similar connectivity pattern and the location of a hub could be identified in the human rACC, we used dMRI tractography to analyze connections between the FC and the rACC. Comparing two connectivity modalities (tracing and dMRI) in different species (NHP and humans) is problematic. We therefore first verified that dMRI correctly detected connectivity convergence in NHPs. Note: for two experiments, the tracer injections and dMRI were carried out in the same animals. We seeded each frontal area and, consistent with the tracing results, probabilistic streamlines converged in a similar location as the hub within the rACC in the NHP. We then seeded each frontal area in a dMRI dataset from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). As in the NHP results, the streamlines converged in a similar rACC location.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview</title><p>Bidirectional tracer injections were placed systematically throughout the rACC. FC was divided based on cytoarchitectonics into areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pandya and Seltzer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paxinos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Preuss and Goldman-Rakic, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vogt, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vogt, 1993a</xref>) and retrogradely labeled cells were quantified using StereoInvestigator. To normalize for comparison across cases (variability in uptake and transport), we calculated the percentage of total labeled cells that projected from each area to each injection site. These percent scores were independent from the size of each area (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A). The areas were further pooled into major FC regions according to their associated functions. Using the percent scores as the measurement for input strength, projection gradient across injection sites was analyzed for each FC region. Guided by the tracing results, probabilistic tractography was conducted on the NHP and human dMRI. Cortical areas were used as seed masks and the rACC as the target mask. The connectivity strength was determined by the number of streamlines between each target voxel and an FC area, divided by the total number of streamlines from that area to all rACC voxels. A convergent-connectivity value was calculated for each rACC voxel as the sum of connectivity strength weighted by the number of areas with non-zero streamlines. We identified voxels with the highest convergent-connectivity value for each individual subject and compared their locations to the hub region found in tract tracing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Anatomical tracing experiments</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the University Committee on Animal Resources at University of Rochester. Animals were adult male monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> and <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>). Bidirectional tracers were injected into the rACC. Details of the surgical and histological procedures have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Safadi et al., 2018</xref>). Monkeys were first tranquilized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (10 mg/kg) and then maintained anesthetized via 1–3% isoflurane in 100% oxygen. Temperature, heart rate, and respiration were monitored throughout the surgery. Pre-surgery structural MR images were used to locate the stereotaxic coordinates for the injection sites. Monkeys were placed in a David Kopf Instruments stereotax, a craniotomy (2–3 cm) was made over the region of interest, and small dural incisions were made at injection sites. Bidirectional tracers (40–50 μl, 10% in 0.1 mol phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4; Invitrogen) were pressure injected over 10 min using a 0.5 μl Hamilton syringe, separate for each case. Tracers used for the present study were Lucifer Yellow (LY), Fluororuby (FR), or Fluorescein (FS). The tracers were all conjugated to dextran amine (Invitrogen) and had similar transport properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rajakumar et al., 1993</xref>). After each injection, the syringe remained in situ for 20–30 min.</p><p>After a survival period of 12–14 days, monkeys were again deeply anesthetized and perfused with saline, followed by a 4% paraformaldehyde/1.5% sucrose solution in 0.1 mol PB, pH 7.4. Brains were postfixed overnight and cryoprotected in increasing gradients of sucrose (10, 20, and 30%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haber et al., 2006</xref>). Brains were removed and shipped to the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. Diffusion MRI data was collected with the brains submerged in Fomblin solution to eliminate susceptibility artifacts at air-tissue interfaces and background signal (see <italic>dMRI data collection and analysis</italic> for imaging protocols). After imaging, the brains were shipped back to University of Rochester Medical Center for histological processing. Serial sections of 50 μm were cut on a freezing microtome, and one series with sections 1.2 mm-apart was processed for subsequent retrograde tracing. The serial sections were processed free-floating for immunocytochemistry. Tissue was incubated in primary anti-LY (1:3000 dilution; Invitrogen), anti-FS (1:1000; Invitrogen), or anti-FR (1:1000; Invitrogen) in 10% NGS and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PB for 4 nights at 4°C. After extensive rinsing, the tissue was incubated in biotinylated secondary antibody followed by incubation with the avidin-biotin complex solution (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). Immunoreactivity was visualized using standard DAB procedures. Staining was intensified by incubating the tissue for 5–15 s in a solution of 0.05% DAB tetrahydrochloride, 0.025% cobalt chloride, 0.02% nickel ammonium sulfate, and 0.01% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Sections were mounted onto gel-coated slides, dehydrated, defatted in xylene, and coverslipped with Permount. In cases in which more than one tracer was injected into a single animal, adjacent sections were processed for each antibody reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Analysis</title><p><italic>strength of inputs and defining the hub.</italic> Nine out of sixteen injection sites were selected for analysis based on the following criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): 1. location of the injection site along the rACC; 2. lack of tracers leaking into adjacent cortical regions or into the white matter; 3. outstanding retrograde transport; and 4. low background. We evaluated the transport by known and distant connections of the rACC, including the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex and thalamus. Locations 2, 5 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) had overlapping injection sites. Cell labeling patterns were surveyed to ensure similarity between the overlapping sites, and one site from each location (six in total, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was chosen for analysis. In addition, three injection sites close to site 5 were used as controls: 1. a large injection controlled for size; 2. a dorsal bank injection controlled for dorsoventral variability; 3. an injection in the left hemisphere controlled for the variability across studies.

The demarcation and definition of vmPFC vary across studies and can include the medial OFC, medial and ventral part of area 10, and area 25. Moreover, area 10 also contains a dorsal and a lateral component, which together with the medial and ventral parts cover the entire polar region. To maintain cytoarchitectonic consistency in spatial demarcation, we separated area 10 (designated as FP) from vmPFC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Comparison of the inputs to site 4 with the composition of inputs to areas 32 and 24</title><p>Based on the analyses described above, site 4 stood out as having a uniquely diverse input pattern as compared to the other sites. Such connectivity property suggested that site 4 is a hub in the FC-rACC network. However, because site 4 was at the junction of areas 32 and 24, an important question is whether its input pattern could be explained by a composition of inputs to areas 32 and 24. We tested this alternative hypothesis by comparing the connectivity pattern of site 4four with mixtures of the patterns of areas 32 and 24 using the symmetric Kullback-Leibler distance. The percent cell counts for sites 1, 2 and 3 and those for sites 5 and 6 were averaged to represent the input distributions of areas 32 and 24, respectively.

The NHP dMRI data was collected from seven animals in a small-bore 4.7T Bruker BioSpin MRI system, with gradient internal diameter of 116 mm, maximum gradient strength 480 mT/m, and birdcage volume RF coil internal diameter of 72 mm. Two of the animals also had tracer injections (cases 1 and 6). A 3D echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence was used for dMRI with TR = 750 ms, TE = 43 ms, δ = 15 ms, Δ = 19 ms, b<sub>max</sub> = 40,000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, 514 gradient directions, matrix size 96 × 96 × 112, and 0.7 mm isotropic resolution. The human dMRI data used 35 healthy subjects, publicly available as part of the MGH-USC Human Connectome Project (HCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fan et al., 2016</xref>). Both the NHP and human data were preprocessed using FSL 5.0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jenkinson et al., 2012</xref>). Artifacts of head movements and distortions by eddy currents were corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2016</xref>).

Parcellation of the FC areas for NHP followed the same atlas used for tract tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paxinos et al., 2000</xref>). Each FC area was used as a seed, while ACC areas 32 and 24 were combined and used as the target. Twenty-seven seed masks were created correspondent to the 27 FC areas used in the tracing analysis. To generate seed and target masks, areal masks from a template brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calabrese et al., 2015</xref>) were transformed to each individual’s diffusion space via nonlinear registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klein et al., 2010</xref>). Each mask covers 0.14 mm thickness (two voxels) of white matter at the gray-white matter boundary (Figure 7B). Anatomical parcellation of the human cortex was hand drawn on a surface-based template (<italic>fsaverage</italic> by FreeSurfer 4.5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The parcellation followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Petrides et al.

Tractography was performed from each seed mask to the ipsilateral target mask. At each voxel, a sample was drawn from the orientation distribution of the anisotropic compartment with the closest orientation to the previously visited voxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>). To exclude indirect pathways through subcortical structures, the thalamus, the striatum and the amygdala were used as exclusion masks. To measure the connectivity strength between each seed mask and each target voxel, the number of streamlines arriving at the target voxel was divided by the total number of streamlines generated from the seed mask. The convergent-connectivity value was defined as the sum of areas with non-zero streamlines multiplied by the connectivity strength. The final results from all individuals were displayed on a template brain via linear registration (FA image of the template by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calabrese et al., 2015</xref> for NHP, T1-weighted image of the MNI152 template for human).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Overview</title><p>Injection sites were labeled 1–6 based on the spatial order of their locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We found that the labeling of cortical areas in cases that overlapped with sites 2, 5 and 6 were consistent with these three sites. Specifically, we did not observe FC areas that contained labeled cells in the non-selected cases but not in the selected cases, or the reverse. Sites 1–3 were in area 32 and ordered from caudal to rostral (FR, LY and FS, respectively). Site 4 (FR) was in the transition zone between areas 32 and 24. Sites 5 (LY) and 6 (FR) were in area 24. There were three control cases, 5a (FR), 5b (FS) and 5c (LY). Case 5a was particularly large, located in area 24, and overlapped extensively with site 5. This case served as a control for the variability of injection size. Injection 5b was in the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus above area 24. It was analyzed to determine the variability of inputs to the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus. Injection 5c was in the left hemisphere caudal to site 5. This case matched most closely with a case previously reported in the literature and therefore was used to compare our general findings with previously reported data. All cases showed dense labeling in areas 23, 29 and 30, and the AV, VA and MD nucleus in the thalamus. Such labeling demonstrated efficient transport. Following quantification of the cell labeling into percent counts, we found that the sites differed with respect to projection strength from various FC areas. The results demonstrated three projection patterns across sites: 1. a decrease in the input strength to sites 1–6 from FP and vmPFC; 2. an increase in the input strength to sites 1–6 from FEF and premotor cortex; and 3. a non-monotonic gradient centered on site 4 with the input strength from dlPFC, dmPFC and vlPFC increasing to sites 1–4 and decreasing to sites 4–6. Taken together these data showed that site 4 received inputs from the greatest number of FC areas. Site 4 also contained the most regionally diverse inputs compared to the other sites. Finally, consistent with the tracing results, dMRI tractography in NHP and human showed convergent probabilistic tracts from the FC to an rACC region in close proximity to site 4.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Projection patterns from the FC areas to the rACC</title><p>Not all FC regions project equally to the rACC. Overall, retrogradely labeled cells in cases 1–3 were primarily located in more rostral regions of the FC, while those in cases 4–6 were primarily in more caudal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Case 1 showed high concentration of labeled cells at the rostral pole of the medial PFC. However, at more caudal levels, the concentration of labeled cells was located primarily ventrally, with few labeled cells in areas 9L and 9/32. In addition, there were clusters of labeled cells located in a caudal OFC area OPro. Similarly, in cases 2 and 3, labeled cells were concentrated rostrally in FP and vmPFC regions. However, some clusters with a few labeled cells were also located more dorsally in area 9L and caudally in the lateral OFC. In contrast to case 1, additional labeled cells were found in the vlPFC (areas 47L and 47O). Case 4 showed a diverse pattern to the distribution of labeled cells, with a clear increase of dense clusters of labeled cells located in dorsal regions. At the most rostral level, labeled cells were concentrated in FP. At more caudal levels, labeled cells were extensively distributed in dlPFC, vlPFC, ventromedial OFC and vmPFC. An additional cluster of labeled cells was also found in area OPro. Case 5 resulted in labeled cells concentrated ventrally, primarily in the caudal part of orbital and medial regions, although scattered clusters of labeled cells were also located rostrally in the FP and dorsally in area 9L. Finally, labeled cells in case 6 were primarily distributed in caudal dorsal regions, in area 8 and premotor cortex. Only very few labeled cells were found in ventral or rostral regions.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43761.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Retrogradely labeled cells (red) in cases 1–6.</title><p>Each column contains rostral to caudal coronal sections from one case.

To measure the degree-centrality of each site, we identified the number of areas that contributed to 50% and 75% of total inputs. This number varied extensively across sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). At site 1, only two areas, 25 and 10M accounted for 50% of the total inputs. Inputs from areas 10L and OPro accounted for an additional 25%, for a total of four areas comprising 75% of all inputs to site 1. Similarly, two areas, 10L and 10M contributed 50% of total inputs to site 2, and two areas 25 and 46 accounted for an additional 25%, for a total of four areas comprising 75% of all inputs to site 2. At site 3, three areas 25, 46 and 47O contributed 50% of the total inputs, with three additional areas 9L, 10L and 11 (the additional 25%) for a total of six areas comprising 75% of all inputs to site 3. In contrast to sites 1–3, site 4 received 50% of the total inputs from five FC areas 9L, 47O, 9M, OPro and 46. Five areas, 9/32, 14O, 14M, 8B and 9/46D, contributed the additional 25%, for a total of ten areas comprising 75% of all inputs to site 4. More consistent with sites 1 and 2, site 5 received 50% of its inputs from only two areas, OPro and 47O. Four areas, 13, 10M, 25 and 9L contributed the remaining 25%, for a total of six areas comprising 75% of all inputs to site 5. Finally, three areas, 6L, 6/32 and 9/46V, contributed 50% of total inputs to site 6. Five areas, 8B, 6M, 8A, ProM and 8/32 contributed an additional 25%, for a total of eight areas comprising 75% of all inputs to site 6.

The third mode was a nonmonotonic gradient with a single peak at site 4, related to the dlPFC, vlPFC, and dmPFC projections. In the first trend, vmPFC and FP contributed to more than 15% of inputs to sites 1 and 2,~10% to site 3, just under 5% to sites 4 and 5, and close to 0% to site 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The between-site difference was statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis <italic>H</italic> = 10.48, p&lt;0.02). This trend indicated a decrease in projection strength of vmPFC and FP along a gradient from site 1 to 6. In contrast, the second trend demonstrated an increase of projection strength from site 1 to 6 of inputs from premotor cortex and FEF. These regions projected strongly to site 6, but weakly to the other sites. Indeed, the average contribution of an area in these regions was less than 1% to the inputs to sites 1–3,~2% to sites 4 and 5, and more than 5% to site 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The between-site difference was also statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis <italic>H</italic> = 35.46, p&lt;1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). Unlike projections from FP and vmPFC, this trend was less evenly distributed along a gradient from sites 1–6, as the projections are concentrated in site 6.

To test whether the projection patterns found above were robust against the variability of 1. injection size, 2. sites above and below the cingulate sulcus, and 3. data reported here and from the literature, we analyzed three additional cases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Projection patterns of the control cases</title><p>All three control sites were located close to site 5.

However, despite the greater number of overall labeled cells, the degree-centrality of site 5a was similar to that of site 5. Site 5a received 50% of its inputs from two areas, 13 and 47O.

It showed the highest number of areas that contributed 50% and 75% of its inputs; these areas were distributed among the highest number of FC regions. Moreover, site 4 was in the intermediate zone of two projection gradients and was the peak center of a third gradient. These connectivity patterns suggested that site 4 is a hub in the FC-rACC network. However, because site 4 was at the junction of areas 32 and 24, an important question was whether its input pattern could be explained by a composition of inputs to areas 32 and 24. If the projection pattern changed gradually from areas 32 to 24, then the strength of the major FC projections to site 4 would fall between the strength of these FC projections to areas 32 and 24. Moreover, if the projection pattern of site 4 was a composition of inputs to areas 32 and 24 but one area contributed more than the other, then this inequality should be present consistently across FC areas. In other words, one would expect to see a closer and consistent approximation of projection strength between site 4 and either area 32 or 24. We tested these possibilities with additional analyses.</p><p>We compared the strength of projections to site 4 with the average strength of projections to area 32 (averaged percent scores of sites 1–3) and those to area 24 (averaged percent scores of sites 5 and 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Areas 14O, 11, 47L, 9/46D, 9L, 9M, 9/32 and 8A showed stronger projections to site 4 than to either area 32 or 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Moreover, 14 out of the 27 FC areas showed more similar projection strength between site 4 and area 24 than site 4 and area 32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We further compared the projection pattern of site 4 with different weighted averages of the connection patterns of areas 32 and 24. In the test for linear combinations, the similarity between normalized connectivity patterns was measured by the symmetric Kullback-Leibler distance. The best fit to site 4 was a combination of approximately 2/3 of area 24 and 1/3 area 32. However, the distance measures were indistinguishable from a situation where we replaced one of the two areas’ connectivity patterns with a uniform distribution over the FC areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In addition, the optimum mixture was inconsistent across the different FC areas. In many cases the connectivity of site 4 was higher/lower than predicted by the weighted average model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). These results demonstrated that the input pattern of site 4 was not a simple linear mixture of the patterns of areas 32 and 24. To test non-linear mixtures of areas 32 and 24, we generated 1000 mixed patterns using randomly sampled, varying weights across FC areas. We compared the degree-centrality and entropy between the mixed pattern and the pattern of site 4. Among the 1000 random samples, only 38 showed five or more FC areas contributing 50% inputs (&quot;degree-centrality at 50%&quot;), and 63 showed 10 or more FC areas contributing 75% inputs (&quot;degree-centrality at 75%&quot;). Moreover, only 117 of the 1000 samples showed greater entropy than that of site 4. In contrast, when we replaced one of the two areas’ connectivity patterns with a uniform distribution, more than 600 samples showed degree-centrality ≥5 at 50%, and more than 900 showed degree-centrality ≥10 at 75%. More than 900 samples showed greater entropy than that of site 4. Thus, the hub properties of site 4 was better predicted by the mixture with a uniform distribution than the combination of patterns of areas 32 and 24. Taken together, these results suggested that the hub properties of site 4 did not occur due to the mixing of connectivity patterns of areas 32 and 24.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43761.013</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Comparison of projections to site 4 with those to areas 32 and 24.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Projection strength across FC areas.

Site 4 was in the intermediate transition zone of two projection gradients across the six sites. It was also at the peak center of a third, nonmonotonic, gradient. Together with the degree-centrality, these connectivity patterns suggested that site 4 is a hub within the rACC. The dMRI tractography in the NHP demonstrated that streamlines from the FC converged in a location comparable to site 4. Using the same tractography methods in human, we found that streamlines from FC also converge in a similar position in the human rACC. Thus, using a cross-species, multimodal approach we located a hub in the rACC in NHPs and, in a similar position, a likely hub in human rACC.</p><p>Qualitatively, our results were overall consistent to previous studies in the literature that demonstrated vmPFC, dlPFC and caudal OFC projections to the rACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vogt and Pandya, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbas and Pandya, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carmichael and Price, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbas and Pandya, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morecraft et al., 2012</xref>).

Although the published data appeared to have a greater number of labeled cells, both cases showed similar labeling patterns. When we quantified the results and tested for the degree-centrality, the results showed that 50% of the inputs to site 5 c were derived from only three areas. This analysis demonstrated the importance of quantification for determining the relative strength for connections.

There are three major divisions of the ACC in NHPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morecraft and Tanji, 2009</xref>): the sACC (area 25), the pregenual ACC (pACC, area 32 and rostral part of area 24) and the midcingulate (caudal part of area 24). The pACC together with the rostral part of the midcingulate is also referred to as the dACC. In human neuroimaging studies, the definition is less precise. Different from the NHP terminology, the human dACC does not include parts of the pACC but only the rostral part of the midcingulate. The pACC is often referred to as the rACC. To avoid confusion, in this study we use rACC to refer to pACC in both NHPs and humans.</p><p>An important issue is whether the hub is in a homologous region within the rACC. We base our assessment on the surface features and cytoarchitecture of the ACC. The cytoarchitectonic regions of the human cingulate cortex have been found broadly consistent with the NHP region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vogt, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vogt et al., 1995</xref>). The two areas in this study, 32 and 24, occupy the genu of the cingulate cortex in both species. The hub region found by tract tracing was at the conjunction of NHP areas 32 and 24. In human, this conjunction region is located at the rostral-most edge of the cingulate sulcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vogt et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, using this surface feature as guidance, we compared the human dMRI result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) with a human brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mai et al., 2008</xref>) to verify that the highest convergent connectivity was near the conjunction of areas 32 and 24.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Translation of results between species via dMRI</title><p>Comparing two connectivity modalities (tracing and dMRI) in different species (NHP and humans) is problematic. We therefore first compared the tracing results with dMRI scans in NHPs, two of which were in the same animals that received the tracer injection. This comparison was central for determining how accurately the dMRI method was able to replicate the anatomic findings. The most direct way to compare the methods was to place the dMRI seeds at the location of each injection site and follow the streamlines to the FC. The results showed that streamlines from these seeds could not be followed to the cortical areas, but rather remained within the cingulum bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). This problem was due to the fact that fibers are highly aligned in the cingulum bundle along the anterior-posterior axis. Consequently, the diffusion signals were strongly anisotropic towards the anterior-posterior direction, while being disproportionately weak in the other directions. Thus, streamlines from the ACC seeds had very low probability of leaving the cingulum bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A &amp; B</xref>). The low number of streamlines reaching different FC areas resulted in low statistical power for measuring the connectivity pattern. To address this problem, we placed seeds in the FC areas which resulted in sufficient number of streamlines that correctly reached the ACC target. The connection strength calculated from these streamlines showed a better match with the projection strength from the tracing data than the results with seeds in the ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>The characterization of a network hub by anatomical projection patterns</title><p>While the concept of hubs emerged in early discussions of brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mesulam, 1990</xref>), recent advances of network analysis have formalized the definition of hubs using graph theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sporns, 2011</xref>). Theoretically, a hub is the node of the highest degree in a network, that is. with unusually high connections with the other nodes. In modularized networks as those in the brain, the hub facilitates communication between functional modules. Neuroimaging studies have identified the rACC as a hub of the brain’s global network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagmann et al., 2008</xref>). However, the rACC is a large region under the scope of anatomical analysis. Anatomical inputs vary across subregions within the rACC. The hub-like connectivity observed in neuroimaging studies may simply reflect the sum of connections over all of rACC’s subregions. The question is then whether a hub exists as a confined subregion within the rACC.</p><p>In this study, site 4 showed two defining features of a hub: high degree-centrality and a position in the network that could facilitate cross-module integration. High degree-centrality was reflected by the number of areas with strong projections to this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). To demonstrate cross-module integration, we defined functional modules in an empirical manner. The standard graph theory definition requires all-to-all connectivity measured between FC areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sporns, 2011</xref>). However, this approach is impractical with tract tracing experiments. We used functional regions of the FC to approximate functional modules. Site 4 marked the most integrative zone in the rACC where inputs from the largest number of functional regions converge: 1. Site 4 was in the central location of two projection gradients. One is formed by inputs from vmPFC and FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These were regions associated with emotion and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joyce and Barbas, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Piray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tsujimoto et al., 2010</xref>). They had the strongest inputs to sites 1–3, less so to sites 4 and 5, and the least to site 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Inputs from the FEF and the premotor cortex were part of the second gradient. These were motor control regions that had the strongest projections to site 6, less so to sites 4 and 5, and the least to sites 1–3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). At each end of the two gradients, the inputs were predominantly associated with emotion- and motor-related functions, respectively. Site 4 was in the intermediate transitioning zone of both gradients. Input strengths were more similar between gradients at this site. 2. A third gradient peaked at site 4. Input strength from regions associated with cognition gradually increased from site 1–4 and decreased from site 4–6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This peak of inputs at site 4 positioned this site to maximally interface inputs between cognition, emotion and motor control. Therefore, site 4 enables communication between all three functional modalities. Together with the high degree-centrality, the integrative nature of site 4four suggests that it is a hub in the frontal cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>A hub or inputs reflecting the junction of two cytoarchitectural areas? </title><p>An alternative to the hub hypothesis is that site 4 was at the border of areas 32 and 24, and thus, its diverse inputs could be a result of a composition of inputs to areas 32 and 24. The analyses of projection strength across FC areas and the spatial distribution of labeled cells argue against this alternative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). 1. If the inputs to site 4 were a composition of the inputs to areas 32 and 24, there would be none or few of the frontal areas projecting to site 4 with higher or lower strength than their projections to both areas 32 and 24. In contrast, we found 8 FC areas that showed stronger projections to site 4 than to either area 32 or 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). 2. The ‘composition’ hypothesis indicates that the strength of projections to site 4 would be consistently more similar to that of one cytoarchitectonic area than the other, depending on which area site 4 covers more extensively. However, we found this similarity random, that is about a half of the FC areas projecting with similar strength to site 4 and area 32 than site 4 and area 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). 3. The ‘composition’ hypothesis also indicates that the strength of projections to site 4 would be predicted by a weighted average of the connectivity patterns of areas 32 and 24. In the linear mixing analysis, although a model with 1/3 of the pattern of area 32 and 2/3 or the pattern of 24 was a better fit to site 4 than either area on its own, such fit was indistinguishable from mixing either area with a uniform distribution of connections to the FC areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In addition, the optimal mixture was variable across the FC areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In the non-linear mixing analysis, the combined input patters of areas 32 and 24 poorly predicted the degree-centrality and entropy of site 4. Such predictions were better when using a mixture of either area and a uniform distribution. 4. In the reconstructed 3D model of the retrogradely labeled cells, site 4 showed a high number of cells in the caudal dlPFC and the principal sulcus, which were only sparsely covered by cells projecting to the neighboring sites 3 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Thus, the connectivity profile of site 4 cannot be explained by a composition of connectivity profiles of its neighboring sites. Based on the collective results, we propose that inputs to site 4 are best understood via the high degree-centrality and cross-domain functional integration at site 4. This cannot be predicted by the location of this site among the cytoarchitectonic areas.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Methodological limitations</title><p>A main limitation of the current study is that experiments were performed in different animals. It is therefore difficult to assess individual variability of the input patterns for each site. Ideally, each animal would receive tracer injections along the rACC and this would be repeated across several animals. Unfortunately, technically this would be difficult to accomplish without, for example, tracer contamination. A second limitation is that the analyses cannot completely exclude the possibility that within-region microcircuitry heterogeneity leads to the observed patterns of a hub. The microstructure of a region between two cytoarchitectonic areas might involve a complex spatial composition of neurons from each area. The inputs to these neurons form heterogeneous microcirctuitries that are not visible in the tracing experiments. Thus, when observed as a whole, the region containing these neurons may appear as a hub.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Implications for ACC functions</title><p>The rACC hub provides an alternative view to the dichotomous interpretation of ACC functions, such that emotional and cognitive influences affect the ventral and dorsal ACC separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bush et al., 2000</xref>). Classically, the ventral ACC is attributed with ‘limbic’ functions, for example visceral responses, emotion, and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Etkin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mayberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Papez, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vogt et al., 1992</xref>). The dorsal ACC is linked with executive control, typically for choosing from conflicting actions and monitoring behavioral outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Botvinick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holroyd and Coles, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">MacDonald et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pardo et al., 1990</xref>). However, this coarse dichotomy cannot entirely account for the complex activation patterns of the ACC across an increasing body of experiments. Recent theories have acknowledged the influence of reward and economic evaluation on the executive component of the dorsal ACC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botvinick and Braver, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kolling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shenhav et al., 2016</xref>), even though reward processing is classically thought of as a ventral ACC/vmPFC function. The effect of cognitive regulation over emotion in the rostral/ventral ACC has also been addressed in the literature on fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Etkin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klumpp et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The rACC hub suggests an alternative view on the functions of ACC subregions. In contrast to associating each subregion with one function to support serial computation, the ACC may be better understood through the functional integration by its subregions. Neuroimaging studies have reported high degree of structural and functional connectivity between the rACC and the rest of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagmann et al., 2008</xref>). While such studies often treated the rACC as a single large region, our results demonstrate that the integration can be carried out in a precise subregion. Site 4 is not simply a conjunction between the ventral and dorsal ACC, but a hub that routes information across functional modules. The inputs to the hub contain strong projections from vlPFC, dlPFC and dmPFC. These regions are critical for higher cognition, such as social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stalnaker et al., 2015</xref>), decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kable and Levy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sakagami and Pan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wallis, 2007</xref>), learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atlas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schuck et al., 2016</xref>), attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Uddin, 2015</xref>) and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D'Esposito and Postle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>). Thus, the hub can route the outputs of higher cognitive functions to emotion and executive processing within the ventral and dorsal ACC. The hub may be uniquely positioned for evaluating and arbitrating between these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013</xref>). The detailed mechanisms may be further investigated through connections of the hub and the other subregions of the ACC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Potential hubs in other subregions of the rACC</title><p>The results in this study did not suggest that only one hub exists in the rACC. Despite the advantage of measuring projection strength at cellular level, this study – and generally tract tracing studies – have a limited number of cases. Unlike neuroimaging studies that can identify all hubs in the global network of the brain, we can only test for hub locations among the available injection sites. Thus, the experiment did not exhaustively cover the all ACC regions. It is possible, therefore, that additional hubs are located elsewhere. The dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus at the rostro-caudal level between sites 5 and six is a region of particular interest as it is often the site for NHP electrophysiology experiments. These studies demonstrate the functional diversity of this region. To determine whether this area had the characteristics of a hub, we analyzed case 5b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We found that 50% of the inputs to site 5b were contributed by 4 areas and 3 FC regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A &amp; B</xref>, right panel). The degree-centrality measured by FC regions was similar between site 5b and sites 1, 2 and 6. Although site 5b is unlikely to be a hub, it showed connectional heterogeneity with strong inputs from both vlPFC and premotor areas. This heterogeneity is consistent with findings in our other cases and in other cytoarchitectonic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luppino and Rizzolatti, 2000</xref>), where inputs are derived from more than one functional region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Implications on the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders</title><p>From a network perspective, most psychiatric disorders are seen as a consequence of network imbalance rather than localized deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Menon, 2011</xref>). This view conforms with and extends the disconnection hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Catani and ffytche, 2005</xref>): Damage to a hub region can cause disconnection between a wide range of functional modalities, and correspondingly, a spectrum of affective and cognitive disorders. The disconnection hypothesis is in line with the broadly observed rACC abnormality in various diseases, including major depression disorder (MDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mayberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pizzagalli, 2011</xref>), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beucke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tadayonnejad et al., 2018</xref>), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tomasi and Volkow, 2012</xref>), and posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kennis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patel et al., 2012</xref>). Based on the FC areas sending convergent inputs to the hub, dysconnectivity with the hub may be involved in the imbalance between goal directed control, emotion and higher cognition in these disorders. MDD and OCD both show treatment response in the rACC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chakrabarty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fullana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mayberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Neill and Schultz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pizzagalli, 2011</xref>). The distinction in their pathophysiology lies in the type of networks involved: MDD engages the networks for self-reference and cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pizzagalli, 2011</xref>), while OCD engages those for reward-driven and goal-directed behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Milad and Rauch, 2012</xref>). The hub connects a majority of FC areas involved in the above networks, which makes it a site prone to damage in both disorders. The precise pattern of its anatomical connections provides important information for testing the disorder-specific disconnections.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The anatomic tracing studies and dMRI analyses were supported by NIH/NIMH grants MH106435, MH045573 and U01-MH109589, and the UK Medical Research Council grant MR/L009013/1.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Badre, as Reviewing Editor, and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision based on the reviewers' summary and comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors studied the inputs to six 'rostral anterior cingulate cortical' (rACC) areas with injection of tracers in two species of macaque monkeys and mapped the origin of projections from the frontal cortex. They then compared the data with findings obtained from diffusion MRI in monkeys and humans, using the injection sites as seeds to study pathways. They identified a non-monotonic connectional gradient and concluded that one site within rACC (their site 4) receives strong input from more areas than the rest, and so is a connectional hub.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers saw considerable value in this study. If verified, the gradient of connectivity and &quot;hubness&quot; of rACC would be an important and novel finding. Furthermore, there was an appreciation of the use of convergent methods between high resolution tracing and diffusion tractography for cross-species comparison.</p><p>However, the reviewers were also in agreement about the primary weakness of the study: The number of injections was highly limited and so this has left open several alternatives to a hub in rACC. For example, beyond some basic methodological concerns, there could be sites in the caudal regions left untested, such as dorsal ones, that would show a similar hub-like pattern, or there could be more than one region being conflated in what is being called rACC (site 4). Thus, the overall consensus was that more injections are needed in order to draw the broad conclusion that rACC is a connectional hub. Here are specific concerns along these lines from reviewers:</p><p>1) Three different tracers are used in the study, but it was not indicated which was injected where. Could the findings of strong labeling in more areas after a single injection in site 4 be attributed to a more efficient tracer, better uptake at the injection site, or a stronger antibody used in the processing of the tissue in each case? With one case per site and missing methodological detail, it is not possible to accept such a broad conclusion.</p><p>2) The conclusion that only one site in the cingulate cortex is a connectional hub is based on injection sites located mainly in the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus (sites 5 and 6), whereas the site in rACC covers both the ventral and dorsal banks. Although it has been suggested that the fundus of the cingulate sulcus might be the dorsal limit of the cingulate cortex (Vogt et al., 2005), this dorsal limit has been challenged. There is functional and anatomical evidence that the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus belongs to the cingulate cortex (see Procyk et al., 2016 for review). For example, all electrophysiological studies demonstrating activity related to cognitive control and performance monitoring have recorded within the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus in monkey. So, can the authors exclude that another hub may exist in the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus (posteriorly to site 4, for example at the level of sites 5 and 6)?</p><p>3) Site 4 was at the intersection of areas 24 and 32 and sites 1-3 and 5-6 are located in areas 32 and 24, respectively (Results, first paragraph). Is it relevant that the injection in site 4 involves 2 areas and thus appears as a hub? The control case is intended to demonstrate that it is the location and not the size of the injection that matters, but the control case involves more posterior areas with less diverse profiles and number of connections. The fact that site 4 involves both areas 32 and 24 possess a problem since its &quot;hubness&quot; might be the result of the convolution of the connectivity profile of the two sites (3 and 5) with a high number of connections and diversity of connectivity profiles as Figure 4 indicates. The arguments against such an interpretation (subsection “Input patterns vs. cytoarchitectonic patterns”) are unconvincing. The first one does not provide evidence against the aforementioned interpretation. The second one assumes a simple sum of the connectivity profiles of two areas. But, this assumption is not necessary since there is connectional heterogeneity within areas (see for instance Luppino et al. work for the frontal cortex). In other words, there is not pure addition of connectivity profiles.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A connectional hub in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex links areas of emotion and cognitive control&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor, David Badre as the Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>One of the main points raised previously was the claim that the &quot;hubness&quot; of site 4 could not reflect an injection involving 2 areas, that is, area 24 and 32. Though the control provided rules out an additive version of this account, there may be reason to doubt additivity of connectivity. Thus, reviewer 3 has suggested a set of additional control analyses to fully rule out this concern. These are appended in this reviewer's comments below. Reviewer 1 also has a suggestion regarding the strength of the conclusions that you should consider in your revision.

If verified, the gradient of connectivity and &quot;hubness&quot; of rACC would be an important and novel finding. Furthermore, there was an appreciation of the use of convergent methods between high resolution tracing and diffusion tractography for cross-species comparison.</p><p>However, the reviewers were also in agreement about the primary weakness of the study: The number of injections was highly limited and so this has left open several alternatives to a hub in rACC. For example, beyond some basic methodological concerns, there could be sites in the caudal regions left untested, such as dorsal ones, that would show a similar hub-like pattern, or there could be more than one region being conflated in what is being called rACC (site 4). Thus, the overall consensus was that more injections are needed in order to draw the broad conclusion that rACC is a connectional hub. Here are specific concerns along these lines from reviewers:</p><p>1) Three different tracers are used in the study, but it was not indicated which was injected where. Could the findings of strong labeling in more areas after a single injection in site 4 be attributed to a more efficient tracer, better uptake at the injection site, or a stronger antibody used in the processing of the tissue in each case? With one case per site and missing methodological detail, it is not possible to accept such a broad conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The tracers injected into sites 1–6 are: FR, LY, FS, FR, LY and FR, respectively. The experimental design took into account the variability of tracer efficiency, uptake level and antibody reactivity, described below in detail. The findings of extensive labeling of an injection into site 4 could not be attributed to these factors.</p><p>First, the type of tracers is randomized among cases. Sites 1, 4 and 6 were injected with FR. In contrast to site 4, site 1 showed the most limited labeling among all six cases, with the fewest areas contributing to 50% of its inputs (Figures 3 and 4). Thus, the tracer FR is not more or less efficient than LY or FS. Moreover, this is consistent with our experience with these tracers. Our entire database of injection sites in non-human primates includes 54 cortical injections of LY, 34 of FR, and 29 of FS, all with outstanding transport. We find similar transport results regardless of the tracer used. We have included the tracer information for each site in the revised Results “Overview<italic>”</italic>.</p><p>Second, although uptake and transport are difficult to quantify, the extensive labeling of case 4 is unlikely to be attributed to these factors for the following reasons: 1) All tracers were conjugated to dextran amine (provided by Invitrogen) to optimize the transport and stability (subsection “Anatomical tracing experiments”, first paragraph) (Rajakumar et al., 1993). 2) Prior to selecting a case for analysis, we first assessed its transport to their known and distant connections, including the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex and the thalamus. All cases showed dense labeling in areas 23, 29 and 30, and in the AV, VA and MD nucleus in the thalamus. We have included additional details of the qualitative assessment in the revised Materials and methods and Results (subsection “Analysis: strength of inputs and defining the hub”, first paragraph; Results subsection “Overview”). 3) If the uptake level was particularly high in a case, it would result in a greater large number of labeled cells in that case. We did not observe that for case 4 compared with the other cases (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B). 4) Importantly, if that had occurred, it would not affect the relative numerosity of labeled cells across areas. The input strength to each site is measured by the percentage of labeled cells to take into account possible variability of uptake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusion that only one site in the cingulate cortex is a connectional hub is based on injection sites located mainly in the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus (sites 5 and 6), whereas the site in rACC covers both the ventral and dorsal banks. Although it has been suggested that the fundus of the cingulate sulcus might be the dorsal limit of the cingulate cortex (Vogt et al., 2005), this dorsal limit has been challenged. There is functional and anatomical evidence that the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus belongs to the cingulate cortex (see Procyk et al., 2016 for review). For example, all electrophysiological studies demonstrating activity related to cognitive control and performance monitoring have recorded within the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus in monkey. So, can the authors exclude that another hub may exist in the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus (posteriorly to site 4, for example at the level of sites 5 and 6)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there may be more than one hub within the ACC region. It was not our intention to conclude that site 4 is the only hub in the ACC. As suggested by the reviewers, we examined an injection site (control case 5b) in the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus at the level between sites 5 and 6. The degree-centrality measured by the number of regions was similar between site 5b and sites 1, 2 and 6. The limited degree-centrality of site 5b did not support the hypothesis that this site in the dorsal bank is a hub. The location and photo micrograph of site 5b have been added to Figure 1A and B. The stereology results have been included in the revised Results, “Projection patterns of the control cases”. Figure 7 has been updated accordingly.</p><p>We have included additional discussion of this new result and the possibility of other hub sites in the ACC:</p><p>“Potential hubs in other subregions of the rACC. The results in this study did not suggest that only one hub exists in the rACC. […] This heterogeneity is consistent with findings in our other cases and in other cytoarchitectonic areas (Luppino and Rizzolatti, 2000), where inputs are derived from more than one functional region.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Site 4 was at the intersection of areas 24 and 32 and sites 1-3 and 5-6 are located in areas 32 and 24, respectively (Results, first paragraph). Is it relevant that the injection in site 4 involves 2 areas and thus appears as a hub? The control case is intended to demonstrate that it is the location and not the size of the injection that matters, but the control case involves more posterior areas with less diverse profiles and number of connections. The fact that site 4 involves both areas 32 and 24 possess a problem since its &quot;hubness&quot; might be the result of the convolution of the connectivity profile of the two sites (3 and 5) with a high number of connections and diversity of connectivity profiles as Figure 4 indicates. The arguments against such an interpretation (subsection “Input patterns vs. cytoarchitectonic patterns”) are unconvincing. The first one does not provide evidence against the aforementioned interpretation. The second one assumes a simple sum of the connectivity profiles of two areas. But, this assumption is not necessary since there is connectional heterogeneity within areas (see for instance Luppino et al. work for the frontal cortex). In other words, there is not pure addition of connectivity profiles.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated functional and connectional heterogeneity within cytoarchitectonic areas (e.g. Luppino and Rizzolatti, 2000). Our results from case 5b (dorsal bank site) showed such heterogeneity in that it received inputs from both vlPFC and premotor areas. However, its degree-centrality did not suggest a hub. To address the issue more robustly, we performed additional analyses to examine: (1) whether the inputs to site 4 can be accounted for by a composition of the connectivity profiles of the cytoarchitectonic areas 32 and 24, and (2) whether the spatial pattern of inputs to site 4 is a composition of those of its neighboring sites 3 and 5. The results suggested “no” to both scenarios.</p><p>If the projection pattern changes gradually from areas 32 to 24, then the strength of the major FC projections to site 4 would fall between the strength of these FC projections to areas 32 and 24. Moreover, if the input pattern of site 4 was a composition of inputs to areas 32 and 24 but one area contributed more than the other, then this inequality should be present consistently across FC areas. In other words, one would expect to see a closer approximation of projection strength between site 4 and either area 32 or 24 but consistently across all FC areas.</p><p>To test these predictions, we compared the strength of projections to site 4 with the average strength of projections to area 32 (averaged percent scores of sites 1–3) and those to area 24 (averaged percent scores of sites 5 and 6). We found that 8 areas, 14O, 11, 47L, 9/46D, 9L, 9M, 9/32 and 8A showed stronger projections to site 4 than to either area 32 or 24 (updated Figure 8A). Moreover, 14 out of the 27 FC areas showed more similar projection strength between site 4 and area 24 than site 4 and area 32 (Figure 8A). The 14/27 ratio indicates that the similarity between site 4 and area 32 or 24 was not consistent across FC areas but a random pattern. These observations do not support the above predictions of the “composition” hypothesis.</p><p>We further compared the projection pattern of site 4 with different weighted averages of the connection patterns of areas 32 and 24. We used the symmetric Kullback-Leibler distance as a measure of similarity between the normalized connectivity patterns. The best fit to site 4 was a combination of approximately 2/3 of area 24 and 1/3 area 32. However, the distance measures were indistinguishable from a situation where we have replaced one of the two areas’ connectivity patterns with a uniform distribution over the FC areas (Figure 8B). In addition, the optimum mixture was inconsistent across different FC areas, and in many samples of different weights the connectivity of site 4 was higher/lower than predicted by the weighted average model (Figure 8C). This inconsistency shows that site 4 connectivity is not a simple linear mixture of the input patterns of areas 32 and 24.</p><p>In the second analysis, we compared the spatial patterns of labeled cells across sites 3, 4 and 5. In the reconstructed 3D model of the retrogradely labeled cells (Figure 8D), site 4 showed a high number of cells in the caudal dlPFC and the principal sulcus, which were only sparsely covered by cells projecting to the neighboring sites 3 and 5. This result argues against the alternative interpretation of the &quot;hubness&quot; of site 4, that it is a result of the convolution of the connectivity profile of the two neighboring sites.</p><p>Details of this analysis are included in the updated Materials and methods:</p><p>“Comparison of the inputs to site 4 with a composition of inputs to areas 32 and 24. Based on the analyses described above, site 4 stands out as having a uniquely diverse input pattern as compared to the other sites[…] <italic>P<sub>s4</sub>(a</italic>) is the probability composed of <italic>P<sub>32</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>24</sub></italic> with weight <italic>w</italic> (0 ≤ <italic>w</italic> ≤ 1).”</p><p>The method for 3D reconstruction is described as follows:</p><p>“For each case, the stack of 2D coronal charts from StereoInvestigator were imported into IMOD, a 3D rendering program (Boulder laboratory for 3D Electron Microscopy). […] The 3D model of each case was then merged through spatial alignment to our in-house template brain as previously described (Haber et al., 2006).”</p><p>The results described above are added to the Results section. Discussion of these results is added as follows:</p><p>“A hub or inputs reflecting the junction of two cytoarchitectural areas?An alternative to the hub hypothesis is that site 4 was at the border of areas 32 and 24, and thus, its diverse inputs could be a result of a composition of inputs to areas 32 and 24. […] This cannot be predicted by the location of this site among the cytoarchitectonic areas.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>One of the main points raised previously was the claim that the &quot;hubness&quot; of site 4 could not reflect an injection involving 2 areas, that is, area 24 and 32. Though the control provided rules out an additive version of this account, there may be reason to doubt additivity of connectivity. Thus, reviewer 3 has suggested a set of additional control analyses to fully rule out this concern. These are appended in this reviewer's comments below. Reviewer 1 also has a suggestion regarding the strength of the conclusions that you should consider in your revision. In discussion, the reviewers were in agreement that both of these points should be addressed. Thus, I send this back to you for additional revision.

Thus, the degree and entropy of site 4 were better predicted by the mixture with a uniform distribution than the combination of areas 32 and 24.
