Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate-like T cells enriched in mucosal tissues that recognize bacterial ligands. We investigated MAIT cells during clinical and experimental sepsis, and their contribution to host responses. In experimental sepsis, MAIT-deficient mice had significantly increased mortality and bacterial load, and reduced tissue-specific cytokine responses. MAIT cells of WT mice expressed lower levels of IFN-γ and IL-17a during sepsis compared to sham surgery, changes not seen in non-MAIT T cells. MAIT cells of patients at sepsis presentation were significantly reduced in frequency compared to healthy donors, and were more activated, with decreased IFN-γ production, compared to both healthy donors and paired 90-day samples. Our data suggest that MAIT cells are highly activated and become dysfunctional during clinical sepsis, and contribute to tissue-specific cytokine responses that are protective against mortality during experimental sepsis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>MAIT cells</kwd><kwd>innate-like T cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI130378</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leung</surname><given-names>Daniel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL092161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rondina</surname><given-names>Matthew T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG040631</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rondina</surname><given-names>Matthew T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG048022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rondina</surname><given-names>Matthew T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TL1TR002540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Labuz</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG008962</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Cole P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007747</institution-id><institution>University of Utah</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3i Initiative Seed Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hale</surname><given-names>J Scott</given-names></name><name><surname>Rondina</surname><given-names>Matthew T</given-names></name><name><surname>Leung</surname><given-names>Daniel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, highly activated and dysfunctional in sepsis patients, contribute to tissue-specific cytokine responses that are protective against mortality during experimental sepsis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by dysregulated host responses to infection resulting in organ dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singer et al., 2016</xref>). It is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 5.3 million deaths annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fleischmann et al., 2016</xref>). Sepsis is characterized by a systemic acute pathologic hyper-inflammatory response and an opposing anti-inflammatory response that can occur concurrently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gentile et al., 2012</xref>). Hallmarks of sepsis include a decreased ability to eliminate primary pathogens and an increased susceptibility to secondary nosocomial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otto et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, it is associated with a protracted immunosuppressed state that contributes to morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hotchkiss et al., 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, clinical trials over the past 3 decades of interventions targeting the hyper-inflammatory state of sepsis have largely failed to consistently improve clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">PROWESS-SHOCK Study Group et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Williams, 2012</xref>), and effective treatments are needed.</p><p>Many components of host responses are altered during sepsis, including activation of innate effector cells such as platelets, neutrophils, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. In some settings, cellular activation is associated with dysfunctional responses and adverse clinical outcomes. Studies on immunosuppression in sepsis have largely focused on exhaustion, apoptosis, and reprogramming of a broader range of effector cells, including T cells, B cells, neutrophils, and other antigen-presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hotchkiss et al., 2016</xref>). Unconventional T cells, such as invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, γδ T cells, and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, bridge the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response, and can contribute to both early-phase inflammation and late-phase immunosuppression.</p><p>MAIT cells are innate-like T cells restricted by MHC-related molecule 1 (MR1) and MAIT ligands belong to a class of transitory intermediates of the riboflavin synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Porcelli et al., 1993</xref>). They express an invariant T cell receptor (TCR) TRAV1-2 (or Vα7.2) in humans and TRAV-1 (or Vα19) in mice and a variable, but restricted, number of TRAJ and TCR β chains. MAIT cells are abundant in mucosal tissues such as the liver, lung, and mesenteric lymph nodes and gut lamina propria. In humans, they constitute 1–10% of peripheral blood T lymphocytes, up to 10% of intestinal T cells, and up to 40% of T cells in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2009</xref>). Recent studies have highlighted the protective role of MAIT cells in host antibacterial responses in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Georgel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chua et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Le Bourhis et al., 2010</xref>). It has also been shown that in patients with sepsis, MAIT cell frequencies are decreased in circulation compared to healthy control donors and uninfected critically-ill patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grimaldi et al., 2014</xref>). Septic patients with persistent MAIT cell depletion also have a higher incidence of secondary, ICU-acquired infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grimaldi et al., 2014</xref>). However, detailed phenotypic and functional MAIT cell changes during sepsis, as well as the mechanisms by which MAIT cells contribute to host immune responses in sepsis, are not known. In this work, we used complementary, longitudinal studies in sepsis patients and in a relevant murine sepsis model to study the role of MAIT cells in sepsis pathology. We examined the immune responses in C57BL/6 wild type (WT) or MR1 knock-out (<italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>; i.e. MAIT depleted) mice using the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of polymicrobial sepsis. Additionally, we evaluated the phenotype and function of human MAIT cells during acute sepsis and at 3 months after sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MAIT cells have decreased expression of effectors during experimental sepsis</title><p>To assess MAIT cell effector function during sepsis, we examined MAIT cells in the lungs of WT mice undergoing CLP, a polymicrobial model of sepsis, or sham surgery.

Despite this, very little is known about this unconventional T cell in sepsis. Our study reveals major alterations in activation, function, and dysfunction of MAIT cells in both clinical and experimental models of sepsis. We show that acutely during clinical sepsis, MAIT cells are highly activated, lower in frequency, and have an altered functional phenotype evidenced by reduced IFN-γ cytokine expression. Moreover, at 90 days after sepsis, these changes in MAIT cells have resolved as compared to matched healthy subjects. Using relevant animal models of sepsis, we show similarly that tissue-resident MAIT cells are dysfunctional during sepsis. Moreover, our experimental data indicate that MAIT cells are protective during sepsis, as a deficiency of MAIT cells resulted in significantly higher bacterial burden and mortality. These results indicate that despite being rendered dysfunctional, MAIT cells may augment host immune responses and therefore outcomes during sepsis.</p><p>In both a polymicrobial model of sepsis (i.e. CLP) and a monomicrobial model using a clinical isolate of ExPEC, we found that MAIT-deficient (<italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice have higher mortality and that this is associated with a higher bacterial burden. Our experimental data from the ExPEC model of sepsis, as well as from experiments where bedding was transferred between <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT mice, suggest that the differences in mortality observed with CLP are unlikely to be due to differences in the microbiota. We also found that <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had lower levels of tissue cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17, GM-CSF) than that in WT mice following induction of sepsis. We hypothesize that MAIT cells play a protective role against sepsis pathology by regulating cytokine expression and maintaining a balance in immune response following sepsis to minimize tissue injury. As MAIT cells are capable of bridging the innate and adaptive immune systems, it has also been postulated that their actions are mediated in part by their interaction with macrophages or monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Interestingly, we found that in sepsis, MAIT-deficient mice produce less GM-CSF and have lower frequencies of lung interstitial macrophages and monocytic dendritic cells compared to WT mice. These observations are concordant with previous work demonstrating MAIT cell promotion of early pulmonary GM-CSF production, and differentiation of inflammatory monocytes into moDCs during pulmonary infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meierovics and Cowley, 2016</xref>). Our co-culture experiments showing that MAIT cells produce higher amounts of GM-CSF upon stimulation with the MAIT ligand 5-A-RU further confirms this hypothesis. Further work to examine whether tissue-resident MAIT cells have protective effects against sepsis pathology is warranted.</p><p>Our finding of decreased MAIT cell frequencies during severe sepsis are consistent with a previous study demonstrating that MAIT cells are decreased in patients with severe sepsis, a decrease that was not seen in other T cell populations examined, including <italic>i</italic>NKT and γδ T cells, suggesting cell-specific, rather than global, depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grimaldi et al., 2014</xref>). To extend this work, we found that at approximately 90 days after sepsis MAIT cell frequencies had returned to similar levels observed in matched healthy donors. Furthermore, we found that MAIT cells express elevated levels of activation markers in septic patients and that these markers also return to similar levels as in healthy donors following recovery from sepsis. The depletion of MAIT cells from circulation in septic patients is similar to what has been observed in other infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leeansyah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shaler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leung et al., 2014</xref>), and may be a result of apoptotic cell death, TCR internalization, or migration to peripheral tissues, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated.</p><p>A previous study had shown an association between MAIT cell frequency and protection against secondary infection in the ICU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grimaldi et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we found that in D1 sepsis patients, ex vivo stimulated MAIT cells had a depressed IFN-γ response compared to healthy donors and patients reassessed 90 days following admission for sepsis. A similar decrease in IFN-γ response was also seen in MAIT cells in the lung tissue of mice undergoing CLP compared to mice undergoing sham surgery. Together with an increase in expression of co-inhibitory receptors on human MAIT cells, our data suggest that during clinical sepsis, MAIT cells are dysfunctional. This may prevent MAIT cells from mounting an optimal response against microbial pathogens, a hypothesis consistent with our experimental data indicating that the loss of MAIT cells results in increased bacterial burden and mortality during sepsis. Previous work has shown that superantigens from bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Staphylococcus spp.</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus spp.</italic> can directly trigger rapid activation of MAIT cells to mount IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 responses in an MR1-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shaler et al., 2017</xref>), and that MAIT cells primed by superantigens are exhausted and anergic to cognate antigens such as <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, our co-culture experiments demonstrating the production of GM-CSF by ligand stimulation of expanded lung MAIT cells in presence of lung monocytes were performed ex vivo. Further experiments on the protective role of MAIT-derived GM-CSF during sepsis are needed. Second, our study of patients was not powered to detect differences in MAIT cells between causes of sepsis. Larger studies are needed to examine differences in MAIT cell activity and function between different causes. Finally, our experiments demonstrated decreases in lung interstitial macrophages and monocytes, along with GM-CSF production, are associated with response to CLP in <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. But whether these deficient responses resulted in increased lung injury remains to be investigated further.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that MAIT cells undergo functional and phenotypic changes during clinical and experimental sepsis. We found that MAIT deficient mice have a higher microbial burden, lower tissue cytokine production, and higher mortality during sepsis. Despite this dysfunction, our data provide new insights into the potential protective role of MAIT cells, and their contribution toward tissue-specific cytokine responses, during sepsis. Defining MAIT cells as a critical therapeutic target during sepsis, and defining the mechanisms that regulate MAIT cell function, will potentially enable the development of novel translational strategies targeted to enhance MAIT cell functionality to improve outcomes in sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

<italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which were back-crossed to the C57BL/6N background (10 generations) and then the C57BL/6J background (10 generations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2019</xref>), were obtained from Siobhan Cowley (US FDA). All mice were bred in a pathogen-free facility at the University of Utah. The animals were kept at a constant temperature (25°C) with unlimited access to a pellet diet and water in a room with a 12 hr light/dark cycle. All animals were monitored daily and infected animals were scored for the signs of clinical illness severity as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yost et al., 2016</xref>). Animals were ethically euthanized using CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mouse models of sepsis</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, i.p., respectively), and sepsis was induced by cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hubbard et al., 2005</xref>). After surgery, the animals received subcutaneous sterile isotonic saline (1 mL) for fluid resuscitation. Sham-operated mice were subjected to identical procedures except that CLP was not done. The animals were followed for 5 days after the surgical procedure for the determination of survival. Bacterial loads were determined by serial dilution and plating of lung homogenates and blood on LB agar plates.</p><p>To examine monomicrobial sepsis, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 μL of PBS containing ~1×10<sup>6</sup> CFU of extraintestinal pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ExPEC) clinical strain F11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2007</xref>).

Briefly, bedding transfers were performed among <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cages and WT cages. The bedding was mixed at 3–4 days and at 8–10 days following these cage changes (as fresh bedding is provided every 14 days, this represents bedding transfers performed twice within each 2-week cycle). At each of these time points, roughly one-quarter of soiled bedding was collected from each cage and the bedding from all cages was mixed in an autoclaved sterile container, followed by redistribution across all cages. Soiled bedding was collected and mixed within a freshly cleaned biological safety cabinet within the room where animals were housed. After 4–5 weeks of bedding transfers, polymicrobial sepsis was induced using CLP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Lung mononuclear cell isolation</title><p>For lung digestion and preparation of single cell suspensions, the lungs were perfused using sterile phosphate-buffered saline. After removal, the lung dissociation protocol (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) was performed using the mouse Lung Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) and the gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) as per manufacturer’s instructions. After dissociation, cells were passed through a 70 µm cell strainer and washed with RPMI with 10% FBS. Red blood cells were lysed with red blood cell lysis buffer. Lung mononuclear cells were then washed twice in RPMI with 10% FBS before use in subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Tetramer and surface-staining of lung single cell suspensions</title><p>From each group of animals, 1–2 million cells aliquots were prepared and to exclude dead cells from analysis, cells were first stained with the fixable viability dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience) for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Cells were incubated with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 Fc Block antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), for 20 min at 4°C.

Septic shock was defined as sepsis and an elevated lactate &gt;2 mmol/L or the need for vasopressors. Blood samples were collected from septic patients upon study enrollment (Day 1, after ICU admission for sepsis) and again in the same subjects ∼90 days after enrollment (Day 90). The venous blood was collected and centrifuged over a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient using the standard protocol to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which were either cryopreserved or used directly.

When and how are MAIT cells exerting their protective function. Do the authors suggest that MAIT cells are functional for a brief period of time (less than 18hrs), which is sufficient to elicit a protective effect? In this context, strengthening the link between MAIT cells in the lung and the monocyte accumulation in the lung would strengthen the possible mechanisms by which MAIT cells are protective and could be achieved by investigating levels of the relevant chemokines and comparing MAIT cell responses and monocyte responses over a fuller time course.</p><p>4) It is not clear why the authors chose the lungs to evaluate CLP-induced inflammation as the role of lung injury in mortality in this model is controversial. Thus justification for why only lung MAIT cells were studies (as opposed to lung, liver and spleen) should be given or the dataset expanded to include other organs. The authors should also provide evidence of lung injury that may explain the increased susceptibility of <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (neutrophil levels, histology, vascular leakage).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells mediate protective host responses in sepsis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The second is that further confirmation that the phenotype is due to the lack of MR1 and not other genetic differences between different C57Bl/6 strains is required. This needs to be addressed more thoroughly, preferably by performing genetic testing comparing the MR1 <sup>-/-</sup>. wildtype controls and C67BL6J mice from Jax.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells mediate protective host responses in sepsis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The reviewer’s agree that they cannot make this comment based on the lack of significance (p 0.117), but that the study may lack sufficient power. If they chose the authors could perform power calculations to determine the number of mice that would need to be compared to reach a robust conclusion. Any data generated would then need to be included in the main text of the manuscript and publication would be dependent on how the outcome of such work impacts on the other conclusions drawn in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55615.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should confirm the differences observed in the MR1 defieicnt and WT mice are not due to differences in genotype (provide confirmation of backcrossing or SNP analysis) or microbiota (repeat experiments using littermates or co-housing)</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding confirmation of backcrossing, we used first generation mice from MR1 knockout breeding pairs provided by collaborators who had backcrossed to the B6J background (10 generations). Regarding the potential role of the microbiota, we appreciate this excellent question and recognize that microbiota can influence host susceptibility to infection. Unfortunately, we will not be able to perform additional experiments on the microbiota, given current COVID-19 related restrictions on research. We have thus added the following statement of limitations in the Discussion section, “Our study has a number of limitations. The microbiota associated with <italic>MR1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice may differ from wild-type mice (37), and we have not examined whether such differences affects susceptibility to sepsis. Our experiments using ExPEC suggest the differences in mortality observed with CLP are not due to differences in the microbiota. However, future studies examining the contribution of MAIT cells to differences in microbiota, and their effects on susceptibility to sepsis, are needed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should further investigate whether MAIT cells are indeed the main source of protective cytokines in the tissues of septic mice by performing intra-cellular cytokine staining within various cell populations or ELISA analyses of purified MAIT cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and agree. To investigate whether MAIT cells are indeed the main source of protective cytokines in the tissues of septic mice, we performed new experiments with intra-cellular cytokine staining within various cell populations. We found that percentage frequencies of IFNγ in lung MAIT cells were significantly lower in septic mice compared to sham treated mice. Conversely, in non-MAIT TCRβ+CD3+ T cells, frequencies of IFNγ+ cells were higher in septic mice compared to sham treated mice. No significant differences were observed in frequencies of TNFα, IL-17a, GM-CSF and IL-10 in lung MAIT cells between the groups. No differences were observed in iNKT and TCRγδ IFNγ production.</p><p>We have now added these results as a new Figure 2 and have added to the Results section to state, “To further confirm that MAIT cell effector function is impaired during experimental sepsis, we evaluated IFNγ, TNFα, IL-17a, GM-CSF and IL-10 protein expression in MAIT cells of lung tissue using flow cytometry. We found that similar to <italic>IFNγ</italic> mRNA expression, percentage frequencies of MAIT cells expressing IFNγ were significantly lower (P = 0.04) in septic mice compared to sham mice (Figure 2A). Mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of IFNγ staining in TCRβ<sup>+</sup> MR1-5OP-RU-tetramer<sup>+</sup> MAIT cells was also significantly reduced (P = 0.02) in septic mice compared to sham mice (Figure 2B). Conversely, in non-MAIT TCRβ+CD3+ T cell populations, IFNγ protein expression was significantly higher (P = 0.0005) in septic mice compared to sham mice (Figure 2C). No significant differences were observed in IFNγ expression in iNKT and TCRγδ cells (Figure 2D and E). No significant differences were observed in frequencies of TNFα, IL-17a, GM-CSF and IL-10 between the groups.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors argue that MAIT cells are protective and suggest that the differences in cytokine levels measured in the lungs of WT and MR1 mice are due to MAIT cell function (further proof of this was asked above in point 2). When and how are MAIT cells exerting their protective function. Do the authors suggest that MAIT cells are functional for a brief period of time (less than 18hrs), which is sufficient to elicit a protective effect? In this context, strengthening the link between MAIT cells in the lung and the monocyte accumulation in the lung would strengthen the possible mechanisms by which MAIT cells are protective and could be achieved by investigating levels of the relevant chemokines and comparing MAIT cell responses and monocyte responses over a fuller time course.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and tested the hypothesis that MAIT cells exert their protective function by IFNγ and GM-CSF cytokine expression very early following sepsis. Total MAIT cells in the lung of each mouse number only ~1000, making co-culture experiments difficult. Thus, we expanded lung MAITs ex vivo using a published method for expansion of human MAITs using recombinant IL-2 and sulfate latex beads of 5-OP-RU/MR1 artificial antigen-presenting cells for 14 days (Liu et al., 2020). This resulted in a 10 fold increase in MAIT cell numbers. We then co-cultured these expanded MAITs with Ly6C+ CD11b+ monocytes isolated from lungs of WT mice for 18 hrs. We found significantly higher amounts of IFNγ and GM-CSF in co-cultures stimulated with 5-A-RU/MeG compared to unstimulated and monocyte only controls. This suggests that within 18 hours, MAITs and monocytes interact in the lung and produce relevant cytokines.</p><p>We have presented these results as supplementary figures to Figure 5 and added to the Results section, “To investigate the possible mechanism by which MAIT cells are protective, we performed ex vivo expansion of lung MAIT cells from WT mice using 5-OP-RU/MR1 artificial antigen presenting cells (25) and co-cultured them with Ly6C+ CD11b+ monocytes, also isolated from WT mice, for 18 hours. We found significantly higher amounts of IFNγ (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A) and GM-CSF (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B) in co-cultures stimulated with 5-amino-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-A-RU) and methylglyoxal (MeG) (25) compared to unstimulated and monocyte only controls indicating that MAIT cells in lung can interact with monocytes to produce effector cytokines.”</p><p>We have also added to the Discussion section, “Our co-culture experiments showing that MAIT cells produce higher amounts of GM-CSF upon stimulation with the MAIT ligand 5-A-RU further confirms this hypothesis.” We have also added to the Discussion section, “Secondly, our coculture experiments demonstrating the production of GM-CSF by ligand stimulation of expanded lung MAIT cells in presence of lung monocytes were ex vivo. Further experiments on the protective role of MAIT-derived GM-CSF during sepsis are needed.<italic>”</italic></p><p>We have also added to the Materials and methods section, “Ex vivo co-culture of lung Ly6C+ CD11b+ monocytes with MAITs: Lung MAITs were expanded ex vivo using a previously published method for expansion of human MAIT cells (25). Briefly, lung homogenates from healthy WT mice were cultured for 14 days in presence of mouse recombinant IL-2 and sulfate latex beads of 5-OP-RU/MR1 artificial antigen-presenting cells. To isolate monocytes, lung cells from healthy WT mice were surface stained with anti-CD45 AF700 (Biolegend), anti-CD11b-FITC (Biolegend), anti-Siglec-F- BV711 (BD), and anti- Ly6C (PE dazzle 594) for 30 min at 4 °C. We obtained CD45+ Siglec-F- Ly6C+ CD11b+ monocytes by flow sorting on a FACS Aria II (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). We incubated 20,000 MAITs with 10,000 monocytes for 18 hours, in a total volume of 200µl in a 96-well U-bottom plates. MAIT-monocyte coculture was stimulated with 200nM 5-A-RU and 50µM MeG (26) in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% HEPES. MAIT cells that were stimulated/unstimulated and monocytes that were stimulated/unstimulated were kept as controls. After 18 hours, cell supernatant was collected and stored at -20°C. We measured IFN-γ and GM-CSF levels in supernatants using ELISA as per manufacturer’s instruction in Biolegend ELISA MAX standard sets for mouse IFN-γ and for mouse GMCSF.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not clear why the authors chose the lungs to evaluate CLP-induced inflammation as the role of lung injury in mortality in this model is controversial. Thus justification for why only lung MAIT cells were studies (as opposed to lung, liver and spleen) should be given or the dataset expanded to include other organs. The authors should also provide evidence of lung injury that may explain the increased susceptibility of Mr1<sup>-/-</sup> mice (neutrophil levels, histology, vascular leakage).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion, and appreciate the chance to clarify. MAIT cells are most abundant in lungs as compared to other organs in mice (Rahimpour et al., 2015). Nevertheless, to examine other tissues, we evaluated MAIT-associated cytokines in lung, liver, gut and serum after CLP. We have now inserted (added as Fiugre 5—figure supplement 1 and 2, also in Results section) additional data showing that tissue cytokines in serum, liver and gut were less affected than lung in <italic>MR1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice after CLP. We did not observe significant differences in frequencies of lung neutrophils between <italic>MR1<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>and WT mice, and have added to Figure 5 a new subpanel (panel E) showing these data. We have also updated the Results section as: “Loss of MAIT cells did not influence AMs, pDCs, or neutrophils, however, following CLP (Figure 5C -E)”. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 related restrictions, we were unable to generate additional data regarding the phenotype of lung injury. We have added additional statement of limitations to the Discussion, “Lastly, our experiments demonstrated decreases in lung interstitial macrophages and monocytes, along with GM-CSF production, are associated with response to CLP in <italic>MR1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. But whether these deficient responses resulted in increased lung injury remains to be investigated further.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The first, and most important is that microbiota differences are likely to exist between any two independently bred strains and could easily account for the observed effects. The reviewers agree that this possibility precludes publication at this point and that experiments using littermate controls or co-housed animals would need to be performed to validate the manuscript's conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To address this, we used a bedding transfer protocol as published in Miyoshi et al., 2018. Briefly, soiled cage bedding was routinely mixed weekly and distributed among all WT and <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice cages for total of four weeks followed by CLP. Similar to our CLP model and ExPEC model results, we found a trend of increased sepsis-related mortality in <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to WT mice. The majority (7/10) of <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice died in 48-72 hours following induction of sepsis, while the majority (6/10) of WT mice survived up to 100 hours after sepsis (Log-rank test, <italic>p</italic> 0.117).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55615-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second is that further confirmation that the phenotype is due to the lack of MR1 and not other genetic differences between different C57Bl/6 strains is required. This needs to be addressed more thoroughly, preferably by performing genetic testing comparing the MR1 +. wildtype controls and C67BL6J mice from Jax.</p></disp-quote><p>The MR1 null mice we received from our collaborator at the FDA were 10x backcrossed prior to us receiving it. We have cited the publications of the collaborator who provided us with the mice, (Smith et al., 2019, “The MR1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were originally generated on a mixed B6/129OlaHsd background. The mice were back-crossed to the C57BL/6N background (10 generations) and then the B6J background (10 generations).”). We have now added this in the Materials and methods: “Mr1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which were back-crossed to the C57BL/6N background (10 generations) and then the C57BL/6J background (10 generations) (37), were obtained from Siobhan Cowley (US FDA).” In addition, in this paper, we report that there were no differences in many immune cells examined between control wild-type and MR1 null mice under sham surgery conditions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revision:</p><p>The data provided by the authors in which co-housing was used and the authors report that they found a trend of increased sepsis related mortality in Mr1 KO compared to WT mice. The reviewer’s agree that they cannot make this comment based on the lack of significance (p 0.117), but that the study may lack sufficient power. If they chose the authors could perform power calculations to determine the number of mice that would need to be compared to reach a robust conclusion. Any data generated would then need to be included in the main text of the manuscript and publication would be dependent on how the outcome of such work impacts on the other conclusions drawn in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for their suggestions. We have now done power calculations and repeated this experiment, for total of 3 independent experiments, with total n = 31 <italic>Mr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>mice and n = 30 WT mice. We found significant increase in <italic>Mr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mortality compared to WT mice (p = 0.03). Together with existing experimental data from an alternative model of sepsis (ExPEC injection), which showed similar findings, we conclude that differences in mortality observed with CLP are not due to differences in the microbiota.</p><p>Following changes are made in manuscript.</p><p>Results section: We have added Figure 3C, and revised the text to state, “The microbiota associated with <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice may differ from wild-type mice (22); therefore we examined whether such differences affect susceptibility to sepsis. In experiments in which bedding was transferred between <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT cages (23) prior to CLP, we found that <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had significantly increased mortality compared to WT mice (Figure 3C).”</p><p>Materials and methods section:</p><p>Bedding transfer procedure is added: “Bedding transfer procedure was followed as previously described (23). Briefly, bedding transfers were performed among <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT cages. Bedding was mixed at 3–4 days and at 8–10 days following cage changes (as fresh bedding is provided every 14 days, this represents bedding transfers performed twice within each two-week cycle). At each of these time points, roughly one-quarter of soiled bedding was collected from each cage and the bedding from all cages was mixed in an autoclaved sterile container, followed by redistribution across all cages. Soiled bedding was collected and mixed within a freshly cleaned biological safety cabinet within the room where animals were housed. After 4-5 weeks of bedding transfers, polymicrobial sepsis was induced using CLP.”</p><p>Power calculations are added:</p><p>“We used Cox proportional-hazards (coxph) model with non-bedding-transferred mice as reference for determining power calculation for the number of mice needed in the bedding transfer experiment. Formula used was: coxph(formula = Surv(t, event) ~ group, data = exp) with coef = 2.1525, exp(coef) = 8.6065, se(coef) = 0.7724, z = 2.787 and p group = 0.00532. Likelihood ratio test = 11.35 on 1 df, p=0.0007563, n= 30, number of events= 13. In order to observe the hazard ratio from this study (8.6065) with 80% power and type I error 0.05, we need to observe 7 deaths. In order to determine sample size, we divided 7 by the expected rate of death overall. For an expected death rate of 50%, we needed a sample size of 14; for an expected death rate of 25%, we needed a sample size of 28. We used total 31 <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and 30 WT mice from three independent experiments to plot survival curves.”</p><p>Discussion section: We have added the following text to the second paragraph of the Discussion: “Our experimental data from the ExPEC model of sepsis, as well as from experiments where bedding was transferred between <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT mice, suggest that the differences in mortality observed with CLP are unlikely to be due to differences in the microbiota.”</p><p>Figure legend for Figure 3C is added as: “(C) Bedding transfer procedure (detailed in the Materials and methods section) was used to exchange gut microbiome between age matched <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT mice (total n = 31 for <italic>Mr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and total n = 30 for WT mice) before inducing sepsis by CLP.
