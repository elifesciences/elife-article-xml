immunity, thus is a common target for bacterial virulence factors. A number of effectors from the bacterial pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> have been shown to modulate the function of host actin cytoskeleton to construct the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV) permissive for its intracellular replication. In this study, we found that the Dot/Icm effector Lem8 (Lpg1290) is a protease whose activity is catalyzed by a Cys-His-Asp motif known to be associated with diverse biochemical activities. Intriguingly, we found that Lem8 interacts with the host regulatory protein 14-3-3ζ, which activates its protease activity. Furthermore, Lem8 undergoes self-cleavage in a process that requires 14-3-3ζ. We identified the Pleckstrin homology-like domain-containing protein Phldb2 involved in cytoskeleton organization as a target of Lem8 and demonstrated that Lem8 plays a role in the inhibition of host cell migration by attacking Phldb2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Legionella</italic></kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd><italic>Dictyostelium</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013061</institution-id><institution>Jilin Scientific and Technological Development Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20200403117SF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013061</institution-id><institution>Jilin Scientific and Technological Development Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20200901010SF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21974002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaoyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005089</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5202012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaoyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI127465</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Zhao-Qing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel bacterial protease activated by a eukaryote-specific factor attacks a host protein involved in cytoskeleton organization to inhibit cell migration during <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> is a Gram-negative intracellular bacterial pathogen ubiquitously found in freshwater habitats, where it replicates in a wide range of amoebae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Richards et al., 2013</xref>). It is believed that these natural hosts serve as the main replication niches for <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> in the environment and provide the primary evolutionary pressure for the acquisition and maintenance of virulence factors necessary for its intracellular lifecycle. Infection of humans by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> occurs when susceptible individuals inhale aerosols generated from contaminated water, which introduces the bacterium to the lungs where it is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. Instead of being digested and cleared, internalized bacteria replicate within a membrane-bound compartment termed <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV), leading to the development of Legionnaires’ disease, a form of severe pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cunha et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>One feature associated with the LCV is its ability to evade fusion with the lysosomal network in the early phase (&lt;8 hr postinfection in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages [BMDMs]) of its development and the quick acquisition of proteins originating from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kagan and Roy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sturgill-Koszycki and Swanson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Swanson and Isberg, 1995</xref>). Biogenesis of the LCV requires the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system that injects more than 300 effector proteins into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Qiu and Luo, 2017</xref>). These effectors function to modulate a wide cohort of host processes, including vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tan et al., 2011</xref>), protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shen et al., 2009</xref>), lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaspar and Machner, 2014</xref>), and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choy et al., 2012</xref>) by diverse biochemical mechanisms. Coordinated activity of these effectors leads to the formation of the LCV which largely resembles the ER in its morphology and protein composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Qiu and Luo, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells is composed of microfilaments derived from actin polymers, intermediate filaments and microtubules, which play distinct roles in maintaining cell shape, migration, endocytosis, intracellular transport, and the association of cells with the extracellular matrix and cell–cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones et al., 2019</xref>). Due to its essential role in these cellular processes, components of the cytoskeleton, particularly the actin cytoskeleton is a common target for infectious agents. For example, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> Typhimurium utilizes a set of type III effectors, including SipC, SopE, and SptP to reversibly regulate the rearrangement of the host actin cytoskeleton to facilitate its entry into nonphagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kubori and Galán, 2003</xref>). Other bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic>, and <italic>Listeria</italic> also exploit the actin cytoskeleton and microtubule networks to promote their movement in the cytoplasm of host cells and cell to cell spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grieshaber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Growing evidence indicates that manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics plays an important role in the intracellular lifecycle of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. It has been documented that chemical interference of the actin cytoskeleton structure impedes bacterial entry and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charpentier et al., 2009</xref>). A number of Dot/Icm effectors have been shown to impose complex modulation of the host actin cytoskeleton. Among these, VipA promotes actin polymerization by functioning as a nucleator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franco et al., 2012</xref>). LegK2 appears to inhibit actin nucleation by phosphorylating the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Michard et al., 2015</xref>). The protein phosphatase WipA participate in this regulation by dephosphorylating several proteins involved in actin polymerization, including N-WASP, NCK1, ARP3, and ACK1, leading to dysregulation of actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2019</xref>). RavK is a metalloprotease that cleaves actin in host cells, abolishing its ability to form polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Ceg14 also appears to inhibit actin polymerization by a yet unrecognized mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, LegG1 has been demonstrated to promote microtubule polymerization and host cell migration by functioning as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Ran GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rothmeier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Simon et al., 2014</xref>). Counterintuitive to the role of LegG1, cells infected by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> display defects in migration in a way that requires a functional Dot/Icm system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Simon et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting the existence of effectors that function to block cell migration.</p><p>Herein, we demonstrate that the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effector Lem8 (Lpg1290) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burstein et al., 2009</xref>) is a cysteine protease that functions to inhibit host cell migration by targeting the microtubule-associated protein Phldb2 via a mechanism that requires the regulatory protein 14-3-3ζ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lem8 is a <italic>Legionella</italic> effector with putative cysteine protease activities</title><p>One major challenge in the study of bacterial effectors is their unique primary sequences that share little similarity with proteins of known function.

Comparing to samples expressing enzymatically inactive Lem8, the amounts of protein detected by the amino terminal Flag epitope and the carboxyl end HA tag both decreased in cells coexpressing wild-type Lem8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We validated this conclusion by making constructs in which GFP was fused to the amino terminal end of Phldb2 and three of its truncation mutants, Phldb2<sub>△N50</sub>, Phldb2<sub>△N100</sub>, and Phldb2<sub>△N200</sub>, respectively. Each of these fusion proteins was coexpressed with Lem8 or Lem8<sub>C280S</sub> in HEK293T cells and the protein level of these fusions was probed by immunoblotting with GFP-specific antibodies. In each case, a fraction of the protein has lost the GFP portion of the fusions when coexpressed with Lem8 but not with Lem8<sub>C280S</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Intriguingly, the cleavage also occurred in fusion proteins in which the GFP is fused to the carboxyl terminus of Phldb2<sub>∆C100</sub> or Phldb2<sub>∆C153</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>, right panel).

The most likely reason for the inability to detect Lem8 activity against Phldb2 in infected cells is the low abundance or instability of the cleaved protein or a combination of both.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A coiled coil motif in the amino terminal region of Lem8 is important for its interactions with 14-3-3ζ</title><p>Using the online MARCOIL sequence analysis software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gabler et al., 2020</xref>), we identified a putative coiled coil motif located in the amino region of Lem8. Coiled coil is a common structural element in proteins, particularly those of eukaryotic origin; it is formed by two to seven supercoiled alpha-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2006</xref>), and often is involved in protein–protein interactions, thus playing important roles in the formation of protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkhard et al., 2001</xref>). To determine the role of this region in the activity of Lem8, we introduced mutations to replace Leu<sub>58</sub> and Glu<sub>59</sub>, the two sites predicted to be essential for the coiled coil structure in Lem8, with glycine (called Lem8<sub>GG</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When tested in yeast, these mutations have completely abolished the toxicity of Lem8 without affecting its expression or stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

These virulence factors often attack host regulatory proteins by diverse posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krachler et al., 2011</xref>), ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou and Zhu, 2015</xref>), AMPylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yarbrough et al., 2009</xref>), acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mukherjee et al., 2006</xref>), and ADP-ribosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen and Chang, 2018</xref>). Proteolytic processing is a type of PTM that can lead to the activation, inactivation, or destruction of target proteins, causing alterations in cellular structure or signaling that benefit the pathogen. For instance, the type III effector EspL from enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> functions as a cysteine protease that antagonizes host inflammatory response by degrading several proteins involved in necroptotic signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pearson et al., 2017</xref>).

In line with the notion that amoebae are the primary host of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, the sole 14-3-3 protein from <italic>D. discoideum</italic> similarly activates Lem8. Due to extremely low bacterial uptake rates by <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, we were unable to examine the impact of Lem8 on the motility of this host. Nevertheless, despite Lem8 is not required for intracellular bacterial replication, it plays a role in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> virulence by inhibiting host cell motility, this finding thus provides a molecular explanation for this phenotype observed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Simon et al., 2014</xref>). It is worth noting that a close homolog of Phldb2 is not present in amoebae species such as <italic>D. discoideum</italic>. The fact that <italic>lem8</italic> is only present in a few isolates of the many sequenced <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strains implies that these bacteria may have coevolved with higher eukaryotes. Several <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> Dot/Icm effectors that attacks host signaling mechanisms not known to exist in amoebae have been reported. For example, the activation of the NF-κB pathway by LegK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ge et al., 2009</xref>) and the specific attack of linear polyubiquitin chains by RavD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wan et al., 2019</xref>).

Intriguingly, neither of these two motifs is present in Lem8. Consistently, recombinant Lem8 from mammalian cells or <italic>E. coli</italic> was not detectably phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The binding of 14-3-3 proteins to unmodified clients is not unprecedented.

Elements with a sequence similar to these established recognition sites are not present in Lem8 nor is there one resembling those in other nonphosphorylated binding targets of 14-3-3 such as GPIb-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gu and Du, 1998</xref>), p75NTR-associated cell death executor (NADE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kimura et al., 2001</xref>) or CLIC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Suginta et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Two lines of evidence suggest that 14-3-3ζ recognizes a coiled coil motif in the amino terminal portion of Lem8. First, deletion of as few as 25 residues from the amino terminus end of Lem8 abolished its interaction with 14-3-3ζ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Second, the integrity of a predicted coiled coil motif in the amino terminal portion of Lem8 is required for its binding to the regulatory protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Coiled coil motifs have long been known to be important for protein–protein interaction but its involvement in binding 14-3-3 has not yet been established. The binding of 14-3-3 to TRIM25 had been suggested to be mediated by recognizing a coiled coil domain, but the mechanism of such binding or whether phosphorylation is required remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>). Future study, particularly structural analysis of the Lem8-14-3-3ζ complex may allow a definite identification of the region in Lem8 recognized by 14-3-3ζ, which will surely shed light on the additional features of the sequences recognizable by this imporant regulatory protein.</p><p>The self-cleavage of Lem8 has allowed us to identify its recognition sequence and several candidate cellular targets. One unexpected observation is that mutations in the identified recognition element reduced but did not abolish self-cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, the primary sequence may not the only factor that dictates the specificity of Lem8 in substrate recognition. Other factors such as the overall structure of substrates may contribute to the configuration of the recognition site. The low level of specificity in cleavage site selection may allow Lem8 to more effectively bring down the cellular level of its targets, which may explain the requirement of 14-3-3ζ for its activity. If a host cofactor is not needed for its activity, Lem8 may cleave itself or even other proteins in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> cells. For Lem8, self-cleavage in the absence of 14-3-3ζ in bacterial cells will be disastrous because the cleaved product will lose the portion of the protein that harbors translocation signals recognized by the Dot/Icm system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Luo and Isberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nagai et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, the requirement of CaM by the Dot/Icm effector SidJ to inhibit the activity of members of the SidE family is to ensure that such inhibition does not occur in bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhogaraju et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sulpizio et al., 2019</xref>). The promiscuity in cleavage site recognition by Lem8 is also supported by the observation that this protease appears to cleave Phldb2 at multiple sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Interference with host cell motility appears to be a common strategy used by bacterial pathogens.

Migration permits phagocytes including amoebae to move in response to chemotaxis cues, which likely will increase their chance to encounter cells that can recognize and engulf infected cells.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jos Van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) The presence of the co-factor 14-3-3ζ was shown to be essential for the protease activity of Lem8. However, the involvement of the co-factor in regulation of cell motility was not demonstrated and should be addressed experimentally.</p><p>(2) The authors could not detect any cleavage of Phldb2 during infection and the cleavage site(s) of Phldb2 remained to be unidentified, therefore, the link between loss of Phldb2 and motility suggested in the title &quot;Legionella pneumophila regulates host cell motility by targeting Phldb2 with a 14-3-3ζ-dependent protease effector&quot;, is not experimentally established. Therefore, a number of other possible models exists, including the possibilities that unidentified substrates of Lem8 are involved in the phenotype or Lem8 is not a protease directly responsible for cleavage of Phldb2 and that the auto-cleaved Lem8 may acquire a distinctive enzymatic ability rather than a protease. To address testing their model that cleavage of Phldb2 by Lem8 affects motility, can the authors make a version of Phldb2 that is resistant to Lem8 cleavage? If so, expressing a Lem8-resistant version of Phldb2 in HEK293T cells may allow for the restoration of cell migration in cells expressing Lem8 or infected with Lem8-expressing Legionella. Alternatively, Lem8ΔC52 is a good substitute for the self-cleaved form of Lem8, showing the enhanced activity against Phlbd2 (Figure 6E). The authors may consider using this variant for the infection experiment. Transfecting the Lem8 stable-cell lines with Phldb2- expression plasmids could further clarify the role of the protein for this phenotype, although this does not directly test the role of cleavage. The authors may also examine the wound healing assay at a later timepoint.</p><p>(3) While the employed wound healing assay system is widely used, caution is needed when extrapolating the findings to more relevant host cells, amoeba or macrophages, without experimental validation. The observation that Lem8 is toxic for yeast, but not HEK293T cells highlights this. The text should reflect these limitations. Is Lem8 required for Legionella to interfere with motility of D. discoideum or other amoebae? Can the authors speculate in the discussion why it may be advantageous for Legionella to have an effector like Lem8 that may interfere with the migration of amoebae?</p><p>(4) The last sentence of the abstract states &quot;Our results reveal a novel mechanism of inhibiting host cell motility by L. pneumophila for its virulence.&quot; However, the authors haven't shown a role for Lem8 in L. pneumophila virulence, as they show that Lem8 is dispensable for intracellular replication within D. discoideum and macrophages. The authors should modify this sentence and similar statements accordingly.</p><p>(5) As Figure 7 is the only and most important data that represents the biological significance of Lem8-Phldb2 axis for controlling cell migration, the images of the would-healing scratch plates should be presented more clearly (Panel C). For instance, WT vs Δlem8 does not seem to be so different in my eyes if the red lines are omitted, while the graph shows the two-fold difference. And the authors could include Lem8GG which lacks interaction with 14-3-3ζ, enabling to demonstrate the involvement of 14-3-3ζ in this axis.</p><p>(6) Line 144: The authors comment on the conservation Lem8 across Legionella spp., but not across L. pneumophila isolates. Is Lem8 conserved in all L. pneumophila isolates/strains?</p><p>(7) The authors confirm that Lem8 binds human and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> 14-3-3 experimentally, but do not comment on evolutionary conservation of Phldb2. This should be at least discussed, as it is critical as to how far the findings from the study can be extrapolated.</p><p>(8) Figure 2A/ Y2H: The authors mention that many more clones apart from the ones containing 14-3-3 were identified in the Y2H screen. In the supplement, the authors should include a full list including information if additional interactions have been validated or disproven.</p><p>(9) Line 231: Do the authors mean Cleavage of C50 or C52 truncation mutant?</p><p>(10) Line 251: Figure 4: It is not clear if other candidate proteins apart from Phldb2 were tested. If yes and they were not cleaved, this information should be included to avoid unnecessary duplication of experiments by other researchers.</p><p>(11) In Figure S5C, Cleavage occurs with the HA-Lem8C280S mutant, instead of WT? Were the figure labels swapped?</p><p>(12) Please include accession numbers Uniprot/ NCBI WP accession numbers for Lem8 in the material and methods section for cross referencing.</p><p>(13) In figure 4D, the authors show microscopy images indicating that in cells expressing WT Lem8, the GFP signal is redistributed throughout the cytoplasm. The authors should quantify this data in a large number of cells and depict it as a graph alongside the microscopy images. Similarly, the authors should show graphs depicting quantification alongside representative microscopy images shown in Figure S5A.</p><p>(14) In figure 6A, Lem8 deltaC100 is poorly expressed, and thus it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions from this mutant. The authors should clarify this point in their manuscript.</p><p>(15) Figure 7C: There are two sets of microscopy images labeled deltalem8 (Lem8). Was one of the sets meant to represent infection with deltalem8 Legionella complemented with the Lem8C280S mutant?</p><p>(16) In the figure legends, the authors mention how many times experiments were performed for some figures, but not for others.

However, the involvement of the co-factor in regulation of cell motility was not demonstrated and should be addressed experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that probing the role of 14-3-3ζ in Lem8-induced cell motility inhibition will further support the conclusion that it functions as a co-factor for the effector. Determining such role in cells would need to interfere with 14-3-3ζ expression. Yet, numerous studies have demonstated that knockdown of 14-3-3ζ alone impairs cell motility (e.g: Chen, Liu et al., 2014, Goc, Abdalla et al., 2012, Jin, Han et al., 2016, Kambach, Sodi et al., 2014, Kim, Ullevig et al., 2014, Kobayashi, Ogura et al., 2011, Li, Xu et al., 2019, Lu, Guo et al., 2009, Preisinger, Short et al., 2004, Yu, Chen et al., 2017). The fact that 14-3-3ζ itself is required for cell motifity would prevent us from making any conclusion on its role in promoting the cell motility-inhibition activity of Lem8. We would like to note that our biochemical experiments have unequivocally shown that Lem8 requires 14-3-3ζ for cleaving itself and its host target Phldb2 (Figures 3 and 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors could not detect any cleavage of Phldb2 during infection and the cleavage site(s) of Phldb2 remained to be unidentified, therefore, the link between loss of Phldb2 and motility suggested in the title &quot;Legionella pneumophila regulates host cell motility by targeting Phldb2 with a 14-3-3ζ-dependent protease effector&quot;, is not experimentally established. Therefore, a number of other possible models exists, including the possibilities that unidentified substrates of Lem8 are involved in the phenotype or Lem8 is not a protease directly responsible for cleavage of Phldb2 and that the auto-cleaved Lem8 may acquire a distinctive enzymatic ability rather than a protease. To address testing their model that cleavage of Phldb2 by Lem8 affects motility, can the authors make a version of Phldb2 that is resistant to Lem8 cleavage? If so, expressing a Lem8-resistant version of Phldb2 in HEK293T cells may allow for the restoration of cell migration in cells expressing Lem8 or infected with Lem8-expressing Legionella. Alternatively, Lem8ΔC52 is a good substitute for the self-cleaved form of Lem8, showing the enhanced activity against Phlbd2 (Figure 6E). The authors may consider using this variant for the infection experiment. Transfecting the Lem8 stable-cell lines with Phldb2- expression plasmids could further clarify the role of the protein for this phenotype, although this does not directly test the role of cleavage. The authors may also examine the wound healing assay at a later timepoint.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the vigor of the reviewer and her/his insightful suggestions. Our data indicate that the cleavage of Phldb2 by Lem8 occurs at multiple sites. Truncated protein fragments are known to be susceptible to nonspecific digestions by proteases, which likely accounts for our inability to detect Phldb2 fragments produced by Lem8.</p><p>We agree that detection of biochemical effects imposed by bacterial effectors under infection conditions will provide a strong support of the conclusion but such effects in some scenarios are extremely challenging and the detection of Lem8-mediated cleavage of Phldb2 in cells infected by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> clearly is one such case. This is one of the most difficult parts of projects on functional analysis of bacterial effectors. As we have discussed in our manuscript, this can be due to a combination of scarce amounts of translocated Lem8, the high abundance of cellular Phldb2 and the inability to detect the cleaved products due to the presence of multiple cleavage sites. Although it is formally possible that Lem8 has an alternative enzymatic activity beyond the protease activity describe here. Our cleavage experiments with recombinant proteins (Figure 4) and results from new experiments showing that overexpression of Phldb2 suppressed the migration inhibition imposed by Lem8 (Figure 7 figure supplement 1) strongly support the conclusion that attack of Phldb2 by Lem8 led to inhibition of cell migration.</p><p>That fact that Lem8 cleaves Phldb2 at multiple sites makes it extremely difficult if not impossible to make mutants that are resistant to the effector. Instead, we have followed the suggestion to overexpress Phldb2 in cells transfected to express Lem8 and found that it indeed can suppress the motility inhibition imposed by Lem8 (Figure 7 figure supplement 1). These results have strengthened our conclusion that Lem8 inhibits host cell motility by attacking Phldb2.. We also have extended the duration of the experiments by adding a 48-h time point (Figures 7B and Figure 7 figure supplement 1). Please note that we did not include the data of 48-h under infection condition because the cells became very unhealthy at this time point.</p><p>As for the suggestion to express the Lem8ΔC52 mutant in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and test its impact on cell motility. It has been well-established that signals required for Dot/Icm-mediated protein translocation resides in the carboxyl end of the effectors (Lifshitz, Burstein et al., 2013, Nagai, Cambronne et al., 2005). As a result, Lem8ΔC52 cannot be recognized and translocated by Dot/Icm, which makes the experiment technically impossible to perform. We have speculated that one of the possible reasons for the requirement of 14-3-3ζ is to ensure that self-cleavage of Lem8 does NOT occur within bacterial cells (page 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) While the employed wound healing assay system is widely used, caution is needed when extrapolating the findings to more relevant host cells, amoeba or macrophages, without experimental validation. The observation that Lem8 is toxic for yeast, but not HEK293T cells highlights this. The text should reflect these limitations. Is Lem8 required for Legionella to interfere with motility of D. discoideum or other amoebae? Can the authors speculate in the discussion why it may be advantageous for Legionella to have an effector like Lem8 that may interfere with the migration of amoebae?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We have attempted the experiments using the amoebae host <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>. Unfortunately, the rate of bacterial uptake by this host is extremely low, which prevents us from making any definite conclusion. In the same time, experiments with Raw264.7 macrophages showed that Lem8 plays a role in the inhibition of cell motility during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection (revised Figure 7D). Finally, we have followed the suggestion to discuss these results in the context of infection of more “natural” hosts of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> by noting the limitations of the experimentals systems we used (page 15).</p><p>We have added a brief discussion of the potential advantage for the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> to inhibit host cell migration (page 18).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The last sentence of the abstract states &quot;Our results reveal a novel mechanism of inhibiting host cell motility by L. pneumophila for its virulence.&quot; However, the authors haven't shown a role for Lem8 in L. pneumophila virulence, as they show that Lem8 is dispensable for intracellular replication within D. discoideum and macrophages. The authors should modify this sentence and similar statements accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to reflect the fact that Lem8 is not required for optimal intracellular replication (page 2 Abstract, page 15 bottom).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) As Figure 7 is the only and most important data that represents the biological significance of Lem8-Phldb2 axis for controlling cell migration, the images of the would-healing scratch plates should be presented more clearly (Panel C). For instance, WT vs Δlem8 does not seem to be so different in my eyes if the red lines are omitted, while the graph shows the two-fold difference. And the authors could include Lem8GG which lacks interaction with 14-3-3ζ, enabling to demonstrate the involvement of 14-3-3ζ in this axis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the suggestion to redo the experiment with additional samples that express LemGG. The results showed that this mutant has lost the ability to inhibit cell motility (revised Figure 7C), which further validates our conclusion that 14-3-3ζ-induced Lem8 activity is responsible for the phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Line 144: The authors comment on the conservation Lem8 across Legionella spp., but not across L. pneumophila isolates. Is Lem8 conserved in all L. pneumophila isolates/strains?</p></disp-quote><p>We have further explored the distribution of Lem8 in L. pneumophila isolates and strains and found that it is present in the following strains.

We have further searched for potential Phldb2 ortholog in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and found that the protein coded for by gene DDB_G0288073 bears remote similarity (please see sequence alignment <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We have further dicussed the implications of targeting Phldb2, a protein only present in mammalian cells or other higher organisms (page 15-16).</p><p>As a point of discussion in this context, it is worth noting that the scientific community of Legionella biology has long believes that unicellular eukaryotes in fresh water niches provide the main driving force for the evolution of these bacteria. Whereas this notion is still largely correct, over the years, the activity of several of its Dot/Icm effectors suggests that these bacteria may have co-evolved with higher organisms. For example, RavD specifically attacks linear ubiquitina chains, a strong inducer for immunity that so far has only been found in mammalian cells (Iwai, 2021, Wan, Wang et al., 2019), so was the kinase LegK1 that activate the noncannical branch of the NFκB pathway (Ge, Xu et al., 2009), which does not exist in amoeba.
