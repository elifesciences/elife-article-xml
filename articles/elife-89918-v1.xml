Mammals express chitin-binding and chitin-degrading proteins to remove chitin from the body. One of these proteins, Acidic Mammalian Chitinase (AMCase), is an enzyme known for its ability to function under acidic conditions in the stomach but is also active in tissues with more neutral pHs, such as the lung. Here, we used a combination of biochemical, structural, and computational modeling approaches to examine how the mouse homolog (mAMCase) can act in both acidic and neutral environments. We measured kinetic properties of mAMCase activity across a broad pH range, quantifying its unusual dual activity optima at pH 2 and 7. We also solved high-resolution crystal structures of mAMCase in complex with oligomeric GlcNAcn, the building block of chitin, where we identified extensive conformational ligand heterogeneity. Leveraging these data, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations that suggest how a key catalytic residue could be protonated via distinct mechanisms in each of the two environmental pH ranges. These results integrate structural, biochemical, and computational approaches to deliver a more complete understanding of the catalytic mechanism governing mAMCase activity at different pH. Engineering proteins with tunable pH optima may provide new opportunities to develop improved enzyme variants, including AMCase, for therapeutic purposes in chitin degradation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enzyme</kwd><kwd>chitin</kwd><kwd>lung</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005595</institution-id><institution>University of California</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T29IP0554</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL148033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van Dyken</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30GM124169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1650113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Díaz</surname><given-names>Roberto Efraín</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Díaz</surname><given-names>Roberto Efraín</given-names></name><name><surname>Locksley</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and structural investigations of the pH adaptability of mouse Acidic Mammalian Chitinase offer insights for designing enhanced enzyme variants that can function in both lung and gut.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chitin, a polymer of β(1-4)-linked <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), is the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature. Chitin is present in numerous pathogens, such as nematode parasites, dust mites, and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabib and Bowers, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2015</xref>), and is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that activates mammalian innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elieh Ali Komi et al., 2018</xref>). To mitigate constant exposure to environmental chitin, mammals have evolved unusual multi-gene loci that are highly conserved and encode chitin-response machinery, including chitin-binding (chi-lectins) and chitin-degrading (chitinases) proteins.</p><p>Humans express two active chitinases as well as five chitin-binding proteins that recognize chitin across many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bussink et al., 2007</xref>). Chitin levels can be potentially important for mammalian lung and gastrointestinal health. These tissues have distinct pH, with the lung environment normally ~pH 7.0 and the stomach environment normally ~pH 2.0, which raises the question of how chitin-response machinery has evolved to function optimally across such diverse chemical environments. Acidic Mammalian Chitinase (AMCase, also known as Chia, for chitinase, acidic) was originally discovered in the stomach and named for its acidic isoelectric point. AMCase is also constitutively expressed in the lungs at low levels and overexpressed upon chitin exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Van Dyken and Locksley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reese et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting this single enzyme has evolved to perform its function under vastly different chemical conditions. Chitin clearance is particularly important for mammalian pulmonary health, where exposure to and accumulation of chitin can be deleterious. In the absence of AMCase, chitin accumulates in the airways, leading to epithelial stress, chronic activation of type 2 immunity, and age-related pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Dyken et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Van Dyken and Locksley, 2018</xref>).</p><p>AMCase is a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family 18 (GH18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies and Henrissat, 1995</xref>), the members of which hydrolyze sugar linkages through a conserved two-step mechanism where the glycosidic oxygen is protonated by an acidic residue and a nucleophile adds into the anomeric carbon leading to elimination of the hydrolyzed product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This mechanism is corroborated by structures of different GH18 chitinases, most notably <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Chitinase A (PDB ID: 1FFQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Papanikolau et al., 2003</xref>).

This result suggested that mAMCase exhibits two distinct pH optima, which is unlike most enzymes that exhibit a shift or broadening of enzymatic activity across conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sajedi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhunia et al., 2011</xref>). For mAMCase the global maximum near pH 2.0 resembles the chemical environments of the stomach and the local maximum near pH 7.0 is similar to the environment of the lung. These two pH optima in the same enzyme suggest that mAMCase may employ different mechanisms to perform its function in different environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seibold et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, the human homolog has maximal activity at pH 4.6 with sharply declining activity at more acidic and basic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seibold et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou et al., 2006</xref>). This optimum corresponds with the pH of lung tissue in pulmonary fibrosis and other disease contexts, suggesting that hAMCase may have been selected for its ability to clear chitin from the lungs and restore healthy lung function.</p><p>The activity of mAMCase has been previously measured through endpoint experiments with limited insight into the rate of catalysis, substrate affinity, and potential substrate inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seibold et al., 2009</xref>). While the pH profile of mAMCase has been reported as a percentage of maximum activity at a given pH, it is unclear how the individual kinetic parameters (<italic>K</italic>M or <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boot et al., 2001</xref>). These gaps have made it challenging to define the mechanism by which mAMCase shows distinct enzymatic optima at different pHs. One possibility is that mAMCase undergoes structural rearrangements to support this adaptation. Alternatively AMCase may have subtly different mechanisms for protonating the catalytic glutamic acid depending on the environmental pH.</p><p>In this work, we explore these hypotheses by employing biophysical, biochemical, and computational approaches to observe and quantify mAMCase function at different pHs. We measured the mAMCase hydrolysis of chitin, which revealed significant activity increase under more acidic conditions compared to neutral or basic conditions. To understand the relationship between catalytic residue protonation state and pH-dependent enzyme activity, we calculated the theoretical pKa of the active site residues and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of mAMCase at various pHs. We also directly observed conformational and chemical features of mAMCase between pH 4.74 and 5.60 by solving X-ray crystal structures of mAMCase in complex with oligomeric GlcNAcn across this range. Together these data support a model in which mAMCase employs two different mechanisms for obtaining a proton in a pH-dependent manner, providing a refined explanation as to how this enzyme recognizes its substrate in disparate environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>New assay confirms broad pH profile for mAMCase</title><p>Prior studies have focused on relative mAMCase activity at different pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seibold et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kashimura et al., 2015</xref>), limiting the ability to define its enzymological properties precisely and quantitatively across conditions of interest. To expand upon these previous observations of dual optima in mAMCase activity at pH 2.0 and 7.0, we measured mAMCase activity in vitro. We developed an approach that would enable direct measurement of <italic>k</italic>cat and <italic>K</italic>M for mAMCase across a broad pH range by modifying a prior assay that continuously measures mAMCase-dependent breakdown of a fluorogenic chitin analog, 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) conjugated chitobioside. To overcome the pH-dependent fluorescent properties of 4MU-chitobioside, we reverted the assay into an endpoint assay, which allowed us to measure substrate breakdown across different pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We conducted our endpoint assay across a pH range of 2.0–7.4 to reflect the range of physiological conditions at its in vivo sites of action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; Data available at doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8250616">10.5281/zenodo.8250616</ext-link>). We then derived the Michaelis-Menten parameters at each pH value measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; Data available at doi: 10.5281/zenodo.8250616). We found that mAMCase has maximum activity at pH 2.0 with a secondary local maximum at pH 6.5, pointing to a bimodal distribution of activity across pH. This is consistent with the relative activity measurements previously performed on mAMCase, but distinct from a single broad pH range, as has been observed for <italic>k</italic>cat of hAMCase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seibold et al., 2009</xref>). The two maxima at pH 2.0 and 6.5 are an approximate match the pH at the primary in vivo sites of mAMCase expression, the stomach and lungs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seibold et al., 2009</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that mAMCase, unlike other AMCase homologs, may have evolved an unusual mechanism to accommodate multiple physiological conditions.</p><p>We also found that low pH primarily improves the rate of mAMCase catalysis 6.3-fold (<italic>k</italic>cat; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), whereas <italic>K</italic>M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) worsens 2.5-fold from pH 7.4 to pH 2.0. Similar to chitotriosidase the other active chitinase in mammals and also a GH18 chitinase, we observe an apparent reduction in the rate of mAMCase catalysis across all pH values measured at 4MU-chitobioside concentrations above 80 μM, which suggests that mAMCase may be subject to product inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilera et al., 2003</xref>). The underlying mechanism for the observed product inhibition may be that mAMCase can transglycosylate the products, as has been previously observed at pH 2.0 and 7.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wakita et al., 2017</xref>). This potential product inhibition leads to a systematic underprediction of rates by the Michaelis-Menten model at high substrate concentrations. The catalytic efficiency (<italic>kcat</italic>/<italic>K</italic>M) of mAMCase may not capture the effects of product inhibition given that these constants reflect sub-saturating substrate concentrations. Independent of the potential for product inhibition, the trend that mAMCase has highest kcat at very low pH and another local optimum at more neutral pH is clear. We hypothesize that these activity data resemble two overlapping activity distributions, suggesting that the rate at lower pH activity is dependent on the concentration of free protons in solution and that the higher pH optimum results from a distinct mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Characterization of mAMCase ligand occupancy and conformational heterogeneity</title><p>Our biochemical analyses led us to hypothesize that the pH-dependent activity profile of mAMCase is linked to the mechanism by which catalytic residues are protonated. Previous structural studies on AMCase have focused on interactions between inhibitors like methylallosamidin and the catalytic domain of the protein. We built on these efforts by solving the structure of mAMCase in complex with oligomeric GlcNAcn, the building block of chitin. We used chitin oligomers because they are chemically identical to polymeric chitin found in nature but are soluble and therefore more amenable for co-crystallization than crystalline chitin is. We successfully determined high resolution X-ray crystal structures of the apo mAMCase catalytic domain at pH 5.0 and 8.0 (PDB ID: 8FG5, 8FG7) and holo mAMCase catalytic domain between pH 4.74–5.60 in

In all of our datasets, we observed continuous ligand density that resembled higher order chitin oligomers (e.g. GlcNAc<sub>4</sub>, GlcNAc<sub>5</sub>, or GlcNAc<sub>6</sub>). This observation was confusing given that these structures were co-crystallized with either GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> or GlcNAc<sub>3</sub>. For example, due to the continuous nature of ligand density observed in our mAMCase-GlcNAc<sub>3</sub> co-crystal structure at pH 4.74 (PDB ID: 8GCA, chain A), we initially modeled hexaacetyl-chitohexaose (H-(GlcNAc)6-OH) into the –4 to +2 sugar-binding subsites, using the nomenclature for sugar-binding subsites from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 1997</xref>. This nomenclature defines the sugar-binding subsites as <italic>-n</italic> to <italic>+n</italic>, with <italic>-n</italic> corresponding to the non-reducing end and <italic>+n</italic> the reducing end.</p><p>We next continued with a modeling approach that replaced higher order oligomer models with models that only used the chemically defined oligomers present in the crystallization drop. To accomplish this modeling of different binding poses, we placed multiple copies of these oligomers consistent with an interpretation of extensive conformational heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In one sample co-crystallized with GlcNAc<sub>3</sub> at pH 4.74 (PDB ID: 8GCA, chains A-B), we identified ligand density that was consistent with GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that some hydrolysis occurs in the crystal. The resulting model includes compositional heterogeneity as there are both types of oligomer present.</p><p>Therefore, across all of our datasets, we modeled a combination of ligand binding events consisting of overlapping GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> or GlcNAc<sub>3</sub> molecules at each sugar-binding site, i.e. GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> ResID 401 Conf. A occupied subsites –3 to –2 while GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> ResID 401 Conf. C occupied subsites –2 to –1. By providing each ligand molecule with an alternative conformation ID, this allowed both occupancies and B-factors to be refined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B and C</xref>; additional details in Methods). Across these different datasets, we observed ligand density for different combinations of occupancy over the –4 to +2 sugar-binding subsites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While modeling chito-oligomers into strong electron density, we observed strong positive difference density between sugar-binding subsites near the C2 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl and the C6’ alcohol moieties. Using the non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) ‘ghost’ feature in <italic>Coot</italic>, we were then able to observe that the positive difference density between ligand subsites in one chain could be explained by the dominant ligand pose observed in another associated crystallographic chain, suggesting the presence of a low-occupancy binding events. This observation led to the discovery that GlcNAcn occupies intermediate subsites, which we label n+0.5, continuing to follow the nomenclature established by Davies et al., in addition to canonical sugar-binding subsites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 1997</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of sugar-binding subsites in mAMCase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PDB ID: 8GCA, chain A.

During ligand refinement, we observed density for both the α- and β–1,4-linked GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> anomers in the active site. This unexpected configurational heterogeneity, which is observable because of the high resolution of our datasets (1.30–1.95 Å), likely formed as a result of equilibration between the two anomers through an oxocarbenium close-ion-pair intermediate. The ability for the active site to accommodate and form interactions with these ligands is important given its role in degrading crystalline chitin, a complex and often recalcitrant substrate that likely requires multiple binding events by AMCase before degradation can occur. We did not identify consistent trends between the contents of the crystallization drop (pH, substrate identity, and substrate concentration), the crystal properties (space group, unit cell dimensions, resolution), and the resulting density in the active site; however, as outlined below, the protein conformations and substrate states are highly correlated. Collectively, modeling a combination of ligand binding modes, linkages, and anomers allowed us to interpret the resulting coordinates in a more complete model of how mAMCase coordinates and stabilizes polymeric chitin for catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structural characterization of mAMCase catalytic triad D<sub>1</sub>xD<sub>2</sub>xE</title><p>We interpreted the protein-ligand interactions along the canonical binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As with other chitinases, we observe a network of tryptophans consisting of Trp31, Trp360, Trp99, and Trp218 stabilizing the positioning of the ligand into the binding site through a series of H-π interactions with the −3,–1,+1, and +2 sugars, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watanabe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zakariassen et al., 2009</xref>). These interactions are primarily with the axial hydrogens of the respective sugars but also include the N-H of the –3 and +1 sugar and the 6’ O-H of the +2 sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Further, we observe Asp213 accepting a hydrogen bond with the 6’ OH of the –1 sugar and Tyr141 acting as a hydrogen bond donor to the 6’ OH of the +1 sugar. These two hydrogen bonds likely orient the ligand in the catalytically competent pose where the glycosidic oxygen bridging the –1 and +1 sugars is 2.8 Å away from the acidic Glu140 -OH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). With this proximity, Glu140 can act as a hydrogen bond donor to the strained (122o bond angle) bridging oxygen forming a hydrogen bond to promote the formation of an oxazolinium intermediate and subsequent cleavage of the glycosidic bond. We observed two interactions with the sugar in the –4 position supporting the ligand orientation far from the enzymatic active site. Residues involved in ligand binding and catalysis adopt similar side chain conformations in the absence of ligand (PDB ID: 8FG5, 8FG7), suggesting that the active site is organized prior to ligand binding and not subject to ligand-stabilized conformational changes.</p><p>We hypothesize that the +1’ subsite is primarily occupied by the product GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> prior to its displacement from the active site by subsequent sliding of polymeric chitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiménez-Ortega et al., 2021</xref>). At this position, Trp99 and Trp218 engage in CH-π interactions with the +1 and+2 sugars, respectively while Asp213 forms a new H-bond with the carbonyl oxygen and Tyr141 retains an H-bond with the hydroxyl moiety on the +1 sugar. We are able to observe this post-catalysis binding mode due to the stabilizing interactions between GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> and Asp213, Trp99, Trp218, and Tyr141 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together, these observations highlight the dynamic chitin binding modes within the mAMCase active site. Collectively, the observed non-canonical binding modes of these sugars is consistent with previous observations that once bound to polymeric chitin, GH18 chitinases engage in chain sliding from the reducing end of the substrate following catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the largely static interactions outlined above, we observed conformational heterogeneity in the catalytically critical Asp138 residue, suggesting flipping between two equally stable states facing each of the other two residues in the catalytic triad (Asp136 or Glu140; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Aalten et al., 2001</xref>). Using Ringer, we confirmed that there are two Asp138 conformations and only a single conformation for Asp136 and Glu140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; Data available at doi: 10.5281/zenodo.7758815; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lang et al., 2010</xref>). Across 20 chains from the datasets derived from different pH and co-crystallization conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), we quantified whether Asp138 is preferentially oriented towards Asp136 (<italic>inactive</italic> conformation) or preferentially oriented towards Glu140 (<italic>active</italic> conformation).</p><p>Prior work has suggested that Asp138 orients itself towards Glu140 to promote stabilization of the substrate’s twisted boat conformation in the –1 subsite. Therefore, we explored if Asp138 conformation is correlated with ligand pose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Olland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Aalten et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fusetti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Songsiriritthigul et al., 2008</xref>). As previously mentioned, we assign alternative conformation IDs to each ligand molecule based on its subsite positioning. We calculate subsite occupancy by taking the sum of all alternative ligand conformations at a given subsite, i.e. the occupancy of subsite –2 is equal to the occupancies of GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> ResID 401 Conf. A and GlcNAc2 ResID 401 Conf. C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; see Methods for additional details; Data available at doi: 10.5281/zenodo.7905828). We observe a strong positive correlation between Asp138 conformation and ligand pose only in the –2 to +1 subsites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). When the –1 subsite is at least 50% occupied, Asp138 prefers the <italic>active</italic> conformation (up towards Glu140). In this orientation, Asp138(HD2) forms a H-bond with Glu140(OE1) (2.6 Å) while Asp138(OD1) forms an H-bond with the amide nitrogen of GlcNAc in the –1 subsite (2.6 Å). Glu140(OE2) is 2.8 Å away from the glycosidic oxygen bridging the –1 and +1 sugars. We suspect that the inverse correlation between Asp138 <italic>active</italic> conformation and the –2.5 and –1.5 sugar-binding subsites represents ligand translocation toward the catalytic residues, prior to enzyme engagement with the ligand. When chitin occupies a canonical sugar-binding subsite, AMCase forms stabilizing H-bonds with the ligand prior to catalysis. These observations are consistent with the proposed catalytic mechanism where upon protonation, the equilibrium between Asp138 conformations shifts to favor the <italic>active</italic> conformation (toward Glu140) where Asp138 stabilizes Glu140 in proximity to the glycosidic oxygen prior to catalysis.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Asp138 orientation correlates with ligand subsite occupancy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PDB ID: 8FR9, chain B.

PROPKA does not account for alternative conformations in its calculations, so we split our protein models to contain single conformations of the catalytic residues Asp136, Asp138, and Glu140. While PROPKA does account for ligands in its calculations, running the calculations with different alternative conformations of GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> or GlcNAc<sub>3</sub> had little effect on the calculated pKas for the active site residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; Data available at doi: 10.5281/zenodo.7905863). Despite the observed ligand heterogeneity, we observe a relatively narrow range of pKa values for the catalytic triad. This suggests that the pKa of the catalytic residues is primarily influenced by the position of nearby residues and that the placement of solvent or ligand molecules has little effect. When Asp138 is oriented towards Asp136 (<italic>the inactive</italic> conformation), the pKa of the catalytic residues are 2.0, 13.0, 7.7 for Asp136, Asp138, and Glu140 respectively.

The accessibility of Asp138’s proton to Glu140 progressively decreases as pH increases from pH 2.0–6.5. In contrast, under neutral and basic conditions (pH 6.0–7.4), Asp138 can shuttle a proton from Asp136 by rotating about its Cα-Cβ bond to supply Glu140 with the proton. Glu140 subsequently uses the proton that it obtained from Asp138 to protonate the glycosidic bond in chitin, promoting hydrolysis as previously described in several chitinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Aalten et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Synstad et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bussink et al., 2008</xref>). While this mechanism could explain how mAMCase has a local optimum at pH 2.0, it is insufficient to explain why we do not observe a similar optimum in hAMCase. The narrow range of pKa values across GH18 chitinases suggest that differences in optimal activity by pH may be influenced by other factors, such as protein stability, conformational dynamics, or coordination of distal GlcNAc residues by ionizable residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mishra et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Molecular dynamics</title><p>Based on our enzymology results suggesting the possibility of differential activity between acidic pH (pH 2.0) and near neutral pH (pH 6.5) and theoretical pKa calculations of the active site residues, we performed short atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to interrogate the movement of catalytic residues. While all the crystal structures we obtained were collected in a narrow acidic pH range between 4.74–5.60, we ran simulations at pH 2.0 and pH 6.5, ensuring that the protonation states of side chains populated by 3DProtonate were supported by our PROPKA calculations (Data available at doi: 10.5281/zenodo.7758821; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Labute, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Olsson et al., 2011</xref>).

In contrast, at low pH Asp136 is protonated, yet continues to form a weaker hydrogen bond with Asp138 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> - Step 1). Glu140 (pKa = 7.7) is protonated across the enzyme’s active pH range. Upon ligand binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> - Step 2), Glu140 stabilizes the sugar at the –1 subsite. The ligand then translocates forward by one GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> to occupy the +1 and+2 subsites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> - Step 3). At neutral pH, Asp136 is predominantly deprotonated. When protonation of Asp136 occurs, this destabilizes the Asp136-Asp138 hydrogen bond and allows Asp138 to rotate about its Cα-Cβ bond into the <italic>active</italic> conformation (towards Glu140). However, since Asp136 is always protonated at low pH, the Asp136-Asp138 hydrogen bond is less energetically favorable, therefore Asp138 can adopt the <italic>active</italic> conformation more readily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>- Step 4).</p><p>Once Asp138 is in the <italic>active</italic> conformation<italic>,</italic> Asp138 and Glu140 form stabilizing interactions with the <italic>N</italic>-acetyl group of the ligand, priming it to become the nucleophile required for catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> - Step 4). Glu140 provides its ionizable proton to the ligand’s glycosidic oxygen, increasing the electrophilicity of the anomeric carbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> - Step 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iino et al., 2019</xref>). The carbonyl oxygen of the –1 sugar <italic>N</italic>-acetyl group then nucleophilically adds into the anomeric carbon from the β face to cleave the glycosidic bond, forming the oxazolinium intermediate. At neutral pH, the resultant deprotonated Glu140 is then re-protonated through proton shuttling in which Asp136 donates its proton to Asp138 and Asp138 donates its ionizable proton to Glu140. At acidic pH, we propose that Glu140 can be directly re-protonated by a proton in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> - Step 5). At a neutral pH, this leads to Asp138 returning to an <italic>inactive</italic> conformation. However, at low pH Asp136 and Glu140 are both protonated due to the high concentration of protons in solution, allowing Asp138 to remain in the <italic>active</italic> conformation and form stabilizing interactions with the <italic>N</italic>-acetyl group on the ligand. The oxazolinium intermediate is then hydrolyzed by a water molecule, generating a GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> catalysis product in the +1 and+2 sugar subsites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> - Step 6). The GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> product dissociates from the +1 to+2 sugar subsites, then the ligand undergoes ‘decrystallization’ and ‘chain sliding’ before re-entering the catalytic cycle, assuming AMCase is bound to a longer polymer such as its natural substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>). At neutral pH this catalytic mechanism is reset with Asp138 in its <italic>inactive</italic> conformation, however at low pH the catalytic mechanism is reset with Asp138 already in the <italic>active</italic> conformation. This could lead to faster rates of catalysis at lower pH compared to the neutral pH mechanism, providing a possible explanation for the observed changes in rate at varying pH.</p><p>While our model helps us propose a plausible explanation of why mAMCase is highly active at pH 2, it does not explain why hAMCase has a single activity optimum around pH 5.</p><p>Prior work by Kashimura et al. has demonstrated that <italic>E. coli</italic>-expressed mAMCase is remarkably stable across a broad pH range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kashimura et al., 2013</xref>).

We identified ionizable residues on mAMCase that likely contribute to its overall stability and are not present in hAMCase. Mutations Lys78Gln, Asp82Gly, and Lys160Gln result in the loss of surface-stabilizing salt bridges in hAMCase and may contribute to its reduced activity at more acidic pH. It is likely that the dual pH optima of mAMCase is intrinsic to the catalytic mechanism, where Glu140 can be protonated directly from solution (at low pH) or through proton shuttling across the catalytic triad (at neutral pH; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, hAMCase is likely too destabilized at low pH to observe an increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>. hAMCase may be under less pressure to maintain high activity at low pH due to humans’ noninsect-based diet, which contains less chitin compared to other mammals with primarily insect-based diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tabata et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data demonstrate the importance of using structural and biochemical assays to develop our understanding of the catalytic mechanism governing mAMCase activity. Using biochemical and structural methods, we have developed a detailed model of how AMCase fulfills its role in chitin recognition and degradation. Small chitin oligomers are ideal for measuring the ability of AMCase to cleave β–1,4-glycosidic linkages between GlcNAc units, but these small oligomers do not represent the complex crystalline chitin encountered by AMCase in the lung. It is difficult to extrapolate the effects we observe using small chitin oligomers to binding (<italic>k</italic>on), processivity (<italic>k</italic>proc), catalysis (<italic>k</italic>cat), or product release (<italic>k</italic>off) on the native large and heterogeneous oligomeric substrates. In the future, we hope to be able to directly visualize the mAMCase-chitin interactions and characterize each step of the catalytic mechanism including decrystallization, degradation, product release, and chain sliding (also known as processivity).</p><p>To further understand the impact of pH on the structure of AMCase, it will be necessary to crystallize AMCase across a broader pH range that may expose conformational and structural changes that contribute to mAMCase’s unique pH activity profile. Our simulations have important limitations that could be overcome by quantum mechanical simulations that allow for changes in protonation state and improved consideration of polarizability. Further, neutron diffraction crystallography could provide novel critical insight into the placement of protons across the active site and help to develop a more complete model of mAMCase’s catalytic mechanism at different pH. Understanding the mechanistic basis behind an enzyme’s dual pH optima will enable us to engineer proteins with tunable pH optima to develop improved enzyme variants for therapeutic purposes for diseases, such as asthma and lung fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Protein expression and purification mAMCase catalytic domain (UniProt: Q91XA9; residues 22–391) was cloned into a pTwist CMV [pmRED006; Twist Biosciences; Addgene ID: 200228] or pcDNA3.1(+) [pmRED013; Genscript; Addgene ID: 200229] expression vector with a C-terminal 6xHis tag.

Default refinement parameters were used, except the fact that five refinement macrocycles were carried out per iteration and water molecules were automatically added to peaks in the 2mFo-DFc electron density map higher than 3.5 Å. The minimum model-water distance was set to 1.8 Å, and a maximum model-water distance was set to 6 Å. For later rounds of refinement, hydrogens were added to riding positions using <italic>phenix.ready_set</italic>, and B-factors were refined anisotropically for non-hydrogen and non-water atoms. Following two initial rounds of iterative model building and refinement using the aforementioned strategy, we began introducing additional parameters into the model, enabled by the extraordinarily high resolution of our diffraction data. First, we implemented anisotropic atomic displacement parameters for heavy atoms (C, N, O, and S), followed by refinement of explicit hydrogen atom positions. A final round of refinement was performed without updating water molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Apo data collection, processing, and refinement at room temperature</title><p>Diffraction data were collected at the beamline ALS 8.3.1 at 277 K.

The model PDB file was opened in MOE and solvated in a sphere of water 10 Å away from the protein. This system then underwent structural preparation for simulations using the standard parameters with the AMBER14 forcefield. The system then was protonated to set pH {2.0, 6.5} based on sidechain pKa predictions using the 3DProtonate menu followed by confirmation of appropriate protonation by PROPKA calculations. Protonated models underwent energy minimization by steepest descent before simulations were set up. Equilibration was performed for 10 ps followed by 100 ps of thermal gradient equilibration from 0K to 300K. A thermal bath equilibration was run for 100 ps before the production runs were started. Productions were run for 10 ns with a time step of 0.5 fs to not overshoot bond vibrations. The simulation was sampled every 10 ps for subsequent data analysis which was performed using the MOE database viewer and replotted using GraphPad Prism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>S.J.V.D. and R.M.L. are listed as inventors on a patent United States application: 17/505,561 for the use of chitinases to treat fibrotic lung disease.

The study includes biochemical assays to establish kinetic parameters at different solution pH, structural studies of enzyme/substrate complexes, and theoretical analysis of amino acid side chain pKas and molecular dynamics.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The biochemical assays are rigorous and nicely complemented by the structural and computational analysis. The mechanistic proposal that results from the study is well rationalized by the observations in the study.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The overall significance of the work could be made more clear. Additional details could be provided about the limitations of prior biochemical studies of mAMC that warranted the kinetic analysis. The mouse enzyme seems unique in terms of its behavior at high and low pH, so it remains unclear how the work will enhance broader understanding of this enzyme class. It was also not clear can the findings be used for therapeutic purposes, as detailed in the abstract, if the human enzyme works differently.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the paper to address these concerns</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) Regarding the pH profiles of mouse AMCase, previous studies have reported its activity at pH 2.0 and within the pH range of 3-7. In this paper, the authors conducted kinetic measurements and showed that pH 6.5 is optimal for kcat/Km. The authors emphasize the significance of mouse AMCase's activity in the neutral region, particularly at pH 6.5, for understanding its physiological relevance in humans. To provide a comprehensive overview, it would be valuable for the authors to summarize the findings from previous and current studies, discuss their implications for future pulmonary therapy in humans, and cite relevant literature. Additionally, the authors should highlight their research's specific contributions and novel findings, such as the determination of kinetic parameters (Kcat and Km) under different pH conditions. Emphasizing why previous studies may have required these observations and underscoring the importance of the present findings in addressing those knowledge gaps will help readers understand the significance of the study and its impact on the field of enzymology.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In keeping with the knowledge gaps addressed directly by this paper, we have not augmented the discussion of future pulmonary therapy in humans. We have summarized the present findings at the end of the introduction as follows:</p><p>“We measured the mAMCase hydrolysis of chitin, which revealed significant activity increase under more acidic conditions compared to neutral or basic conditions. To understand the relationship between catalytic residue protonation state and pH-dependent enzyme activity, we calculated the theoretical pKa of the active site residues and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of mAMCase at various pHs. We also directly observed conformational and chemical features of mAMCase between pH 4.74 to 5.60 by solving X-ray crystal structures of mAMCase in complex with oligomeric GlcNAcn across this range.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Regarding the implications of the pKa values and Asp138 orientation for the pH optima, it would be valuable for the authors to discuss the variations in optimal activity by pH among GH-18 chitinases and investigate the underlying factors contributing to these differences. In particular, exploring the role of Asp138 orientation in chitotriosidase, another mammalian chitinase, would provide important insights. Chitotriosidase is known to be inactive at pH 2.0, and it would be interesting to investigate whether the observed orientation of Asp138 towards Glu140 in mouse AMCase for pH 2.0 activity is lacking in chitotriosidase.</p></disp-quote><p>There are similar rotations of the two acidic residues in the literature on Chit1. The variety of crystal pH conditions and the lack of a straightforward mechanism for pKa shifts in AMCase make it difficult to draw a comparison to why Chit1 is inactive at low pH, but this is an interesting area for future study. See a more full discussion in: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2760363/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2760363/</ext-link></p><p>Furthermore, considering the lower activity of human AMCase at pH 2.0, it would be worthwhile to examine whether the Asp138 orientation towards Glu140, as observed in mouse AMCase, is also absent in human AMCase. Exploring this aspect will help determine if the orientation of Asp138 plays a critical role in pH-dependent activity in human AMCase.</p><p>The situation for hAMCase is similar to Chit1 as the rotations observed here for mAMCase are also present. It is not the whether Asp138 can rotate, but rather the relevant energetic penalties as we discuss in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In a previous study by Okawa et al.(Loss and gain of human acidic mammalian chitinase activity by nonsynonymous SNPs. Mol Biol Evol 33, 3183-3193, 2016), it was reported that specific amino acid substitutions (N45D, D47N, and R61M) encoded by nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in the N-terminal region of human AMCase had distinct effects on its chitinolytic activity. Introducing these three residues (N45D, D47N, and R61M) could activate human AMCase. This activation significantly shifted the optimal pH from 4-5 to 2.0.</p><p>Considering the significant impact of these amino acid substitutions on the pH-dependent activity of human AMCase, the authors should discuss this point in the manuscript's discussion section. Incorporating the findings and relating them to the current study's observations on pH optima and Asp138 orientation can provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing pH-dependent activity in AMCase.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a citation and dicuss how the mutations identified by this study could potentially shift the pKa of key catalytic residues:</p><p>“Okawa et al identified how primate AMCase lost activity by integration of specific, potentially pKa-shifting, mutations relative to the mouse counterpart42b.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) To further strengthen the discussion, the authors could explore the ancestral insectivorous nature of placental mammals and the differences in chitinase activity between herbivorous and omnivorous species. Incorporating these aspects would add depth and relevance to the overall discussion of AMCase. AMCase is an enzyme known for its role in digesting insect chitin in the stomachs of various insectivorous and omnivorous animals, including bats, mice, chickens, pigs, pangolins, common marmosets, and crab-eating monkeys 1-7. However, in certain animals, such as dogs (carnivores) and cattle (herbivores), AMCase expression and activity are significantly low, leading to impaired chitin digestion 8. These observations suggest a connection between dietary habits and the expression and activity of the AMCase gene, ultimately influencing chitin digestibility across different animal species 8.</p><p>(1) Strobelet al.

This will provide transparency and enable readers to understand the boundaries of the study's findings. A comprehensive discussion of limitations would contribute to a more robust interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a sentence to the discussion:</p><p>“Our simulations have important limitations that could be overcome by quantum mechanical simulations that allow for changes in protonation state and improved consideration of polarizability.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) Regarding the naming of AMCase, it is important to accurately describe it based on its acidic isoelectric point rather than its enzymatic activity under acidic conditions based on the original paper (Reference #14 (Boot, R. G. et al). Identification of a novel acidic mammalian chitinase distinct from chitotriosidase. J. Biol. Chem. 276, 6770-6778 (2001)).</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this modification</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the introduction, providing more context regarding the terminology of acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) would be beneficial. While AMCase was initially discovered in mice and humans, subsequent research has revealed its presence in various vertebrates, including birds, fish, and other species. Therefore, it would be appropriate to include the alternative enzyme name, Chia (chitinase, acidic), in the introduction to reflect its broader distribution across different organisms. This clarification would enhance the readers' understanding of the enzyme's taxonomy and facilitate further exploration of its functional significance in diverse biological systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this modification</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors mention that AMCase is active in tissues with neutral pHs, such as the lung. However, it is important to consider that the pH in the lung is lower, around 5, due to the presence of dissolved CO2 that forms carbonic acid. The lung microenvironment is known to vary, and specific regions or conditions within the lung may have slightly different pH levels. By addressing the pH conditions in the lungs and their relationship to AMCase's activity, the authors can enhance our understanding of the enzyme's function within its physiological context. A thorough discussion of the specific pH conditions in the lung and their implications for AMCase's activity would provide valuable insights into the enzyme's role in lung pathophysiology.</p></disp-quote><p>To keep the focus on the insights we have made, we have elected not to expand this discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It would be helpful for the authors to provide more information about the substrate or products of AMCase. The basic X-ray crystal structures used in this study are GlcNAc2 or GlcNAc3, known products of AMCase. Including details about the specific ligands involved in the enzymatic reactions would enhance the understanding of the study's focus.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unclear about what this means - and since it is a minor comment, we have elected not to change the discussion of substrates here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors should critically evaluate the inclusion of the term &quot;chitin-binding&quot; in the Abstract and Introduction. Suppose substantial evidence or discussion regarding the specific chitin-binding properties of the enzyme or its relevance to the immune response needs to be included. In that case, removing or modifying that statement might be appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unclear about what this means - and since it is a minor comment, we have elected not to change the discussion of “chitin-binding” here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors developed an endpoint assay to measure the activity of mouse AMCase across a broad pH range, allowing for direct measurement of kinetic parameters. The authors should provide a more detailed description of the methods used, including any specific modifications made to the previous assay, to ensure reproducibility and facilitate further research in the field. It is important to clearly show the novelty of their endpoint assay compared to previous methods employed in other reports. The authors should also explain how their modified endpoint assay differs from existing assays and highlight its advancements or improvements. This will help readers understand the unique features and contributions of the assay in the context of previous methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a detailed method description and figures already. See also our previous paper by Barad which includes other, related, assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors suggest that mouse AMCase may be subject to product inhibition, potentially due to its transglycosylation activity, which can affect the Michaelis-Menten model predictions at high substrate concentrations. However, the reviewer needed help understanding the specific impact of transglycosylation on the kinetic parameters. It would be helpful for the authors to provide a more appropriate and detailed explanation, clarifying how transglycosylation activity influences the kinetic behavior of AMCase and its implications for the observed results.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments to conclusively demonstrate this are beyond our current capabilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) In the Abstract, the authors state, &quot;We also solved high resolution crystal structures of mAMCase in complex with chitin, where we identified extensive conformational ligand heterogeneity.&quot; This reviewer suggests replacing &quot;chitin&quot; with &quot;oligomeric GlcNAcn&quot; throughout the text, specifically about biochemical experiments. It is important to accurately describe the experimental conditions and ligands used in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made these changes throughout the manuscript</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) In the introduction, the authors mention &quot;a polymer of β(1-4)-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc)&quot;. In this case, the letter &quot;N&quot; should be italicized to conform to the proper notation for the monosaccharide abbreviation.</p></disp-quote><p>corrected (and hopefully would have been done so by the copy editor!)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) In the introduction, the authors state, &quot;In the absence of AMCase, chitin accumulates in the airways, leading to epithelial stress, chronic activation of type 2 immunity, and age-related pulmonary fibrosis5,6&quot;. It is recommended to clarify that &quot;AMCase&quot; refers to &quot;acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase)&quot; in this context, as it is the first mention of the enzyme in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We moved that section so that it flows better and is introduced with the full name.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) In the introduction, the authors state, &quot;Mitigating the negative effects of high chitin levels is particularly important for mammalian lung and gastrointestinal health.&quot; This reviewer requests further clarification on the connection between chitin and gastrointestinal health. Please provide an explanation or reference to support this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified this sentence to:</p><p>“Chitin levels can be potentially important for mammalian lung and gastrointestinal health.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) In the introduction, the authors mention that &quot;Acidic Mammalian Chitinase (AMCase) was originally discovered in the stomach and named for its high enzymatic activity under acidic conditions.&quot; It is recommended to include Reference #14 (Boot et al. J. Biol. Chem. 276, 6770-6778, 2001) as it provides the first report on mouse and human AMCase, contributing to the understanding of the enzyme.</p><p>However, it is worth noting that while this paragraph primarily focuses on human tissues, Reference #14 primarily discusses mouse AMCase but also reports on human AMCase. Additionally, References #8 and #9 mainly discuss mouse AMCase. This creates confusion in the description of human and mouse AMCase within the paragraph.</p><p>Considering that this paper aims to focus on the unique features of mouse AMCase, it is suggested that the authors provide a more specific and balanced description of both human and mouse AMCase throughout the main text..</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the origin of the name AMCase and the results distinguish the two orthologs in the text with h or mAMCase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Figure 1A in the Introduction section has been previously presented in several papers. The authors should consider moving this figure to the Results section and present an alternative figure based on their experimental results to enhance the novelty and impact of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have considered this option, but prefer the original placement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) In the Results section, the authors mentioned, &quot;Prior studies have focused on relative mAMCase activity at different pH18,20, limiting the ability to define its enzymological properties precisely and quantitatively across conditions of interest.&quot; It would be beneficial for the authors to include reference #14, the first report showing the pH profile of mouse AMCase, to support their statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this reference</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) Regarding the statement, &quot;To overcome the pH-dependent fluorescent properties of 4MU-chitobioside, we reverted the assay into an endpoint assay, which allowed us to measure substrate breakdown across different pH (Supplemental Figure 1A)&quot;, the authors should provide a more detailed description of the improvements made to measure AMCase activity. Additionally, it would be helpful to include a thorough explanation of the figure legend for Supplementary Figure 1A to provide clarity to readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a detailed method description and figures already. See also our previous paper by Barad which includes other, related, assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) Figure 1B shows that the authors used the AMCase catalytic domain. It would benefit the authors to explain the rationale behind this choice in the figure legend or the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is addressed in the text:</p><p>“Previous structural studies on AMCase have focused on interactions between inhibitors like methylallosamidin and the catalytic domain of the protein.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) For Figures 1C-E, it is recommended that the authors include error bars in their results to represent the variability or uncertainty of the data. In Figure 1E, the authors should clarify the units of the Y-axis (e.g., sec-1 µM-1). Additionally, in Figure 1F, the authors should explain how the catalytic acidity is shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added error bars and axis labels. Figure 1F is conceptual, so we are leaving it as is.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(18) The authors stated, &quot;These observations raise the possibility that mAMCase, unlike other AMCase homologs, may have evolved an unusual mechanism to accommodate multiple physiological conditions.&quot; It would be helpful for the authors to compare and discuss the pH-dependent AMCase activity of mouse AMCase with other AMCase homologs to support this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>That is an excellent idea for future comparative studies, but beyond the scope of what we are examining in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(19) The authors should explain Supplemental Figures 1B and C in the Results or Methods sections to provide context for these figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unclear about what this means - and since it is a minor comment, we have elected not to change these sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(20) Supplemental Figure 3 is missing any description. It would be important for the authors to include a mention of this figure in the main text before Supplemental Figure 4 to guide the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>The full legend is in there now and the reference to Supplemental 4 was mislabeled.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(21) For Supplemental Figure 4, the authors should explain the shape of the symbol used in the figure. Additionally, they should explain &quot;apo&quot; and &quot;holoenzyme&quot; in the context of this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Unclear what a shape means in this context - perhaps the confusion arises because these are violin plots showing distributions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(22) Table 1 requires a more detailed explanation of its contents. Additionally, Tables 2 and 3 need to be included. The authors should include these missing tables in the revised version and explain their contents appropriately.</p></disp-quote><p>Table 1 is the standard crystallographic table - there isn’t much more detailed explanation that can be offered. Tables 2 and 3 were not transferred properly by BioRxiv but were included in the review packet as requested a day after submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(23) In Figure 4, it would be beneficial to enlarge Panels A-C to improve the ease of comprehension for readers. Additionally, it is recommended to use D136, D138, and E140 instead of D1, D2, and E to label the respective parts. The authors should also explain the meaning of the symbol used in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Since it is a minor comment, we have elected not to change these figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(24) In Figure 5, it would be beneficial to enlarge Panels A-C to improve the ease of comprehension for readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Since it is a minor comment, we have elected not to change these figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(25) Similarly, in Figure 6, all panels should be enlarged to enhance the ease of comprehension for readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Since it is a minor comment, we have elected not to change these figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In general, I did not identify many detailed or technical concerns with the work. A few items for the authors to consider are listed below.</p><p>(1) The interpretation of the crystallographic datasets seems complicated by the heterogeneity in the substrate component. It might be nice to see more critical analysis of the approach here. Are there other explanations or possible models that were considered? Do other structures of chitinases or other polysaccharide hydrolases exhibit the same phenomenon?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried in writing it to provide a very critical approach to this and it is quite likely that other structures contain unmodeled density containing similar heterogeneity (but it is just unmodeled).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It would be ideal to include more experimental validation of the proposed mechanism. Much of the manuscript includes theoretical validations (pKa estimation, dynamics, etc) - but it would be optimal to make an enzyme variant or do an experiment with a substrate analog.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes - we agree that follow on experiments are needed to fully test the mechanism and that those will be the subject of future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For an uninitiated reviewer, I think the major issue with this study is that the broader significance of the work and how it fits into the context of other work on these enzymes is not clear. It would be helpful to be more specific about what we know of mechanism from work on other enzymes to help the reader understand the motivation for this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a few additional references, guided by reviewer 1 comments, that should help in this respect.</p></body></sub-article></article>
