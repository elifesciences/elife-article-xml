adipogenesis. Accumulating evidence has suggested a role for mTORC1 signaling in the DNA damage response. This is mostly based on the findings that mTORC1 inhibitors sensitized cells to DNA damage. However, a direct role of the mTORC1-S6K1 signaling pathway in DNA repair and the mechanism by which this signaling pathway regulates DNA repair is unknown. In this study, we discovered a novel role for S6K1 in regulating DNA repair through the coordinated regulation of the cell cycle, homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair (HRR) and mismatch DNA repair (MMR) mechanisms. Here, we show that S6K1 orchestrates DNA repair by phosphorylation of Cdk1 at serine 39, causing G2/M cell cycle arrest enabling homologous recombination and by phosphorylation of MSH6 at serine 309, enhancing MMR. Moreover, breast cancer cells harboring <italic>RPS6KB1</italic> gene amplification show increased resistance to several DNA damaging agents and S6K1 expression is associated with poor survival of breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Our findings reveal an unexpected function of S6K1 in the DNA repair pathway, serving as a tumorigenic barrier by safeguarding genomic stability.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Damage to the DNA in our cells can cause harmful changes that, if unchecked, can lead to the development of cancer. To help prevent this, cellular mechanisms are in place to repair defects in the DNA. A particular process, known as the mTORC1-S6K1 pathway is suspected to be important for repair because when this pathway is blocked, cells become more sensitive to DNA damage.</p><p>It is still unknown how the various proteins involved in the mTORC1-S6K1 pathway contribute to repairing DNA. One of these proteins, S6K1, is an enzyme involved in coordinating cell growth and survival. The tumor cells in some forms of breast cancer produce more of this protein than normal, suggesting that S6K1 benefits these cells’ survival. However, it is unclear exactly how the enzyme does this.</p><p>Amar-Schwartz, Ben-Hur, Jbara et al. studied the role of S6K1 using genetically manipulated mouse cells and human cancer cells. These experiments showed that the protein interacts with two other proteins involved in DNA repair and activates them, regulating two different repair mechanisms and protecting cells against damage.</p><p>These results might explain why some breast cancer tumors are resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments, which aim to kill tumor cells by damaging their DNA. If this is the case, these findings could help clinicians choose more effective treatment options for people with cancers that produce additional S6K1. In the future, drugs that block the activity of the enzyme could make cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>S6K1</kwd><kwd>MSH6</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>MSH2</kwd><kwd>mTORC1</kwd><kwd>CDK1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>S6K1</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>MSH6</kwd><kwd>MSH2</kwd><kwd>Cdk1(CDC2)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1290/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karni</surname><given-names>Rotem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1501/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karni</surname><given-names>Rotem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003975</institution-id><institution>Israel Cancer Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20181132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karni</surname><given-names>Rotem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>682118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karni</surname><given-names>Rotem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unbiased proteomics and molecular analysis revealed a new role for S6K1 in regulating DNA repair through the orchestrated phosphorylation of CDK1 and MSH6.

When nutrients are available, mTORC1 phosphorylates its two main substrates, S6K1 (S6 Kinase 1) and 4E-BP1/2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding proteins 1 and 2), which are at the helm of cell growth, survival, translation, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mamane et al., 2006</xref>). Recent studies have pointed to a distinction between the mTORC1-S6K1 and the mTORC1-4EBP axes, arguing that the mTORC1-S6K1 axis regulates cell size and glucose metabolism with minor effects on translation and proliferation, while the mTORC1-4EBP axis appears to have a greater impact on translation, proliferation, and tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dowling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Whittaker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Manteuffel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Hur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruvinsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruvinsky and Meyuhas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pende et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>S6K1 is known for its ability to coordinate nutritional status and control cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruvinsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Magnuson et al., 2012</xref>) but its role in tumorigenesis remains elusive, even controversial. <italic>RPS6KB1</italic>, the gene encoding for S6K1, is located in chromosomal region 17q23 which is amplified in 8.8% of primary breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bärlund et al., 2000</xref>).

Our previous work had identified a cancer promoting alternative splicing switch that modulates between S6K1 long and short variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Hur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karni et al., 2007</xref>). While the short isoform of S6K1, which lacks kinase activity (termed here Iso-2), acts as an oncogenic driver and activates the mTORC1-4EBP axis, the long S6K1 variant (termed here S6K1) was shown to harbor tumor suppressive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Hur et al., 2013</xref>). This activity can only partially be explained by the known regulatory negative feedback loop of the Akt-mTORC1 signaling pathway mediated by S6K1 phosphorylation of the Insulin Receptor Substrate Protein 1 (IRS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Efeyan and Sabatini, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The mTORC1-S6K1 arm is best known for its role in nutrient-dependent signaling pathways underlying cell growth, and less for its role in DNA damage response (DDR). However, several reports have demonstrated that genotoxic stress regulates mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Sensing of DNA damage by mTORC1 is mediated through several pathways; Ras/MEK/ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Braunstein et al., 2009</xref>), ATM/LKB1/AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>) or other yet undiscovered mechanisms. mTOR inhibition has also been suggested to sensitize cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR) or to interstrand cross-linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bae-Jump et al., 2009</xref>). These reports suggest involvement of mTORC1 in DNA repair, though no formal proof has been established. Recently, it has been proposed that in response to double-strand breaks (DSBs), the mTORC1-S6K1 pathway transcriptionally regulates a key component of the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway ultimately reducing phosphorylated histone 2 A variant X (γ-H2AX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shen et al., 2013</xref>), a well-known surrogate marker of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonner et al., 2008</xref>). It was also reported that the insulin−IGF-1−PI3K−AKT pathway is implicated in DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsuoka et al., 2007</xref>) and S6K1, as well as Akt and other components of this pathway, were found to be phosphorylated on their ATM and ATR consensus sites in response to IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsuoka et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, S6K1 itself was implicated in DDR. Cells from S6K1/S6K2 double knockout mice show increased DNA damage, without any stimulus, as detected by increased γ-H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The gene encoding for S6K1, <italic>RBS6KB1</italic> is amplified in 8–10% of breast cancer tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bärlund et al., 2000</xref>). However, we previously reported that the long kinase active isoform of S6K1 acts as a tumor suppressor in certain conditions when it is overexpressed while the short kinase-dead isoform promotes oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Hur et al., 2013</xref>). These intriguing results are typical of genes that, on one hand, control an essential cellular process while, on the other hand, are an obstacle for certain cancer cells or reduce their fitness. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are good examples of genes whose loss promotes cancer development but also make the cancer cell vulnerable to DNA damage. Thus, we sought to examine if and how S6K1 is involved in the DNA damage response and in DNA damage repair. Using mass spectrometry analysis of proteins associated with S6K1, we identified interactions between S6K1 and components of the DNA repair machinery including; Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), MutS homolog 2 (MSH2), MutS homolog 6 (MSH6), Cyclin Dependent Kinase 1(Cdk1, also known as CDC2) and others. We demonstrate that the latter two (MSH6 and Cdk1) are direct substrates of S6K1. We show that S6K1 functions as a DNA damage checkpoint protein for both HRR and MMR mechanisms: Inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest by Cdk1 phosphorylation thus allowing HR repair and enhancing MMR by phosphorylating and activating MSH6. These findings suggest that the mTORC1-S6K1 axis may serve as an important path in modulating DDR to ensure genomic integrity during proliferation and upon exposure to increased DNA hazards.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>S6K1 protects cells from various DNA damaging agents</title><p>Several reports have demonstrated that genotoxic stress regulates mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bärlund et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Braunstein et al., 2009</xref>) and imply involvement of mTORC1 in resistance to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shen et al., 2013</xref>). We set out to examine whether up-regulation of S6K1 expression protects cells from DNA damaging agents and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. To this end, we overexpressed either the full length active kinase S6K1 (S6K1) or the S6K1 short isoform (Iso-2) in S6K1/S6 K2 double knockout (S6K<sup>-/-</sup>) MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). We compared viability and survival of these cells upon induction of DNA damage. Expression of S6K1 (but not Iso-2) rescued S6K<sup>-/-</sup> MEF cells from DNA damage induced cell death following treatment with either doxorubicin (Dox), γ irradiation, UV irradiation or neocarzinostatin (NCS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–j</xref>). Overexpression of S6K1 in MCF-10A cells protected, while its knockdown sensitized the cells to cell death following treatment with either Dox, γ irradiation, UV-irradiation, NCS or cisplatin (CDDP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a-i</xref>). Moreover, inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin, inhibited the protective effect of S6K1 following Dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1k</xref>).

HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids containing different S6K1 isoforms tethered to a halo-tag (HT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, Materials and methods). Protein pulldown assays and two independent mass-spectrometry analyses were performed on these cells. As phosphorylation usually causes conformational changes of the substrate due to steric repulsion of the negatively charged phosphate groups, we hypothesized that the S6K1 kinase inactive variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Hur et al., 2013</xref>), short isoform Iso-2, may have a stronger interaction with all putative substrates. We therefore included this isoform in the pulldown assay. Iso-2 has a truncated kinase domain and lacks the folded conformation created by the interaction with the auto-inhibitory C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Magnuson et al., 2012</xref>), allowing availability of the N-terminal region for protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Combined proteomic analyses (described in detail in Materials and methods), identified approximately 400 putative interactors, of which 164 were identified by both mass-spectrometry pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

A previous study that identified S6K1 and S6K2 interactors identified 21 high-scoring S6K1 interactions, of which two (S6K1, HSP90AA1) were also found in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We chose to focus on the set of proteins in the DNA damage response/repair module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

The truncated MSH6 recombinant protein, comprising of amino acids 1–718, contained the first three domains; the N-terminal disordered domain (NTR), mismatch binding domain and connector domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edelbrock et al., 2013</xref>). These regions have many predicted S6K1 phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

We performed an in vitro kinase assay using radioactive <sup>32</sup>P, incubating recombinant S6K1 alone or in combination with either Cdk1, MSH6 (Materials and methods) or ribosomal S6 protein (rpS6) as a positive control. In addition, we also performed this experiment, without radioactive <sup>32</sup>P, using an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylation motif (RXXS) of the AGC kinase family to detect S6K1 specific phosphorylation. As shown by both radiolabeling and immunoblotting, S6K1 phosphorylated Cdk1 and MSH6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). To eliminate the possibility of the presence of a contaminating protein, which may be acting as a kinase or substrate in our assay, we performed the in vitro kinase assay using recombinant Uba5 as a negative control. Uba5 does not contain any RXXS phosphorylation motifs but does have 26 serine and 19 threonine residues. In our assay S6K1 did not phosphorylate Uba5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a, b</xref>). Co-transfection of MSH6 with S6K1 into HEK293 cells followed by MSH6 pull-down revealed enhanced phosphorylation of MSH6 on the RXXS motif, as shown by immunoblotting using the phospho-specific RXXS antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>). Furthermore, co-transfection of Cdk1 with S6K1 into HEK293 cells followed by HA-Cdk1 pull-down revealed enhanced phosphorylation of Cdk1 on the RXXS motif, as shown by immunoblotting using the phospho-specific RXXS antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e and f</xref>).

Specifically, S6K1 knockdown or knockout sensitizes cells to treatments with UV radiation, NCS, IR, Dox, and cisplatin. Expression of S6K1 increased cell resistance to these genotoxic treatments and this was accompanied by reduced DNA damage, as detected by lower levels of γ-H2AX, and reduced apoptosis, as detected by reduced cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The prognostic value of this is supported by the finding that S6K1 expression level correlates with worse survival of breast cancer patients who received chemotherapy but not patients that were never treated with chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>). Evidence for a causal relationship between S6K1 amplification and enhanced chemotherapy resistance is shown by the fact that breast cancer cell lines harboring <italic>RP6SKB1</italic> amplification, and overexpression of S6K1, show enhanced resistance to chemotherapeutic agents compared to breast cancer cell lines with no amplification and low S6K1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c-e</xref>).</p><p>S6K2, the paralog enzyme, which is highly similar to S6K1 in its activities, might be involved in some of the interactions and activities we describe here for S6K1.

Even though we cannot exclude the possibility that S6K2 mediates some of the described activities, the fact that S6K1 expression could rescue the phenotypes observed in S6K1 and S6K2 double knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and that S6K1 knockdown/knockout can mimic the phenotypes of the double knockout cells, suggests that S6K1, and not S6K2, is the prominent regulator of the DDR.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>S6K1 interacts with DDR components and phosphorylates MSH6 and Cdk1</title><p>Except for several cytoplasmic substrates involved in translational regulation and signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>), very little is known about the cellular substrates of S6K1. Only recently, the first nuclear substrate of S6K1, H2B, was identified, connecting S6K1 with chromatin modulation in adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yi et al., 2016</xref>). Using a combination of pull-down assays and mass spectrometry, we have revealed novel and unexpected interactions between S6K1 and a number of DDR components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A previous study by Pavan et al. identified several S6K1 and S6K2 interactors. However, none of the high-scoring S6K1 interactors reported were HRR or MMR components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavan et al., 2016</xref>). Among the low-scoring S6K1 interactors identified were PCNA and MSH6, but not CDK1 or MSH2. Three DDR related proteins identified in that study (PARP1, XRCC6, and XRCC5) bound only S6K2 but not S6K1 in an IP validation experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavan et al., 2016</xref>). We compared our S6K1 interactors with those identified in both Pavan et al. and a proteomic database and found surprisingly little overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). One explanation for this low overlap is that we analyzed, in addition to active S6K1, the interaction with a kinase-dead short isoform Iso-2 (p31), which is a naturally occurring kinase-dead version of S6K1. We also identified interactions with S6K1 K123 &gt;A, a kinase-dead version of S6K1, which is identical in size and sequence to S6K1 and differs only in a lysine to alanine (K123A) substitution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, these results were not included in our final analysis. Both of these kinase-dead versions bind many more proteins than S6K1, possibly due to repulsion of S6K1 interactors by the negative charge added following phosphorylation. PCNA, one of S6K1 interactors, is known for its role in orchestrating many processes such as replication, DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moldovan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maga and Hubscher, 2003</xref>.

We show that two of the S6K1 interacting proteins, Cdk1 (Cdc2) and MSH6, are directly phosphorylated by S6K1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Here, we assign S6K1 an additional nuclear function, regulation of DNA repair.</p><p>In addition to the in vitro phosphorylation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>), where S6K1 induced MSH6 phosphorylation, co-transfection of S6K1 with MSH6 enhanced its phosphorylation also in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d</xref>).

The cell cycle is tightly regulated by Cdk-cyclin complexes. Specifically, the Cdk1-cyclinB complex controls the G2/M checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson and Jasin, 2000</xref>). We further demonstrate that phosphorylation of Cdk1, by S6K1, correlates with G2/M cell cycle arrest following exposure IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We provide the first evidence for Cdk1 phosphorylation on serine 39 by S6K1, and show that this phosphorylation enhances HRR, as its substitution to alanine inhibits HRR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Cdk1 is known to be phosphorylated on serine 39 by CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamane and Kinsella, 2005</xref>), a vital player in DDR and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edelbrock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">St-Denis and Litchfield, 2009</xref>), and this specific Cdk1 phosphorylation was also shown to be important for chemotherapy induced G2/M cell arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamane and Kinsella, 2005</xref>). According to our results, S6K1/S6K2 are not essential for the G2/M checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–d</xref>). However, S6K1 augments the G2/M checkpoint to enhance cell cycle arrest upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–d</xref>). This might be the mechanism by which S6K1 overexpression protects cells from DNA damage-induced cell death, while S6K1 knockout mice are viable with no obvious signs of DNA damage response problems. In addition, we do not exclude the fact that there are other kinases that phosphorylate Cdk1, such as CKII, and therefore it is reasonable that S6K-/- MEFs will still activate the G2/M checkpoint. The budding yeast Cdk1, Cdc28, has recently been shown to directly phosphorylate the essential homologous recombination repair proteins Rad51 and Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lim et al., 2020</xref>). This connection, that probably occurs also in mammals, strengthens the suggestion that modulation of Cdk1 activity regulates HR. It is important to mention that previous studies have shown that Cdk1 can phosphorylate S6K1, inhibiting its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kurabe et al., 2009</xref>). This raises the possibility that there is a positive feedback loop between Cdk1 and S6K1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>S6K1 enhances MMR by phosphorylation of MSH6 on serine 309</title><p>The MMR machinery signals directly to kinases such as ATR, CHK1 and CHK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang and Qin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lord and Ashworth, 2012</xref>), inducing several cascades in parallel, coordinating cell cycle checkpoints and DNA-repair activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stojic et al., 2004</xref>). MMR proteins not only signal to the repair mechanism but are also recruited by it; MSH2 and MSH6 have ATM and ATR phosphorylation motifs that undergo phosphorylation upon IR treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsuoka et al., 2007</xref>), and were shown to be recruited to sites of DNA damage upon UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou et al., 2010</xref>). This evidence supports the existence of crosstalk between MMR proteins and DSB and SSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>) and illustrates MutSα involvement in UV induced DDR. Here, we show that S6K1 interacts with MSH6 and MSH2 (MutSα), upregulating their nuclear localization and elevating MMR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The MSH6 NTR contains a PIP box, three identified Nuclear Localization Signals (NLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edelbrock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gassman et al., 2011</xref>) and a PWWP domain for binding to chromatin or chromatin associated proteins (such as histones). We show S6K1 phosphorylation of MSH6 in that region on multiple serines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Some of these sites were reported to be mutated in familial colorectal cancer patients with germline MSH6 mutations and characterized by a low microsatellite instability phenotype. Moreover, point mutations in these residues were found to alter nuclear localization of MSH6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gassman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kolodner et al., 1999</xref>). We show that S6K1 phosphorylates MSH6 on the serine cluster 252, 254, and 256, which is known to be phosphorylated also by CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edelbrock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gassman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaliyaperumal et al., 2011</xref>) and serine 309 which is also phosphorylated by PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Polo and Jackson, 2011</xref>). To examine if serine 309 phosphorylation is directly involved in increased MMR activity observed in MEF S6K<sup>-/-</sup> cells overexpressing S6K1, we mutated this residue to either aspartate or alanine. Our results indicate that mutation of serine 309 to aspartate, which mimics the phosphorylated state, enhanced both MSH6 mediated repair activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>) and its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). MutSα phosphorylation by CK2 and PKC, has already been shown to be involved in its nuclear translocation, corroborating our findings of increased nuclear transport of MutSα in S6K1 overexpressing MCF-10A cells and reduced nuclear localization following S6K1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–d</xref>). Although we detected S6K1 translocation into the nucleus following DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), we cannot rule out that the phosphorylation of MSH6 and CDK1 by S6K1 occurs in the cytoplasm, as these proteins shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.</p><p>MMR-deficient cells are defective in cell cycle arrest in response to multiple types of DNA damaging agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li, 2008</xref>. It is therefore reasonable to assume that S6K1 effects on cell cycle are mediated by both Cdk1 and MSH6 phosphorylation, two known proteins involved in MMR. S6K1 coordination of cell cycle arrest and DNA repair may also be attributed to phosphorylation of other proteins, in addition to MSH6 and Cdk1, which we identified as interacting with S6K1 but were not investigated further in this study. The fact that S6K1 protected from several types of DNA damaging agents suggests that, in addition to MMR and HHR, it might activate additional repair mechanisms. In conclusion, we show that S6K1 promotes both MMR and HRR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) and both of these activities are dependent on S6K1 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e and i</xref>), revealing a novel role of S6K1 in DNA damage repair. These results suggest that activation of the mTOR pathway, following DNA damage, activates repair mechanisms through S6K1 kinase activity. Furthermore, it suggests that nutrient sensing is linked to the DNA repair machinery through the mTOR-S6K1 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>It is becoming increasingly clear that cancer drug resistance is not only mediated by genes that drive or facilitate malignancy but also by genes that maintain essential functions required by both normal and malignant cells.

For example, mutations in the tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2, on one hand, cause enhanced susceptibility to development of breast and ovarian cancers, but on the other hand, tumors in mutant BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers are extremely sensitive to DNA damaging drugs and to PARP inhibitors that eliminate their only functioning DNA repair arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magesa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yin and Shen, 2008</xref>).</p><p><italic>RPS6KB1</italic> gene amplification and overexpression is reported in about 8–10% of breast tumors and other cancers and correlates with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sinclair et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bostner et al., 2015</xref>).

We thank the Reviewers for their helpful comments, which we have considered carefully. We note that the reviewers appreciated the importance of this study as seen by their comments &quot;This study provides evidence for a novel function of S6K1 in DNA repair. These observations may help understand how amplification of RPS6KB1 gene that encodes S6K1 in breast cancers is associated with poor chemotherapy outcome&quot; and &quot;This study adds value to our understanding of DNA damage responses in cancer, particularly with regards to a potential role for the mTOR signaling pathway in regulating this process&quot;. We have now clarified the points that were not clear to the reviewers in the original manuscript. In addition, we have included many additional experiments and controls that we believe strengthen our conclusions.</p><p>Our point-by-point response is included below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. The way the IP data was presented is strangely inconsistent and confusing. For instance, In Figure 2C and 2f, blotting of the bait was not shown.</p></disp-quote><p>The HT pull-down is based on covalent binding of the Halotag to the beads and thus, after binding of the Halotag-conjugated protein, it cannot be released from the beads and only the proteins which were copulled down with it can be separated on the SDS-PAGE. This is the reason for showing flow-through (unbound) as a control since the levels of the pulled down Halotag-conjugated protein cannot be detected in the Western blot. We have now clarified the design of the HaloTag experiments explaining why blotting of HT is not shown in Figure 2c and 2f (Material and methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They chose to show flow through for figure 2d and 2e but not for other panels.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this and now include flow through for all panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The lysate and FT was shown in separate panels (2d and 2e) for HeLa and HEK293 cells but pulldown for the two cells were grouped into one panel (2f). For IP experiment in Figure 2g and 2h, HT antibody was used for lysate, but S6K1 and phospho-S6K1 antibodies were used for pulldown products.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see explanation to specific comment 1. In these experiments the bait is covalently bound through HaloTag to the beads and therefore cannot be detected by blotting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no input blot for figure 2i.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this and have now included input blot for Figure 2i.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>No reasonable explanations have been provided for these inconsistencies or choices. I also strongly suggest that the authors group blots for each IP experiment into one figure panel that includes both input and IP samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included blots that the reviewer requested and rearranged the panels to include both input and IP samples for each experiment in the same panel (see new Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. &quot;Immunoblot of PCNA immunoprecipitated lysates showed interaction of PCNA with both S6K1 and Iso2 in HEK293 cells (Figure 2g,h) and in HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure 4f,g).&quot; I do not see any interaction between S6K1 and PCNA in Supplementary Figure 4g.</p></disp-quote><p>The interaction of S6K1 with PCNA (and other substrates) may be difficult to capture due to possible repulsion of S6K1 interactors by the negative charge added following phosphorylation. This common phenomenon in kinase-substrate interactions is explained on page 6 of manuscript &quot;As phosphorylation usually causes conformational changes of the substrate due to steric repulsion of the negatively charged phosphate groups, we hypothesized that the S6K1 kinase inactive variant<sup>7</sup>, short isoform Iso-2, may have a stronger interaction with all putative substrates&quot;. This is now clarified again in the revised manuscript on page 7 &quot;It should be noted that the interaction with Iso-2 is stronger due to lack of steric repulsion caused by S6K1 phosphorylation&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Labeling in Figure 3a is confusing. Also, CDK1 was blotted for but MSH6 was not. Why was S6K1 seen in CDK1 WB?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Figure 3a is complicated and a bit confusing. S6K1 auto-phosphorylates in the presence of ATP, so in every P<sup>32</sup> exposure it is detected. In the WB of CDK1+S6K1 (right side of panel 3a) S6K1 is the recombinant S6K1 that was added to the in-vitro kinase assay. MSH6 protein levels were hard to detect in Figure 3a. However, in the similar “cold” in vitro kinase assay experiment in Figure 3b (bottom right), it is clearly detected and the assay is similar, apart from the detection method of the phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. &quot;Cdk1 and MSH6, but not PCNA, have multiple putative S6K1 phosphorylation sites (Supplementary Table 3). &quot; The authors have not reasoned why they only chose to examine these three proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, Cdk1 has two putative S6K1 phosphorylation sites and MSH6 has 12 putative sites. We chose to focus on these three proteins due to their roles in cell cycle regulation (Cdk1), DNA damage repair (MSH6) and DNA synthesis and repair (PCNA). These are well studied proteins with reagents available for performing the experiments (antibodies). Clearly there are other proteins that were identified that interact with S6K1 and these proteins can be the focus of future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. &quot;To eliminate the possibility of the presence of a contaminating protein, which may be acting as a kinase or substrate in our assay, we performed the in vitro kinase assay using recombinant Uba5 as a negative control. Uba5 does not contain any RXXS phosphorylation motifs but does have 26 serine and 19 threonine residues. In our assay S6K1 did not phosphorylate Uba5 (Supplementary Figure 5a,b).&quot; This is a worthwhile control experiment to have. But it is not to address the possibility that the author raised about a contaminating kinase. One way to address this question would be to use a kinase-dead S6K1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the use of Uba5 as a negative control is worthwhile. The Uba5 control shows that there is no contaminating protein that is acting as a kinase per se (able to phosphorylate Uba5 multiple serines and threonines) in our in vitro kinase assay. Unfortunately, there is no commercial kinase dead S6K1 available and we were not able to purify recombinant kinase-dead S6K1 protein (due to aggregation and inclusion body issues), therefore we were not able to perform in vitro kinase assay with kinase-dead S6K1. However, in the experiments in cell culture, the kinase-dead version – Iso-2 – was unable to enhance MSH6 phosphorylation (Figure 3c-d).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors made an interesting finding that in cells over-expressing S6K1, γ-H2AX was largely suppressed. They attributed this to enhanced repair in S6K1 expressing cells. In this experiment, the cells were fixed and stained just 2 hours after UV irradiation. UV irradiation mostly causes pyrimidine dimers and photo adducts, which need to be converted to DNA breaks during DNA replication or other DNA transactions to induce γ-H2AX. The time window is simply too short to allow all these repair processes to complete.

The increased HR efficiency in S6K1-expressing cells is expected, given that homologous recombination mainly occurs in G2/M phase. What is interesting is the decreased HR efficiency in S6K1 knockout cells and in Cdk1-39A cells. But since the CDK1 experiment was done by over-expressing WT or 39A mutant Cdk1, it is difficult to conclude what is the effect of 39A in normal cells. It is possible that Cdk1 over-expression changes cell cycle profile, which further complicate the interpretation. There is also not enough evidence that S6K1 promotes G2M arrest and HR vis CDK1. To prove this, the authors need to introduce 39A mutation to native Cdk1 and test if this mutant abolishes the effect of S6K1 expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is possible that Cdk1 overexpression could possibly change the cell cycle profile, further complicating interpretation. The reviewer suggested that we introduce 39A mutation to native Cdk1 and test if this mutant abolishes the effect of S6K1. However, we chose to perform cell cycle experiments in U20S-DR-GFP cells with and without overexpression of S6K1 co-transfected with either Cdk1 WT or Cdk1 39A mutations. These experiments were more feasible for us to complete rather than introducing 39A mutation to native Cdk1. We have now included cell cycle analysis using U2OS-DR-GFP cells either overexpressing S6K1 or Iso-2; or overexpressing Cdk1 WT or Cdk1 39A; or overexpressing S6K1 with either Cdk1 WT or Cdk1 39A. Note that our cell cycle analysis is much more inclusive now as we separated the cell cycle by adding markers for -late ‘S’ phase – cyclin A, ‘G2’-high cyclin A+B and ‘M’ phase- p-H3.

The interaction of S6K1 with CDK1 and MSH6 is difficult to capture due to possible repulsion of S6K1 interactors by the negative charge added following phosphorylation. Whereas, the interaction with Iso-2 is easier to capture due to the lack of kinase activity. This is explained on page 6 of manuscript &quot;As phosphorylation usually causes conformational changes of the substrate due to steric repulsion of the negatively charged phosphate groups, we hypothesized that the S6K1 kinase inactive variant<sup>7</sup>, short isoform Iso-2, may have a stronger interaction with all putative substrates&quot;.
