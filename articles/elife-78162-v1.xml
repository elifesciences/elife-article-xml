considered the driving force of helping. However, when deciding to help others in danger, one must consider not only their distress, but also the risk to oneself. Whereas the role of self-defense in helping has been overlooked in human research, studies in other animals indicate defensive responses are necessary for the protection of conspecifics. In this pre-registered study (N=49), we demonstrate that human defensive neural circuits are implicated in helping others under threat. Participants underwent fMRI scanning while deciding whether to help another participant avoid aversive electrical shocks, at the risk of also being shocked. We found that higher engagement of neural circuits that coordinate fast escape from self-directed danger (including the insula, PAG, and ACC) facilitated decisions to help others. Importantly, using representational similarity analysis, we found that the strength with which the amygdala and insula uniquely represented the threat to oneself (and not the other’s distress) predicted helping. Our findings indicate that in humans, as other mammals, defensive mechanisms play a greater role in helping behavior than previously understood.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Fear</kwd><kwd>altruism</kwd><kwd>Brain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-00877</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olsson</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The activation of defence brain circuits drives decisions to help conspecifics under threat.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Helping someone in danger (e.g., by saving a person who fell on the train tracks, or running into a building in flames to rescue someone inside) may expose oneself to health and life-threatening risks. Nevertheless, such helping behaviors are observed across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hernandez-Lallement et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oliner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preston, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rand and Epstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Waal and Lanting, 1997</xref>). Risky helping differs from other altruistic actions in that it occurs in the simultaneous presence of two highly salient cues: the distress of a conspecific in need, and a potential threat to the self. In humans, a wealth of research has been dedicated to the former, explaining how perceiving distress in others may trigger the motivation to help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Waal and Preston, 2017</xref>), particularly if the helper is not under threat themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preston, 2013</xref>). But virtually nothing is known about how, in a threatening situation, one’s own responses to the threat may drive decisions to help. More so, animal research suggests defensive brain mechanisms may in fact be implicated in aiding or protecting conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rickenbacher et al., 2017</xref>). Understanding the neurocognitive processes underlying the motivation to both safeguard oneself and helping others is critical to explain inter-individual behavior in dangerous contexts. The overarching goal of our study was thus to determine how one’s own defensive responses to threat guide decisions to help others in dangerous situations.</p><p>In humans, defensive responses to threat are graded as a function of the proximity or imminence of the threatening stimulus, paralleling predatory avoidance responses in other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fanselow and Lester, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mobbs et al., 2020</xref>). Distal and unpredictable threats are typically associated with risk assessment and intermittent anxiety, allowing for slower and more flexible escape decisions. As threat imminence increases and an attack becomes more likely, fixed and species-specific responses are triggered, such as freezing or, if immediate avoidance is necessary, fight-or-flight. Some behavioral reports indicate that different states along the defensive continuum may have dissociable effects on prosocial behavior. For example, following acute social stress, participants behave more prosocially in economic games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tomova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">von Dawans et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">von Dawans et al., 2019</xref>), make more moral decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singer et al., 2017</xref>), and show greater empathy for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tomova et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, it has been shown that individuals were more likely to help a co-participant avoid aversive electrical shocks when the threat of shock was imminent rather than distal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2020</xref>). This behavioral pattern was accompanied by faster reaction times and heart rate during imminent compared to distal threats, paralleling what has been found in response to imminent self-directed threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hashemi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roelofs, 2017</xref>). Consistent with these laboratorial studies, higher danger in real-life situations (captured via public surveillance footage) has been associated with higher likelihood of bystander intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lindegaard et al., 2022</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that defensive states triggered by high threat imminence may not only enable fast avoidance of self-directed threats, but also motivate helping when others are under threat. Yet, the neural basis of these effects is unclear. Specifically, it is unknown how the activation of specific sub-circuits underlying different defensive states (e.g., freezing vs. fight-or-flight) impacts decisions toward others in a threatening context.</p><p>We aimed to characterize the involvement of different defensive neural responses on helping under threat. To do so, we used a paradigm adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2020</xref>, in which participants make helping decisions at different stages of threat imminence (details in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Briefly, a participant is asked to decide whether or not to help a co-participant (in reality, a confederate) avoid aversive electrical shocks. In each trial, the participant watches a supposedly live video-feed of the co-participant, and a visual cue signaling an upcoming shock. The participant is asked to decide whether to help the co-participant avoid the shock at the risk of receiving a shock from her/himself. These decisions are prompted in some trials in the beginning of the trial (<italic>distal threat</italic>), and in others immediately prior to the shock delivery (<italic>imminent threat</italic>). If the participant decides not to help, the co-participant always receives a shock; if the participant decides to help, there is a fixed probability both participant and co-participant will receive a shock.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Outline of the experimental tasks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) fMRI helping under threat task. Participants saw the co-participant on the screen, together with a visual cue signaling threat (an upcoming shock). There were three threat levels: safe (0 shocks, green circle), moderate threat (1 shock, yellow circle), and high threat (2 shocks, red circle). In each trial of the task, the circle started static on the left (4 s), and then moved to the right (4 s). Participants were prompted to decide whether they wanted to help the co-participant or not (1.25–1.75 s) either in the beginning of trial (distal) or right before the moment of shock delivery (imminent). Therefore, the available time to make a decision was identical in distal and imminent threats. If participants decided to help, there was a 70% chance both themselves and co-participant would receive shocks; if they decided not to help, the co-participant would always receive a shock, and the participant would not. Decisions prompted on safe trials were to arbitrarily choose to press 1 or 2, since no shocks would be administered. (<bold>B</bold>) After the fMRI task, outside the scanner, participants re-watched clips of the co-participant presented during the scan, and were asked to rate how much ‘discomfort, anxiety or uneasiness’ he was experiencing in each clip on a 9-point scale. They also presented images of the threat cues and asked to rate, on the same scale, how threatened they felt themselves when they saw those images during the scan.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78162-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our hypotheses were guided by previous work on neural responses to the imminence of self-directed threats. It has been shown that the response to distal threats (i.e., unpredictable, spatially distant, retreating, slow moving) is coordinated by so-called ‘cognitive fear’ circuits, which include the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mobbs et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qi et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, imminent threats (i.e., predictable, spatially close, looming, and fast moving) predominantly engage ‘reactive’ fear circuits, which include the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC), insula, and periaqueductal gray (PAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mobbs et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qi et al., 2018</xref>). The amygdala plays a central role in both circuits, namely by coordinating adaptive switches between defensive states as a function of threat imminence (e.g., from freezing to fight-or-flight), through oxytocin-mediated communication between its central (CeA) and basolateral nucleus (BLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Terburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these findings, we expected neural activation within the full defensive circuitry to respond to the threat level of the trial (i.e., safe, 1 shock, and 2 shocks), with higher engagement of brain regions previously included in cognitive fear circuits (i.e., vmPFC and hippocampus) in response to distal threats, and higher engagement of regions included in reactive fear circuits (i.e., insula, dACC, and PAG) in response to imminent threats. At the behavioral level, prior findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2020</xref>) showed that helping decisions were more frequent under imminent than distal trials, suggesting that the activation of reactive fear circuits would facilitate helping behavior. We thus predicted that helping decisions would be associated with higher engagement of brain regions included in reactive fear circuits (i.e., amygdala, insula, ACC, and PAG).</p><p>One important aspect of our paradigm was that, as in most real-life dangerous situations, the threat and the conspecific in need were simultaneously presented. To dissociate the role of representations of threat and of other’s distress on helping behavior, after the scan we asked participants to rate the degree of distress experienced by <italic>the co-participant</italic> in each clip showed during the scan; also, participants rated how threatened they felt <italic>themselves</italic> when they saw the visual threat cues during the scan. These ratings were used as behavioral models in a representational similarity analysis (RSA; see Materials and methods) that identified neural representations of other’s distress and of threat to the self, and determined their association with helping behavior. It should be noted that our goal was specifically related to the link between neural representations of distress and threat, and helping behavior, and not to the dissociation of representations of distress and threat in the brain. This would be a highly interesting question to examine in future research.</p><p>The demonstration that neural representations of other’s distress are positively associated with helping decisions would support existing empathy-based explanations of helping. Indeed, it has been proposed that helping a conspecific in danger results primarily from an evolutionarily preserved motivation to care for offspring in mammals, which is triggered by signals of distress and vulnerability, and is especially likely to occur <italic>if</italic> the helper is not under threat themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preston, 2013</xref>). However, evidence in rodents indicates that, rather than conflicting, defensive responses may be <italic>required</italic> for helping and caregiving: for example, anxious rat mothers display enhanced maternal behavior after pharmacological activation of defensive brain circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosch et al., 2005</xref>), whereas mice bred to have low anxiety display significant defects in maternal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheleg et al., 2017</xref>); and helping behavior in rats is compromised following treatment with anxiolytic drugs that suppress defensive circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2016</xref>). According to these animal findings, an alternative prediction to empathy-based accounts is that the neural representation of threat to the self would promote helping of others.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Helping decisions did not vary based on threat imminence or threat level</title><p>Using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), we found no significant effect of either threat imminence (β=0.017, se=0.014, t=1.24, p=0.218), threat level (β=−0.068, se=0.053, t=−1.282, p=0.205), nor a threat imminence*level interaction (β=−0.099, se=0.019, t=−0.497, p=0.622) on the percentage of helping decisions throughout the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Despite the lack of group-level effects of threat imminence (which were predicted based on previous work; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2020</xref>), individual data showed that the number of participants helping more during imminent than distal threats was objectively higher (n=27) than those helping more during distal (n=11), or the same amount during imminent and distal (n=11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Note that these differences are descriptive, and no statistical inference was performed.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Behavioural results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

We thus checked whether there was an interaction between the empathic concern scale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis, 1983</xref>) and threat imminence on helping. When empathic concern was added in the model, results showed no significant effects of threat imminence (β=0.018, se=0.014, t=1.249, p=0.215) and threat level (β=−0.050, se=0.051, t=−0.985, p=0.330), and no significant interaction between imminence and empathic concern (β=0.018, se=0.014, t=1.292, p=0.20). However, a significant association emerged between empathic concern and helping behavior (β=−0.101, se=0.041, t=−2.473, p=0.02), indicating those higher in empathic concern displayed less frequent helping behavior. It should be noted here that the impact of low statistical power cannot be discounted. Our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2020</xref>) had a larger sample, and to detect a correlation between helping and empathic concern of the magnitude of that reported in that study (with 80% power) we would need at least 123 participants (based on calculations carried on in GPower 3.1.9.2).</p><p>Also, to account for the possibility that decisions varied throughout the experiment (e.g., participants helped more in the beginning than toward the end), we also performed a mixed effects logistic regression on single trial dichotomous responses (help or no help), including the trial number as a fixed effect. This analysis revealed no significant effects, indicating the individuals did not respond differently as time passed.</p><p>Finally, in line with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2020</xref>), analysis of reaction times showed individuals made faster decisions during imminent versus distal trials (β=−173.30, se=12.09, t=−14.33, p&lt;0.0001), and for shock versus safe trials (β[1 shock]=−43.26, se=12.76, t=−3.39, p=0.001; β[2 shock]=−53.35, se=13.43, t=−3.97, p=0.0002), with no significant threat imminence*level interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Participants were sensitive to variations in the co-participant’s distress, threat imminence, and threat level (manipulation check)</title><p>After the scan, participants were asked to re-watch all clips of the co-participant during the scan, and rate the level of ‘discomfort, anxiety or uneasiness’ they thought <italic>he</italic> was experiencing in each clip. Of note, these clips were shown without the threat cues (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) that were also present during the scan, in order to isolate the response to distress and threat. Results showed participants rated the distress of the co-participant being significantly higher during imminent than distal clips (β=0.418, se=0.089, t=4.676, p&lt;0.0001), and progressively higher across the three levels of threat (1 Sh: β=0.279, se=0.077, t=3.611, p=0.0005; 2 Sh: β=0.559, se=0.081, t=6.853, p&lt;0.0001; reference class was safe). No significant threat level*imminence interaction was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results suggest the video clips used in the scan successfully portrayed subtle variations in cues of distress by the co-participant.</p><p>Participants also presented isolated images of the threat cues used during the scanning task (namely, the green, yellow, and red circles, both in the distal and imminent positions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and asked to rate how threatened they felt <italic>themselves</italic> when they saw those visual cues during the scan.

It could be argued that these represent fundamentally different types of decisions. To overcome this limitation, we also performed a parametric modulator analysis, in which we used a GLM that included a parametric modulator for decisions made in shock trials (0 if no help and 1 if helped). This analysis allowed us to model all threat imminence and level conditions, but only assign parametric modulators to those in which a subsequent help or no help decision was made (i.e., distal 1 shock, distal 2 shocks, imminent 1 shock, and imminent 2 shocks). The disadvantage of this approach is that only participants with at least 1 ‘no help trial’ trial per condition were included (N=28). Results of the parametric modulator analysis were consistent with those of the ANOVA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), in that we only found significant modulation of brain activation by subsequent decision during distal threats.

To this end, we performed an ROI-based RSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017</xref>). This analysis was done separately for imminent and distal trials, and comprised three steps (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and Materials and methods for details). First, we computed neural representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) that reflected trial-by-trial variation in activation patterns throughout the scanning task. Second, we used post-scan ratings to construct behavioral RDMs that reflected, respectively, between-trial differences in perceived distress experienced by the co-participant, and between-trial differences in how threatened the participant felt themselves during the scan. Finally, in the third step, we estimated the second-order similarity between neural and behavioral RDMs. This similarity metric allowed us to assess, for each ROI, whether trial-by-trial multivoxel patterns during the scan primarily represented the co-participant’s distress, or the threat to oneself. Importantly, it allowed us to determine whether and to what degree neural representations of other’s distress and of threat to the self were associated with helping behavior. Based on the second-order similarity between neural and behavioral RDMs, we found no evidence for any of the ROIs that neural activity predominantly represented other’s distress or threat to self (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix 1—table 5</xref>). However, results showed that, regardless of threat imminence, the similarity between neural and threat RDMs in the left amygdala (β=4.41, se=1.35, t=3.27, p=0.006) and left insula (β=2.46, se=0.97, t=2.53, p=0.047) was positively associated with helping behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>).

Our findings strongly suggested that neural circuits that coordinate fast avoidance responses from self-directed threats (reactive fear circuits) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mobbs et al., 2020</xref>) also underlie the protection of others in dangerous situations. More, the extent to which key defensive regions (amygdala and insula) represent the threat to the self (and not others’ distress) predicts more frequent helping decisions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Reactive fear circuits promote both self- and -other defence</title><p>Previous work has shown that increased imminence of an other-directed threat facilitates helping behavior, suggesting that the same way threat imminence triggers active avoidance (i.e., fight or flight) from self-directed threats, it may promote defensive helping when others are under threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we examined the neural basis of this effect. We found that multivoxel activation within the defensive circuitry (<italic>i.e.,</italic> amygdala, ACC, insula, hippocampus, and OFC) tracked with the level of threat. Also, we found dissociable local patterns of activation prior to helping as a function of threat imminence within the insula, hippocampus, and dorsal ACC. These findings are consistent with previous work highlighting the role of the hippocampus and dACC as key regions optimizing escape decisions within cognitive and reactive fear circuits, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qi et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, we found that average activation within several regions of the defensive circuitry, namely the in the PAG, insula, hippocampus, dACC, OFC, and vmPFC, differed between trials leading up to helping or not helping decisions. Specifically, consistent with our predictions, activation in the insula, ACC, and PAG was higher before decisions to help, whereas activation in the hippocampus, vmPFC, and OFC was higher prior to decisions not to help. Therefore, although overall we did not find higher frequency of helping decisions under imminent than distal threat, our results suggest that greater engagement of reactive fear circuits facilitated helping behavior. Our failure to replicate prior behavioral effects of threat imminence could have been due to a difference in how participants were instructed (here, we instructed individuals to balance helping and not helping decisions) and/or statistical power (the previous study had a larger sample defined based on power calculations, N=98). The task instructions, in particular, used may have induced specific metacognitive processes that directly affected the behavioral decisions, and are virtually impossible to quantify. In any case, the present results are in line with prior findings in that they suggest that acute defensive states coordinated by reactive fear circuits promote helping under threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2020</xref>). Of note, the differential activation of cognitive and reactive fear circuits based on the subsequent decision (help vs. not help) was only found when decisions were made under distal threat (i.e., when responses were prompted in the beginning of the trial). Also, contrary to our predictions, when comparing the average activation during distal and imminent threats independently of the decision, we found that the bilateral insula and ACC were more active during distal relative to imminent threats, whereas the bilateral IFG and OFC were more active during imminent threats. These results are opposite to those from prior studies that manipulated the imminence of self-directed threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mobbs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wendt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mobbs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meyer et al., 2019</xref>). It is possible, however, that the disparity between our and previous findings is due to methodological reasons and does not reflect true differences in the processing of self- versus other-directed threats. For instance, in previous work only avoidance responses were made, whereas in our paradigm both help and no help decisions were possible (perhaps more analogous to an approach and avoidance option). Importantly, in our paradigm, every trial started with a distal threat (the circle was static on the left) that always evolved into an imminent threat (the circle would move to the right, and the shock would be administered at the end of the trial). This may have made the threat overly predictable (especially given the high number of trials required for fMRI), engaging reactive fear circuits to a greater extent during the distal phase of the trial.</p><p>Nonetheless, our results obtained in a paradigm wherein the threat was directed at another person (the co-participant) were overall consistent with previous fMRI research investigating neural responses to self-directed threats as a function of imminence, suggesting a parallel between responses to self- and other-directed threats. This self-other parallel has been demonstrated in other threat-related processes, such as learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olsson et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, in line with previous demonstrations that acute defensive states may promote prosocial outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2020</xref>), we found that greater engagement of reactive fear circuits may facilitate helping of others in a threatening situation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The neural representation of threat to the self predicts helping</title><p>To decide whether to help another person in a dangerous situation, one must consider not only their distress, but also the threat in the environment. Here, we determined how the representations of another’s distress and of threat guide behavior. To do so, we collected ratings of both the co-participant’s distress, and of how threatened the participant felt during the scan. Crucially, these ratings were obtained after the scan, allowing us to obtain a behavioral metric of how participants independently represented another person’s distress and the threat value of the situation. Although collecting these ratings during the scan would have provided a more direct measure of the neural representation of other’s distress and threat, it would have also have increased scanning time considerably and potentially compromised data quality as a result of fatigue. Performing these ratings after the scan was consistent with previous approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parkinson et al., 2014</xref>) and enabled us to avoid explicitly priming participants to consider those distress and threat cues during the scan, which could have influenced their behavior and neural responses. Using behavioral representations of distress and threat, we assessed the extent to which each brain region in the defensive circuitry represented those cues, and its association with helping decisions. We found no indication that any of our ROIs predominantly represented the other’s distress or the threat to own self. However, our results showed that, regardless of threat imminence, the more the left amygdala and left insula represented the threat to oneself, the more participants decided to help.</p><p>The association between representation of threat and helping was particularly strong in the left amygdala. The amygdala has long been known to have a pivotal role in the acquisition and expression of defensive responses in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, in both humans and rodents, it has been shown to coordinate switches between defensive states across through the communication between its basolateral nucleus (BLA) and oxytocin(OT)-sensitive neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Terburg et al., 2018</xref>). Our present results suggest that the amygdala’s role in defensive responding may also be relevant for helping behavior. This is consistent with previous work in animals. In rodents, CeA activation by OT not only enables the transition from freezing to fight-or-flight, but has also been shown to trigger offspring care behaviors in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rickenbacher et al., 2017</xref>), and to enhance maternal aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosch, 2013</xref>). It has additionally been demonstrated that the administration of benzodiazepines, drugs with a known effect on CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griessner et al., 2021</xref>), impairs helping behavior in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together with these reports, our findings in humans suggest that amygdala-mediated defensive processes may also enable the provision of care to others, here in the form of helping. Of note, our effects were restricted to the left amygdala, which is consistent with several others demonstrations of hemispheric specialization in amygdala function in emotional and pain processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blair et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Young and Williams, 2010</xref>).</p><p>We found no evidence that the representation of other’s distress in any ROI was associated with helping, including in brain regions that have previously linked with empathy for pain and distress states (ACC and insula) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernhardt and Singer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lockwood, 2016</xref>). Relatedly, our behavioral analysis revealed that, contrary to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">FeldmanHall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hein et al., 2016</xref>), empathic concern was negatively associated with the percentage of helping decisions. These findings are at odds with prior accounts of altruistic responding, which suggest empathy for distress is the key proximal mechanism driving helping behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Waal and Preston, 2017</xref>). Several explanations may account for lack of evidence of an association between neural representation of distress and helping in our data. One is that the behavioral ratings, which were collected after the scan, were not sensitive enough to reflect variations in perceived distress between clips of the confederate. However, this seems unlikely, given that we found significant effects of imminence and threat level on ratings of distress. Another possibility is that distress is mainly represented in brain regions not included in our analysis. The amygdala, insula and ACC would be prime candidate regions to represent another individual’s distress, in light of previous research on empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fallon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marsh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">OConnell et al., 2019</xref>), but we did not detect an association between the degree to which these regions represented distress and helping behavior. Other potential regions would be those previously implicated in mentalizing, such as the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schurz et al., 2014</xref>). At an exploratory level, we repeated the RSA analysis within anatomical masks of the left and right TPJ, but did not find evidence that the representation of distress in these regions were related to helping behavior (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>). Additional research at the whole brain level is necessary to further assess the representation of distress in the brain, and its impact on helping behavior under threat. In any case, our present results suggest that, even if perceiving distress/need in others to some extent triggers altruistic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preston, 2013</xref>), the ability to provide help may ultimately rely on the activation of circuitry implicated in self-defense.</p><p>In summary, our results point to a parallel between responses to self- and other-directed threats, and suggest that the engagement of reactive fear circuits facilitates helping of others. Importantly, we showed that the extent to which the amygdala represents the threat to self (and not other’s distress) predicts helping decisions. These results challenge the idea that empathy for distress is the only proximal mechanism motivating helping decisions, and that overriding self-defensive responses is necessary to help others under threat. Rather, in dangerous situations, one’s own response to the threatening event may enable defensive helping of others, possibly through the activation of neural mechanisms subserving both individual defense and offspring care in mammals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study has been pre-registered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/yvufn">https://osf.io/yvufn</ext-link>) and any deviations from the pre-registration are justified in the Appendix.

Participant and co-participant were then accompanied to separate testing rooms (the actual participant was taken to the MRI area) and did not interact again during the experiment (details about testing procedures, post-task questionnaires, and debriefing are available in the Appendix).</p><p>In the MRI, participants performed a task modified from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2020</xref>) wherein they made trial-by-trial decisions about whether or not to help the co-participant avoid aversive electrical shocks to the wrist, at the risk of also being shocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Threat imminence was manipulated by varying the spatial position and movement of a visual cue signaling varying levels of threat on a computer screen. Respectively, a green circle signaled no threat (no shocks), a yellow circle signaled moderate threat (1 upcoming shock), and the red circle signaled high threat (2 upcoming shocks). In addition, a webcam feed of the co-participant was presented on the screen throughout the task. Unbeknownst to the participant, the video feed was in fact pre-recorded, and edited to select unique clips for each trial of the task.</p><p>Participants were informed that, throughout the experiment, they and the co-participant would see the same screen. Each trial started with a static cue on the left side of the screen (4 s), which then moved to the right (4 s). In shock trials, the co-participant would be administered an aversive shock to the wrist when the cue reached the right end of the screen, unless participants decided to help him. To decide whether they wanted to help the co-participant avoid the upcoming shock, participants made forced-choice responses by pressing 1 (Help) or 2 (Do not help) on an MRI-compatible button box as soon as the response slide was displayed (1.25–1.75 s). Responses were prompted sometimes in the beginning of the trial, when the visual cue was static on the left side (distal threat), and other times at the end of the trial, after the visual cue had moved to an endpoint on the right, and thus immediately before shock delivery (imminent threat). Of note, the time available to make a response was identical in distal and imminent conditions. Although in naturalistic settings higher threat imminence generally coincides with less time to make a decision, here we opted to dissociate imminence from decision for the sake of experimental control. Outcomes of participants’ decisions were as follows: if they chose not to help, the co-participant would always receive a shock; if they chose to help, there would be around 70% probability of both participant and co-participant receiving 1 shock (in moderate threat trials) or 2 shocks (high threat trials). Shocks were administered on the left ankle. Participants were instructed they should respond as quickly as possible. Also, to discourage missed responses, they were informed that a shock would be delivered to both participants (with 100% chance) whenever a response was not detected. Finally, to balance the number of helping and non-helping trials during the scanning session, participants were informed that they would have a pre-set number of times they could help on each run, and thus they should try to balance, per run, the number of times they helped and not helped. In reality, participants could help on as many trials as they wished. These task instructions may have affected overall helping performance as participants were asked to consider the overall balance of helping and not helping choices whenever making a new decision. Nonetheless, participants were still left with the decision whether to help or not on any given trial, allowing us to examine the corresponding brain activation. It is also important to point out that these instructions may have introduced additional metacognitive demands on the task. Yet, given the within-subject design, these demands are not expected to have introduced a systematic bias in the data. Shock administration always happened at the end of the trial, and participants were able to see the outcome of their decisions on the screen (i.e., the co-participant receiving or not receiving a shock; 4 s).</p><p>Safe trials followed an identical structure, with response slides presented at distal or imminent stages in relation to the end of the trial. However, participants were instructed that no shocks would be given and they should arbitrarily choose to press 1 or 2 when the response slide was displayed. It was made clear to them that their choice would have no consequences for them or the co-participant.</p><p>The task included 144 trials split into 8 functional runs (approx. 8 min). Each run comprised 18 trials, 9 distal and 9 imminent, and 6 of each threat level (resulting in 24 trials per condition, in total).

In a separate model, we also added a threat imminence*level*empathic concern interaction, following previous indications that threat imminence may affect helping behavior more strongly in individuals with higher caregiving tendencies. To account for the possibility that behavior varied throughout the experiment, we also performed a mixed effects logistic regression on single trial dichotomous responses (help or no help), including the trial number as a fixed effect in addition to the other fixed effects.

Time-series of each voxel were normalized by dividing the signal intensity of a given voxel at each point by the mean signal intensity of that voxel for each run and multiplying it by 100. Resulting regression coefficients thus represent a percent signal change from the mean. Regressors were created by convolving the train of stimulus events with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Three different GLMs were estimated based on the goal of the analysis. For assessing differences based on threat imminence and level, six regressors of interest were modeled corresponding to the time window of the visual threat cue (distal safe, distal 1 shock, distal 2 shocks, imminent safe, imminent 1 shock, and imminent 2 shocks). These regressors were defined based on the position of the threat cue on the screen (static=distal; approaching=imminent), and not relative to when the participant made a decision. In addition, eight regressors of no interest were added in the model, corresponding to the time window of the response and the outcome, plus the six motion parameters estimated during realignment.</p><p>To assess differences in neural response based on the type of decision, another model was estimated with six regressors of interest: help distal 1 shock, help imminent 1 shock, help distal 2 shocks, help imminent 2 shocks, no help distal, and no help imminent. Here, distal and imminent refer specifically to when the decision was prompted in the trial. Of note, due to the reduced number of no helping trials for some participants, the ‘no help’ regressor included both not help decisions, and decisions made during safe trials, wherein no shocks were given. In addition, eight regressors of no interest (response, outcome, and six motion parameters) were added. Because of potential concerns in modelling no help and safe trials together, we additionally created a model that included regressors for distal and imminent events (per threat level) with a subsequent decision, and for each shock regressor (1 shock and 2 shocks) we added a parametric modulator to reflect the response subsequently made in that trial (0=no help, 1=help). The limitation of this approach is that only participants with at least 1 ‘no help trial’ trial per condition were included (N=28). Following reviewer advice, we also implemented a Bayesian approach (using Variational Bayes in SPM12) to obtain a first-level model that produced separate estimates for help, no help and safe trials, based on threat imminence and level.

We analyzed BOLD signal to the threat cues, regardless of decision, in a threat imminence (distal and imminent) by threat level (safe, 1 shock, and 2 shocks) repeated-measures ANOVA. We also analyzed BOLD signal to threat cues prior to the decision in a decision type (help and not help) by threat imminence (distal and imminent) ANOVA. Full results for these analyses are available in . Finally, we performed a One-sample t test on parametric modulator contrast images to identify brain regions wherein average activation during the threat was modulated by subsequent decision. Univariate analysis results were first thresholded at p&lt;0.001 uncorrected. With this threshold, clusters with more than 10 voxels were significant with FWE-corrected p&lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2-5"><title>Representational similarity analysis</title><p>One of the goals of the study was to characterize representations of other’s distress and of threat to oneself by defensive regions, and determine its relation to helping behavior. RSA was done separately for imminent and distal trials, and comprised three steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). On the first step, we modeled each trial in the first-level analysis (in SPM12), in order to estimate one beta coefficient per trial. Then, for each ROI, we extracted betas from each voxel in each trial to estimate the correlation of beta-values (expressed in r values) between all voxels per trial. Resulting r values were used to construct a representational similarity matrix across all trials that reflects the correlation between all voxels in each trial. This matrix was then transformed (1−r) to reflect dissimilarity instead of similarity (RDM). On the second step, distress ratings provided after the scan on the unique video clips shown in each trial were used to construct a dissimilarity matrix that reflects the difference in perceived distress of the co-participant between trials (expressed in Euclidean distances). Post-scan threat level ratings were used in an identical manner to construct a dissimilarity matrix that reflects between-trial differences in how threatened the participant felt during the scan. Finally, on the third step, we estimated the second-order similarity (kendall’s τ) between neural and behavioral RDMs. In a nutshell, this similarity metric allowed us to assess, for each ROI, whether trial-by-trial multivoxel patterns during the scan represented the co-participant’s distress and the threat to oneself. Importantly, it allowed us to determine whether neural representations of other’s distress and of threat to oneself were associated with helping behavior. To do so, second-order similarity values were entered in a linear model predicting average helping percentage during the scan. Predictors in this model were the similarity between neural and threat RDM, the similarity between neural and distress RDM, as well as threat imminence. Thirteen linear models were estimated, one for each ROI (i.e., left and right amygdala, left and right hippocampus, left and right insula, midbrain, left and right ACC, left and right vmPFC, and left and right vlPFC). False discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to adjust the p value of all coefficient estimates, across all 13 models. FDR-corrected p values below α=0.05 were considered significant. Beta value extraction was performed in Matlab, and all remaining steps and analyses of the RSA were performed through custom-made scripts in R (code available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/nb6cf/">https://osf.io/nb6cf/</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the RSA pipeline.</title><p>On step 1, we extracted the vector of trial-by-trial betas for each voxel in a given ROI. We then calculated the correlation (Pearson r) between all trial pairs. These correlation values were inverted (1−r) and used to create a trial-by-trial matrix, wherein each cell represents how correlated activation across all voxels of the ROI was in each trial pair (neural representational dissimilarity matrix, RDM). On step 2, post-scan ratings of the co-participant’s distress in each unique clip were used to construct a trial-by-trial matrix, wherein each cell contained the Euclidean distance between the rating of each pair of clips (distress RDM). A similar method was used with the ratings of threat to the participant (threat RDM). On step 3, the second-order similarity between the neural RDM and distress RDM, and between the neural RDM and threat RDM were calculated using a ranked correlation method (Kendall’s tau).

Upon arrival, both participant and co-participant (i.e., confederate) were welcomed into the lab and told that the experiment comprised two parts and each one of them would only perform one. The parts were assigned through a fake coin flip to give the impression of randomization. Participant and co-participant were then accompanied to separate rooms to receive more detailed instructions.</p><p>Prior to entering the MRI, written informed consent was obtained, and electrodes for administration of electrical shocks were placed on participants’ left ankle. Participants were then given a short practice block on a computer, to allow them to familiarize with the timing of responses. After the practice, participants were taken into the MRI scanner room.</p><p>Once in the scanner, shock intensity was individually calibrated using a standard work-up procedure. Participants were asked to select an intensity level that was “not painful, but very uncomfortable” and that it should be something that “if they could avoid, they would rather avoid”. It was emphasized to participants that, during the experiment, they would be able to avoid the shock if they so desired.</p><p>Participants were then given written instructions for the first block of the task. They were informed they would see the co-participant via webcam and they would both be presented the same stimuli on the screen. The first block consisted of 3 trials (safe, 1 shock and 2 shocks), wherein the participant was simply required to pay attention to the screen; they would not be asked to make any responses and would not be given any shocks. The goal of this block was to allow participants to see the consequences of safe and threat trials to the co-participant. This was meant to discourage them from making “test responses” in the first trials of the actual task (for instance, decide not to help just to see whether the co-participant would indeed receive a shock).</p><p>Thereafter, participants were given written instructions for the rest of the task. They were explained that, on each trial, they would be asked whether they wanted to help the co-participant avoid the shock(s) or not, and what would be the outcomes of their decisions. Participants were also informed that: 1. the co-participant was not aware that shock administration was decided by them, 2. they should try to balance out the number of help and not help decisions, since there was a preset number of times they could help in each run, 3. they would not swap places with the co-participant afterwards, 4. they would not meet the co-participant again after finishing the experiment, and 5. their behavior during the task would not be observed nor filmed.</p><p>After the scan, participants were taken to another testing room to perform the ratings task. At the end, they were asked to fill out questionnaires, including post-tasks questions designed to assess whether the instructions and cover-story were believable (e.g., To what extent do you think the shocks were controlled by you? How authentic did the co-participant seem to you?). Lastly, they were fully debriefed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Post-task and questionnaire measures</title><p>After the fMRI helping under threat task and the ratings task, participants completed a series of questionnaires to assess individual differences in empathy and threat sensitivity, including the Interpersonal Reactivity Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis, 1983</xref>), the Trait Fear Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kramer et al., 2020</xref>), the, and the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Patrick et al., 2009</xref>).

Much of the prevailing knowledge about the motivations for prosocial behavior focuses on the distress of the conspecific-in-need. Leveraging animal research, the authors hypothesize that defensive neural circuitry may stimulate prosocial helping under threat, specifically that &quot;cognitive&quot; fear circuits would respond to more distal threats whereas &quot;reactive&quot; fear circuits would respond to imminent threats. In addition to examining helping behavior under conditions of threat to self, the authors included representational similarity analyses of neuroimaging data, examining how overlapping representations of self and other distress related to helping behavior.

Shackman (Reviewing Editor) and Roiser (Senior Editor).</p><p>The Reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor, who drafted this summary.</p><p>The Reviewers noted several strengths of the manuscript, including:</p><p>– The theoretical basis for this work is sound and the authors attempt to answer a question of broad interest.</p><p>– The questions the authors set out to investigate are interesting and original. Understanding the role of defensive neural circuitry in helping decisions is of interest to fields of neuroscience, ecology, and psychology.</p><p>– This topic of this paper will be of interest to readers in the field of decision–making under threat, fear and anxiety, defensive responses, and altruistic behaviors. With an ecologically inspired task design, the authors looked into the relationship between self–directed defensive mechanism and the action of helping others, and shed lights on the brain regions and neural circuits driving these behavioral dynamics.</p><p>– Conceptually, this paper taps into the dynamics between altruistic behaviors and defensive responses to simulated ecological threat in humans, which is substantially relevant but is to date a rare breed. This innovation helps advance the understanding of the intersection. It also builds strongly upon prior human/animal research, where the &quot;cognitive fear&quot; and &quot;reactive fear&quot; circuits on the threat imminence continuum has been established.</p><p>– The inclusion of threat imminence and threat value increase the contribution of this work to understanding how helping decisions vary as a function of threat features.</p><p>– The authors preregistered the study analyses and hypotheses.</p><p>Nevertheless, several substantial concerns considerably dampened enthusiasm and there was a consensus that additional data and major revisions would be required.</p><p>As Reviewer #1 noted, &quot;The interpretation of these data is hindered by a number of technical and conceptual limitations with data analysis and experimental design. Most of the data analysis concerns can be addressed, but conceptual issues with the experimental design substantially limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the current study.&quot; S/he also emphasized that the study &quot;requires essential additional data to support the central claims. As [both Reviewers] noted, the collapsing of &quot;no help&quot; choices makes it difficult for the authors to substantiate their primary claims about neural engagement in response to helping versus not helping. I also raised concerns about the second central claim, which is the argument that the RSA results demonstrate a unique representation of one's own threat, but not the other's distress. Without additional data addressing these two concerns, I am not confident the claims are substantiated. I have enthusiasm for this work…but these are pretty big&quot; concerns.</p><p>As Reviewer #2 noted, &quot;My concerns overlap with those of Reviewer #1. After reading [his/her] comments and the paper again, I agree that the authors would need to conduct additional control experiments and analysis to address the major limitations.&quot;</p><p>– Instructions/New Data</p><p>R1. The authors explicitly instructed participants that they &quot;would have a pre–set number of times they could help on each run, and thus they should try to balance, per run, the number of times they helped and not helped&quot;.</p><p>R1. These instructions undermine most of the study conclusions. The verbal instruction to balance helping and non–helping behavior introduces an auxiliary constraint into the task, likely inducing metacognitive processes in participants via which they monitor their behavior to ensure that they satisfy the constraint. It is unclear how such metacognitive processes would alter neural activity during the task, making it difficult to distinguish whether the observed BOLD signal is involved in decision making or is also influenced by metacognition. The data indicate that most subjects heeded these instructions: Figure 2B illustrates that most subjects maintained differences of less than 10% in helping vs. non–helping behavior and approximately half maintained differences of less than 5%, suggesting that most subjects attempted to balance helping and non–helping decisions.</p><p>– RSA Analyses</p><p>R1. Although this study has strengths in principle, the weaknesses of this work result in an inability to support the conclusions the authors attempt to make. One of the stated goals of this work is to determine how the neural representations of self threat and other's distress are associated with helping behavior. To dissociate representations of threat and other's distress within the defensive circuitry would require the authors to show that the neural representations of threat are separable in voxel space from the neural representations of other's distress.</p><p>R1. The authors do not explicitly show that the two kinds of neural representations are dissociable or that neural representations are sufficiently stable within conditions to be used in an RSA. One can imagine that representational drift across trials could lead to high variance of neural representations within a single condition, leading to low similarity scores within that condition and therefore deflated second–order similarity scores. To show that the neural representations of self threat and other's distress are dissociable, the authors would need to first determine the distributions of these two kinds of representations in conditions where subjects are faced only with a threat to themselves or only with the distress of another. This could be done, for example, by continuing to image while subjects rated self threat and other's distress and extracting the distribution of voxel patterns that are correlated with these ratings; then, methods from signal detection theory could be used to determine if the two distributions are separable.</p><p>R1. The authors assume that when the threat and conspecific in need are presented simultaneously the neural representations in these contexts will be a linear combination of the separate representations for self threat and other's distress. Evidence from other domains suggests that may be unlikely; for example, in olfaction, sensory representations of mixtures of two odors are rarely a linear combination of the individual sensory representations of each odor presented separately.</p><p>R1. These conceptual issues with the RSA hinder its interpretation here and make it difficult to accept the authors' interpretation that &quot;neural representations of threat promoted helping'.</p><p>– Data Pooling/Muddling</p><p>R1. In the section &quot;Greater engagement of reactive fear circuits led to helping&quot;, the authors pool imaging data from trials on which a &quot;no help&quot; decision was made with imaging data from safe trials. A decision under threat to help a conspecific and an arbitrary decision with no consequences for either the subject or conspecific should involve different neural mechanisms, so there is no clear justification for pooling the data from these two conditions. Pooling data from these two conditions makes it impossible to determine whether the results of the ANOVA provide sufficient evidence for their conclusion that &quot;greater engagement of reactive fear circuits led to helping'.</p><p>R2. As mentioned in line 227, because of a reduced number of &quot;no help&quot; decision trials in the conditions where threat is present, the authors used trials from the safe condition in conjunction to form the regressor. This might reflect an &quot;inflation&quot; in &quot;help&quot; decisions, possibly due to the nature of the experimental environment and task design [See comments regarding 'instructions']. This could influence the interpretation of the behavioral results – for example, there was no significant difference between the &quot;help&quot; ration in distal and imminent threat conditions, and that could be due to the saturated &quot;helping&quot; responses (line 798, Figure 2A). This is also potentially problematic for the imaging analysis, since there has been research showing that safety signals are implicated in the vmPFC regions, which overlap with the key ROIs listed in this research. The &quot;no help&quot; trials under safety would not be homogenous to the &quot;no help&quot; trials under threat.</p><p>R2. Both in the Results and Discussion sections (line 300 – 314), the authors mentioned that the average activation patterns for imminent and distal threats were contrary to previous research of similar nature. One possible explanation the paper might have overlooked is that the analysis would be done without the independence of &quot;help/no help&quot; decisions. In the previous research the paper cited, there was only one possible choice when under threat. However, in the current study, &quot;help&quot; resembles an approach choice, while &quot;no help&quot; an avoidance choice (and possibly safety signal). combining them would confound the results.</p><p>R1. The authors should re–run the analysis without pooling the safe and no–help conditions. If the authors are worried about a lack of data on ``no help' decisions, they could take a Bayesian approach to the analysis since Bayesian models are non–asymptotic and therefore do not make the same demands on sample size as frequentist approaches. Summary statistics for the distribution of no–help decisions should be included.</p><p>R2. The authors could consider separating the &quot;help&quot; and &quot;no help&quot; trials in a more stringent manner, or create some control scenarios where only one action is possible;</p><p>R2. The study would benefit from some adjustment to the paradigm itself – to reduce the &quot;inflation&quot; in helping, and increase the effectiveness of different levels of threat;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78162.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Instructions/New Data</p><p>R1.

We disagree that the “instructions undermine most of the study conclusions”. The implementation of these instructions was motivated by our results in a previous study using a similar paradigm (Vieira et al., 2020, Proc B), in which we found markedly skewed response distributions caused by the high rate of helping. We also found evidence of this during piloting for the current fMRI study, in which this would be especially problematic because we needed participants to decide not to help in at least some trials so we could analyse the corresponding brain responses. Therefore, we (falsely) informed participants they would need to balance out the number of help and not help responses. We were fully aware that the total helping percentage throughout the task could be affected by the instructions, as the total number of helping responses would not necessarily reflect the number of times participants would like to have helped. But importantly, at the trial level, participants were still left with the decision of whether to help or not, and thus the corresponding brain response leading to the decision in each trial remained informative.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the verbal instruction could have induced metacognitive processes, but also believe that, based on participants’ subjective reports at the end of the study, a task of this nature will always introduce metacognitive processes over which we have no experimental control. The influence of such metacognitive processes would have been similar across conditions (given our within-subjects design), and not likely to introduce systematic bias in the results. The most crucial aspect, in our opinion, is that regardless of the experiment’s constraints, participants were still left with a trial-by-trial decision of whether to help or not.</p><p>Despite our confidence in the task instructions, we fully agree with the reviewer that more information is needed to justify their rationale and potential implications for the study conclusions. We therefore edited the manuscript as follows:</p><p>P. 15: “Our failure to replicate prior behavioural effects of threat imminence could have been due to a difference in how participants were instructed (here, we instructed individuals to balance helping and not helping decisions) and/or…”.</p><p>P. 22: “to balance the number of helping and non-helping trials during the scanning session, participants were informed that they would have a pre-set number of times they could help on each run, and thus they should try to balance, per run, the number of times they helped and not helped (…) Although these task instructions may have affected overall helping performance, at the trial level, participants were still left with the decision whether to help or not on any given trial, allowing us to examine the corresponding brain activation. It is also important to point out that these instructions may have introduced additional metacognitive demands on the task. Yet, given the within-subject design, these demands are not expected to have introduced a systematic bias in the data”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– RSA Analyses</p><p>R1. Although this study has strengths in principle, the weaknesses of this work result in an inability to support the conclusions the authors attempt to make. One of the stated goals of this work is to determine how the neural representations of self threat and other's distress are associated with helping behavior. To dissociate representations of threat and other's distress within the defensive circuitry would require the authors to show that the neural representations of threat are separable in voxel space from the neural representations of other's distress.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point and agree that this is a key aspect we need to clarify. Our goal, as the reviewer mentioned, was to determine whether the neural representation of self threat and other's distress in specific brain regions was associated with helping behaviour. It was not to localize representations of distress and threat in voxel space within those regions. The localization of voxels exclusively representing distress or threat would not have answered our question, which was specifically related to how representation of a certain type of information across the entire ROI was associated with helping. In fact, based on previous studies we would expect several of the used ROIs to represent both self-threat and other’s distress (e.g., insula and ACC). Overlapping voxels in such regions could represent both other’s distress and threat to self, but only the representation of threat be correlated with helping across the whole ROI (as we found).</p><p>To make our objective clearer, we edited the introduction in the following way:</p><p>P. 6: “To dissociate the role of representations of threat and of other’s distress on helping behaviour, after the scan we asked participants to rate the degree of distress experienced by the co-participant in each clip showed during the scan; also, participants rated how threatened they felt themselves when they saw the visual threat cues during the scan. These ratings were used as behavioural models in an ROI-based representational similarity analysis (RSA; see Materials and methods) that identified neural representations of other’s distress and of threat to the self, and determined their association with helping behaviour. It should be noted that our goal was specifically related to the link between neural representations of distress and threat, and helping behaviour, and not to the dissociation of representations of distress and threat in the brain. This, however, would be a highly interesting question to examine in future research.”</p><p>Also, to provide additional information regarding the extent to which activity in our ROIs was predominantly correlated with the representation of self threat or other’s distress we compared the second-order similarity between the neural, threat and distress RDMs. In other words, we checked whether trial-by-trial neural activity in each ROI was differently associated with ratings of other’s distress or of self threat. These comparisons showed that, across all ROIs examined, there was no evidence that other’s distress or threat to self were predominantly represented. We now report this in the manuscript:</p><p>P. 13: “Based on the second-order similarity between neural and behavioural RDMs, we found no evidence for any of the ROIs that neural activity predominantly represented other’s distress or threat to self (Table S5)”.</p><p>We provide the corresponding statistics, obtained with R’s cocor package (Diedenhofen, 2019; using Pearson and Filon's z, 1898) for overlapping correlations, in the supplemental information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1. The authors do not explicitly show that the two kinds of neural representations are dissociable or that neural representations are sufficiently stable within conditions to be used in an RSA. One can imagine that representational drift across trials could lead to high variance of neural representations within a single condition, leading to low similarity scores within that condition and therefore deflated second–order similarity scores. To show that the neural representations of self threat and other's distress are dissociable, the authors would need to first determine the distributions of these two kinds of representations in conditions where subjects are faced only with a threat to themselves or only with the distress of another. This could be done, for example, by continuing to image while subjects rated self threat and other's distress and extracting the distribution of voxel patterns that are correlated with these ratings; then, methods from signal detection theory could be used to determine if the two distributions are separable.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that it would be have been ideal to directly measure the neural representation of other’s distress and self threat by scanning participants while they provided ratings or distress and threat. The reason we decided not to do this is that it would have increased scanning time to 2 hours or more (the ratings were self-paced). Fatigue can compromise data quality, and we did not want to prolong the scanning time beyond what is reasonable to ask from participants. We therefore decided to obtain only behavioural representations of other’s distress and self threat outside of the scanner. We would like to point out that the use of behavioural models in RSA analysis has been a successful and frequently used approach in previous studies (e.g., Parkinson et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1. The authors assume that when the threat and conspecific in need are presented simultaneously the neural representations in these contexts will be a linear combination of the separate representations for self threat and other's distress. Evidence from other domains suggests that may be unlikely; for example, in olfaction, sensory representations of mixtures of two odors are rarely a linear combination of the individual sensory representations of each odor presented separately.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that we do not assume a linear combination of representations of threat and other’s distress. Indeed, no assumptions were made regarding how these representations are combined when both cues are present. Instead, our focus was to find the association between those representations and helping behaviour. We realize, based on the reviewer’s comment, that our main goal was not sufficiently clear in the manuscript, so we have now clarified it in the following way:</p><p>P.15: “To dissociate the role of representations of threat and of other’s distress on helping behaviour, after the scan we asked participants to rate…”.</p><p>P.17: “To decide whether to help another person in a dangerous situation, one must consider not only their distress, but also the threat in the environment. Here, we determined how the representations of another’s distress and of threat guide behaviour.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1. These conceptual issues with the RSA hinder its interpretation here and make it difficult to accept the authors' interpretation that &quot;neural representations of threat promoted helping'.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that some of these conceptual issues were not made sufficiently clear in the initial version, and are thankful to be given the opportunity to address them. We hope that with the current alterations and clarifications, the RSA analysis and its interpretation will be clearer to readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Data Pooling/Muddling</p><p>R1. In the section &quot;Greater engagement of reactive fear circuits led to helping&quot;, the authors pool imaging data from trials on which a &quot;no help&quot; decision was made with imaging data from safe trials. A decision under threat to help a conspecific and an arbitrary decision with no consequences for either the subject or conspecific should involve different neural mechanisms, so there is no clear justification for pooling the data from these two conditions. Pooling data from these two conditions makes it impossible to determine whether the results of the ANOVA provide sufficient evidence for their conclusion that &quot;greater engagement of reactive fear circuits led to helping'.</p><p>R2. As mentioned in line 227, because of a reduced number of &quot;no help&quot; decision trials in the conditions where threat is present, the authors used trials from the safe condition in conjunction to form the regressor. This might reflect an &quot;inflation&quot; in &quot;help&quot; decisions, possibly due to the nature of the experimental environment and task design [See comments regarding 'instructions']. This could influence the interpretation of the behavioral results – for example, there was no significant difference between the &quot;help&quot; ration in distal and imminent threat conditions, and that could be due to the saturated &quot;helping&quot; responses (line 798, Figure 2A). This is also potentially problematic for the imaging analysis, since there has been research showing that safety signals are implicated in the vmPFC regions, which overlap with the key ROIs listed in this research. The &quot;no help&quot; trials under safety would not be homogenous to the &quot;no help&quot; trials under threat.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the point made by both reviewers that there are limitations in combining “not help” and safe decisions in the comparison against help decisions. In fact, this was not our preferred approach, and it was made to overcome the reduced number of “not help” trials in comparison to help trials.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ concerns, we now included in the manuscript a parametric modulation analysis. Here, we used a GLM that included a parametric modulator for decisions made in shock trials (0 if no help, and 1 if helped). This analysis has the advantage of modelling all threat imminence and level conditions in the GLM (including safe trials), but only assigning parametric modulators to conditions in which a subsequent helping decision was made (i.e., distal 1 shock, distal 2 shocks, imminent 1 shock and imminent 2 shocks). The disadvantage of this approach is that only participants that at least 1 trial in which they did not help were included. The results of the parametric modulator analysis were consistent with our original findings. We have now added the following paragraph to the manuscript:</p><p>P. 12: “One limitation of this analysis is that it conflated responses made during safe trials and no help responses. It could be argued that these represent fundamentally different types of decisions. To overcome this limitation, we also performed a parametric modulator analysis, in which we used a GLM that included a parametric modulator for decisions made in shock trials (0 if no help, and 1 if helped). This analysis allowed us to model all threat imminence and level conditions, but only assign parametric modulators to those in which a subsequent help or no help decision was made (i.e., distal 1 shock, distal 2 shocks, imminent 1 shock and imminent 2 shocks). The disadvantage of this approach is that only participants with at least 1 “no help trial” trial per condition were included (N=28). Results of the parametric modulator analysis were consistent with those of the Anova (Table 3), in that we only found significant modulation of brain activation by subsequent decision during distal threats. Activation of bilateral insula was increased before helping decisions (Distal 2 shocks), and activation of the vmPFC was increased before not helping decisions (Distal 1 and 2 shocks).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2. Both in the Results and Discussion sections (line 300 – 314), the authors mentioned that the average activation patterns for imminent and distal threats were contrary to previous research of similar nature. One possible explanation the paper might have overlooked is that the analysis would be done without the independence of &quot;help/no help&quot; decisions. In the previous research the paper cited, there was only one possible choice when under threat. However, in the current study, &quot;help&quot; resembles an approach choice, while &quot;no help&quot; an avoidance choice (and possibly safety signal). combining them would confound the results.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We have added this possibility in our Discussion as follows:</p><p>P. 15: “These results are opposite to those from prior studies that manipulated the imminence of self-directed threats (28, 30, 31, 33). It is possible, however, that the disparity between our and previous findings is due to methodological reasons and does not reflect true differences in the processing of self- versus other-directed threats. For instance, in previous work only avoidance responses were made, whereas in our paradigm both help and no help decisions were possible (perhaps more analogous to an approach and avoidance option). Importantly, …”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1. The authors should re–run the analysis without pooling the safe and no–help conditions. If the authors are worried about a lack of data on ``no help' decisions, they could take a Bayesian approach to the analysis since Bayesian models are non–asymptotic and therefore do not make the same demands on sample size as frequentist approaches. Summary statistics for the distribution of no–help decisions should be included.</p><p>R2. The authors could consider separating the &quot;help&quot; and &quot;no help&quot; trials in a more stringent manner, or create some control scenarios where only one action is possible;</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this important point made by both reviewers in our additional parametric modulation analysis, which we described above. We have also included the response distributions in the Supplemental information. We believe this extra analysis addresses the reviewers’ concerns, but are open to performing additional Bayesian analyses if the reviewers and editors deem it necessary. It should be noted, however, that the Bayesian estimation of betas associated with not-helping decisions will still rely on a smaller number of trials than helping decisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2. The study would benefit from some adjustment to the paradigm itself – to reduce the &quot;inflation&quot; in helping, and increase the effectiveness of different levels of threat;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our paradigm could be adjusted, and in future research, we will certainly use the reviewers’ feedback to improve the paradigm. Yet, we are confident in the value of the added analyses suggested by the reviewers in further strengthening our original conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
