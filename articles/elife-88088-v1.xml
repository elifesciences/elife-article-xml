is often hindered by their small size. Ultrastructural expansion microscopy (U-ExM) is a microscopy preparation method that physically expands the sample by ~4.5×. Here, we apply U-ExM to the human malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> during the asexual blood stage of its lifecycle to understand how this parasite is organized in three dimensions. Using a combination of dye-conjugated reagents and immunostaining, we have cataloged 13 different <italic>P. falciparum</italic> structures or organelles across the intraerythrocytic development of this parasite and made multiple observations about fundamental parasite cell biology. We describe that the outer centriolar plaque and its associated proteins anchor the nucleus to the parasite plasma membrane during mitosis. Furthermore, the rhoptries, Golgi, basal complex, and inner membrane complex, which form around this anchoring site while nuclei are still dividing, are concurrently segregated and maintain an association to the outer centriolar plaque until the start of segmentation. We also show that the mitochondrion and apicoplast undergo sequential fission events while maintaining an association with the outer centriolar plaque during cytokinesis. Collectively, this study represents the most detailed ultrastructural analysis of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> during its intraerythrocytic development to date and sheds light on multiple poorly understood aspects of its organelle biogenesis and fundamental cell biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Plasmodium</italic></kwd><kwd>expansion microscopy</kwd><kwd>MTOC</kwd><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.58275/aha.23post1011626.pc.gr.161347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liffner</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI145941</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dvorin</surname><given-names>Jeffrey D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 AI172110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cepeda Diaz</surname><given-names>Ana Karla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>NHMRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT2020822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Danny W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hospital Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C-MCF-52-2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Danny W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ultrastructure expansion microscopy unlocks new fundamental cell biology of malaria parasites, providing new insights into processes including establishment of cell polarity, organelle biogenesis, and organelle fission.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> has a complex lifecycle that involves both human and mosquito hosts. Of its many lifecycle stages, the asexual replication of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> inside human red blood cells (RBCs) is responsible for the clinical symptoms of malaria. This asexual blood stage starts when a merozoite invades a host RBC and transitions through several morphologies before forming approximately 30 new daughter merozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rudlaff et al., 2020</xref>), which egress from their host cell and invade new RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Host RBCs are approximately 7–8 µm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kinnunen et al., 2011</xref>) and contain dozens of parasites, each with their own sets of organelles and structures. The small size of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and its organelles still poses a challenge to the study of many facets of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cell biology, especially when immunostaining is required.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ultrastructural expansion microscopy (U-ExM) workflow and summary of parasite structures imaged in this study.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Diagram of asexual blood-stage lifecycle of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.

While many expansion microscopy methods have been developed, ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gambarotto et al., 2019</xref>) was the first used in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and since has been used in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and across multiple apicomplexan parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertiaux et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dave et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liffner and Absalon, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oliveira Souza et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rashpa and Brochet, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Severo et al., 2022</xref>). U-ExM results in the ~4.5-fold isotropic expansion of the sample and largely preserves its proteome, making it compatible with antibody staining and many fluorescent dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gambarotto et al., 2019</xref>). The increase in physical sample size results in a dramatic increase in the ability to identify and distinguish different parasite structures. Thus, some structures that could previously only be investigated using electron microscopy can now be studied with the flexibility, scalability, and inexpensive nature of conventional light microscopy.</p><p>Application of U-ExM to <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and other Apicomplexa, has already enhanced our understanding of parasite cell biology tremendously, resulting in the identification of new parasite structures and better characterization of the size and shape of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertiaux et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liffner and Absalon, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rashpa and Brochet, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tomasina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tosetti et al., 2020</xref>). Its significant impact on the field in such a short amount of time indicates U-ExM will be a technique heavily used in both <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and Apicomplexa more broadly for the foreseeable future. Considering this, we set out to image <italic>P. falciparum</italic> structures and organelles across the asexual blood stage of the lifecycle to serve as a reference for the expanding number of U-ExM users who study Apicomplexa and uncover previously invisible aspects of the cell biology of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>U-ExM reveals multiple parasite structures without the use of antibodies</title><p>Dyes that are not antigen-specific are commonplace in light microscopy. N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters conjugated to dyes are amino-reactive and can be used for fluorescent labeling of protein density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nanda and Lorsch, 2014</xref>). Similarly, BODIPY TR ceramide (BODIPY TRc) and other dye-conjugated fatty acids are commonly used for labeling lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marks et al., 2008</xref>). Coupling U-ExM with these dyes has already revealed parasite structures for which specific antibodies did not exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertiaux et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liffner and Absalon, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simon et al., 2021</xref>). While antibody-based labeling provides high specificity, this labeling lacks complexity and is limited to the specific protein or antigen that is being targeted. The more general stains increase the number of parasite features or organelles we can observe in the same sample without additional antibody markers. Therefore, these general stains allow for low-specificity but high-complexity imaging. An example of this principle is the use of uranyl acetate in electron microscopy to increase contrast by increasing the electron density of phosphate-rich structures in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rudlaff et al., 2020</xref>). While NHS esters and uranyl acetate can bring out similar features in the cell, they do not have the same reactivity and are therefore not equivalent stains. To better profile the subcellular organization of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> during the asexual blood stages, we set out to determine what parasite structures could, and could not, be visualized by U-ExM when using some of these dyes.</p><p>We, and others, have previously shown that combining BODIPY TRc and dye-conjugated NHS ester with U-ExM allows visualization of the parasite plasma membrane (PPM), parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM), nuclear envelope, rhoptries, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), centriolar plaque (CP), basal complex, and apical polar rings (APRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertiaux et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liffner and Absalon, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simon et al., 2021</xref>). However, many important organelles and parasite structures are either not identifiable using these stains or have yet to be validated, including the mitochondrion, apicoplast, and cytostomes.</p><p>To identify and validate the location of as many parasite organelles and structures as possible, we utilized U-ExM coupled with BODIPY TRc, Alexa Fluor 405-conjugated NHS ester (which we will refer to as ‘NHS ester’), the nucleic acid (i.e., DNA) stain SYTOX Deep Red, and antibodies directed against 13 different subcellular targets (microtubules, CP, basal complex, inner membrane complex [IMC], mitochondrion, apicoplast, cytostome, rhoptry bulb, rhoptry neck, micronemes, cytoplasm, ER, and Golgi). In this study, all parasites were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), unless otherwise stated, and anchored overnight at 37°C before gelation, denaturation at 95°C, and expansion. Expanded gels were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), before shrinking in PBS antibody staining, washing, re-expansion, and imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Parasites were harvested at multiple time points during the intraerythrocytic asexual stage and imaged using Airyscan 2 super-resolution microscopy, providing high-resolution three-dimensional imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). A full summary of all target-specific stains used in this study can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>.</p><p>The first protein we imaged was aldolase, a marker of the parasite cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Aldolase staining was present in all asexual replication stages. During the ring stage, the ‘ameboid’ shape of the parasite is readily visualized, consistent with previous studies of this stage in time-lapse microscopy of live parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grüring et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Regions within the parasite where both aldolase and NHS ester staining were absent are consistent with the expected area of the food vacuole. Typically, the food vacuole would be filled with hemozoin; however, this crystal likely cannot expand and therefore leaves a large space inside the parasite that does not contain significant protein density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The CP, nuclear MTOC, and microtubules</title><p>The first major transition during the blood stage of the lifecycle occurs when the parasites turn from rings into trophozoites. Soon after this transition, the parasite will begin to replicate its DNA and undergo mitosis followed by nuclear fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gerald et al., 2011</xref>). Mitosis is coordinated by microtubules, which are in turn nucleated by structures called microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sanchez and Feldman, 2017</xref>). <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has a structure known as the CP that spans the nuclear envelope, with intranuclear and cytoplasmic portions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simon et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we will refer to the intranuclear portion of the CP as the inner CP and the cytoplasmic portion of the CP as the outer CP. The inner CP acts as the nuclear MTOC that coordinates <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mitosis, while the function of the outer CP is unknown in asexual blood-stage parasites. The most commonly used MTOC markers are the centrins, which in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> comprise four proteins that localize to the outer CP and appear after intranuclear microtubules have already formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simon et al., 2021</xref>). Given that an MTOC is required for microtubule formation, this implies that an MTOC forms before centrin is visible. To investigate these processes in more detail, we visualized the biogenesis and dynamics of the CP and microtubules during the trophozoite and schizont stages by pairing NHS ester, which we have recently shown can stain both the inner and outer CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liffner and Absalon, 2021</xref>), with an anti-centrin antibody (Clone 20H5, raised against centrin from <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

The inner CP first appeared in mononucleated trophozoites but changed morphology as these parasites got closer to their first nuclear division. In the 23 mononucleated trophozoites we imaged, 52% of CPs lacked cytoplasmic extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). These CPs contained only the inner CP and lacked the outer CP as observed by NHS ester (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). All 12 of the trophozoites with an inner CP but no outer CP also lacked centrin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). This matches previous reports that centrin is specifically associated with the outer CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simon et al., 2021</xref>). As expected, this early CP lacking the outer CP was capable of nucleating microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The centrin focus and outer CP became visible in mononucleated trophozoites after nucleation of the intranuclear microtubules but prior to the first CP duplication event of the first mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simon et al., 2021</xref>). The cytoplasmic extensions that form the outer CP began at the nuclear membrane and ended at an NHS ester-dense focus located at the PPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This association between the outer CP and the PPM has previously been observed in gametocytes and asexual blood stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rashpa et al., 2023</xref>), but the temporal nature of this association during the asexual blood stages remained uncharacterized. Our observation of the outer CP using NHS ester, discussed further below, combined with the temporal pattern of outer CP–PPM association, suggests that nuclei are physically anchored to the PPM while parasites are undergoing mitosis.</p><p>For as long as parasites continue to undergo mitosis throughout schizogony, the outer CP remains in contact with the PPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The outer CP appears as one or two elongated bundles, referenced throughout this paper as ‘branches,’ that stain densely with NHS ester. These branches showed one or two centrin foci that largely matched branch number. That is, of the 139 single-branched outer CPs (outer CPs with a single cytoplasmic extension branch) observed, all had a single centrin focus, and of the 30 double-branched outer CPs observed, 92% had two centrin foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The overwhelming coordination between number of cytoplasmic extension branches and number of centrin foci suggests centrin duplication and duplication of the branches of the outer CP happens quickly and simultaneously. The few cases when there is a mismatch between the number of cytoplasmic extensions and centrin foci all occur in double-branched outer CPs and can be attributed to limitations in our ability to resolve two centrin foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>).</p><p>The relative abundance of nuclei with a single CP, defined as a CP not forming a mitotic spindle, versus mitotic CPs, CPs anchored to a mitotic spindle, varied throughout schizogony as did their branch numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As we previously observed that the inner CP forms first, we hypothesized that CPs start out without an outer CP and then develop a single cytoplasmic extension and centrin focus, which duplicate ahead of CP duplication and then segregate with each CP during miotic spindle formation and karyokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This means that during the rapid mitotic events of schizogony that take place at the 6–12 nuclei stage, single outer CPs with a single cytoplasmic extension are very rare. We observed them in just 6% of 221 imaged CPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Single outer CPs with a single cytoplasmic extension were only abundant when the pace of nuclear replication was slow at the early schizont stage (24% of 76 CPs imaged in cells with 2–5 nuclei) and the end of segmentation (44% of 290 CPs imaged in segmenting parasites).</p><p>This observed pattern of duplication and segregation also suggests that double-branched outer CPs with two centrin foci have committed to undergoing a new round of mitosis and that the duplication of cytoplasmic extensions represents the first identifiable step in CP duplication. In line with this hypothesis, the most common CP states in schizonts prior to segmentation are single CPs with two cytoplasmic extensions (26% of CPs in cells with 2–5 nuclei, 52% in cells with 6–12 nuclei) that have committed to the next round of mitosis and mitotic CPs with one extension each (42% of CPs in cells with 2–5 nuclei, 36% in cells with 6–12 nuclei) that are finishing a round of mitosis. Interestingly, 8% of CPs observed in the 2–5 nuclei stage and 6% in the 6–12 nuclei stage were mitotic and double-branched, suggesting the duplication of cytoplasmic extensions, and commitment to the next round of mitosis, can happen before karyokinesis is completed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).</p><p>Outer CP branch number reaches semi-synchrony at the beginning of segmentation as defined by the first appearance of a basal complex by NHS ester. At this point, rather than seeing a variety of CP states and branch numbers, virtually all CPs in the same cell share the same mitotic state and branch number. Most CPs are mitotic with a single cytoplasmic extension during early segmentation and then appear as single CP with a single extension during mid-segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). By the time segmentation is completed, the CP is no longer visible by NHS ester, suggesting that it may disassemble after all mitotic events are finished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). To ensure imaged parasites were fully segmented, we arrested parasite development by adding the reversible protein kinase G inhibitor compound 1 (C1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gurnett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor et al., 2010</xref>). This inhibitor arrests parasite maturation after the completion of segmentation but before egress. When C1 is washed out, parasites egress and invade normally, ensuring that observations made in C1-arrested parasites are physiologically relevant and not a developmental artifact due to arrest. Of 159 nuclei imaged in 6 C1-arrested schizonts, none showed the presence of a CP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The apical polar rings, Golgi, and rhoptries are all segregated with the CP</title><p>Given the cytoplasmic coordination of mitotic events and the physical tethering of the nucleus to the PPM throughout schizogony, we investigated whether we could observe any coordination extending to the apical organelles and other structures known to be present near the CP at these stages. We observed close association between the outer CP and the rhoptries, Golgi, basal complex, and an apical density reminiscent of the APR.</p><p>The number of basal complex structures closely matched the number of outer CP extensions throughout schizogony (156 observed cytoplasmic extensions, 153 observed basal complexes). The basal complex, discussed in detail below, appears as a ring-like structure from early schizogony to the completion of segmentation. No basal complex structures were observed in CPs without cytoplasmic extensions. Of 82 single-branched outer CPs imaged, 81 (99%) showed a single basal complex structure. Of 37 double-branched outer CPs imaged, 33 (89%) showed two basal complex structures. As we observed when imaging centrin foci, the few cases when there is a mismatch between the number of cytoplasmic extensions and basal complex structures mostly occur in double-branched outer CPs. However, in this case, the mismatch cannot be attributed to resolution and most likely reflects a transition state in basal complex replication. CINCH stains the basal complex in a punctate pattern until early segmentation, allowing us to visualize basal complex division events as gaps in the punctate staining (Figure 4a and b). The occasional presence of two cytoplasmic extensions in the absence of these gaps suggests that basal complex division, when visualized by breaks in CINCH staining, is less simultaneous with outer CP branch duplication than centrin focus duplication.</p><p>Rhoptry biogenesis, discussed further below, was also closely tied to the number and position of the outer CP. This association of one rhoptry per branch, however, is broken at the start of segmentation, when 205 of 211 imaged CPs (97%) had a rhoptry pair per outer CP branch. Further suggestive of CP–rhoptry interaction is the fact that the rhoptries were positioned immediately next to the outer CP for as long as these were visible by NHS ester. While we had no APR protein marker, the cytoplasmic extensions always ended in an NHS ester-dense focus at the plasma membrane. At the beginning of segmentation, this focus obtained a morphology suggestive of the APR based on its ring shape, position, and size. As described above, a small percentage of parasites commit to the next round of mitosis before they finish segregating their genetic material. In these parasites, CP-associated organelles continued to match the number of cytoplasmic extensions. This gave rise to nuclei that were anchored to four basal complexes, four single rhoptries, and four proto-APR densities in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This matches previous observations by three-dimensional electron microscopy that a single nucleus can have four sets of apical buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rudlaff et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We also characterized the distribution of the Golgi and its location near the CP and apical organelles, this spatial correlation had been previously described by electron microscopy but has not been thoroughly explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bannister et al., 2000</xref>). The Golgi was visualized using an antibody to ER lumen protein retaining receptor 2 (ERD2), a <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi marker expressed throughout intraerythrocytic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elmendorf and Haldar, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Small regions of Golgi were visible at all development stages. In ring-stage parasites and mononucleated trophozoites, one or two Golgi foci were observed near the nucleus but had no clear proximity to the CP. In all five imaged parasites with less than two nuclei and an outer CP, no Golgi was observed near the inner CP. In parasites that had undergone the first round of mitosis and had an outer CP, the Golgi was proximal to the extensions of the outer CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>) and closely matched their number and presence. Specifically, 21 of 22 imaged parasites with visible outer CPs had Golgi staining near each branch of their outer CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). While increased Golgi–CP proximity coincides with the appearance of the cytoplasmic extensions, the Golgi is able to remain toward the apical end of the parasite after these tethers and the CP are no longer visible by NHS ester. However, at this point the Golgi loses its close proximity to the apical organelles and is situated closer to the nucleus. In C1-arrested schizonts, each merozoite has a single Golgi that remains at the apical end of the parasite, typically between the rhoptry bulb and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, we did not observe a CP association in the distribution of the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) within the parasite. The ER was visualized using an antibody to binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), a constitutively expressed ER lumen protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kumar et al., 1991</xref>). As expected, ER was detected at all stages of intraerythrocytic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In ring-stage and mononucleated trophozoite-stage parasites, the ER could be seen wrapping around the nucleus and forming recognizable cisternae. In multinucleated parasites, the ER was too dense to observe cisternae, but large regions of the cell were occupied by the ER. Following segmentation in C1-arrested schizonts, the ER was only observed contiguous with the nuclear envelope.</p><p>Combining the observations that the CP is physically tethered to the PPM through the outer CP and that this anchoring is closely associated with organelles that will define the apical end of the parasite (Golgi, rhoptries, basal complex, and APRs), we suggest that this tethering by the outer CP establishes apical–basal polarity in the parasite early in schizogony. Considering that rhoptries are formed from Golgi-derived cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben Chaabene et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Counihan et al., 2013</xref>), it is unsurprising to find the Golgi forms part of this apical cluster of organelles throughout schizogony. The confined space between nuclear envelope and PPM that these organelles are packed into, for example, may allow each nucleus to provide rhoptry cargo locally to their own rhoptries rather than to all rhoptries in the cell. The same principle could apply to other apical Golgi-derived organelles. However, it remains unclear what role, if any, the outer CP plays in this association, whether any organelles besides the nucleus are physically tethered by these extensions, and how these clusters of organelles remain together during the rapid mitotic events constantly separating sister CPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Characterization of intranuclear microtubules</title><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual blood stages are known to have two classes of microtubules; intranuclear microtubules, which partake in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liffner and Absalon, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simon et al., 2021</xref>), and subpellicular microtubules (SPMTs), which are cytosolic and extend in a single spine from the apical end of merozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liffner and Absalon, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simon et al., 2021</xref>).

Intranuclear microtubules were first visible in mononucleated trophozoite-stage parasites and were present until early segmentation stages, with no intranuclear microtubules visible by the end of segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Intranuclear microtubules arrange into three distinct spindle structures: hemispindles, mitotic spindles, and interpolar spindles. Hemispindles are microtubule structures coming from a single CP that retract prior to CP duplication. Mitotic spindles appear following CP duplication and separate sister chromatids during mitosis. When the two CPs migrate away from each other, they remain connected by an elongated microtubule structure called the interpolar spindle (or elongated spindle), which retracts prior to nuclear fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liffner and Absalon, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Machado et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simon et al., 2021</xref>).

The average number of non-interpolar branches per inner CP was 5.6, which is similar to the previously reported average number of branches in a hemispindle of 5–6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liffner and Absalon, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simon et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that only the interpolar microtubules retract during the interpolar spindle to hemispindle transition. We measured interpolar microtubules in 3D, adjusting for expansion factor by dividing the measured distance by 4.25, the median expansion factor observed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). All of the following measurements in this study are reported in this expansion-corrected format.

In all cases, the CPs connected by interpolar spindles were anchored to the plasma membrane by their cytoplasmic extensions. The large variability in interpolar microtubule size and the continued tethering of the outer CPs to the PPM suggest that interpolar microtubules push PPM-anchored CPs to opposite sides of the cell without causing detachment from the PPM. It is unclear how parasites achieve this sliding effect or how CP-associated organelles are able to retain this association while CPs are moved large distances.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SPMT length and biogenesis</title><p>SPMTs are nucleated in the cytoplasm and have long been observed in merozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aikawa, 1967</xref>).

Leveraging our ability to specifically detect SPMTs using PolyE, we investigated the possibility that merozoite SPMTs are also formed at the outer CP and subsequently transferred onto the APR during segmentation. In schizonts where nuclei are approaching or have completed their final mitosis (~15n), we observed small cytoplasmic microtubules that stained strongly with PolyE appear in the area between the outer CP and PPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g and h</xref>). However, we did not achieve a resolution that allowed us to distinguish individual APRs or to confidently pinpoint whether the microtubules were nucleated at the APRs or the cytoplasmic extensions. Likely, higher resolution imaging techniques are needed to resolve the site of SPMT nucleation in merozoites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Segmentation machinery (IMC and basal complex)</title><p>Following replication of their genetic material during the trophozoite and early schizont stages, parasites partition their nuclei and organelles into ~30 daughter merozoites from the common cytoplasm of a schizont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Francia and Striepen, 2014</xref>). This form of cytokinesis, called segmentation, takes place in the final hours of schizogony and culminates with the physical separation of each daughter cell and their egress from the host RBC. The IMC is a double lipid bilayer formed from ﬂattened vesicles that scaffolds the process of segmentation as well as anchors many proteins important for parasite shape and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harding and Meissner, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The IMC cannot be distinguished from the plasma membrane by U-ExM</title><p>The IMC forms de novo during segmentation starting at the apical end of the parasite, where the outer CP is anchored to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harding and Meissner, 2014</xref>).

It is hypothesized to act as a contractile ring that guides IMC biogenesis and mediates abscission of newly formed merozoites by separating the IMC and plasma membrane from the residual body. We used parasites where PfCINCH, a basal complex marker, was tagged with a spaghetti monster V5 (smV5) tag to follow basal complex development throughout schizogony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rudlaff et al., 2019</xref>). CINCH is first visible at early schizogony (3–5 nuclei stage) as a small ring-like structure surrounding an NHS ester-dense focus on the plasma membrane that is tethered to the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Of 55 early schizont CPs imaged, 44 (80%) had matching numbers of outer CP branches and basal complex structures. This suggests that as CPs divide, they each inherit a CINCH ring that has been split by the duplication of the cytoplasmic tethers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Early IMC proteins have been described to form cramp-like structures like these prior to attaining their characteristic ring structure later in schizogony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kono et al., 2012</xref>).

This matches previously reported behavior of early IMC proteins and supports our hypothesis that the cramp-like structures arise from IMC and basal complex division. At this point, nuclei reach a point of semi-synchronicity. All 64 imaged CPs in early segmentation parasites had duplicated and were forming a mitotic spindle. This event marks the last nuclear division the parasite will undergo. Each of these CPs had a single uninterrupted basal complex ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Thus, we cease to observe events where a single nucleus is attached to four basal complexes as CPs have ceased committing to future rounds of mitosis. As the parasite undergoes segmentation, the basal complex expands and starts moving in the basal direction. By the time the basal complex reaches its maximum diameter, all nuclear divisions have been completed, each nucleus has a single CP and basal complex, and no mitotic spindles are visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). After this point, the basal complex contracts and continues to move away from the apical end. By the time segmentation is completed, the basal complex is an NHS ester-dense ring that is smaller than the APR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>NHS ester as a basal complex marker</title><p>While the basal complex stains brightly with NHS ester at the end of segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), this staining is not consistent throughout schizogony. NHS ester staining of the basal complex is not visible or is very faint during early schizogony. Once the basal complex attains its bona fide ring form during early segmentation, it stains reliably, though faintly, with NHS ester. This staining intensifies after the basal complex begins to contract. The denser staining observed during basal complex contraction could be due to recruitment of more basal complex proteins at the midpoint of schizogony, an increase in protein density as the ring area decreases during contraction, or both. Once the parasites finish segmentation, the basal complex is at its brightest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). While NHS ester staining correlates with CINCH, it does not perfectly overlap with it. CINCH consistently appears as a larger ring with a slight basal shift relative to NHS ester after the basal complex reaches maximum diameter, an effect most visible at the end of segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Since this shift is consistent with parasite anatomy regardless of parasite orientation, it suggests it is not an imaging artifact. There is no primary antibody against CINCH at this point, and so it is not possible to determine whether the lack of overlap with NHS ester is due to distance between the smV5 tag and the main protein density of CINCH (CINCH is 230 kDa). It is also possible that this difference in localization reflects basal complex architecture similar to that previously observed in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, where the basal complex consists of multiple concentric rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson-White et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engelberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roumégous et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Mitochondrion and apicoplast</title><p>The apicoplast and mitochondrion undergo pronounced morphological changes during the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood-stage lifecycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">van Dooren et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van Dooren et al., 2006</xref>).

MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos accumulates in live mitochondria, driven electrophoretically by membrane potential, and is retained after fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Poot et al., 1996</xref>).

To our surprise, rather than showing continuous staining of the mitochondria, MitoTracker staining of our expanded parasites revealed alternating regions of bright and dim staining that formed MitoTracker-enriched pockets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). These clustered areas of MitoTracker staining were highly heterogeneous in size and pattern. Small staining discontinuities like these are commonly observed in mammalian cells when using MitoTracker dyes due to the heterogeneity of membrane potential from cristae to cristae as well as due to fixation artifacts. At this point, we cannot determine whether the staining we observed represents a true biological phenomenon or an artifact of this sample preparation approach. Our observed MitoTracker-enriched pockets could be an artifact of PFA fixation, a product of local membrane depolarization, a consequence of heterogeneous dye retention, or a product of irregular compartments of high membrane potential within the mitochondrion, to mention a few possibilities. Further research is needed to conclusively pinpoint an explanation.</p><p>In addition to these small staining discontinuities, we observed large gaps in MitoTracker staining within parasites at all stages of development. This included pre-segmentation parasites, where we would expect a single continuous mitochondrion to be present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). To our knowledge, no membrane potential discontinuities or fixation artifacts of this size have been reported in mammalian cells. So, as a secondary way to visualize the mitochondria and better characterize these staining discontinuities, we generated a transgenic cell line with the putative ATP synthase F0 subunit-d (ATPd, Pf3D7_0311800) tagged with a spaghetti monster HA tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Viswanathan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

ATPd, like MitoTracker, had a heterogeneous distribution throughout the mitochondria, but it did not show the same large gaps in staining.

Tracking this in parallel to parasite nucleus number allowed us to determine whether the growth of these organelles occurred progressively with simultaneous rounds of mitosis and nuclear division. In mononucleated ring and trophozoite parasites, both the mitochondria and the apicoplast are relatively small, having an average area of 13.39 µm<sup>2</sup> (±15.1 µm<sup>2</sup> SD) and 4.81 µm<sup>2</sup> (±2.62 µm<sup>2</sup> SD), respectively, in expanded parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6b</xref>). As expected from live cell observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">van Dooren et al., 2005</xref>), both organelles show significant growth and spread throughout the cell in multinucleated parasites, adopting an elongated and branching morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Mitochondria grow almost exclusively during the first two rounds of nuclear replication, achieving an average size of 87.9 µm<sup>2</sup> (±15.9 µm<sup>2</sup> SD) at the 2–5 nuclei stage. This size remains relatively constant until segmentation, with the average mitochondria size right before the start of fission being 99.6 µm<sup>2</sup> (±37.4 µm<sup>2</sup> SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).

Once segmentation starts, all apicoplast branches contact an outer CP each and remain in contact with the outer CP until the end of apicoplast fission and CP degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). In 11 imaged segmenting schizonts, all outer CPs showed contact with an apicoplast branch each. This association starts in early segmentation, when a single branched apicoplast connects all outer CPs. By the time the basal complex reaches maximum diameter and begins contraction, we observe seven parasites where all branches have completed fission and two parasites that had at least one or more apicoplast segments still connecting multiple merozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Mitochondria fission follows a very similar pattern, but later in parasite development. Prior to the basal complex reaching maximum diameter, we observe no significant connection between the outer CP and mitochondria. When the basal complex entered its contraction phase, we observed nine parasites where all outer CPs were in contact with one branch of the mitochondria each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d and e</xref>). Only one of these nine parasites had an intact pre-fission mitochondrion, while the other eight had undergone at least one fission event. Matching previous descriptions of mitochondria and apicoplast segmentation, C1-arrested schizonts having completed segmentation show elongated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) and small, rounded apicoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).</p><p>Both mitochondria and apicoplast fission showed neighboring nascent merozoites that shared a single branch of mitochondria or apicoplast passing through both of their basal complexes while others had an individual mitochondrion or apicoplast that had already separated from the rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6c</xref>). This suggests that fission does not occur synchronously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) and supports the model of branching point fission. In other words, parasites seem to undergo a primary fission event that leaves only some merozoites sharing stretches of the organelles and then a subsequent fission event leaves each merozoite with an individual apicoplast and mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Unfortunately, BODIPY TRc does not distinctly stain the membranes of the mitochondria and apicoplast. So, it is not possible for us to determine whether the observed breaks in staining of our chosen organelle markers truly indicate a complete fission of the mitochondria or apicoplast membranes. Thus, while suggestive of branching point fission, our data is not sufficient to conclusively determine the sequence of fission events in these organelles. More research with additional mitochondrial and apicoplast markers is needed to confirm the observations made in this study and conclusively map out the growth and fission of these organelles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-15"><title>Characterization of residual body mitochondria</title><p>At the completion of segmentation, the parasite forms a structure known as the residual body, which contains parasite material, such as the hemozoin crystal, that was not incorporated into merozoites during segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rudlaff et al., 2020</xref>).

This is not surprising given the speed of mitotic events requires near-constant biogenesis of new rhoptry bulbs. By the time segmentation is underway, instead of inheriting one sister rhoptry in the final mitotic event of schizogony, each CP will inherit a pair of rhoptries each. At this point, the speed of these mitotic events slows and parasites reach a point of semi-synchrony. To our surprise, this synchrony does not extend to rhoptry pairs; the two rhoptries inherited by segmenting daughter cells remain different from each other. This heterogeneity in rhoptry pairs during early segmentation has been documented before by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bannister et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rudlaff et al., 2020</xref>). Of 109 rhoptry pairs imaged in early segmentation schizonts undergoing their last miotic event (where CPs were observed forming mitotic spindles), only 4% had two rhoptries of similar size and density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1d</xref>). We observed that 40% of these 109 rhoptry pairs had different size but equal NHS ester density, 21% had the same size but different NHS ester density, and 35% differed in both size and NHS ester density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1e</xref>). As expected from previous reports, this heterogeneity was lost after the completion of this last miotic event and rhoptry neck elongation. Of 98 rhoptry pairs imaged in non-mitotic segmenting parasites, 76% had two rhoptries of similar size and density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1d</xref>). It is still unclear how the one-to-two rhoptry transition occurs and whether rhoptry heterogeneity has a biological role in biogenesis and maturation of the organelles.</p><p>Overall, we present three main observations suggesting that rhoptry pairs undergo sequential de novo biogenesis rather than dividing from a single precursor rhoptry. First, the tight correlation between rhoptry and outer CP branch number suggests that either rhoptry division happens so fast that transition states are not observable with these methods or that each rhoptry forms de novo and such transition states do not exist. Second, the heterogeneity in rhoptry size throughout schizogony favors a model of de novo biogenesis given that it would be unusual for a single rhoptry to divide into two rhoptries of different sizes. Lastly, well-documented heterogeneity in rhoptry density suggests that, at least during early segmentation, rhoptries have different compositions. Heterogeneity in rhoptry contents would be difficult to achieve so quickly after biogenesis if they formed through fission of a precursor rhoptry. While constant de novo biogenesis could explain why one rhoptry can appear smaller or less mature than the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bannister et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rudlaff et al., 2020</xref>), it is currently unclear why heterogeneity in rhoptry density only appears during early segmentation and not earlier. Thus, this model is not enough to explain all the variation in rhoptry size and density observed throughout schizogony. Furthermore, a lot of unknowns remain about what exactly governs rhoptry number during the rapid rounds of asynchronous nuclear division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klaus et al., 2022</xref>), how the transition to a rhoptry pair is signaled, and how many rounds of de novo rhoptry formation parasites undergo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-23"><title>Rhoptry neck biogenesis and elongation</title><p>In order to observe rhoptry neck biogenesis in more detail, we stained parasites against the rhoptry apical membrane antigen (RAMA, a rhoptry bulb marker) and rhoptry neck protein 4 (RON4, a rhoptry neck marker) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Richard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Topolska et al., 2004</xref>). RAMA is anchored to the rhoptry bulb membrane and only stains the periphery of the rhoptry bulb as marked by NHS ester (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1c</xref>). RON4 is absent from the earliest rhoptry bulbs, appearing as a focus within the rhoptry bulb shortly before early segmentation and before the rhoptry neck could be distinguished from the bulb by NHS ester staining alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). During early segmentation, when rhoptry pairs first become visible, we observe an uneven distribution of RON4 within each pair. RON4 preferentially associates with one of the rhoptries, with the staining on the second rhoptry being fainter, more diffuse, or even absent in some cases. Of 84 rhoptry pairs observed at this stage, 72 (86%) showed an uneven distribution of RON4. To our surprise, when these rhoptry pairs were of different NHS ester densities, the larger share of RON4 associated with the less dense rhoptry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). Previous observations of rhoptry density differences by electron microscopy have been ascribed to differences in rhoptry age or maturity, with the denser rhoptry being more mature. So, finding RON4 to be more abundant in the less dense rhoptry suggests that either heterogeneous RON4 accumulation cannot be explained by rhoptry age or that the less dense rhoptry is instead the older rhoptry. The RON4-positive rhoptry neck elongates during segmentation, attaining its characteristic shape by mid to late segmentation and becoming observable by both RON4 staining and NHS ester (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). At this point, nearly all rhoptry necks had an equal distribution of RON4 (of 76 rhoptry pairs observed at these stages, 72 [95%] had an equal distribution of RON4).</p></sec><sec id="s2-24"><title>The micronemes</title><p>Previous studies have suggested that micronemes may be heterogeneous and that apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and other micronemal markers such as erythrocyte binding antigen-175 (EBA175) reside in different subsets of micronemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absalon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ebrahimzadeh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Healer et al., 2002</xref>). We reasoned that individual micronemes may be visible using U-ExM and imaged parasites stained with AMA1 and EBA175 to observe their biogenesis and relative distribution. The first microneme marker to appear during schizogony was AMA1. Large puncta of AMA1 appear near the rhoptries when the basal complex is at its maximum diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). At this point, EBA175 is not yet detectable above background fluorescence. At the end of segmentation, we observe AMA1 has arranged itself into small, densely arranged puncta below the APR and around the rhoptry neck. We also observe EBA175 staining in puncta that are less densely arranged and have little co-localization with AMA1. EBA175 puncta are basal to the AMA1 puncta, being closer to the rhoptry bulb. They also form a cloud of larger diameter than the one formed by AMA1 such that, when viewed from above the APR, two concentric clouds are observed with the core being AMA1 positive and the periphery being EBA175 positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b and c</xref>). We could observe a punctate NHS ester staining pattern at the apical end of merozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>), which we reasoned could be micronemes. The AMA1 and EBA175 staining we observed in late-stage schizonts partially overlaps with this punctate NHS ester pattern, suggesting that NHS ester punctae are micronemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>). However, many NHS ester-positive foci did not stain with either AMA1 or EBA175 despite being morphologically indistinguishable from those which did. This suggests that NHS ester stains more than just the micronemes and that some of these foci may be exonemes, dense granules, or other apical vesicles. Alternatively, it is also possible that these additional NHS ester-positive foci represent micronemes that lack both AMA1 and EBA175.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Micronemal proteins AMA1 and EBA175 reside in separate micronemes.</title><p>3D7 parasites were prepared by ultrastructural expansion microscopy (U-ExM), stained with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester (grayscale), SYTOX (cyan), and antibodies against the micronemal markers AMA1 (magenta) and EBA-175 (yellow), and imaged using Airyscan microscopy in segmenting schizonts.

E64 allows for normal daughter cell maturation but prevents RBC plasma membrane rupture once segmentation is complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hale et al., 2017</xref>). We observe that once AMA1 is translocated, the density of apical AMA1 decreases. EBA175, which does not translocate, increases in density, and moves apically, taking the space AMA1 occupied prior to translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c and d</xref>).

In the process, we demonstrate U-ExM can be used to study the biogenesis and protein distribution of a variety of organelles and structures within the parasite. Globally, our observations suggest that the CP is involved in establishing apical–basal polarity within the parasite and that this polarity is established early in schizogony.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Summary of organelle organization and fission during schizogony.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Apical organelle biogenesis: Biogenesis of the rhoptries, Golgi, basal complex, and apical polar rings occur at outer centriolar plaque (CP), between the nuclear envelope and parasite plasma membrane. Duplication and segregation of these organelles appears to be tied to CP duplication and segregation following nuclear division. Mid-segmentation merozoite: the rhoptry neck is distinguishable from the bulb, and AMA1-positive micronemes are present at the apical end of the forming merozoite. Each merozoite has inherited a cytostome. Subpellicular microtubules stretch the entire distance from the apical polar rings and the basal complex. The apicoplast has attached to the outer CP and begun fission. Mature merozoite: the parasite has completed segmentation, and each merozoite contains a full suite of organelles. The CP is no longer visible, and EBA175-positive micronemes are both visible and separate from AMA1-positive micronemes. (<bold>b</bold>) Model for fission of the mitochondrion and apicoplast. Prior to fission, both the apicoplast and mitochondrion branch throughout the parasite cytoplasm, before associating with the outer CP of each forming merozoite. For the apicoplast, this occurs during the final mitosis, but not until late in segmentation for the mitochondrion. Following outer CP association, the apicoplast and mitochondrion undergo a first fission event, which leaves an apicoplast and mitochondrion shared between forming merozoite pairs. Subsequently, both organelles undergo a second fission event, leaving each forming merozoite with a single apicoplast and mitochondrion.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88088-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We show that the branches of the outer CP appear to act as physical ‘tethers,’ connecting the nucleus to PPM. This creates a space between the PPM and nuclear envelope where we observe multiple parasite structures and organelles including the Golgi, basal complex, rhoptries, and APRs. These structures and organelles remain CP-associated despite the constant movement and segregation of CPs during mitotic events. In other systems, MTOC or centrosome positioning has been described as a source of cellular polarity, polarizing a cell by directing cargo of secretory organelles to a defined area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cowan and Hyman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Anda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huse, 2012</xref>). While this has not been previously described in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, this model fits well with our observation of the Golgi being adjacent to the CP throughout schizogony. This Golgi positioning could grant local control over the biogenesis of rhoptries, micronemes, dense granules, and IMC, which are all at least partially formed by Golgi-derived cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Counihan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubois and Soldati-Favre, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Griffith et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sloves et al., 2012</xref>). While the biogenesis of the APRs seems to also be coupled to the CP, we do not yet know how they are nucleated or whether they are also dependent on Golgi-derived cargo.</p><p>This study also shows CP-coupled organelle segregation and biogenesis to an extent never observed before. Specifically, we observe that the Golgi, rhoptries, and basal complex match the branches of the outer CP in number throughout early schizogony and segregate with CPs during the mitotic events of schizogony. As this study used fixed cells, we lack the temporal power to precisely define the order of these events. Using known markers of parasite age, however, we describe putative transition states that nascent rhoptries and basal complexes adopt when being segregated with CPs. We put forward a model where outer CP-associated events occur before inner CP-associated events. That is, the duplication of the outer CP and organelles precedes inner CP duplication and the formation of a mitotic spindle such that this cytoplasmic duplication represents the first identifiable step in the commitment of a nucleus to the next round of mitosis. Interestingly, nuclei can sometimes have CPs forming a mitotic spindle that have already committed to the next round of mitosis by duplicating their cytoplasmic cargo. That is, a mitotic nucleus can show four outer CP branches and sets of apical organelles at the same time. While this supports our hypothesis that duplication of apical organelles and the outer CP components happens upstream from intranuclear mitotic events, it does not tell us how this relates to the genome copy number inside the nucleus. So, we cannot say whether DNA replication and associated checkpoints occur upstream or downstream from the cytoplasmic events that seem to commit a CP to mitosis.</p><p>Lastly, we contribute important evidence toward hypotheses across several open questions regarding organelle biogenesis and segregation in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. We observe contacts between the outer CP and both the mitochondria and apicoplast during fission that suggest a role for this structure in monitoring copy number of these organelles. We also document sequential fission events in both the apicoplast and mitochondria that are suggestive of branching point fission. Lastly, we see temporal and spatial localization patterns of AMA1, EBA175, and RON4 that support theories of heterogeneity within the apical organelles.</p><p>U-ExM represents an affordable and adaptable sample preparation method that can be applied to any microscope to produce images with far greater visible detail than conventional light microscopy platforms. Applying this technique to the visualization of organelle biogenesis and segregation throughout schizogony allowed us to observe these processes in the context of structures that could previously only be investigated in detail using electron microscopy. The flexibility and scalability of this technique allowed us to image more than 600 individual parasites at a variety of developmental stages, increasing the confidence of our observations and giving them some temporal resolution. To our knowledge, this article represents the most comprehensive study of a single organism using U-ExM, with a total of 13 different subcellular structures investigated.</p><p>Our inability to pinpoint the nucleation site of the SPMTs or resolve the plasma membrane from the IMC highlights some of the limitations of U-ExM as applied in this work. The subpellicular network that holds IMC1g and lines the cytoplasmic face of the IMC sits approximately 20 nm below the parasite surface, where we would find MSP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kudryashev et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the distance between IMC1g and MSP1 post-expansion is around 90 nm. This is below our imaging resolution with Airyscan 2 and close to the maximum resolution we could achieve through other super-resolution methods compatible with our current setup when antibody effects are considered. Thus, some parasite structures remain beyond the resolution achieved in this study. In order to resolve the IMC from the plasma membrane or resolve multiple APRs using light microscopy, we would need to employ single-molecule localization microscopy or iterative expansion microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Louvel et al., 2022</xref>), which increases expansion factor to ~20×.</p><p>We also noticed some drawbacks and artifacts introduced by U-ExM. Most visually striking was that the hemozoin crystal of the food vacuole does not expand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coronado et al., 2014</xref>), which leaves a large space that lacks NHS ester staining. For nearly all antibodies used in this study, significant off-target fluorescence was observed inside the food vacuole. Thus, U-ExM may not be as useful for studying food vacuole biology. Occasionally, significant SYTOX (DNA stain) fluorescence was observed at either the nuclear envelope or PPM. It is unclear if this represents an expansion-induced artifact or a PFA-fixation artifact that is only now observable. Lastly, for cells stained with MitoTracker, some non-specific background was observed that seemed to correlate with protein density as observed by NHS ester.</p><p>Malaria parasites have been extensively studied using electron microscopy to determine their ultrastructure and live-cell microscopy to observe their most dynamic processes in real time. Much of what we uncovered in this study involved dynamic processes that are too small to be resolved using conventional live-cell microscopy. Specifically, we made important observations about <italic>P. falciparum</italic> organelle biogenesis and the organization of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> cell division around the CP. Rather than a replacement for any existing microscopy techniques, we see U-ExM as a complement to the suite of techniques available to study the cell biology of malaria parasites, which bridges some of the limitations of electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy. As such, there are many parasite processes that are logical candidates for investigation by U-ExM. Some of these have been highlighted in this article, but others remain completely unexplored. Merozoite invasion, for example, has been well-studied using a variety of microscopy techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geoghegan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hanssen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liffner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Riglar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>), but U-ExM would allow us to visualize how all the apical organelles associate with each other and rearrange in three dimensions across the established time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>) of this process. Another logical candidate for investigation by U-ExM is the rapid disassembly of the IMC and other merozoite organelles immediately following invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferreira et al., 2020</xref>), a process where the parasite undergoes rapid and dramatic morphological rearrangements that lie beyond the resolution of live-cell microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> culture</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all parasites in this study were 3D7-Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rudlaff et al., 2019</xref>).

Fisher Scientific) coated with poly-<sc>d</sc> lysine. The side of the gel containing sample is placed face down on the coverslip and a few drops of ddH<sub>2</sub>0 are added after mounting to prevent gel shrinkage due to dehydration during imaging. All images presented in this study were taken using either a Zeiss LSM800 AxioObserver with an Airyscan detector, or a Zeiss LSM900 AxioObserver with an Airyscan 2 detector. Imaging on both microscopes was conducted using a ×63 Plan-Apochromat objective lens with a numerical aperture of 1.4. All images were acquired as Z-stacks that had an XY pixel size of 0.035 µm and a Z-slice size of 0.13 µm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image analysis</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Image processing and presentation</title><p>All images were Airyscan processed using 3D processing at moderate filter strength on ZEN Blue Version 3.1 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).</p><p>The majority of images presented in this study are presented as maximum-intensity z-projections, but those that contain BODIPY TRc are presented as average intensity projections for viewing and interpretation purposes. For images containing NHS ester, the gamma value of this channel was set to 0.45 rather than 1 as this allowed discernment of a greater number of parasite structures. It should be noted that because of this the fluorescence intensities shown in the NHS ester channel are not linear.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>3D rendering</title><p>3D renderings of micronemal proteins AMA1 and EBA175 were produced using the 3D analysis package on ZEN Blue version 3.5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Measurement of interpolar spindles and SPMTs</title><p>All length measurements reported in this study were obtained using the ‘Measure 3D distance’ function of ZEN Blue version 3.1. The length of interpolar spindle microtubules and SPMTs was determined as the 3D distance between the start and end points of continuously stained stretches of anti-tubulin staining. Interpolar microtubules were defined as those whose staining appeared to contact both CPs as defined by NHS ester, while non-interpolar microtubules were those that did not meet these criteria. SPMTs were only measured in C1-arrested schizonts that had visibly completed segmentation based on the basal complex as visualized by NHS ester. Any microtubule that did not appear connected to the APR, or extend toward the basal complex was excluded from the analysis. Cell diameter was defined as the greatest XY distance on any z-slice between two points of the parasite as defined by NHS ester staining. Merozoite length was defined as the 3D distance between the center of the APRs and basal complex as defined by NHS ester staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Apicoplast and mitochondria area analysis</title><p>All area measurements presented were obtained using the ‘Area’ function on ZEN Blue version 3.1.

Using ZEN Blue version 3.1, a maximum-intensity projection of the entire cell was generated and based on the NHS staining, the entire parasite was defined as the region of interest. Signal intensity of the channel staining the mitochondria was calculated inside the full cell, which was defined as total mitochondria fluorescence. Subsequently, the residual body was defined the area within the parasite vacuole, but external to all merozoite plasma membranes, as based on BODIPY TRc staining. A second maximum-intensity projection of this subsection of the schizont was made, the residual body was defined as the region of interest, and this signal intensity inside this region of interest was defined as residual body mitochondria fluorescence.</p><p>To determine residual body mitochondria fluorescence (RB) as % total mitochondria fluorescence (total), the following equation was used:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In each of the parasites included in this analysis, the number of merozoites was defined as the number of distinct nuclei as determined by SYTOX staining.

Compared to previous microscopy work with these parasites, the strength of this paper lies in the increased resolution and the fact that the NHE ester highlights protein densities. Together with the BodipyC membrane staining, this results in data that is somewhere in between EM and standard fluorescence microscopy: it has higher resolution than standard fluorescence microscopy and provides some points of reference of different cellular structures due to the NHE ester/BodipyC.</p><p>This study makes many interesting and useful observations and although it is somewhat &quot;old school descriptory&quot; in its presentation, researchers working in many different areas will find something of interest here. This ranges from mitosis, to organisation and distribution of major cellular structures, endocytosis and invasion, overall providing a rich and interesting resource. The results section is long but by taking the space to explain everything in detail, it has the advantage that it clearly transpires how things were done and on how many cells a conclusion is based on. Further the authors often also included a brief interpretation of their findings with a very open assessment what it does and what it does not show, highlighting interesting questions left by the data.</p><p>Overall this is a very nice and useful paper that will be of interest to many, particularly those working on nuclear division, cytokinesis, endocytosis or invasion in malaria parasites. The spatiotemporal arrangement and interconnection of subcellular structures will also give a framework for specific functional studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88088.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In their study the authors analyze the localization of multiple organelles and subcellular structure of blood stage malaria parasites with unprecedented detail. They use a 3D super-resolution imaging technique that has gained popularity in the protozoan field, ultrastructure expansion microscopy. Building on markers and labels established in the field they generate an appealing collection of images for all stages of the intraerythrocytic developmental stages of asexual blood stage parasites with some focus on nuclear division and cell segmentation stages.</p><p>The authors have made a very good effort to address all the comments raised by the reviewers providing more clarity to the manuscript and appropriate interpretations of their results.

All reviewers provided extremely detailed feedback regarding the initially submitted manuscript, we appreciate their efforts in helping us improve this manuscript. Below, are listed each of the specific comments made by the reviewers, and our responses to them in a point-by-point format.</p><p>The only notable change made to the manuscript that was not in response to comments from a reviewer was regarding nomenclature of the structure that we had previously called the nuclear microtubule organising centre (MTOC). We had used the term MTOC to describe the entire structure, which spans the nuclear envelope and comprises an intranuclear portion and cytoplasmic extensions. Given recent evidence, including findings from this study, it is possible that both the intranuclear region and cytoplasmic extensions both have microtubule nucleating capacity, and therefore both meet the definition of an MTOC. To disambiguate this, we now refer to the overall structure as the centriolar plaque (CP), consistent with previous literature. The intranuclear portion of the CP will be referred to as the inner CP, while the cytoplasmic portion will be referred to as the outer CP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. In the first part of the result section, a paragraph on sample processing for U-ExM could be added, with reference to Fig 1b.</p></disp-quote><p>The following section has been added to the first paragraph of the results “…In this study all parasites were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), unless otherwise stated, and anchored overnight at 37 °C before gelation, denaturation at 95 °C and expansion. Expanded gels were measured, before shrinking in PBS, antibody staining, washing, re-expansion, and imaging (Figure 1b). Parasites were harvested at multiple time points during the intraerythrocytic asexual stage and imaged using Airyscan2 super-resolution microscopy, providing high-resolution three-dimensional imaging data (Figure 1c). A full summary of all target-specific stains used in this study can be found in Figure 1d.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

This inhibitor arrests parasite maturation after the completion of segmentation but before egress. When C1 is washed out, parasites egress and invade normally, ensuring that observations made in C1-arrested parasites are physiologically relevant and not a developmental artefact due to arrest.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Line 581: does the PFA-glutaraldehyde fixation allows visualizing other structures in addition to cytostome bulbs?</p></disp-quote><p>While PFA-glutaraldehyde fixation allows visualisation of cytostome bulbs, to date we have not observed any other structure that stains/preserves better using NHS Ester or BODIPY Ceramide in PFA-glutaraldehyde fixed parasites. As a general trend, all structures other than cytostomes become somewhat more difficult to identify using NHS Ester or BODIPY Ceramide in PFA-glutaraldehyde fixed samples due to the local contrast with the red blood cell cytoplasm. It seems likely that this is just due to the preservation of RBC cytoplasm, and would be expected from any fixation method that doesn’t result in RBC lysis, rather than anything unique to glutaraldehyde.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 652-653: It is unclear how the authors can hypothesize that rhoptries form de novo rather than splitting based on their observations.</p></disp-quote><p>This not something we can say with certainty, we have however, introduced the following paragraph to qualify our claims: “Overall, we present three main observations suggesting that rhoptry pairs undergo sequential de novo biogenesis rather than dividing from a single precursor rhoptry. First, the tight correlation between rhoptry and MTOC cytoplasmic extension number suggests that either rhoptry division happens so fast that transition states are not observable with these methods or that each rhoptry forms de novo and such transition states do not exist. Second, the heterogeneity in rhoptry size throughout schizogony favors a model of de novo biogenesis given that it would be unusual for a single rhoptry to divide into two rhoptries of different sizes. Lastly, well-documented heterogeneity in rhoptry density suggests that, at least during early segmentation, rhoptries have different compositions. Heterogeneity in rhoptry contents would be difficult to achieve so quickly after biogenesis if they formed through fission of a precursor rhoptry.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 769: is expansion microscopy sample preparation compatible with FISH?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, there are publications of expansion being done with both MERFISH and FISH. Though it has not yet been applied to plasmodium. See examples: Wang, Guiping, Jeffrey R. Moffitt, and Xiaowei Zhuang. &quot;Multiplexed imaging of high-density libraries of RNAs with MERFISH and expansion microscopy.&quot; Scientific reports 8.1 (2018): 4847.

In the methods, the authors could provide details on the gel mounting step for imaging This is particularly important since this paper will likely serve as a reference standard for expansion microscopy in the field. Also, illustration that cryopreservation of gels does not modify the quality of the images would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>The following section has been added to our “image acquisition” paragraph: “Immediately before imaging, a small slice of gel ~10mm x ~10mm was cut and mounted on an imaging dish (35mm Cellvis coverslip bottomed dishes NC0409658 - FisherScientific) coated with Poly-D lysine. The side of the gel containing sample is placed face down on the coverslip and a few drops of ddH20 are added after mounting to prevent gel shrinkage due to dehydration during imaging.”</p><p>We have decided not to illustrate that cryopreservation does not alter gel quality, as this is something that is already covered in the study that first cryopreserved gels, which is referenced in our methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. Advantages and limitations of the expansion method are generally well discussed. The only matter in that respect that I was wondering is if expansion can always be assumed to be linear for all components of a cell. The hemozoin crystal does not expand (maybe not surprisingly), but could there also be other cellular structures that on a smaller scale separate or expand at a different rate than others? Is there any data on this from other organisms? I am raising this here not as a criticism of this work but if known to occur, it might need mentioning somewhere to alert the reader to it, particularly in regards to the many measurements in the paper (see also point 4). This might be a further factor contributing to the finding that the IMC and PPM could not be resolved.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and, to our knowledge, one that is currently still under investigation in the field. It is well-documented that expansion protocols need to be customized to each cell type and tissue they are applied to. Each solution used for fixation and anchoring as well as timing and temperature of denaturation can affect the expansion factor achieved as well as how isotropic/anisotropic the expanded structures turn out. However, we do not know of any examples where isotropic expansion was achieved for everything but an organelle or component of the cell. It is our impression that if the cell seems to have attained isotropic expansion, this is assumed to also be the case for the subcellular structures within it. Nonetheless, we think it remains a possibility to be considered specially as more structures are characterized using these methods. In the case of our IMC/PPM findings, when we performed calculations taking into account our experimental expansion factor as well as antibody effects, it was clear that the resolution of our microscope was not enough to resolve the two structures using our current labelling methods. So, we suspect most of the effect is driven by that. However, this still needs to be validated by attempting to resolve the two structures though alternative labelling and imaging methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I understand that many things described in the results part are interconnected but still the level of hopping around between different figures/supp figures is considerable (see also point 6 on synchronicity of Figure parts). I do not have a simple fix, but maybe the authors could check if they could come up with a way to streamline parts of their results into a somewhat more reader friendly order.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been a problem we encountered from the beginning and, after trying multiple presentations of the results and discussion, we realized they all have drawbacks. We eventually settled on this presentation as the “least confusing”. We agree, however, that the figure references and order could be better streamlined and have addressed this to the best of our ability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Are the authors sure the ER expands well and the BIP signal (Fig. S5) gives a signal reflecting the true shape of the ER? The signal in younger parasites seems rather extensive compared to what the ER (in my experience) typically looks like in these stages in live parasites.</p></disp-quote><p>While there may be a discrepancy between how the presumably dynamic ER appears in live cells, and how it appears using BiP staining, we think it is unlikely this is a product of expansion. Additionally, if there were to be an artefactual change in the ER, it would be likely under-expansion rather than over-expansion, which to our knowledge has not been reported. In our opinion, the BiP staining we observe is comparable between unexpanded and expanded samples. We have included comparative images in Author response image 1 with DNA in cyan and BiP in yellow, unexpanded (left) and expanded (right) using the same microscope and BiP antibody.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88088-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is nice to have measurements of the apicoplast and mitochondria, but given their size, this could also have been done in unexpanded, ideally live parasites, avoiding expansion and fixing artifacts. While the expansion has many nice features, measuring area of large structures may not be one where it is strictly needed. I am not saying this is not useful information, but maybe a note could be added to the manuscript that the conclusions on mitochondria and apicoplast area and division might be worth confirming in live parasites. A brief mention on similarities and differences to previous work analysing the shape and multiplication of these organelles through blood stage development (van Dooren et al MolMicrobiol2005) might also be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that previous studies such as van Dooren et al. (2005) demonstrate that it is possible to track apicoplast and mitochondrial growth without expansion and share the opinion that live parasites are better for these measurements. Expansion only provides an advantage when more organelle-level resolution is needed. For example, in studying the association between these organelles and the MTOC or visualizing other branch-specific interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

In Fig. 2a, the centrin foci are very focal and difficult to see in these images, particularly when printed out but also on screen. To a lesser extent this is also the case for CINCH in Fig. 4a (particularly when printed; when zoomed-in on screen, the signal is well visible). This issue of difficulties in seeing the fluorescence signal of some markers, particularly when printed out, applies also to other images of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>In the images of full size parasites, this is an issue that we cannot easily overcome as the fluorescent channels are already at maximum brightness without overexposure.

Line 227; does Supp Fig. 2b really show Golgi- cytoplasmic MTOC association?</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased the wording of this section to clarify that we are observing proximity and not necessarily a physical tethering, however it is worth nothing that this was an accidental reference to Supplementary Figure 2b, and should’ve been Supplementary Figure 2e.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 230, in segmented schizonts the Golgi was considered to be at the apical end. It might be more precise to call its location to be close to the nucleus on the side facing the apical end of the parasite. It seems to me it often tends to be closer to the nucleus (in line with its proximity to the ER, see also point 13).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more detail to this description clarifying that despite being at the apical end, the Golgi is closer to the nucleus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Supp Fig. S5: Is the top cell indeed a ring? In the second cell there seem to be two nuclei, I assume this is a double infection (please indicate this in the legend or use images of a single infection).</p></disp-quote><p>In our opinion, the top cell in Supplementary Figure 5 is a ring. This is based on its size and its lack of an observable food vacuole (an area that lacks NHS ester staining). We typically showed images of ameoboid rings to avoid this ambiguity, but we think this parasite is a ring nonetheless. For the second image, this parasite is not doubly infected, as both DNA masses are actually contained within the same dumbbell shaped nuclear envelope. This parasite is likely undergoing its first anaphase (or the Plasmodium equivalent of anaphase) and will likely soon undergo its first nuclear division to separate these two DNA masses into individual nuclei.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 244: I would not call the Golgi a part of the apical cluster of organelles. All secretory cargo originates from the ER-Golgi-transGolgi axis in a directional manner and this axis is connected to the nucleus by the perinuclear ER. If seen from a secretory pathway centred view, it is the other way around and you could call the apical organelles part of the nuclear periphery which would be equally non-ideal.</p></disp-quote><p>Everything is close together in such a small cell. The secretory pathway likely is arranged in a serial manner starting from the perinuclear region to the transGolgi where cargo is sorted into vesicles for different destinations of which one is for the delivery of material to the apical organelles. The proposition that the Golgi is part of the apical cluster therefore somehow feels wrong, as the Golgi can still be considered to be upstream of the transGolgi before apical cargo branches off from other cargo destined for other destinationsWe agree with the reviewer that claiming a functional association between the Golgi and the apical organelles would be odd and we by no means meant to imply such functional grouping. Our intent was to confirm observations previously made about Golgi positioning by electron microscopy studies such as Bannister et al. (2000) at a larger spatial and temporal scale. These studies make the observation that the Golgi is spatially associated with the rhoptries at the apical end of the parasites. Logically, the Golgi is tied to the apical organelles through the secretory pathway as the reviewer suggests, but we claim no further relationship beyond that of organelle biogenesis. We have made modifications to the text to clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lines 300 - 308 (and thereafter): I assume these were also expanded parasites and the microtubule length is given after correction for expansion. I would recommend to indicate in line 274 (when first explaining the expansion factor) that all following measurements in the text represent corrected measures or, if this is not always the case, indicate on each occasion. Is the expansion factor accurate and homogenous enough to draw firm conclusions (see also point 1)? Could it be a reason for the variation seen with SPMTs? Could a cellular reference be used as a surrogate to account for cell specific expansion or would you assume that cellular substructure specific expansion differences exist and prevent this?</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct, the reported number is the number corrected for expansion factor, and the corresponding graphs with uncorrected data are present in the Supplementary Figures. We have clarified this in the text.Uneven expansion can be caused when certain organelles/structures do not properly denature. Given that out protocol denatures using highly concentrated SDS at 95 °C for 90 minutes, we do not anticipate that any subcellular compartments would expand significantly differently. In this study our expansion factors varied from ~4.1-4.7 across all gels, and for our corrected values we used the median expansion factor of 4.25. If we are interpreting the length of an interpolar spindle as 20 µm for example, the value would be corrected value would be 4.7 µm when divided by the median expansion factor, 4.9 µm when divided by the lowest, and 4.2 µm when divided by the highest. These values fall well within the measurement error, and so we expect that these small deviations in expansion factor between gels have a fairly minimal influence on variation in microtubule lengths.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

However, we think the puncta corresponding to micronemal EBA175 can be clearly distinguished from background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 9b, the long appearance of the micronemes in the z-dimension likely is due to axial stretch (due to point spread function in z and refractive index mismatch), in reality they probably are more spherical. It might be worth mentioning somewhere that this likely is not how these organelles are really shaped in that dimension (spherical fluorescent beads could give an estimation of that effect in the microscopy setup used).</p></disp-quote><p>After recently acquiring a water-immersion objective lens for comparison, it is clear that the transition from oil to hydrogel causes a degree of spherical aberration in the Z-plane, which in this instance causes the micronemes to be more oblong. As we make no conclusions based on the shape of the micronemes, however, we don’t think this is a significant consideration. This is an assumption that should be made when looking at any image whose resolution is not equal in all 3-dimensions. We also note that the more spherical shape of micronemes can be inferred from the max intensity projections in Figure 9c.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

The background of the images seems to have an intensity of 0 which in standard microscopy images should be avoided (see for instance doi:10.1242/jcs.03433) similar to the general standard of avoiding entirely white backgrounds on Western blots.

This can be a contributor to the low background in some channels. The level of filtering is the processing strength, with higher filtering giving higher resolution but increased chances of artefacts.

While we appreciate that never altering the black point of images displays 100% of the data in the image, images with any significant background can become impossibly difficult to interpret.

Most importantly, in order to justify the authors claim to provide an &quot;Atlas&quot;, I want to strongly suggest they share their raw 3D-imaging data (at least of the main figures) in a data repository. This would allow the readers to browse their structure of interest in 3D and significantly improve the impact of their study in the malaria cell biology field.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree completely that the potential impact of this study is magnified by public sharing of the data. The reason that this was not done at the time of submission is that most public repositories do not allow continued deposition of data, and so new images included in response to reviewers comments would’ve been separated from the initial submission, which we saw as needlessly complicated. All 647 images that underpin the results discussed in this manuscript are now publicly available in Dryad (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9s4mw6mp4">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9s4mw6mp4</ext-link>)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The organization of the manuscript can be improved. Aside some obvious modifications as citing the figures in the correct order (see also further comments and recommendations), I would maybe suggest one subsection and one figure per analyzed cellular structure/organelle (i.e. 13 sections). This would in my opinion improve readability and facilitate &quot;browsing the atlas&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This is actually how we had originally formatted this manuscript, but this structure made discussing inter-connected organelles, such as the IMC and basal complex, impossibly difficult to navigate. We have done our best to make the manuscript flow better, but have not come up with any way to greatly restructure the manuscript so to increase its readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Considering the importance of reliability of the U-ExM protocol for this study the authors should provide some validation for the isotropic expansion of the sample e.g. by measuring one well defined cellular structure.</p></disp-quote><p>The protocol we used comes from the Bertiaux et al., 2021 PLoS Biology study. In this study they show isotropic expansion of blood-stage parasites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the absence of time-resolved data and more in-depth mechanistic analysis the authors must down tone some of their conclusions specifically around mitochondrial membrane potential, subpellicular microtubule depolymerization, and kinetics of the basal complex.</p></disp-quote><p>Our conclusions regarding mitochondrial membrane potential and basal complex kinetics have been dampened. We have not, however, changed our wording around microtubule depolymerisation. Partial depolymerisation of microtubules during fixation is a known phenomenon in Plasmodium, and in our opinion, our explanation of this offers a hypothesis that is balanced with respective to evidence: “we hypothesise that most SPMTs measured in our C1-treated schizonts had partially depolymerised. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> microtubules are known to rapidly depolymerise during fixation10,29. It is unclear, however, why this depolymerization was observed most often in C1-arrested parasites. Thus, we cannot determine whether these shorter microtubules are a by-product of drug-induced arrest or a biologically relevant native state that occurs at the end of segmentation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The observation that the centriolar plaque extensions remains consistently tethered to the plasma membrane is of high significance. To more convincingly demonstrate this point, it would be very helpful to show one zoomed-in side view of nucleus with a mitotic spindle were both centriolar plaques are in contact with the plasma membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>We of course agree that this is one of our most important observations, but in our opinion this is already demonstrated in Figure 2b. The third panel from the right shows a mitotic spindle and has the location of the cytoplasmic extensions, nuclear envelope and parasite plasma membranes annotated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Please verify the consistent use of the term trophozoite and schizont. In Fig. 1c a parasite with two nuclei, likely in the process of karyofission is designated as trophozoite, which contrasts with the mononucleated trophozoite shown in Fig. 1a. The reviewer is aware of the more &quot;classical&quot; description of the schizont as parasite with more than 2 nuclei, but based on the authors advanced knowledge of cell cycle progression and mitosis I would encourage them to make a clear distinction between parasites that have entered mitotic stages and pre-mitotic parasites (e.g. by applying the term schizont, and trophozoite, respectively).</p></disp-quote><p>For this study, we have interpreted any parasite having three or more nuclei as being a schizont. We are aware this morphological interpretation is not universally held and indeed suboptimal for studying some aspects of parasite development, but all definitions of a schizont have some drawbacks. Whether a parasite has entered mitosis or not is obviously a hugely significant event in the context of cell biology, but in a mononucleated parasite this could only be determined using immunofluorescence microscopy with cell cycle or DNA replication markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Aldolase does not localize diffusely in the cytoplasm in schizont stages as in contrast to earlier stage. The authors should comment on that.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unclear if this is an interpretation of the images in supplementary figure 1, or inferred from other studies. If this is an interpretation of the images in Supplementary Figure 1, we do not agree that the images show a significant change in the localisation of aldolase. It is possible that this difference in interpretation comes from the strong punctate signal observed more readily in the schizont images. This is the strong background signal in or around the food vacuole we mention in the text. These punctae are significantly brighter than the cytosolic aldolase signal, making it difficult to see them on the aldolase only channel, but aldolase signal can clearly be seen in the cytoplasm on the merge images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 79. Uranyl acetate is just one of the contrasting agents used in electron microscopy. The authors might reformulate this statement. Possibly this would also be a good opportunity to briefly mention that electron density measured in EM and protein-density labeled by NHS-Ester can be similar but are not equivalent.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded on this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors claim that they investigate the association between the MTOC and the APR (line 194), but strictly speaking only look at subpellicular microtubules and an associated protein density. The argument that there is a &quot;NHS ester-dense focus&quot; (line 210) without actual APR marker is not quite convincing enough to definitively designate this as the APR.</p></disp-quote><p>While an APR marker would of course be very useful, there are currently no published examples of APR markers in blood-stage parasites. We therefore think that the timing of appearance, location, and staining density are sufficient for identifying this structure as the APR, as it has previously been designated through EM studies. We have nonetheless softened our language around APR-related observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 226: The authors should also discuss the organization of the Golgi in early schizonts (Fig. S4). (not only 2 nuclei and segmenter stages).</p></disp-quote><p>We did not mean to imply that all 22 parasites had only 2 nuclei, but instead that they had 2 or more nuclei. Therefore, early schizonts are included in this analysis, with Golgi closely associated with all their MTOCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 242: To the knowledge of the reviewer the nuclear pore complexes, although clustered in merozoites and ring stages, don't particularly &quot;define the apical end of the parasite&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The MTOC is surrounded by NPCs, which because of the location of the MTOC end up being near the forming apical end of the merozoite, but we have removed this as it was needlessly confusing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Supplementary Figure 8 is missing (it's a repetition of Fig. S6).</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 253: asexual blood stage parasites have two classes of MTs. Other stages can have more.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been clarified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 3f: Please comment how much of these observations of &quot;only one&quot; SPMT could result from suboptimal resolution (e.g. in z-direction) or labeling. Otherwise use line profiles to argue that you can always safely distinguish SPMT pairs.</p></disp-quote><p>In the small number of electron tomograms of merozoites where the subpellicular microtubules have been rendered, they have been seen to have 2 or 3 SPMTs. Despite this, we don’t think it is likely that the single SPMT merozoites observed in this study are caused by a resolution limitation. SPMTs were measured in 3D, rather than from projections, and any schizont where the SPMTs were pointing towards the objective lens, elongating the parasite in Z, were not imaged. Additionally, our number of merozoites with a single SPMT correspond with the same data collected in the Bertiaux et al., 2021 PLoS Biology study. We cannot rule this out as a possibility, as sometimes SPMTs cross over each other in three-dimensions, and at these intersection points they cannot be individually resolved. We, however, think it is very unlikely that two SPMTs would be so close that they can never be resolved across any part of their length.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lines 302ff: the claim that variability in SPMT size must be a consequence of depolymerzation is unfounded. The dynamics of SPMT are unknown at this point. Similarly unfounded is the definitive claim that it is known that P.f. MTs depolymerize upon fixation. Other possibilities should be considered. SPMT could also simply shorten in C1-arrested parasites.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree with the reviewer that much about SPMT dynamics in schizonts remains unknown, we disagree with the claim that our consideration of SPMT depolymerization as a possible explanation for our observations is unfounded. Microtubule depolymerization is a well-known fixation and sample preparation artefact in both mammalian cells and a well-documented phenomenon in Plasmodium when parasites are washed with PBS prior to fixation. We convey in the text our belief that it is possible that SPMTs shorten in C1-arrested parasites as a result of drug treatment. However, it is our opinion that there simply is not enough evidence at this moment to conclusively pinpoint the cause of our observed depolymerization. As we mention in the text, further experiments are needed in order to determine with confidence whether depolymerization is a consequence of our fixation protocol, a consequence of C1 treatment (or the length of that treatment), or a biological phenomenon resulting from parasite maturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Figure 4b. Line 354 The postulated breaking in two is not well visible and here the authors should attempt a more conservative interpretation of the data (especially with respect to those early basal complex dynamics).</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the basal complex dividing or breaking in two is the more conservative interpretation of our data. There is no evidence to suggest that a second basal complex is formed de novo and, while never before described using a basal complex protein, the cramp-like structure and dynamics we observe are consistent with that observed in early IMC proteins. We have updated the text to provide additional context and make the reasoning behind our hypothesis clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 365: Commenting on their relative size would require a quantification of APR and basal complex size (can be provided in the text).</p></disp-quote><p>We are unsure what this is in reference to, as there is no mention of the APR in the basal complex section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lines 375ff: The claim that NHS Ester is a basal complex marker should be mitigated or more convincing images without the context of anti-CINCH staining being sufficient to identify the ring structure should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided high quality, zoomed-in images without anti-CINCH staining in Fig. 5D&amp;E, 6C, 7b, and Supplementary Fig. 8 that show that even in the absence of a basal complex antibody, the basal complex still stains densely by NHS ester.</p><p>.20. Line 407: The claim that there are differences in membrane potential along the mitochondria needs to be significantly mitigated. There are several alternative explanations of this staining pattern (some of which the authors name themselves). Differences in local compartment volume, differences in membrane surface, diffusibility/leakage of the dye can definitively play a role in addition to fixation and staining artefacts (also brought forward recently for U-ExM by Laporte et al. 2022 Nat Meth). Confirming the hypothesis of the authors would need significantly more experimental evidence that is outside the scope of this study.</p><p>We have significantly dampened and qualified the wording in this section. It now reads: “These clustered areas of MitoTracker staining were highly heterogeneous in size and pattern. Small staining discontinuities like these are commonly observed in mammalian cells when using MitoTracker dyes due to the heterogeneity of membrane potential from cristae to cristae as well as due to fixation artifacts. At this point, we cannot determine whether the staining we observed represents a true biological phenomenon or an artefact of this sample preparation approach. Our observed MitoTracker-enriched pockets could be an artifact of PFA fixation, a product of local membrane depolarization, a consequence of heterogeneous dye retention, or a product of irregular compartments of high membrane potential within the mitochondrion, to mention a few possibilities. Further research is needed to conclusively pinpoint an explanation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 7e: The differences in morphology using different fixation methods are interesting. Can the authors provide a co-staining of K13-GFP together with the better-preserved structures in the GA-containing fixation protocol to demonstrate that these are indeed cytostome bulbs?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 7 has been changed substantially to show more clearly the preservation of the red blood cell membrane following PFA-GA fixation, followed by direct comparison of K13-GFP stained parasites fixed in either PFA only or PFA-GA. The cytostome section of the results has also changed to reflect this, the changed section now reads:</p><p>“PFA-glutaraldehyde fixation allows visualization of cytostome bulbThe cytostome can be divided into two main components: the collar, a protein dense ring at the parasite plasma membrane where K13 is located, and the bulb, a membrane invagination containing red blood cell cytoplasm {Milani, 2015 #63;Xie, 2020 #62}.While we could identify the cytostomal collar by K13 staining, these cytostomal collars were not attached to a membranous invagination. Fixation using 4% v/v paraformaldehyde (PFA) is known to result in the permeabilization of the RBC membrane and loss of its cytoplasmic contents65. Topologically, the cytostome is contiguous with the RBC cytoplasm and so we hypothesised that PFA fixation was resulting in the loss of cytostomal contents and obscuring of the bulb. PFA-glutaraldehyde fixation has been shown to better preserve the RBC cytoplasm65. Comparing PFA only with PFA-glutaraldehyde fixed parasites, we could clearly observe that the addition of glutaraldehyde preserves both the RBC membrane and RBC cytoplasmic contents (Figure 7c). Further, while only cytostomal collars could be observed with PFA only fixation, large membrane invaginations (cytostomal bulbs) were observed with PFA-glutaraldehyde fixation (Figure 7d). Cytostomal bulbs were often much longer and more elaborate spreading through much of the parasite (Supplementary Video 1), but these images are visually complex and difficult to project so images displayed in Figure 7 show relatively smaller cytostomal bulbs. Collectively, this data supports the hypothesis that these NHS-ester-dense rings are indeed cytostomes and that endocytosis can be studied using U-ExM, but PFA-glutaraldehyde fixation is required to maintain cytostome bulb integrity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.
