toxin-blocked and sodium-bound states at 3.2 Å, 2.5 Å, 3.2 Å, and 2.9 Å. These structures, all obtained at nominally zero membrane potential in detergent micelles, reveal distinct ion-occupancy patterns in the selectivity filter. The first two structures are very similar to those reported in the related Shaker channel and the much-studied Kv1.2–2.1 chimeric channel. On the other hand, two new structures show unexpected patterns of ion occupancy. First, the toxin α-Dendrotoxin, like Charybdotoxin, is seen to attach to the negatively-charged channel outer mouth, and a lysine residue penetrates into the selectivity filter, with the terminal amine coordinated by carbonyls, partially disrupting the outermost ion-binding site. In the remainder of the filter two densities of bound ions are observed, rather than three as observed with other toxin-blocked Kv channels. Second, a structure of Kv1.2 in Na<sup>+</sup> solution does not show collapse or destabilization of the selectivity filter, but instead shows an intact selectivity filter with ion density in each binding site. We also attempted to image the C-type inactivated Kv1.2 W366F channel in Na<sup>+</sup> solution, but the protein conformation was seen to be highly variable and only a low-resolution structure could be obtained. These findings present new insights into the stability of the selectivity filter and the mechanism of toxin block of this intensively studied, voltage-gated potassium channel.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryoEM</kwd><kwd>ion selectivity</kwd><kwd>dendrotoxin</kwd><kwd>inactivation</kwd><kwd>voltage sensor</kwd><kwd>biophysics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS021501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigworth</surname><given-names>Fred J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD023603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigworth</surname><given-names>Fred J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The well-studied Kv1.2 potassium ion channel is observed in a variety of states and conditions, to understand mechanisms of ion permeation, gating and block.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Among the most-studied ion channel proteins is the Kv1 family of tetrameric, six-transmembrane-segment, voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. The best-known member of this family is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Shaker channel, first cloned in the late 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iverson et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Papazian et al., 1987</xref>) and which quickly became the favorite object for biophysical studies due to its small size and ease of heterologous expression. The potassium current in the squid giant axon described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref> is carried by a closely related Shaker homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenthal and Bezanilla, 2002</xref>).</p><p>In 2005, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2005</xref> obtained the 2.9 Å crystal structure of Kv1.2, a mammalian Shaker-family channel. This structure showed clearly the overall architecture of the channel, but unfortunately the densities were weak in the all-important voltage-sensor domains (VSDs). Two years later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Long et al., 2007</xref> presented the 2.4 Å X-ray structure of the ‘paddle chimera’ Kv1.2–2.1 channel in which a portion of the voltage-sensor domain (the S3-S4 paddle) was replaced by the corresponding Kv2.1 sequence. This structure presented the VSDs in fine detail, and so was a watershed in the structural understanding of the many functional measurements of Shaker channels. It has also formed the basis of computational studies of voltage-sensing and gating mechanisms. A subsequent cryoEM structure of Kv1.2–2.1 channels reconstituted into nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matthies et al., 2018</xref>) has excellent agreement with the X-ray structure. Meanwhile, a very welcome recent development is the cryoEM structure of the original Shaker channel itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The high-resolution structure of the Kv1.2 paddle chimera channel has been the basis for much research, but the native Kv1.2 channel has been used for more functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suárez-Delgado et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). The properties of the native and chimeric channels are similar but not identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tao and MacKinnon, 2008</xref>). The chimeric channel has 27 amino-acid differences in the S3-S4 paddle region, but the VSD structures of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Long et al., 2007</xref> are remarkably similar; in the transmembrane region the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-carbon traces are nearly superimposable. Our structure of Kv1.2 confirms this remarkable structural conservation.</p><p>Inactivation is an important process that diminishes voltage-gated channel current even when the activating membrane depolarization is maintained. A relatively slow inactivation process, usually called C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoshi et al., 1991</xref>) involves conformational changes in the pore domain and the selectivity filter. Various mutations in the pore domain have been shown to accelerate or impede C-type inactivation. The Shaker pore-domain mutation W434F renders the channel almost completely non-conductive through a process like C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perozo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pless et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suárez-Delgado et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). Structures of this mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2022</xref>) and of a corresponding mutant Kv1.2–2.1 paddle-chimera channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reddi et al., 2022</xref>) show a dramatic dilation of the selectivity filter that disrupts two of the four ion-binding sites in the selectivity filter. We report here the structure of the corresponding W366F mutant in the Kv1.2 channel background, which shows a nearly identical dilation.</p><p>An important aspect of C-type inactivation is that it is enhanced when potassium ions are absent. In KcsA the replacement of most K<sup>+</sup> with Na<sup>+</sup> results in a collapse of the selectivity filter region, occluding the two central ion-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). Other channels including NaK2K and members of the K2P family show a destabilization of the external part of the pore at low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, abolishing the two outer ion-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lolicato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matamoros et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sauer et al., 2011</xref>). In low potassium, the NaK2K channel actually shows a dilation of the outer selectivity filter very similar to that seen in Shaker-W434F and the corresponding K1.2–2.1 mutant. On the other hand, a lengthy molecular-dynamics simulation of deactivation in the Kv1.2–2.1 chimera channel in symmetrical K<sup>+</sup> solutions showed that, with the closing of the channel gate, there is a complete loss of water and ions from the cavity below the selectivity filter. Under these conditions, however, the selectivity filter remains intact and is populated by K<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>; M. Ø. Jensen, personal communication). In view of the variety of effects of low K<sup>+</sup>, in our current study we sought to observe experimentally the structure of the Kv1.2 channel when potassium ions are absent.</p><p>Finally, Kv channels are targets for many toxins that inhibit channel conductance, with a common mechanism being occlusion of the pore. This occlusion has been seen directly in two cases. Crystal structures of the Kv1.2 paddle-chimera channel have been obtained with charybdotoxin (CTx) bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref>), and cryoEM structures of Kv1.3 with the ShK toxin bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Selvakumar et al., 2022</xref>). In the present work, we consider dendrotoxins (DTxs) produced by the mamba snake <italic>Delodiaspis</italic>. These are distinct from CTx but also block Kv channels with high potency and selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gasparini et al., 1998</xref>). In this study, we have determined the structure of Kv1.2 with α-DTX bound.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview of mammalian Kv1.2 structure</title><p>For this study, we employed a full-length Kv1.2 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-subunit construct containing three mutations in disordered regions of the N-terminus and S1-S2 linker. We denote this construct used for structure determination Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>. We co-expressed a construct of of Kvβ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gulbis et al., 1999</xref>) containing residues 36–367. Each β2-subunit contained five mutations chosen to neutralize positive charges on the cytoplasmic face of the subunit; these remove strong, interfering interactions with cryoEM carbon substrates. We find that the mutations have no effect on β-subunit secondary structure. Although α and β subunits were co-expressed, in cryoEM micrographs we observed many α<sub>4</sub> complexes along with the expected α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> particles. As the structures of the transmembrane regions of these two populations of channels were indistinguishable, we combined the two particle sets. This is reasonable as the presence of β2 subunits has very little effect on the structure of the α-subunit T1 domains to which they bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gulbis et al., 2000</xref>) and also little effect on channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rettig et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>The constructs encoding the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> or Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-W366F mutant <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-subunits, along with the β2 subunits, were expressed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2005</xref>). Channel complexes were affinity-purified in the presence of dodecylmaltoside detergent and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography in buffers containing either 150 mM K<sup>+</sup> or 150 mM Na<sup>+</sup> ions. The channel complexes were plunge-frozen on grids for cryoEM analysis. Focusing on the transmembrane region of the Kv1.2 channel complexes, we obtained structures of nominally open, C-type inactivated, DTx-bound, and K<sup>+</sup>-free states at resolutions of 3.2 Å, 2.5 Å, 3.2 Å, and 2.9 Å, respectively.

One difference in the voltage-sensing residues is that a glutamine replaces the arginine at the first position (R1) in the chimera. Another difference is that there is an earlier Arg residue R0 that replaces leucine, but is unlikely to contribute to charge movement. A direct measurement of charge movement in the paddle chimera is lacking, but macroscopic activation and inactivation show lower voltage sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tao and MacKinnon, 2008</xref>) as if its gating charge movement were reduced. Nevertheless, as was observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Long et al., 2007</xref>, the structures of the S4 regions are very similar: comparing Kv1.2 with the paddle chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) the rms deviation of Arg sidechain atoms is less than 0.75 Å.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Channel inactivation</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> compares the structure of the open channel with that of the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-W366F mutant.

Here, we shall call the cryoEM structure of Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-W366F the ‘inactivated channel’ structure, keeping in mind that other distinct inactivated channel conformations are likely to exist. The overall conformational difference between open and inactivated structures in Kv1.2s is identical to the difference observed in structures of Shaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2022</xref>) and in structures of Kv1.2–2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reddi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>For detailed comparison with structures of other voltage-gated potassium channels, we borrow from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller, 1991</xref> the numbering of the 39 residues in the S5-S6 linking region, which we will denote as residue numbers 1’ to 39’. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The 39-residue numbering is appropriate for Kv1 through Kv4 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shealy et al., 2003</xref>) and is fortuitously convenient in comparisons with KcsA, because it differs numerically by exactly 50 from the residue numbering of KcsA. In the Miller system for example the Kv1.2 W366 residue is W17’, and we can denote the W366F mutant channel as Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-W17’F. In KcsA the W17’ residue is W67.</p><p>The selectivity filter of potassium channels consists of an array of four copies of the extended loop (the P-loop) formed by a highly conserved sequence, in this case TTVGYGD. The main-chain carbonyl oxygens of the residues TVGY, positions 25’ to 28’, delineate ion binding sites S3, S2 and S1, respectively, while the lower (most intracellular) edge of binding-site S4 is formed by the T25’ hydroxyl. Hydrogen bonds involving two P-loop residues anchor the outer half of the selectivity filter and are particularly important in inactivation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pless et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sauer et al., 2011</xref>). Normally, the tyrosine Y28’ (Y377 in Kv1.2) is constrained by hydrogen bonds to residues in the pore helix and helix S6 and is key to the conformation of the selectivity filter. The final aspartate of the P-loop, D30’ (D379 in Kv1.2) is normally located near the extracellular surface and has a side chain that also participates in H-bonds with W17’ (W366 in Kv1.2) on the pore helix.</p><p>The difference between the open and inactivated Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> structures, like the open-inactivated state differences in Kv1.2–2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reddi et al., 2022</xref>) and in Shaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2022</xref>) can be imagined as resulting from a two-step process. The first step is a partial twist of the P-loop backbone involving D30’. When W17’ is mutated to phenylalanine, it is no longer an H-bond donor to D30’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> right upper panel). The resulting destabilization of D30’ allows it to reorient toward the external water-filled vestibule.</p><p>The second step is the reorientation of Y28’ and further twisting of the polypeptide backbone. Y28’ normally participates in H-bonds with the pore-helix residues W18’ and S22’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right-hand panels), but with the release of D30’, and presumably the entry of water molecules into the space surrounding the P-loop, the side chain of Y28’ also reorients toward the external solution, filling some of the original volume occupied by the side chain of D30’. The reorientation of the phenol group of Y28’ is through a very large pitch angle of about 120° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H,I</xref>). The reorientations of the D30’ and Y28’ side chains drag and twist the backbone. The result is an enlargement of the ion-binding site IS2 to a width of 5.1 Å between opposing carbonyl oxygens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and an even wider (11 Å) cavity is formed at the level of IS1. There are no clear ion densities in the upper selectivity filter.</p><p>Meanwhile, the lower binding sites IS3 and IS4 show relatively small disturbances in the inactivated state. The largest change is a rise of 1.3 Å in the position of the G27’ carbonyl, the one which defines the top of IS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). As in the inactivated Shaker structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2022</xref>) strong ion densities are seen in IS3 and IS4.</p><p>Might symmetry-breaking accompany Kv1.2 inactivation?

However, we were not able to detect any evidence of reduced symmetry in the inactivated Kv1.2 channel. We were able to build the atomic model unambiguously into the 2.5 Å map that was obtained with C4 symmetry imposed. Further, there was no evidence of broken symmetry when using symmetry expansion and local C1 refinements of the cryoEM dataset.</p><p>A comparison of our open-channel and inactivated Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> structures show subtle but noticeable differences in the VSDs. Salt bridges involving the S4 Arg and Lys residues are shifted slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). Arg300 (R3) is in close proximity to Glu226 on the S2 helix for the open channel, while R3 is closer to Glu183 in the S2 helix. The Glu226 side chain adopts a visible interaction with R4 in the inactivated state. In both open and inactivated states of Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>, K5 interacts more closely with S2 Phe233 than is the case in the paddle chimera channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Functional interactions have been observed between residues in the voltage-sensing domains and pore residues involved in C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bassetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conti et al., 2016</xref>). Leucine and valine residues on the S4 helix interface with serine and leucine residues on S5, which in turn contact F16’ and W17’ on the pore helix. We see very little relative movement of the residues at the S4-S5 interface, much less than 1 Å difference between open and inactivated structures.</p><p>When individual VSD domains are aligned the VSD helices in Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> and the inactivated Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-W17’F superimpose very well at the top (including the S4-S5 interface described above), there is a general twist of the VSD helix bundle that yields an overall rotation of about 3° at the bottom of the bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E–F</xref>). In moving to the inactivated state, the axes of the helices S0, S1 and S2 tilt by 6°, 4°, and 3.2° in a clockwise direction as viewed from the cytoplasmic side, while S4 is stationary. This lower VSD rotation provides a good explanation of the shifts in the S2 residues Glu183 and Glu226 that interact with R2 and R3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). In contrast to Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>, neither Shaker and Kv1.2–2.1 structures show this rotation between open and inactivated states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3G–H</xref>) but instead the VSDs remain superimposable.</p><p>It should be noted that the difference between Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> and the others in conformational changes might arise from the variety of systems used for structure determination, which include DDM micelles, MSP-bounded nanodiscs, and crystals grown in different laboratories (but under very similar conditions and having the same space group). In the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> case for example, the DDM detergent micelles might allow the VSDs to be particularly mobile.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A dendrotoxin blocks Kv1.2 by inserting a lysine into the pore</title><p>Dendrotoxins are peptide neurotoxins from mamba snakes that bind with nanomolar affinities and block potassium channels.

In 3D classification only a small fraction (&lt;1%) of toxin-free particles was detected, and this class was removed before further processing. The processing of particle images is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Refined structures with imposition of fourfold symmetry (C4) or with no symmetry (C1), yielded resolutions 2.8 and 3.2 Å, respectively. In the C4 reconstruction, the additional cap of density from the toxin was not interpretable, as it arises from the four-fold superposition of the asymmetric toxin bound in alternative poses to the symmetric channel. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2021</xref> have demonstrated however that small asymmetric ligands can be distinguished in large single-particle datasets by focused classification and refinement. Similarly we used symmetry expansion, a reference mask covering only the toxin and upper selectivity filter, and a set of four asymmetric starting references to obtain, through 3D classification without alignment in the Relion software, a C1 reconstruction. The refined C1 density map and model are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>. Due to the C4 symmetry of Kv1.2, there are four equivalent DTx binding sites on the channel.

The positively-charged toxin is tethered to the negatively-charged outer mouth of the pore by three salt bridges: toxin residues K30, R15, and R3 bind to three channel residues D355, D363, and D363 (D6’, D14’, and D14’ in the turret and pore helix). Each of the three channel residues is located on a different subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>).</p><p>In the selectivity filter of the toxin-bound channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), a continuous density is seen to extend downward from the toxin to the boundary of IS1. This density is well modeled by the side chain of Lys5, with the terminal amine coordinated by the carbonyls of Y377 (Y28’). We conclude that block by α-DTx is occlusion of the selectivity filter through binding of the Lys5 terminal amine. In the selectivity filter a large density peak, presumably a K<sup>+</sup> ion, is seen in a somewhat offset IS1 binding site; a second, larger K<sup>+</sup> ion peak is seen in IS3.</p><p>Like the nearby Lys5 residue, substitution of alanine for Leu9 also results in a 1000-fold reduction in toxin affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gasparini et al., 1998</xref>). In the structure, however, the Leu9 sidechain does not show contacts with either the channel or other residues in the toxin itself. It is therefore not obvious why it is important in toxin binding.</p><p>We also tried mixing an excess of α-DTX with the Kv1.2s W366F protein sample in an attempt to observe a pore-blocker-bound inactivated structure. However, we found no evidence of bound toxin density on the channel in the cryoEM 2D classes. This is no surprise in view of the large rearrangement of the extracellular pore entrance in the inactivated state, where the IS1 and IS2 sites are abolished and the corresponding carbonyls point away from the pore axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), eliminating the site of binding of the lysine side chain. It should be noted however that in the case of a ShK toxin derivative binding to the Kv1.3 channel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tyagi et al., 2022</xref> observed that binding occurs to inactivated channels.

NaK’s selectivity filter (P-loop sequence TVGDGN) has only two ion binding sites, and opens into a wide extracellular vestibule. A similarly wide vestibule is seen in the nonselective HCN1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). NaK can however be converted to a highly K<sup>+</sup> selective channel, termed NaK2K, through just the two mutations D28’Y and N30’D, yielding the P-loop sequence TVGYGD. NaK2K has the four-site selectivity filter seen in all K<sup>+</sup>-selective channels, and the residues Y28’ and D30’ participate in a hydrogen-bonded network to stabilize the selectivity filter just as in KcsA channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>). Y28’ also participates in hydrophobic packing interaction. The removal of any of these interactions results in a loss of selectivity, and unraveling of the selectivity filter, returning to the large vestibule seen in NaK channels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sauer et al., 2011</xref> conclude that the standard four-ion-site, K<sup>+</sup> selective configuration of potassium channel selectivity filters is an energetically unfavorable, strained backbone conformation, and the weakening of the specific interactions that hold it in place lead to its unraveling, producing a lower-energy configuration that yields a nonselective conduction path.

In Shaker, this mutation (W434F) causes the near total loss of open-channel current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perozo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 1997</xref>); in Kv1.2, it greatly accelerates inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suárez-Delgado et al., 2020</xref>). A large expansion of the outer selectivity filter in W17’F mutants is seen in structures of Shaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2022</xref>), Kv1.2–2.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reddi et al., 2022</xref>) and also in Kv1.2 as reported here. Quantified as the distance between the diagonally-positioned Y28’ alpha-carbons, the expansion in Shaker is from 8.6 to 12.8 Å. In both the Kv1.2–2.1 paddle chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reddi et al., 2022</xref>) and in Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> the expansion is approximately from 7.2 to 10.7 Å. The expanded outer pore is very similar to the large extracellular vestibules observed in NaK and HCN1 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>A striking feature of the inactivated state structure reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reddi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2022</xref> is the high occupancy by potassium ions of the two remaining binding sites IS3 and IS4. During normal conduction, ion binding sites in the selectivity filter are usually occupied by K<sup>+</sup> and water molecules in alternation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morais-Cabral et al., 2001</xref>). However, in molecular-dynamics simulations based on their Shaker W434F structure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2022</xref> observed with high probability the simultaneous occupancy of IS3 and IS4 by two K<sup>+</sup> ions. The ions did not leave the sites during a (relatively long) 2 µs simulation with 300 mV membrane potential applied, but knock-on permeation events were observed at a low rate, two events during 1µs, at the very high potential of 450 mV. A similar result was observed in earlier MD simulations of the Kv1.2–2.1 chimera where the W17’F mutation was artificially introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kondo et al., 2018</xref>). Those simulations did not show the large rearrangement of the outer pore, but they did demonstrate small shifts in the geometry of IS3 and IS4 that, like those seen by Tan et al., produced simultaneous occupancy by K<sup>+</sup> ions and blockage of ion permeation. We also see strong ion densities in the two remaining ion binding sites in the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-W17’F channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>), and a similar tight binding of adjacent K<sup>+</sup> ions seems also to block K<sup>+</sup> permeation in the structure of an inactivated Kv1.3 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In a study of the Shaker mutant W17’F, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 1997</xref> observed, with symmetrical high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations to maximize channel activity, brief (1ms) openings of channels that occurred with a peak open probability of 10<sup>–5</sup> immediately following a large depolarization to +80 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). When open, the single-channel currents were the same magnitude as the currents in wildtype channels. It is unlikely that these currents arose from rare ion-conduction events through destabilization of the tightly-bound K<sup>+</sup> ions in the inactivated configuration, as such currents would be too small to be observed. Instead, the simplest explanation is that these currents arise when structural fluctuations transiently reconstitute the normal four-site selectivity filter, and the channel conducts normally for brief intervals. The normal selectivity filter is expected to be stabilized by bound K<sup>+</sup> ions. In the absence of external potassium ions, the peak open probability drops to about 10<sup>–7</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Inactivation is voltage-dependent: it occurs less in channels held at a negative membrane potential, but is enhanced in a time-dependent manner with depolarization. This was observed for example in the experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 1997</xref> in our recordings from Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> W17’F channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This voltage dependence could arise from a coupling between voltage sensors and the pore domain, which would be reflected in a difference in gating-charge movement (reporting VSD conformational changes) between wildtype and W17’F channels. There is however little difference in gating-charge movement between Shaker and Shaker W17’F channels, although Shaker with certain mutations in S4 and S6 do show differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bassetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conti et al., 2016</xref>). A more important mechanism seems to be coupling between the S6 activation gate of the channel and the inactivation mechanism, such that steps in the physical opening of the channel would in increase the inactivation rate. Such a coupling is clearly seen in a series of KcsA X-ray structures by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cuello et al., 2017</xref>: with increased opening of inner bundle gate there is an increased steric clash between residues of the M2 helix and residues on the pore helix that could lead to inactivation. They identified a similar interface in the Kv1.2–2.1 structure, which provides a simple explanation for coupling between channel opening and inactivation processes.</p><p>Are the structures of the various W17’F channels valid models for C-type inactivation? In recent cryoEM studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Selvakumar et al., 2022</xref>) the human Kv1.3 channel was found to spontaneously exist in one or two alternative conformations that appear to be inactivated states. The D1 conformation shows a large displacement of D30’ and is reminiscent of the cryoEM structure of the Kv1.3 rapidly-inactivating mutant H20’N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). It exhibits a partially twisted P-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>) as if it were an intermediate state between open and the W17’F structures. Meanwhile the D2 conformation is very similar to that of the W17’F variants considered here. This strongly supports the widely-held view that these mutant channels are in a conformation close to, if not identical to, a true C-type inactivated state.</p><p>Why is inactivation much more complete in the Shaker mutant W17’F than in Kv1.2 or Kv1.2–2.1? Clearly one can compare the stabilities of the conducting and the inactivated conformations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2022</xref> mutated several of the residues that form important interactions in these channels, and found that the inactivation behaviors of Kv1.2 and Kv1.2–2.1 are different from that of Shaker. In the conducting state, the H-bond networks stabilizing the key residues Y28’ and D30’ in Shaker and Kv1.2 very similar, with the only obvious difference being at position 22’ where Shaker has Thr but Kv1.2 has Ser. It turns out that the mutation S22’T in the Kv1.2 background has little effect on inactivation; thus to a first approximation the conducting state is equivalently stabilized.</p><p>In the inactivated state structures, all obtained with the W17’F mutation, a variety of H-bond interactions arise in the linker sequence between the P-loop and the S6 helix, with the variety arising from different conformations of Loop 1 and Loop 2, two regions of the linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Details of the interactions are discussed in the Figure legend. We conclude that a quantitative evaluation of the stability of the inactivated state will require more than simply an enumeration of H-bonds in this region of the protein sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Block of the channel by dendrotoxin</title><p>Potassium currents can be inhibited by five distinct families of toxins. The spider toxins Hanatoxin, SGTx1 and VSTx1 interact with the voltage sensors of Kv channels to inhibit voltage-dependent channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee and MacKinnon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Other toxins bind directly to the extracellular mouth of the channel to block current. The cone-snail toxin Cs1 binds to the extracellular surface of Kv channels and is thought to block currents by inducing a conformational change in the protein, collapsing the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karbat et al., 2019</xref>). In X-ray crystal structures the scorpion toxin Charybdotoxin is seen to block Kv1.2-paddle chimera channels by inserting a lysine residue directly into the selectivity filter, disrupting the ion-binding site IS1 to inhibit ion flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref>). The same mechanism holds for block of Kv1.3 by the sea anemone toxin ShK as studied by cryoEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Selvakumar et al., 2022</xref>); in the latter two cases, the lysine terminal amine interacts with the Y17’ carbonyls which form the top of binding site IS1. We now report that Kv1.2 block by the snake toxin α-Dendrotoxin (α-DTx) is by a similar mechanism.</p><p>Obtaining the structure of an asymmetric ligand bound to a four-fold symmetric channel is challenging, and the four structural studies that have been done have used different strategies. In their X-ray crystallographic study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref> were able to interpret and model at low resolution the fourfold superimposed toxin density, using heavy-atom derivatives in a series of crystal structures to establish the pose of the toxin molecule. The difficulty of modeling the CTx molecule precluded assigning a precise location to the Lys22 channel-blocking sidechain; nevertheless, in the 2.5 Å map of the selectivity filter are seen three well-resolved, discrete ion densities in the sites IS2, IS3 and IS4, and the authors conclude that the toxin interaction prevents ion occupancy of the IS1 site. A cryoEM study that yielded a similar C4 symmetric reconstruction of Kv1.3 with bound dalazatide, a derivative of the ShK toxin, was obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tyagi et al., 2022</xref>. The C4-symmetric reconstruction did not yield an interpretable map of the toxin, but clear ion densities in IS2, IS3, and IS4 were visible.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Selvakumar et al., 2022</xref> also obtained a structure of ShK bound to Kv1.3, but in this case the ShK toxin was fused to a Fab fragment; this yielded an asymmetric ligand large enough to allow C1 reconstruction from the cryoEM images. The resulting 3.4 Å map allowed the toxin K22 sidechain to be modeled entering the pore and extending to near the Y17’ carbonyl oxygens.</p><p>From our cryoEM data we obtained a C1 map of α-DTx bound to Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> at 3.2 Å; this was done by extensive image processing and was helped by the larger size of α-DTx (59 residues as compared to 35 for ShK). With this map, the side chain of the toxin residue K5 could be traced, apparently with the terminal amine directly coordinated by the Y17’ carbonyls. A surprise in this map are the positions of the K<sup>+</sup> ion peaks in the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Ion density is visible in IS3, and somewhat lower density is seen in IS1; there is no density peak in IS2. The different pattern of ion densities with DTx compared to CTx, having two rather than three peaks in the selectivity filter, implies that the interaction between the lysine side chain and the selectivity filter is in some way different in DTx compared to the other toxins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The selectivity filter in the absence of K<sup>+</sup></title><p>In the absence of K<sup>+</sup>, large voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> currents are observed in wildtype Kv2.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korn and Ikeda, 1995</xref>) and in Shaker channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Melishchuk et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The Kv1.2 structure reported here with Na<sup>+</sup> replacing essentially all K<sup>+</sup> in the solution shows a selectivity filter conformation that is little changed from the K<sup>+</sup> structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

We therefore sought to obtain the structure of the corresponding Kv1.2-W17’F channel in Na<sup>+</sup> solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In 2D classes, the complex appeared to be highly unstable, with large variations in the ‘wobble’ angle between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.

One gram of cell lysate was resuspended in 5 mL of Lysis buffer consists of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM KCl, 300 mM sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, 0.05 mg deoxyribonuclease I, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin and aprotin, and 0.1 mg/mL of soy trypsin inhibitor. Lysis buffer plus 30 mM dodecylmaltoside (DDM) was used to solubilize the membranes for 3 hr at room temperature. Centrifugation (13,000× <italic>g</italic>, 20 min) separated the unsolubilized material. The supernatant was added to Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads (IBA Lifesciences) preequilibrated with Membrane Resuspension Buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 3 mM TCEP, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mM DDM). The bead slurry (approximately 1 ml) was incubated 1 hr at 4 °C with gentle rotation. A column was used to collect the beads after incubation, followed by washing with 14 volumes of Wash Buffer, which was Membrane Resuspension Buffer with added lipids (0.1 mg/ml of the mixture 3:1:1 of POPC:POPE:POPG). The addition of 10 mM desthiobiotin was used to elute the bound protein. The eluted protein was concentrated with a Millipore Amicon Ultra 100 K filter and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superose S6 column pre-equilibrated with Running Buffer: 20 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 2 mM TCEP, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM dodecylmaltoside (Anatrace, anagrade) and 0.1 mg/ml lipid mixture (3:1:1 of POPC:POPE:POPG). We pooled fractions containing both alpha and beta subunits, and when necessary concentrated the protein to 1~2 mg/ml (Amicon Ultra 100 KDa, Millipore). For experiments under K<sup>+</sup>-free conditions, the protein bound to Strep-Tactin was washed with 5 column volumes of K<sup>+</sup>-free Wash Buffer (150 mM NaCl replacing KCl) and eluted in 3 mL of K<sup>+</sup>-free elution buffer. As for SEC, the column was first washed with three volumes of K<sup>+</sup>-free Running Buffer before running the protein sample.</p><p>Protein expression was monitored by western blot using an anti-strep-tag antibody, Abnova PAB16603.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Oocyte expression and voltage-clamp recordings</title><p>The Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> alpha subunit or its W366F mutant construct was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector. RNA was prepared from the XbaI-linearized plasmid using T7 RNA polymerase. Oocytes were obtained from a <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> frog (Nasco Education) and were defolliculated by collagenase treatment, injected with cRNA and stored in ND96 solution (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH) at 18 °C. Recordings were done at room temperature, 5–6 days post-injection in ND96 solution or KD96, the same solution but made with 96 mM KCl, 2 mM NaCl and KOH. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings employed an OC-725C amplifier (Warner Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>CryoEM specimen preparation, data acquisition, and processing</title><p>Quantifoil holey carbon grids (R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh, Au) were glow-discharged at 15 mA for 1 min with carbon side facing upwards in the chamber. The chamber of the freezing apparatus (Vitrobot Mark IV, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was preequilibrated at 16 °C and 100% humidity. A 3 μL droplet of protein sample was applied to the carbon side of each grid and blotted for 3 or 5 s with zero blotting force after 15 s wait time before plunge-freezing in liquid ethane. For the DTX bound sample, about 400 nM α-DTX (Alomone Labs) was mixed with Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> protein 30 min prior to cryoEM grid preparation.</p><p>For the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-Na<sup>+</sup>, W366F-Na<sup>+</sup>, and DTX-bound samples, graphene-covered grids were used to allow lower protein concentrations (0.05–0.1 mg/ml) to be used. These were prepared from commercial graphene (Trivial Transfer Graphene, single layer; ACS Material LLC) using the recommended transfer protocol and floated onto quantifoil grids. To make the graphene layer hydrophilic, grids were then plasma-cleaned (Gatan 950 Advanced Plasma System) under Ar/O<sub>2</sub> at 10 W for 10 s with the graphene coated surface facing upwards in the chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fan et al., 2019</xref>). Vitrification was conducted as described above but with 30 s wait time.</p><p>A table of cryoEM data collection, refinement and validation statistics is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. CryoEM samples were imaged on a Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 keV, equipped with a Bio Quantum energy filter (20 eV slit width) and K3 camera (Gatan). Micrographs were collected using super-resolution mode, physical pixel size 1.068 Å, with SerialEM software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schorb et al., 2019</xref>) using image shift patterns and one shot per hole. A total of 6335, 8310, 4507, 2573, and 9628 micrographs were collected for datasets of WT, W366F, DTX-bound, Na<sup>+</sup>-bound WT, and the Na<sup>+</sup> bound W366F transmembrane region.</p><p>Processing for each dataset is summarized in the Figure Supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>. Beam-induced motion was corrected by MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) and CTF values were estimated by Gctf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang, 2016</xref>). Particles were picked either by RELION reference-free Laplacian-of-Gaussian autopicking; an adversarial-template-based program DemoPicker written by F.J.S.; or RELION reference-based auto-picking. All further processing used RELION 3.1. Picked particles were extracted and subjected to rounds of 2D and 3D classification before refinement. Transmembrane-domain masks were used for focused refinement to optimize the resolution of the transmembrane region. Beam-tilt and per-particle CTF refinement followed by per-particle motion correction were applied to further improve the resolution.</p><p>Analysis of the DTx-Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> complex started with a C4 reconstruction of the complex from 323 k particles. We then performed a rough docking into the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> apo density of a toxin map created from the 1DTX model. The toxin pose was chosen not to be inconsistent with the symmetrized toxin density visible in the DTx-Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> C4 map. Four of these composite maps were created, with the toxin pose rotated 90<sup>o</sup> each time about the z-axis. These were filtered to 20 Å resolution for use as 3D references. Meanwhile a C4 symmetry expansion of the 323 k particles was performed, resulting in a 1.294 M particle stack. A soft cylindrical mask of radius 24 Å and height 48 Å was created, centered on the z-axis at the interface between the toxin and the pore region. Using this mask and the four 3D references, we performed 3D classification without alignment in RELION, and chose one of the four resulting classes as a C1 reconstruction of the masked region. Using the corresponding set of 312 k particles, we performed C1 homogeneous reconstruction in CryoSPARC to yield the refined structure at 3.2 Å resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Protein model building, refinement, and structural analysis</title><p>An Alpha-Fold predicted rat Kv1.2 model (alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/Q09081) was used to build the Kv1.2 native atomic model.

The work builds on a large body of structural work on Kv1.2 and related voltage-gated potassium channels. The manuscript presents a plethora of structural work, and the authors are commended on the breadth of the studies. The structural studies are well-executed. Although the findings are mostly confirmatory, they do add to the body of work on this and related channels. Notably, the authors present structures of DTx-bound Kv1.2 and of Kv1.2 in a low concentration of potassium (which may contain sodium ions bound within the selectivity filter). These two structures add considerable new information. The DTx structure has been markedly improved in the revised version and the authors arrive at well-founded conclusions regarding its mechanism of block. Regarding the Na+ structure, the authors claim that the structure with sodium has &quot;zero&quot; potassium - I caution them to make this claim. It is likely that some K+ persists in their sample and that some of the density in the &quot;zero potassium&quot; structure may be due to K+ rather than Na+. This can be clarified by revisions to the text and discussion. I do not think that any additional experiments are needed. Overall, the manuscript is well-written, a nice addition to the field, and a crowning achievement for the Sigworth lab.</p><p>Most of this reviewer's initial comments have been addressed in the revised manuscript. Some comments remain that could be addressed by revisions of the text.</p><p>Specific comments on the revised version:</p><p>Quotations indicate text in the manuscript.</p><p>(1) &quot;While the VSD helices in Kv1.2s and the inactivated Kv1.2s-W17'F superimpose very well at the top (including the S4-S5 interface described above), there is a general twist of the helix bundle that yields an overall rotation of about 3o at the bottom of the VSD.&quot;</p><p>Comment: This seemed a bit confusing. I assume the authors aligned the complete structures - the differences they indicate seem to be slight VSD repositioning relative to the pore rather than differences between the VSD conformations themselves. The authors may wish to clarify. As they point out in the subsequent paragraph, the VSDs are known to be loosely associated with the pore.</p></disp-quote><p>We aligned the VSDs alone, and it is a twist of the VSD helix bundle.</p><p>This is now clarified in lines 269-273, p. 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Comment: The modeling of DTx into the density is a major improvement in the revision. Figure 3 displays some interactions between the toxin and Kv1.2 - additional side views of the toxin and the channel might allow the reader to appreciate the interactions more fully. The overall fit of the toxin structure into the density is somewhat difficult to assess from the figure. (The authors might consider using ChimeraX to display density and model in this figure.)</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new panels, and stereo pairs, to Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) &quot;We obtained the structure of Kv1.2s in a zero K+ solution, with all potassium replaced with sodium, and were surprised to find that it is little changed from the K+ bound structure, with an essentially identical selectivity filter conformation (Figure 4B and Figure 4-figure supplement 1).&quot;</p><p>Comment: It should be noted in the manuscript that K+ and Na+ ions cannot be distinguished by the cryo-EM studies - the densities are indistinguishable. The authors are inferring that the observed density corresponds to Na+ because the protein was exchanged from K+ into Na+ on a gel filtration (SEC) column. It is likely that a small amount of K+ remains in the protein sample following SEC. I caution the authors to claim that there is zero K+ in solution without measuring the K+ content of the protein sample. Additionally, it should be considered that K+ may be present in the blotting paper used for cryo-EM grid preparation (our laboratory has noted, for example, a substantial amount of Ca2+ in blotting paper). The affinity of Kv1.2 for K+ has not been determined, to my knowledge - the authors note in the Discussion that the Shaker channel has &quot;tight&quot; binding for K+. It seems possible that some portion of the density in the selectivity filter could be due to residual K+. This caveat should be clearly stated in the main text and discussion. More extensive exchange into Na+, such as performing the entire protein purification in NaCl, or by dialysis (as performed for obtaining the structure of KcsA in low K+ by Y. Zhou et al. &amp; Mackinnon 2001), would provide more convincing removal of K+, but I suspect that the Kv1.2 protein would not have sufficient biochemical stability without K+ to endure this treatment. One might argue that reduced biochemical stability in NaCl could be an indication that there was a meaningful amount of K+ in the final sample used for cryo-EM (or in the particles that were selected to yield the final high-resolution structure).</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain in the Methods section, in more detail the steps taken to avoid any residual Na+ contamination during purification, lines 683-687, pp. 24-25. We have changed the text to point out that the ion species cannot be distinguished in the maps, and note results in NaK2K and KcsA (lines 368-381, pp. 13-14).</p><p>We note that the same procedures to remove K+ were used for the Kv1.2sW17’F structure (line 385, p. 14). We qualify the ion replacement to say that Na+ replaces “essentially” all K+ (line 607, p. 21).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Referring to the structure obtained in NaCl: &quot;The ion occupancy is also similar, and we presume that Kv1.2 is a conducting channel in sodium solution.&quot;</p><p>Comment: Stating that &quot;Kv1.2 is a conducting channel in sodium solution&quot; and implying that conduction of Na+ is achieved by an analogous distribution of ion binding sites as observed for K+ are strong statements to make - and not justified by the experiments provided. Electrophysiology would be required to demonstrate that the channel conducts sodium in the absence of K+. More complete ionic exchange, better control of the ionic conditions (Na+ vs K+), and affinity measurements for K+ would be needed to determine the distribution of Na+ in the filter (as mentioned above). At minimum, the authors should revise and clarify what the intended meaning of the statement &quot;we presume that Kv1.2 is a conducting channel in sodium solution&quot;. As mentioned above, it seems possible/likely that a portion of the density in the filter may be due to K+.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present a more detailed argument (lines 376 to 381, pp. 13-14.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p><p>After consultation, the reviewers agree that, although the authors have answered most of the comments raised in the previous review, there remains a concern about the structure obtained in the presence if Na. Given that Kv1.2 is more reluctant to slow inactivation, the conducting structure in Na+ could be due to this fact or that it really has higher affinity for K+ than Na+. In the presence of even a small contamination by K+, this ion could thus occupy the selectivity filter, resulting in an open conformation. The authors should clearly state the steps taken to ensure no contamination by K+. It is also possible that indeed the open structure occurs even in the presence of Na+ in the selectivity filter. This should be also discussed, given that this has been observed in other potassium channel structures.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In this revised version of the manuscript, the authors have adequately addressed my previous points and improved the clarity and readability of the manuscript. This is a compelling work that shows inactivated structures if the Kv1.2 potassium channel, especially interesting is a structure in the absence of extracellular potassium ions, that can help understand how a reduction in the availability of these ions speed up entrance into the inactivated state in these ion channels.</p><p>I would just recommend that in the absence of functional data (current recordings) when potassium is removed, the authors just use caution in ascribing this structure to an inactivated state. Also, it should be mentioned that the observed ion densities observed in the pore cannot unambiguously be identified as sodium ions.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) &quot;The nearby Leu9 is also important as its substitution by alanine also decreases affinity 1000-fold, but we observe no contacts between this residue and residues of the Kv1.2s channel.&quot;</p><p>Comment: It seems early in the text to mention the potential interaction of Leu9 to the channel structure. The authors may wish to discuss Leu9 later in the manuscript - a figure showing the location of Leu9 would strengthen the statement. Any hypothesis on why mutation of it has such a profound effect?</p><p>Add a figure panel showing Leu9 position.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the text as suggested, and have identified Leu9 in several panels of Fig. 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) &quot;The X-ray structure of a-DTX (Figure 3A)&quot;</p><p>Comment: The authors may wish to cite a reference to this X-ray structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite Skarzynski (1992) on line 321, p. 12.</p></body></sub-article></article>
