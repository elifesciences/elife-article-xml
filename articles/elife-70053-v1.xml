specialized subset of CD4 effector T cells that are crucial for germinal center (GC) reactions and for selecting B cells to undergo affinity maturation. Despite this central role for humoral immunity, only few data exist about their clonal distribution when multiple lymphoid organs are exposed to the same antigen (Ag) as it is the case in autoimmunity. Here, we used an autoantibody-mediated disease model of the skin and injected one auto-Ag into the two footpads of the same mouse and analyzed the T cell receptor (TCR)β sequences of Tfh located in GCs of both contralateral draining lymph nodes. We found that over 90% of the dominant GC-Tfh clonotypes were shared in both lymph nodes but only transiently. The initially dominant Tfh clonotypes especially declined after establishment of chronic disease while GC reaction and autoimmune disease continued. Our data demonstrates a dynamic behavior of Tfh clonotypes under autoimmune conditions and emphasizes the importance of the time point for distinguishing auto-Ag-specific Tfh clonotypes from potential bystander activated ones.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptive immunity</kwd><kwd>germinal center reactions</kwd><kwd>follicular T helper cells</kwd><kwd>T cell antigen</kwd><kwd>receptor sequences</kwd><kwd>clonal selection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kalies</surname><given-names>Kathrin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK 1727/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Westermann</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name><name><surname>Kalies</surname><given-names>Kathrin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TR-SFB654</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Westermann</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name><name><surname>Kalies</surname><given-names>Kathrin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Repertoires of autoreactive murine follicular T helper cells synchronize transiently within one individual.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Germinal centers (GCs) are transient organized microstructures within secondary lymphoid tissues, which support the development of high-affinity antibodies by B cells. Even though GCs are mainly B cell driven, their formation and maintenance depends on follicular T helper cells (Tfh), a specialized subset of effector CD4 T cells. The differentiation into Tfh initiates in T cell zones of lymphoid organs before GC formation starts. After their interaction with B cells at the T-B border, Tfh locate within GC (GC-Tfh) and regulate the survival of proliferating GC-B cells, which compete for antigen (Ag) and for signals from GC-Tfh to undergo further somatic hypermutation and to mature into high-affinity-antibody-producing plasma cells and memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crotty, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qi, 2016</xref>). Thus, GC-Tfh are central players in the regulation of humoral immune responses. Both (i) their differentiation into GC-Tfh and (ii) their survival and clonal expansion within GCs are constantly driven by competition for Ag contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumjohann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fazilleau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hwang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knowlden and Sant, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tubo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Merkenschlager et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we asked whether this clonal competition of Tfh for the limited space in GCs involves GC reactions of one or more activated lymphoid organs. This is of special interest for autoimmune conditions when multiple inflamed tissue sites and autoreactive GC reactions exist in distinct lymphoid organs. Tfh can shuttle between GCs of one lymph node or spleen indicating a local competition within one lymphoid organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Merkenschlager et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shulman et al., 2013</xref>). The finding that CXCR5+ Tfh circulate in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2013</xref>) opens the possibility for a systemic exchange, in which each Tfh clone could participate in the clonal competition within distinct lymphoid organs in one individual. However, the diversity of individual T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires is extremely high, and it has been shown that individual T cell responses towards Ag are unique and polyclonal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Textor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thomas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zarnitsyna et al., 2013</xref>). This might be especially valid for auto-Ag because TCR bind with low affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rius et al., 2018</xref>). In line, the number of autoreactive T cell clones within one individual is particularly low due to the thymic negative selection process, which could support the involvement of multiple cross-reactive T cell clones specific for the same auto-Ag within one individual as it has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ritvo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To find out how polyclonal autoreactive Tfh responses are, we studied the distribution of GC-Tfh clones between two activated lymph nodes and challenged the endogenous TCR repertoire by injecting one auto-Ag, directed against a structural protein of murine skin, into the two hind footpads of the same mouse and analyzed the TCRβ sequences of GC-Tfh in both draining popliteal lymph nodes (pln). In contrast to our expectations, we found that the GC-Tfh clonotypes were highly shared between the two pln. This high overlap between both pln was restricted to the dominant GC-Tfh clonotypes and disappeared after establishment of skin pathology even though GC reaction continued. These temporal variations in the distribution of Tfh clones should be considered when utilizing Tfh repertoires to monitor and diagnose autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GC reactions occur in both draining lymph nodes</title><p>To evaluate TCR sequences of GC-Tfh in separate lymph nodes, we used the autoimmune model for the autoantibody-induced skin blistering disease epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hammers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sitaru et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The number of GCs varied between 38 and 55 per pln with volumes ranging between 0.005 and 0.01 mm<sup>3</sup>, which were clearly sufficient to laser-capture 4–6 complete GCs from left and right pln (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). Next, we investigated whether the mice in our control group that received Ag-free PBS emulsified in the adjuvant TM only (PBS group) would induce comparable GCs and GC-Tfh as the Ag1 group. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, quantification of the GC area within the B cell follicles and T cell numbers within GCs of left and right pln revealed that the GC areas in the PBS group were smaller compared to the Ag1 group (22% for the Ag1 group and 17% for the PBS group), but the numbers of Tfh within the light zone of the GCs did not differ between the Ag1 and PBS groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). To isolate GC-Tfh, we laser-captured an area of 0.04 mm<sup>3</sup> GC (4–6 complete GCs, see black dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) from cryosections of left and right pln. These laser-captured GCs contained altogether an estimated average of 30,000 GC-Tfh per pln (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). TCRβ amplification and Illumina Miseq sequencing yielded on average 1.14 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 0.08 × 10<sup>6</sup> total and 3297 and 2411 unique TCRβ sequences (here referred to as GC-Tfh clonotypes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) in the Ag1 and PBS groups, respectively. This data shows that the injections into the two footpads induced GC reactions in both draining pln, which contained comparable numbers of Tfh independent whether Ag is present or not.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-70053-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>3D image of germinal centers (GCs) in the left popliteal lymph nodes (pln) of mouse 1.</title><p>Ag1/TM was injected into both footpads of SJLH2s mice.

A high correlation between both pln was found in all mice of the Ag1 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The dominant GC-Tfh clonotypes especially overlapped almost completely as shown for the 20 most abundant GC-Tfh clonotypes from one representative mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This situation was totally different when GC-Tfh clonotypes were correlated to TCRβ sequences of skin-immigrating T effector cells (Teff). In this experiment, a biopsy of an autoantibody-induced inflammatory skin lesions of murine ears was used for TCRβ sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niebuhr et al., 2020</xref>). We found that the overlap between Tfh and Teff did not exceed the background level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c, d</xref>). To quantify the clonal overlaps between pln and skin lesions for all mice, we used the Morisita–Horn index (MHI), which identifies the number of identical T cell clonotypes between two individual repertoires by taking their relative frequencies into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morisita, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horn, 1966</xref>). Thus, the MHI of GC-Tfh clonotypes between both pln was 3.5 times higher than that between GCs and skin lesions (MHI of 0.46 ± 0.07 versus MHI of 0.13 ± 0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). This data demonstrates that distinct T cell clones contribute to the responses in GCs and skins, which is in line with data suggesting that the binding affinities between TCR and peptide:MHCII complexes determine the direction of T cell differentiation and that only the high-affinity T cell differentiates into Tfh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tubo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identical Tfh clonotypes accumulate within germinal centers (GCs) of both popliteal lymph nodes (pln) at the time point of skin lesion onset.</title><p>Ag1 or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were injected s.c. into both footpads.

Each CD4 T cell expresses one specific αβ TCR interacting with specific peptide-Ag presented in MHCII complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Itano and Jenkins, 2003</xref>). Upon interaction of the TCR with peptide:MHCII complexes, naive CD4 T cells undergo proliferation and functional differentiation into distinct T helper subsets such as Th1, Th2, Th17 effector cells, Tfh, and immunosuppressive Treg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). The main factor that regulates CD4 T cell differentiation is the TCR signaling strength, which is controlled by TCR/peptide:MHCII interactions, co-stimulation, and/or optimal dwell times. The differentiation into Tfh depends on strong TCR signals. It is suggested that they are strictly Ag-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hwang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knowlden and Sant, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tubo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Merkenschlager et al., 2021</xref>).

We used an autoantibody-mediated disease model of the skin, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and induced GC-Tfh in two separate draining pln by injecting auto-Ag in adjuvant (Ag1 or Ag2 group) or adjuvant only (PBS group).</p><p>Our study shows two major findings. First, we found a high overlap of dominant GC-Tfh clonotypes in both pln of one mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). This data demonstrates that even though the response to the auto-Ag was polyclonal in each mouse, a group of almost identical GC-Tfh clonotypes became dominant in each draining pln. Thus, exposures to the auto-Ag (Ag1 or Ag2) decreased the diversity of the endogenous Tfh repertoire compared to the PBS group. To establish this finding, we used multiplex iRepertiore PCRs and subsequent MiTCR analysis for preparing libraries and annotating TCRβ sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolotin et al., 2013</xref>), which ensures to yield the highest possible diversity of TCRβ clonotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afzal et al., 2019</xref>). To confirm this decrease in diversity of the endogenous Tfh repertoire, we reanalyzed our data for Ag1 with a more precise analysis tool MiXCR that is advantageous for error corrections and adjusts for a more accurate clonal composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolotin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolotin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Team I, 2019</xref>). The high overlap of the dominant Tfh clonotypes in the Ag1 group was clearly confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further compare both analysis tools, we calculated the MHI from samples of the Ag1 and PBS groups analyzed either with MiTCR or MiXCR. Data show a high similarity in both the Ag1 group (0.70 ± 0.04) and the PBS group (0.69 ± 0.039). Obviously, our finding that Tfh clonotypes highly overlap in contralateral pln is very robust independent of the analysis tools. On the other side, the suitability of the multiplex PCRs can be seen by the correct detections of the deletions in the TRBV genes of SJL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behlke et al., 1986</xref>). In summary, this data that the endogenous Tfh repertoire decreased after Ag exposure indicates that the number of T cell clones specific for the injected auto-Ag is restricted per mouse and supports previous reports demonstrating that the precursor frequency specific for auto-Ag within the T cell population of an individual is rather low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jenkins and Moon, 2012</xref>). However, the precursor frequency of naive T cells specific for different peptide:MHC complexes varies in size. Therefore, it will be interesting whether this high clonal overlap would be found after injection of xenogeneic or pathogenic Ag. Moreover, because both Ag used in this study are polypeptides of a relatively large size (200–400 aa) and clearly differ from the size of peptides (13–25 aa) that are usually presented in MHCII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Natarajan et al., 2018</xref>), it is likely that they contain more than one antigenic epitope. It is reasonable to assume that injecting smaller peptides will further narrow the diversity of the individual GC-Tfh repertoire. In an initial experiment as an example for a recombinant xenogeneic protein antigen, we injected the <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>-derived glutathione-s-transferase (GST)-tag of Ag1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rao et al., 2003</xref>), emulsified in TM into both footpads, and analyzed the distribution of Tfh clonotypes in both draining pln 4 weeks p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). We found that the distribution of the GST-specific Tfh clonotypes between both pln was less controlled compared to the auto-Ag1. Dot plot diagrams showed a higher variability between the mice. In line, the MHI was not significantly different from the PBS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and the number of overlapping Tfh clonotypes is lower in the GST group compared to the Ag1 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Analysis of the V/J usage revealed significant differences in expression of TRBV3. The J2-4-segment was significantly less abundant after GST/TM immunization compared to the PBS/-group and the J2-5 segment was jointly higher abundant after GST/TM and Ag1 immunization compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data confirm the strict Ag specificity of Tfh cells in GCs, especially during the first 4 weeks p.i. The higher inconsistency in the number of overlapping Tfh clonotypes in the GST group could be explained by an earlier consumption of the Ag or the presence of more high-affinity T cell clones. These findings might be strongly influenced by the time point and the Ag concentration, which should be further investigated in future studies.</p><p>Another arising question is when this overlap of T cell clonotypes between both pln of one mouse starts. For example, T cells could travel between pln and the clonal selection could be a continuous organism-wide systemic process. The presence of circulating Tfh cells has been described in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2013</xref>); however, it is not clear whether these circulating Tfh cells can enter ongoing GC reactions. Alternatively, it could take place during the priming phase. In this case, either the naive TCR repertoire is sufficiently broad that the Ag-driven selection for the GC reactions in both pln would robustly yield groups of similar clones independently or recently activated CD4 T cell clones would exchange between both pln after priming before GC reaction starts. To address this, we performed an initial experiment and identified TCRβ sequences of entire left and right pln of the same mouse (naive mice and mice that had been exposed to Ag1 for 1 or 3 days; please find detailed information in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) and compared the relative percentage of overlapping T cell clonotypes between left and right pln by using the MHI. We found that the MHI did not differ between naive mice and Ag-exposed mice at 1 day p.i. (0.2035 + 0.01962 in naive mice, 0.2113 + 0.009 at 1 day p.i.), but a significant increased MHI at 3 days p.i. (0.3716 + 0.031; p&lt;0.01, Kruskal–Wallis test, mean + SD for n = 3 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In parallel, the number of proliferating T cells and the mRNA expression for the proliferation marker Ki67 increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). One may speculate that a high number of progenies emerges from the high-affinity T cell clones 3 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2017</xref>), which then migrate into other activated lymphoid tissues before differentiating into GC-Tfh. In this case, the initial progeny of activated T cell clones could originate from identical precursors, which would enter the circulation and migrate into the other pln, in which they outcompete low-affinity competitors and develop into GC-Tfh. However, on the other side it is assumed that Tfh stay resident in lymph nodes to provide B cell help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crotty, 2019</xref>). One possibility to observe potential exchanges of Tfh cells between lymph nodes would be treatment with the T cell trafficking blocker FTY720. However, previous studies revealed no effect in this autoimmune mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niebuhr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thieme et al., 2019</xref>). The second major finding of our study is that the PBS group, which received only adjuvant, develops GCs to a similar extent as the Ag group. Here, in contrast to the Ag group, the GC-Tfh repertoire remains diverse. No overlap of dominant GC-Tfh clonotypes was found between both pln. TM is a water-in-oil adjuvant that contains squalene among other components but no peptides that could be presented in MHCII (TiterMax Inc). It is proposed that adjuvants stress or kill local cells, which leads to the release of endogenous peptide-epitopes that are subsequently presented to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riteau et al., 2016</xref>) and induce the formation of GC reactions as observed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In this scenario, numerous endogenous peptide-epitopes at low concentrations might be released by the local inflammation, which leads to the diverse GC-Tfh repertoire in both pln (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). However, to break the tolerance in our model, both auto-Ag had to be injected at very high concentrations (60 µg/Ag1 or 120 µg/Ag2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sitaru et al., 2006</xref>). This data leads to the hypothesis that the concentration of the Ag is critically involved in the emergence of overlapping GC-Tfh repertoires in separate pln (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It will be interesting to find out how low Ag concentrations at distinct tissue sites affect the GC-Tfh repertoires. Moreover, it will be important to study the adjuvant-stimulated peptide-epitopes in future studies, especially because squalene compounds are frequently used in human vaccines and might evoke unwanted autoimmune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pellegrini et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>GC-Tfh clonotypes overlap in separate lymph nodes only after Ag exposure.</title><p>Simplified drawing summarizes the distribution of GC-Tfh clonotypes of the Ag group and PBS group over time. Clonotypes are displayed as circles. Circle colors indicate specificity and circle size its frequency. Ag is injected at high quantities into both footpads (bluish green pentagons, top left). The injection of adjuvant induces a local inflammation and the release of many endogenous epitopes at low quantities (diverse forms and colors, bottom left). Both groups receive adjuvant (red jagged circles). Identical high-expanded Ag-activated Tfh clonotypes emerge in germinal centers (GCs) of both draining popliteal lymph nodes (pln) after 2–4 weeks (big greenish circles, top middle). The high-expanded Tfh clonotypes get exchanged after 7–10 weeks. The initially high-activated Ag-specific Tfh clonotypes remain at low quantities (small greenish circles, top right). Adjuvant-only-exposed pln harbor distinct random Tfh clonotypes (diverse colors, bottom middle and bottom right).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70053-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Another conclusion of our study is that the total number of GC-Tfh within one individual is regulated by the number of lymphoid tissues that drain Ag-exposed tissue sites. This data suggests that Ag injection at two or more tissue sites could improve the development of high-affinity antibodies. We believe that this information will be highly useful for the development of new and more efficient vaccination strategies.</p><p>Finally, we wish to highlight that this in vivo approach could help to identify new peptide-specific TCR sequences and confirm already established datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teraguchi et al., 2020</xref>). Even though TCR datasets are growing, the number of TCRs with known Ag specificity and function is extremely low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shugay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zvyagin et al., 2020</xref>). Especially the detection of self-reactive CD4 TCR is problematic due to the low binding affinities between TCR and autoantigenic-peptide:MHCII complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rius et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, even though our approach is restricted to mouse models, the use of HLA-transgenic mice might enable to link TCR sequences also to human antigenic epitopes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>8–12-week-old female SJL/J mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany), and 8–12-week-old female H2s-congenic C57BL/6 mice (B6.SJL-H2s) C3c/1CyJ (B6.s) mice were kindly provided by the Lübeck Institute of Experimental Dermatology (LIED, University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany).

#1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Niebuhr et al. use a mouse model of the autoimmune disease epidermolysis bullosa acquisita to investigate the T cell receptor repertoire of follicular helper T cells (TFH) isolated from the light zone of germinal centers by laser capture as determined using high throughput sequencing. The key question the authors address is whether such repertoires differ when the same mouse is immunized in two different locations in parallel. Two weeks after immunization dominant T cell clones were comparable in germinal centers in the two lymph nodes that drain the two different injection sites. The size of such clones was contracting at 7 and 10 weeks after injection and similarities of repertoires between the two lymph nodes were lost. These are well executed complex experiments. Welcome are the repertoire characterization of the PBS control, the comparison with effector T cells, and the use of a second mouse model for corroboration. The data support the idea that the immune response to the autoantigens is comparable across the entire mouse rather than distinct in each draining lymph node.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable note.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The compact manuscript lacks causal experiments. The authors could for example prevent lymphocyte trafficking between lymph nodes to distinguish whether the similar TCR repertoires in the two draining lymph nodes two weeks after injection arise from independent parallel priming or from lymphocyte trafficking between the lymph nodes. Such experiments would substantially strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We agree with the reviewer that is important to examine lymphocyte trafficking. We surgically removed one 2wk lymph node and compared Tfh clonotypes to the 10wk contralateral lymph node of the same mouse, which reflects an inhibition of T cell trafficking between both lymph nodes for a period of 8 wks. The data show that especially the size of the dominant 2wk Tfh clonotypes decreased in the 10 wk lymph nodes and other Tfh clonotypes became dominant but most of the 2 wk Tfh clonotypes were maintained within the GC over this period of 8 wk. We agree with the reviewer that the changes observed indicate an exchange of dominant clones within one lymph node, but it cannot be concluded that Tfh clonotypes exchange between lymph nodes. To clarify this, we rewrote the manuscript substantially (title, abstract, second paragraph on page 7, line 166 and 181).</p><p>In addition, we performed experiments and compared T cell receptor sequences in left and right lymph nodes of the same mouse 1d and 3d after priming. The number of shared dominant T cell clonotypes increased 3d p.i.. (Morisita Horn index). We included these data in the discussion (page 11, line 267).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Looking at the week 7 and 10 TFH TCR repertoires, Niebuhr et al. interpret the lack of significant correlation between the repertoires in the two draining lymph nodes as evidence for clonotype replacement (line 157). There may be a simpler explanation that should be considered. Clone sizes contract over the course of the immune response as seems evident in Figure 4A. This should be quantified. As the repertoire of non-antigen-specific follicular helper T cells is different in each lymph node, a contraction of the antigen-specific clones to the size of the non-antigen-specific ones may simply make it technically impossible to follow the antigen-specific clones on the variable background of the non-antigen-specific ones. In this context, the linear relation analysis used by the authors is largely driven by the relatively small number of large clones.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this basic concern. We agree that our data focus especially on the high frequent clones that are shared between left and right lymph nodes. In our opinion these are the most relevant Tfh clonotypes to look at due to the limited size in GC and the high clonal competition between Tfh for space within GC (Merkenschlager et al. Nature 2021, doi: 10.1038/s41586-021-03187-x). Our data show that the size of the overlapping dominant 2 wk Tfh clones declines over time and the size of other potential bystander activated Tfh clones becomes superior (Figure 4). This does not mean that the initial large clones would be completely replaced. Instead, they are still there but at lower frequencies. We rewrote the manuscript accordingly (title, abstract, second paragraph on page 7, line 166 and 181). In addition, to study the clone distribution we performed box plot analysis from the 2wks and 10wks GC-Tfh clonotypes (Figure 4c and d) that shows that the overall clone size of GC-Tfh does not generally contract over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As minor comments, statistics for Figure 1C should be given. Arrows in Figure 1D may be shifted.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and added statistics and changed the arrows</p><p>accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The manuscript leaves important questions unresolved.</p><p>A similar TCR repertoire in the distinct lymph nodes draining two injection sites could in principle be caused by two different mechanisms. The naïve T cell repertoire in each lymph node could be sufficiently broad that the antigen-driven selection in the germinal centers robustly yields independent groups of similar clones. Alternatively, lymphocytes could travel between lymph nodes thus setting up organism-wide clonal selection. These scenarios can be experimentally distinguished as discussed above.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. The surgical removal of one lymph node resembles an inhibition of T cell trafficking within one mouse. In addition, we performed new experiments that show the synchronization between both lymph nodes starts during initial T cell proliferation 3d p.i.. However, we cannot conclude whether these shared T cell clonotypes would differentiate into GC-Tfh cells. Even though the idea to inhibit lymphocyte trafficking is appealing we feel that this kind of kinetic analysis that would be the required is beyond the scope of this paper. We rewrote the manuscript substantially (title, abstract, second paragraph on page 7, line 166 and 181).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As is, the manuscript describes that TFH TCR repertoires are similar in different draining lymph nodes. Are there any practical consequences to that? There should not be, one injection should be sufficient. Are there any practical consequences to the mechanism ensuring this similarity, as outlined in the first question? If there are, this should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for asking these clarifying questions. To better emphasis the practical consequences of our manuscript we changed the focus towards Tfh clonotypes during the course of an autoimmune disease and the importance of timing. Usually in autoimmune diseases, multiple tissues sites are affected, and it has been suggested that autoreactive clonotypes accumulate in the most adjacent lymphoid organ, which was simple judged by V/J gene segment expression (Oftedahl et al. 2017, doi: 10.1016/j.jaut.2017.03.002). In contrast to this, another report showed that high numbers of bystander-activated Tfh clonotypes accumulate also in autoimmune models (Ritvo et al., 2018, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1808594115). Our data fills the gap by showing that indeed identical Tfh clonotypes accumulate in GC of lymph nodes that drain autoantigen-exposed skin sites but that this high overlap of prominent Tfh clonotypes is only transiently. In addition, our approach has the potential to identify antigen-specific T cell clones in vivo and could help to improve vaccination strategies. To emphasize these practical consequences we rewrote the manuscript profoundly (title, abstract, main text and discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The key expertise of this reviewer is in T cell signal transduction. This review thus presents a more general immunological view from outside of the core question of TFH TCR repertoires in the germinal centers.</p><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>I share the conceptual concerns of reviewer 2. I regard laser capture of individual germinal centers and whole lymph node cytometry as complimentary, each having its strengths and weaknesses. I can't comment of the choice of sequencing approach as discussed by reviewer 3.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The manuscript by Niebuhr et al. used laser dissection and TCR sequencing to address the role of follicular T helper (Tfh) cell clonality after immunization in mice. While the topic of the manuscript is of interest, the experimental data and several technical concerns do not fully support the conclusions drawn from the study.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1. Mice were immunized s.c. in both hind foot pads with either a model antigen and Titermax adjuvant or with PBS and Titermax adjuvant, i.e. one mouse received either the Ag or the PBS control. They found that 90% of the clones overlapped in the LNs and that this was transient. The authors claim that TCRs failed to remain enriched and conclude from that the selection of germinal center (GC)-Tfh is controlled by systemic clonal competition throughout the response as stated in the abstract.</p><p>The connection between the enrichment of clones (which is induced by the expansion of activated T cells, most likely clonal, which is not surprising) and its control by &quot;systemic clonal competition&quot; remains questionable though.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to the lack of clarity. We agree with the reviewer that an accumulation of highly expanded T cell clones after immunizations is not surprising. However, we showed previously that high expanded T cell clones even within adjacent T cell zones of murine spleen do not substantially overlap after antigen exposure (Textor et al. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800091). Therefore, the huge difference in the number of shared Tfh clones in both lymph nodes between the Ag and PBS group is surprising. We used the term “systemic versus local selection” to explain this difference between the PBS and Ag group. The adjuvant in the PBS group induces a local inflammation in both footpads leading to the presentation of multiple local epitopes. Each lymph node develops its local Tfh repertoire that does not overlap with the other lymph node. In contrast, the Tfh repertoire of both lymph nodes overlaps in the Ag group. We called this “systemic” because both lymph nodes are involved. We understand that this wording might be misleading. To clarify this, we rewrote the abstract, and changed it throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conceptually, one big question remains: Why did the authors not use both Ag challenge and control treatment in the same mouse? The foot pad/popl. LNs are ideally suited to test this in one mouse. The presented data further do not allow the conclusion that &quot;the GC response is shared between separate LNs and underlies a constant systemic competition&quot; (line 270/271 and similarly in the abstract). Another point is the timing of 2,4, and 7 weeks, which appears quite late given that GCs (admittingly dependent on the Ag/adjuvant used) often reach their peak magnitude already around 7-14 days post immunization.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting this experiment. This kind of experiment should be clearly done. It would be also interesting to inject different antigens and repeat the injections. However, even though it would substantially add interesting information, we feel that this would be beyond the scope of this manuscript and would extend it too much. Additionally, we rewrote substantial parts of the manuscript and avoided terms like “shared GC responses and systemic competition”. Regarding the timing, the time points were chosen depending on the onset of skin pathologies. It takes at least 4 wks for the development of initial skin lesions. This long period is probably required for the loss of tolerance and the recruitment of autoreactive T cell clones. To address earlier time points, we compared the T cell repertoire of complete lymph nodes 1d p.i. and 3d p.i..(discussion page 11, line 267, supplemental Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The approach of dissecting GCs with laser capture is appealing, however, it would be much easier to use sorting by flow cytometry, as this would not only allow single cell sequencing analysis (which was not performed here, only bulk in Figure 2.) but flow cytometry would also provide a much more powerful analysis of the Tfh cells in this setting. While the authors argue that the observed skin phenotype is depending on high-affinity Abs derived from GCs, GC B cells were not assessed here at all, even though a B cell read-out would further help in dissecting the Tfh differences between Ag/TM vs. PBS/TM conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. In this approach we aimed to analyze Tfh in GC without disturbing the organized structure of the lymph nodes. This approach has the advantage that Tfh cell can be analyzed in vivo, which avoids any bias such as unwanted T cell activations or deaths during cell isolation pro. Flow cytometry was used as control. Interestingly, the similarity was higher in FACS-sorted GC-Tfh clonotypes compared to lasercaptured GC-Tfh clonotypes (MHI, 0.46 ± 0.07 versus 0.71 ± 0.11, mean ± SD, Figure 2f). This data indicates that each GC within one lymph node shares the majority of Tfh clonotypes. We included this result in the text (page 6, line 137). We agree with the reviewer that FACS should be the method of choice for further studies. We have not expected before that lasercaptured GC and FACS sorting would give such similar results. Regarding B cell data, we feel that this kind of new experiments would be beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Principally, sorting works (Figure 2e-h). Nevertheless, there are some concerns here: A) The gates in Figure 2e appear (hopefully) not correctly positioned. Did it shift upward during the preparation of the figure? B) From the plot and the legend, it seems that all CXCR5+PD-1+ cells were sorted. These cannot be regarded as GC-Tfh cells, since GC-Tfh cells are only those cells with very high expression of both markers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much pointing towards this important issue. We apologize for the</p><p>bad quality of this FACS plot. We now added the complete gating strategy (Figure 2e).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors use very low numbers of replicates for their experiments. While complex assays such as laser capture and subsequent sequencing require a lot of effort, it needs to be made sure that the results are robust and reproducible. Claiming in Figure 1b that there is no difference between left and right pLN if there are only two mice shown and in mouse 2 there are ~35 vs. ~55 GCs in left vs. right LN, underscores this (with n=2 being not enough for statistical use). Same for 1c.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you! We understand the concern of the reviewer, changed Figure 1b and</p><p>1c and rewrote this sentences (page 5, lines 97 and 113). It is more important that GC reactions emerge in both pln instead that the number of GC are identical.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Lines 117-119: “This data demonstrate that distinct T cell clones contribute to the responses in GC and skins, which is unexpected considering the fact that all T cells were activated with the same Ag.” I would argue that this is actually expected, since those cells that emigrate are most likely not the same cells that end up in GCs, i.e. they are potentially primed at different sites within the T zone or at the T-B border, with different signal strengths, and additionally at different time points (Marc Jenkins’ work). Many variables here. Furthermore, mice were immunized with complex antigens most likely containing several different epitopes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and apologize for this inconclusive conclusion. We</p><p>agree with the reviewer and rewrote this paragraph (page 6, lines 133).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It appears that during cell sorting by flow cytometry dead cells were not excluded with a viability dye. That should always be done to reduce background/false-positive staining, and is regarded as good scientific practice. This is particularly important for sensitive down-stream applications such as sequencing.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify this issue we included the complete gating strategy (Figure 2e).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors injected up to 120µg of Ag in 60µl total volume in the hind foot pads. That is in both regards a lot. Is this due to the autoantigen-driven immunization model that would otherwise not precipitate a phenotype? Is the observed data dependent on such high antigen-load? Would the results be different if other exogenous (model)antigens would be used at lower concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this interesting questions. This high dosage of antigen is required to induce pathologies in this skin blistering autoimmune model. It will be important in further studies to use different kind of antigens and antigenic peptides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>8.

The antigen-specificity in this system is not entirely clear, since complex antigens were used. The clonality of the Tfh cells response has been adressed in humans before, e.g. in influenza infection: Brenna et al. Cell Rep 2020 (PMID: 31914381) found that TCR sequences showed similarities between tonsils and the periphery. This study shouldbe be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. We agree with the reviewer that peptides should be used for further analysis. Regarding the antigen-specificity recent data demonstrated that GC-Tfh cells are selected by affinity and TCR receptor signaling strength and underly a high clonal competition for space within GC (Merkenschlager et al. Nature 2021, doi: 10.1038/s41586-021-03187-x). Therefore, especially the dominant Tfh clones should be antigen-specific. In addition, the study of Brenna et al. shows that also circulating Tfh cells are antigen-specific and overlap with GC-Tfh clones in tonsils. Both studies were included into the introduction and discussion (page 3, line 59; page 10, line 231 and page 11, line 262)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The article &quot;Receptor repertoires of murine follicular T helper cells reveal shared responses in separate lymph nodes&quot; summarizes the results of a beautiful and technically complex study devoted to the Tfh clonotype dynamics in antigenic response.

TCR sequencing data analysis is out-of date and not sufficiently justified. Instead of</p><p>MiTCR software more recent and customizable MiXCR software should be used. MiTCR was well-known to produce overestimation of diversity in samples, which is detrimental in conjunction with multiplex PCR approach of iRepertoire libraries. At the same time, MiXCR could be optimized for murine samples and multiplex PCR-based DNA libraries and provide adequate error correction. Data engineering is extremely important to check for overamplification in iRepertoire data, filter the cross-contamination between adjacent samples and avoid batch effects such as extensive clonal overlaps in top clonotypes in samples which were sequenced together on MiSeq. Authors should consider re-analysis of raw data with additional attention to batch effects as just considering clonotypes with at least 2 reads as real could be not enough to get a clean dataset. Usually with iRepertoire data you need to look at the suspicious expanded clones in sorted naïve T cells, which represent contamination from adjacent memory samples. With technical and biological replicates you can estimate the level of contamination and discard all clones with this threshold.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these critical comments about our TCR analysis approach. However, many new TCR analysis approaches have been developed and computational comparative studies identified MiTCR as solid choice (Azfal et al. 2019, doi:</p><p>10.1093/bib/bbx111). Additionally, the higher diversity obtained in multiplex PCR enrichmentbased libraries makes sequencing easier compared to usage of 5’RACE based libraries. In this approach it is wanted and it is not problematic to yield high numbers of T cell clonotypes because:</p><p>(1) Due to the number of Tfh cells within GC, the number of Tfh clonotypes is considerable low when compared to entire lymph nodes (see table S1 and table S4). Each GC reaction emerged just in response to Ag or to adjuvant. This excludes the presence of potential false expanded memory T cells among naïve T cells.</p><p>(2) We focused only on dominant Tfh clones. All those TCR sequences below the median of the respective sample were removed. Thus, all clonotypes with 2 reads only do not play a role at all.</p><p>(3) Our data does not focus on the diversity within one sample instead we compared dominant Tfh clonotypes at two tissue sites. In our opinion, using MiTCR and iRepertoire rather strengthen our data due to the high yields of TCR sequences and our finding that the overall diversity decreases in the Ag exposed groups. In addition, a comparative study of computational methods for T-cell receptor sequencing data revealed that MiTCR and MiXCR do not profoundly differ in clonality measures (Azfal et al. 2019, doi: 10.1093/bib/bbx111). To address this point, we included this reference and wrote a paragraph in the discussion (page 10, line 235).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The manuscript contains inconsistent terminology, for example, TRBV segment naming. Axes on plots either lack labels or are incomprehensible in many cases. Therefore, the manuscript needs some editing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment! We edited the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Authors describe that the time points in this study were selected accordingly to the development of experimental autoimmune process, the dynamics of its phenotype and its pathology – e.g. autoantibody deposition at the epidermis-dermis junction. However, it would be interesting to explore earlier processes of Tfh differentiation, competition for the antigen and establishment of the new GC. Do authors have the data on Tfh TCR dynamics in time points 4-14 days post injection of the antigen? The clonal competition could be more apparent and show if lateral lymph nodes develop the response independently. It may happen that in the first days the competition is restricted to lymph node and therefore private, and later the competition is systemic and both contralateral LN exchange large numbers of T cell clones. However this requires a whole set of experiments and may be out of scope of this particular short manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for these appealing suggestions. We performed new experiments and included the TCR analysis of contralateral draining lymph nodes 1d and 3d after priming. We found that the number of dominant T cell clonotypes that are shared between both lymph nodes increased 3d p.i.. (Morisita-Horn-index, Supplemental Figure S2). However, before this at 1d p.i. the number of shared clones between both pln decreased significantly (Jaccard Index, naïve: 0.082 ± 0.02, 1d: 0.053 ± 0.015 (p&lt;0.05) and 3d 0.12 ± 0.01 (p&lt;0.01), n = 3, 2 pln each, Mann-Whitney-U test). It might be that this decrease reflects the recruitment of new naïve T cells into the Ag-exposed lymph nodes before the Agactivated clones start to expand (Figure S2a). Subsequently, those clones that bound with highest affinity and therefore produced the highest number of progenies could distribute between both pln before they differentiate into Tfh cells. We did not include this data into the manuscript because further experiments will be required to answer this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>1.

The usage of sharing metrics in repertoire comparison should be explained in more details. Why a certain sharing index was used, why another edit distance measure is not applicable? Repertoire sharing strongly depends on the size of repertoire, therefore the data cleaning and downsampling needs to be described in details. 18 shared clonotypes and 65 shared clonotypes: are these nucleotide sequences or aminoacid CDR3 sequences? Do they have the same pattern of recombination – is there a match in both TRBV and TRBJ segments used? It's 18 and 65 of 500 clonotypes? Of n clonotypes if sizes of compared repertoires differ?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. We used the term “sharing index” not as a special metrics but just as a simple enumeration of shared Tfh clonotypes between the mice either of the Ag group and or the PBS group as described by Madi et al. 2014, doi:</p><p>10.1101/gr.170753.113. First, all the Tfh clonotypes that were detected once per mouse were assessed by combining all Tfh clonotypes of both contralateral lymph nodes and removing all duplicates. These number of unique Tfh clonotypes were combined from all three mice in each group. Thus, 4 wks after immunization, 7449 and 6445 Tfh clonotypes were unique in all three mice of the Ag1 group or PBS group, respectively. From those, 424 (Ag1) or 244 (PBS) Tfh clonotypes were present in 2 mice and 65 versus 18 in 3 mice of the Ag1 group or PBS group. This data demonstrates that Ag-exposure increases the number of the shared Tfh clonotypes between all mice. For a better clarification we rewrote this paragraph on page 8, line 204 and removed the 2 wks and 7 wks groups on Figure 5. For all other samples, the Morisita-Horn-index were used for quantifying shared clonotypes between the groups. This index considers not only the quantity of clonotypes within one sample but also the frequency with which each clonotype exist. We included an explanation on page 6 line128.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Figure 5. There are no significant changes on the plot, why the name of the figure strongly claims changes over time? Figure 5B. It's not convincing without statistics that TRBV3 is the most prominent gene family which changes frequency after Ag challenge. Moreover, it is certainly not enough without TCR transfection experiments to claim that this TRBV is specific to the Ag1-derived epitopes. These claims should be removed, or additional TCR cloning and specificity confirmation experiments are required.</p></disp-quote><p>Changes in the V/J usage in autoimmune models have been described from other groups before without transfection experiments. In this Figure, we demonstrate that among the Tfh clonotypes that are shared between all three mice especially the percentage of those that bears the TRBV3 gene segment accumulated in the Ag1 group compared to the PBS group (from 16.6% to 33.84%). To make this point clearer, we removed the 2wks and 7wks time points as done for Figure 5A. Due to the fact that only the shared Tfh clonotypes are analyzed statistical analysis is not applicable.
