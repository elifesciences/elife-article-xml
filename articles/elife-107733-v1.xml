with membrane potential. SK2 modulators are in development for the treatment of neurological and cardiovascular diseases, though the mechanisms of pharmacological modulation remain incompletely understood. We determined structures of an SK2–4 chimeric channel in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conformations and in complex with the bee toxin apamin, a small molecule inhibitor, and a small molecule activator. The structures revealed that the S3–S4 linker forms a hydrophobic constriction at the extracellular opening of the pore. Apamin binds to this extracellular constriction and blocks the exit of potassium ions. Furthermore, we identified a structurally related SK2 inhibitor and activator that bind to the transmembrane domains. The compounds exert opposing effects on gating by differentially modulating the conformation of the S6 helices. These results provide important mechanistic insights to facilitate the development of targeted SK2 channel therapeutics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM and electrophysiology reveal the mechanism of SK2 channel modulation by the bee toxin apamin and small molecules, providing insights that enable the rational design of targeted SK2 channel therapeutics.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fundamental to a variety of biological processes, ion channels are an important class of therapeutical targets. Small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa2.x, or SK1, 2, and 3) channels are activated by increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to induce potassium efflux and regulate membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Köhler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bond et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blatz and Magleby, 1986</xref>). In this role, SK1, 2, and 3 mediate cellular excitability and have different but overlapping functions in many cell types including neurons, endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, the SK2 channel regulates synaptic transmission and plasticity, learning and memory, and cardiac action potentials and thus has attracted attention as a potential target for the treatment of neurological and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bond et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammond et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). SK2 activators reduce cellular excitability and are potential therapeutics for alcohol dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hopf et al., 2011</xref>), ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alviña and Khodakhah, 2010</xref>), epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2006</xref>), and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, SK2 inhibitors increase cellular excitability and have been proposed for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Proulx et al., 2015</xref>) and atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diness et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The cryo-EM structure of the related SK4 (KCa3.1, IK) channel provided the first insights into the architecture and mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating for the SK channel family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>). SK4 channels form non-domain swapped tetramers, with each subunit containing six transmembrane helices S1 to S6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Köhler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>). S1–S4 form a voltage-sensor like domain where the S4 helices lack the positively charged residues necessary for voltage sensitivity. The S5 and S6 helices form the potassium pore. Within the potassium pore lies the selectivity filter, a structure unique to potassium channels that is required for rapid and selective conductance of K<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>). Following the S6 helices, there are two intracellular helices (HA and HB) that form the binding site for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein calmodulin (CaM), which acts as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor to gate SK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xia et al., 1998</xref>). The CaM C-lobe is constitutively bound to the HA and HB helices, and upon an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the CaM N-lobe binds to a unique S4–S5 linker, inducing a conformational change in the S6 helices to open the potassium pore and activate the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>).</p><p>SK2 activators described to date bind at the interface of the CaM N-lobe and S4–S5 linker and function by stabilizing this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shim et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, known SK2 inhibitors target the extracellular and/or transmembrane regions and were proposed to function by either direct pore block or negative gating modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2020</xref>). The binding site for the bee venom toxin apamin, a cyclic 18-residue peptide inhibitor, has been mapped to the extracellular loop regions of SK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nolting et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weatherall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamy et al., 2010</xref>). Apamin is of historical importance as it was used to elucidate the physiological role of SK2 and apamin inhibition of SK2 increases neuronal excitability and improves learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blatz and Magleby, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Messier et al., 1991</xref>). Apamin inhibits SK1, 2, and 3 but not 4 and is most potent against SK2 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of ~70 pM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Köhler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuzmenkov et al., 2022</xref>). Functional mutagenesis of apamin identified two arginine residues that are essential for inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vincent et al., 1975</xref>). Mutagenesis experiments on the SK2 channel indicated that residues in the extracellular loops between S3 and S4 (S3–S4 linker) and between S5 and S6 are important for apamin binding and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nolting et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weatherall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamy et al., 2010</xref>). Since the S3–S4 linker is predicted to be distant to the pore, an allosteric mechanism of apamin inhibition rather than a direct pore block has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamy et al., 2010</xref>). Attempts to recapitulate the potency and selectivity of apamin with small molecules resulted in the development of a class of inhibitors, such as UCL1684, that are predicted to have an overlapping binding site with apamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castle et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2000</xref>). These small molecules generally carry two positive charges, which may mimic the two arginine residues in apamin that are essential for inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vincent et al., 1975</xref>). Further characterization of the molecular mechanisms of inhibition by apamin and the small molecule pore blockers is required to understand how the interaction between the S3–S4 linker and the essential arginine residues/positive charges block ion conduction in SK2.</p><p>Another class of small molecule SK2 inhibitors acts as negative gating modulators by shifting the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of activation to higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simó-Vicens et al., 2017</xref>). One such inhibitor, AP31969, is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saljic et al., 2024</xref>). Mutagenesis experiments with the structurally related inhibitor AP14145 suggest that these compounds bind within the pore directly below the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simó-Vicens et al., 2017</xref>). Similar potencies on SK1, 2, and 3 channels have been reported most likely due to the homology of pore lining residues in the SK family. However, selective SK1 inhibitors were developed that take advantage of a unique residue, Ser293, on S5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hougaard et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, only small modifications to this family of inhibitors are sufficient to switch the activity profile from inhibition to activation of SK1. However, it remains unclear how compounds that bind the transmembrane regions of SK channels affect Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating, which is driven by the interaction between CaM and the intracellular domains.</p><p>Despite SK2 being a prominent therapeutic target for both neurological and cardiovascular diseases, no structure of human SK2 has been reported to date. Although the structure of rat SK2 was reported while this manuscript was in preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nam et al., 2025</xref>). To enable high-resolution cryo-EM studies of human SK2, we designed a chimera (SK2–4) that contains the transmembrane and extracellular domains of human SK2 and intracellular domains of human SK4. The structures of the SK2–4/CaM complexes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conformations demonstrate that SK2 and SK4 adopt similar overall architectures and share a similar mechanism for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating. However, unlike SK4, we observed a structured S3–S4 linker that induces a conformational change in the selectivity filter and forms a hydrophobic constriction at the extracellular opening of the SK2 pore. Apamin binds to the extracellular constriction formed by the S3–S4 linker to block potassium efflux. In addition, high-throughput screening and medicinal chemistry optimization efforts yielded a new class of potent SK2 inhibitors that bind to a novel pocket formed by the S5, S6, and pore helices and induce closure of the S6 helices. Structure-guided design efforts enabled switching the activity profile toward activation while retaining the same binding mode. The detailed understanding of two distinct mechanisms of SK2 channel inhibition, extracellular pore block and negative gating modulation, and a new mechanism for channel activation presented here should facilitate the rational design of potent and selective SK2 modulators.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of the SK2–4 chimeric channel</title><p>We attempted to solve the structure of wild-type (WT) human SK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) expressed and purified from mammalian cells in the presence of CaM and Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

SK currents were recorded in the ‘whole-cell’ configuration under voltage clamp where a saturating concentration of a specific SK2 inhibitor was applied at the end of experiment to isolate SK current. Electrophysiological measurements demonstrated that SK2–4 current has a similar reversal potential as WT SK2 and SK4 currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which is near the expected value for a K<sup>+</sup>-selective channel based on the K<sup>+</sup> concentration gradient. To evaluate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation, we measured average SK current amplitude from different cell populations each exposed to a different intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ranging from 0.1 to 20 µM (i.e., each cell population was only tested with an individual free intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration). Like WT SK2 and SK4, the activation of SK2–4 is dependent on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Despite the potential limit in diffusion with the ‘whole-cell’ configuration which precludes the ability to fully control the intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, our results clearly showed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of SK2–4 is higher than that of SK2 but similar to SK4, consistent with the CaM-binding domain of the chimera stemming from SK4. In addition, SK2–4 activity was inhibited by known SK2 inhibitors apamin and AP14145 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.7 nM and 2.4 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

In SK4, Tyr253 hydrogen bonds with a pore helix threonine (Thr247), and the homologous interaction is not observed in SK2–4 due to the rotation of Tyr361. In addition, the backbone carbonyls of Gly360 and Tyr361, which typically form the extracellular K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites one and two, are rotated away from the center of the selectivity filter and the ion conduction path. As a result, only the two intracellular K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites, three and four, are intact and occupied by K<sup>+</sup>.

Therefore, the conformation of the selectivity filter observed in the SK2–4 structure is likely due to the S3–S4 linker, which is disordered in SK4. As discussed above, Asp363 at the C-terminus of the selectivity filter is directed toward the extracellular S3–S4 linker and interacts with Arg240 and Tyr245 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). In SK4, the homologous aspartate (Asp255) is directed toward the pore helix and forms a hydrogen bond with a conserved tryptophan (Trp242) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>). The homologous pore helix tryptophan in SK2, Trp350, adopts a different rotamer and is unable to form a hydrogen bond with Asp363 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The hydrogen-bonding interaction between a pore helix residue (usually Trp or Tyr) and the residue at the C-terminus of the selectivity filter (usually Asp or Asn) is a conserved feature of K<sup>+</sup> selective channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauer et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, inserting this interaction into non-selective channels produces K<sup>+</sup> selective channels with four K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites, while deletion of this interaction from K<sup>+</sup> selective channels produces non-selective channels with two K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derebe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauer et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we propose that by interacting with Asp363 and thereby preventing its interaction with the pore helix Trp350, the S3–S4 linker induces the selectivity filter conformation observed in SK2–4 with two K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites. We predict that the SK1 and 3 selectivity filters could adopt similar conformations with two K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites because the S3–S4 linker residues that interact with Asp363 are conserved among these channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Except for one report indicating significant sodium permeability in rat SK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shin et al., 2005</xref>), studies show that SK2 is K<sup>+</sup> selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Köhler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jäger et al., 2000</xref>).

In this position, apamin blocks the exit of K<sup>+</sup> ions from the extracellular side of the pore to inhibit conduction.</p><p>To probe the interaction between SK2 Phe243 and apamin Arg13 and Arg14, we determined the apamin sensitivity of a Phe243Ala mutant and found it to be insensitive to apamin inhibition up to 3 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), demonstrating the critical role of this interaction for apamin binding and inhibition. Prior mutagenesis of both the S3–S4 linker and the outer pore regions further supports the observed apamin-binding site and proposed mechanism of apamin inhibition. For example, mutation of Ser244 and Tyr245 in the S3–S4 linker reduces the potency of apamin by 10- and 5-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nolting et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weatherall et al., 2011</xref>). Ser244 is within 5 Å of the apamin-binding site and bulky mutations may clash with apamin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Tyr245 hydrogen bonds with Asp363, likely stabilizing the S3–S4 linker conformation for apamin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the outer pore, mutation of His336 decreases sensitivity of SK2 to apamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamy et al., 2010</xref>). As discussed above, this residue also stabilizes the S3–S4 linker conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, the previous mutagenesis experiments decreased but did not fully abolish the potency of apamin as we observed for the Phe243Ala mutation, underscoring that the interaction between apamin and Phe243 is essential.</p><p>Fortuitously, the apamin-bound structure provides some insight into S3–S4 linker dynamics and the potential transition from a closed to open extracellular constriction. Insertion of apamin Arg13 and Arg14 dilates the Phe243 constriction from 1.8 to 3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). Such an S3–S4 linker conformation in the absence of apamin would permit K<sup>+</sup> ion conduction, providing an example of the type of S3–S4 movement required to expand the extracellular constriction. Compared with the apamin-free Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the movement of the S3–S4 linker away from the pore axis upon apamin binding is accompanied by multiple conformational changes in the selectivity filter to adopt the canonical K<sup>+</sup>-selective conformation with four K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites: Arg240 withdraws and frees Asp363 to form a weak hydrogen bond with a rotated Trp350 side chain while Tyr361 in the selectivity filter is rotated 180° and forms a hydrogen bond with Thr355 in the pore helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). Toxin-induced selectivity filter conformational change has also been reported for K<sub>v</sub>1.3 with the sea anemone toxin ShK. However, unlike apamin binding to SK2–4, ShK binds directly to the K<sub>v</sub>1.3 selectivity filter to convert a C-type inactivated conformation to a canonical K<sup>+</sup> selective structure with four coordination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tyagi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Selvakumar et al., 2022</xref>). The change in selectivity filter conformation in apamin-bound SK2–4 seems to be driven instead by the weakening of interactions between the selectivity filter and the S3–S4 linker. Based on the structure of SK2–4 bound to apamin, we hypothesize that in the physiological conductive/dilated state of the extracellular constriction, the S3–S4 linker and Phe243 will withdraw from the pore axis and the selectivity filter will return to the canonical conformation with 4 K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites to maintain the K<sup>+</sup> selectivity demonstrated for SK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Köhler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jäger et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Identification and functional characterization of novel SK2 modulators</title><p>To identify new modulators of SK2, we developed a high-throughput patch clamp assay using CHO cells stably expressing WT human SK2 channels on the Qube instrument (Sophion) (see methods section for details).

Four molecules of compound 1, which is clearly defined by cryo-EM density, were bound per SK2–4 tetramer at the interface of the S5, pore helix, and S6 of each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E</xref>). The benzoxadiazole moiety of compound 1 rests in a hydrophobic pocket lined by Leu321 and Ala325 of S5, Ile352 and Phe356 of the pore helix, and Met381 of S6. In the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free apo conformations of SK2–4/CaM, this pocket is blocked by Leu321 adopting an alternative rotamer conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). The central benzamide moiety is positioned between Trp322 of S5 and Phe356 and Leu357 at the C-terminus of the pore helix. The sulfonamide tail of compound 1 extends toward but does not enter the ion pore, and the sulfonamide nitrogen hydrogen bonds with Ser318 on S5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E</xref>). The methoxyphenyl forms an edge-to-face interaction with Phe356, and the methoxy contacts Thr386 on S6, which is one N-terminal helical turn removed from the intracellular gate at Val390 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The residues that interact with compound 1 are conserved in SK1–3, and thus compound 1 is likely not selective among these isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, for SK4, Thr212 replaces SK2 Ser318, and Trp216 (homologous to SK2 Trp322) is conserved but adopts a different rotamer conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Both changes occlude the compound 1-binding site in SK4 and would likely reduce compound 1 potency on SK4 as observed in the functional data.</p><p>Compared with the ligand-free Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound conformation, there are two significant conformational changes in the structure of SK2–4/CaM bound to compound 1. First, there are slight changes in the position of the S5 and pore helix to accommodate the compound 1 core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These movements translate through Tyr335 and His336 at the extracellular end of S5 to the S3–S4 linker, which is shifted by 1.2 Å in the extracellular direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). In this conformation, the hydrophobic constriction at Phe243 would block ion conduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>); however, non-continuous side chain density and a high b-factor (51 Å<sup>2</sup> compared to 33 Å<sup>2</sup> in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound state) indicate increased Phe243 flexibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Movement of the S3–S4 linker coincides with conformational changes in the selectivity filter similar to those observed with apamin-bound SK2–4 (described above) resulting in a selectivity filter with four K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). This structure further supports the hypothesis that movement of the S3–S4 linker away from the selectivity filter induces a conformation with four K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites.</p><p>The second notable conformational change is in the position of the S6 helices. Structural comparisons demonstrate that the methoxy group of compound 1 would clash with Thr386 on S6 in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound apo conformation of SK2–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To accommodate the methoxy, Thr386 and the portion of the S6 helices C-terminal to Thr386 shift toward the pore axis akin to the S6 helix shift observed in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Concomitantly, the pore radius at the Val390 intracellular gate is reduced to 1.2 Å demonstrating a clear mechanism for channel inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Notably, compound 1 closes the gate at Val390 in the presence of saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, demonstrating that this mechanism of inhibition can override the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating. The importance of the methoxy for inhibition was demonstrated by structurally related compounds 2 and 3, in which the benzoxadiazaole of compound 1 is replaced with a benzothiadiazole isostere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H, I</xref>). Removal of the methoxy from compound 2 produced compound 3 with a 30-fold reduction in potency.</p><p>A previous report identified a pair of structurally related compounds that act as selective SK1 inhibitors and activators. This chemical series requires Ser293 on S5 for activity, which corresponds to Leu321 in SK2, suggesting that the SK1 modulators and compound 1 share the same binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hougaard et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesized that compound 1 analogs lacking the methoxyphenyl, which our structure and functional data demonstrated is important for SK2 inhibition, may activate SK2. Indeed, a focused screen of compound 1 analogs lacking the methoxyphenyl identified compound 4 as an SK2 activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>) which dose-dependently increases SK2 current in the presence of 2 µM intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Like compound 1, compound 4 retains the benzoxadiazole/benzamide core, but the benzamide phenyl features a trifluoromethyl substituent para to the amide. In the 3.1 Å structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound SK2–4 in complex with compound 4, clear cryo-EM density demonstrates that the benzoxadiazole/benzamide core occupies the same pocket as observed for compound 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, the S6 helices are in an open conformation, and the trifluoromethyl interacts with Ile380, which is 2.5 helical turns N-terminal to Val390, on the S6 helix from a neighboring subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>). Structural overlays predict that the trifluoromethyl would clash with Ile380 in the closed conformation of the S6 helices and thereby promote the open conformation to activate SK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Unlike compound 1, compound 4 binding does not induce movement of the S3–S4 linker and the selectivity filter retains a conformation with two K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mechanism of compound 4 activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Activation or inhibition of SK2 channel by compound 4 (orange squares) and compound 1 (magenta squares), respectively.

First, the S3–S4 linker forms an anti-parallel β-turn that extends over the S5–S6 segments and interacts with the extracellular pore loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In this conformation, Phe243 on the S3–S4 linker is positioned directly above the selectivity filter creating a hydrophobic constriction with a radius of 1.8 Å, which prevents the efflux of hydrated K<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). Therefore, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound SK2–4 structure represents a non-conductive conformation even though the intracellular gate is open. Second, the selectivity filter adopts a conformation that resembles non-selective cation channels, such as NaK and HCN, with only two K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This selectivity filter conformation seems to be due to the interaction between Asp363 at the C-terminus of the selectivity filter and residues Arg240 and Tyr245 on the S3–S4 linker. In the related SK4 channel, the homologous aspartate hydrogen bonds with a pore helix tryptophan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which is critical for the formation of a selectivity filter with four K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites observed in all K<sup>+</sup> selective channels to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derebe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauer et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, by sequestering Asp363 and preventing its interaction with Trp350 in the pore helix, the S3–S4 linker likely induces the two K<sup>+</sup> coordination site selectivity filter observed in the apo SK2–4 structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, a similar S3–S4 linker and selectivity filter conformation was observed in the structure of rat SK2, which was published during the preparation of this manuscript, and mutagenesis demonstrated that the interactions between the S3–S4 linker and pore residues induce the observed selectivity filter with two K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nam et al., 2025</xref>). However, this selectivity filter conformation seems to only exist in a non-conductive state of the channel due to the extracellular constriction at Phe243 and thus should not affect the K<sup>+</sup> selectivity observed for SK2 and SK2–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Köhler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derebe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jäger et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The subsequent structures of SK2–4 bound to apamin and compound 1 elucidated how the SK channels maintain K<sup>+</sup> selectivity in the conductive state. Conductivity likely requires movement of the S3–S4 linker and Phe243 away from the pore axis to expand the extracellular constriction. Such a shift was observed upon binding of both apamin and compound 1 and was accompanied by four structural rearrangements: (1) Asp363 no longer hydrogen bonds with Arg240 in the S3–S4 linker, (2) Asp363 reorients toward Trp350 in the pore helix, (3) Trp350 rotates to enable a hydrogen bond with Asp363, and (4) Tyr361 in the selectivity filter rotates 180° and forms a hydrogen bond with Thr355 in the pore helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). These structural changes produce a canonical K<sup>+</sup>-selective selectivity filter with four K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites. Based on these structures, we predict that in a conductive state of SK2, the extracellular constriction dilates to allow for the flow of K<sup>+</sup> ions. Such a movement would weaken the interactions between the S3–S4 linker and selectivity filter, producing a selectivity filter conformation with four K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites to maintain the K<sup>+</sup> selectivity.</p><p>The physiological role of the S3–S4 linker and the mechanism of extracellular constriction opening require further investigation. One possibility is that the S3–S4 linker and extracellular constriction exists in an equilibrium between conductive and non-conductive conformations. Such a mechanism may explain some properties of SK2 that are not observed in SK4, which lacks a structured S3–S4 linker, such as its low conductance (~10 pS) and the ability to switch between low- and high-open probability states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Köhler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, mutation of Phe243 in rat SK2 produced a twofold increase in channel conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nam et al., 2025</xref>). Alternatively, other physiological factors, such as PIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woltz et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) or protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luján et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García-Negredo et al., 2014</xref>), may exist in live cells that modulate the interaction between S3–S4 linker and the selectivity filter. Importantly, the extracellular constriction provides novel opportunities for modulation of SK2.</p><p>The structures and functional experiments presented here revealed two binding sites for SK2 modulators and identified three distinct mechanisms of modulation. The bee toxin apamin binds at the extracellular opening of the pore, at the same site as UCL1684, to a site co-formed by the S3–S4 linker from each subunit, explaining why both the S3–S4 linker and pore residues were found to be important for apamin binding and inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nolting et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weatherall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nam et al., 2025</xref>). The two essential arginine residues (13 and 14) of apamin are directed toward the selectivity filter and form cation–π interactions with the essential S3–S4 linker residue Phe243, blocking K<sup>+</sup> ion efflux and inhibiting conduction. In support of this binding interaction and mechanism of inhibition, a Phe243Ala mutant abolishes apamin inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The elucidated apamin-binding site and mechanism of inhibition may enable development of new modulators that target the extracellular domains of SK2.</p><p>A second partially cryptic binding pocket at the interface of the S5, pore helix, and S6 was revealed through the identification and characterization of compounds 1 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>). This binding pocket interacts with a benzoxadiazole/benzamide core and the functional arm on the benzamide phenyl interacts with the S6 helices to modulate SK2 activity. For compound 1, a sulfonamide methoxyphenyl meta to the amide contacts Thr386 on the S6 helix in the same subunit to induce the closed conformation of the S6 helices and inhibit the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). Conversely, for compound 4, the trifluoromethyl para to the amide contacts Ile380 on the S6 helix from a neighboring subunit to promote the open conformation of the S6 helices and activate the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B, C</xref>). This proposed mechanism of modulation suggests that compound 1 may bind preferentially to the closed conformation of the S6 helices, and compound 4 may bind preferentially to the open conformation of the S6 helices. Further optimization of the functional groups on the benzamide phenyl that interact with S6 helices may produce more potent activators and/or inhibitors. For example, more potent activation may be achieved if the interaction between compound 4 and the neighboring S6 was closer to the intracellular gate at Val390 (i.e., within 1 helical turn). Producing isoform-selective modulators targeting the compound 1/4-binding pocket may prove more challenging due to the high sequence conservation of residues lining the pocket among SK1–3. However, SK1 modulators that are predicted to share the same binding site as compound 1 take advantage of a unique S5 Ser to confer selectivity over SK2 and SK3, suggesting isoform selectivity could be achieved through further optimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hougaard et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this study characterized SK2 channel dynamics as well as mechanisms of pharmacological modulation utilizing a SK2–4 chimera, containing the S1–S6 transmembrane regions of human SK2 and the intracellular domains of human SK4. SK2–4 is K<sup>+</sup>-selective, activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, sensitive to SK2 modulators that bind the S1–S6 transmembrane regions, and suitable for cryo-EM structure determination. The findings revealed critical structural features and mechanisms of SK2 channel modulation, providing a framework for the development of targeted therapeutics for the SK channel family.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construct design</title><p>The amino acid sequences for human SK2 (KCNN2, Uniprot Q9H2S1, 579 amino acids) and human SK4 (KCNN4 Uniprot O15554, 427 amino acids) were used to design the chimeric SK2–4 channel construct.

For pharmacological effects, cells were washed with Ba<sup>2+</sup>-free extracellular buffer containing different concentrations of compounds before SK currents were recorded (a single concentration per well). Leak and non-SK currents were estimated at the end of the experiment with saturating concentration of specific SK inhibitors (10 µM UCL1684,30 µM AP14145, or 10 µM TRAM-34, as needed) and subtracted from average current amplitudes. Average current amplitude after compound from each well was normalized to its before-compound amplitude then normalized to time-matched wells treated with 0.3% DMSO. Normalized values at each concentration (<italic>n</italic> = 4–6 wells) were used to construct dose–response curves, which were fitted with Hill Equation to yield IC<sub>50</sub> values. For Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of SK channels, different amounts of CaCl<sub>2</sub> were added to intracellular buffer to achieve desired levels of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration as calculated with Maxchelator. On a 384-well plate, 24 wells (3 columns) were exposed to intracellular buffer containing one of eight different calculated free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 20 µM. Average SK current amplitudes from 24 wells for each [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] were normalized to the level at 20 µM and plotted against free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to construct the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation curve, which was fitted with the Hill Equation to yield EC<sub>50</sub> values. Note that on the automated high-throughput electrophysiology system, it is only feasible to record current in whole-cell configuration (in contrast to inside-out) in which true intracellular free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] may differ from the calculated values for the bulk intracellular buffers due to incomplete diffusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Counter-screening assays on other ion channels</title><p>Compound effect on hERG channel was tested on the Qube system at 35°C using CHO-K1 cells stably expressing hERG channel. Assay conditions were similar to the SK assay except for buffers and voltage protocol. Extracellular buffer contains (in mM): 145 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH = 7.4 with NaOH. Intracellular buffer contains (in mM): 20 KCl, 120 KF, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH = 7.2 with KOH. hERG channel inhibition was measured by peak tail current level at –50 mV after a 3.5 s long depolarization to 10 mV. Compound effect on hCav1.2 channel was tested on the Qube system at 35°C using CHO-K1 cells expressing hCav1.2 channel (inducible with the T-Rex system). Assay conditions were similar to the SK assay except for buffers and voltage protocol. Extracellular buffer contains (in mM): 145 NaCl, 10 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 4 KCl, pH = 7.4 with NaOH. Intracellular buffer contains (in mM): 112 CsCl, 28 CsF, 2 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 8.2 EGTA, pH = 7.3 with CsOH. Cav1.2 channel inhibition was measured by peak current level at 10 mV depolarization from a –70 mV holding potential. The compound effect on the hKCNQ1 channel was tested on the Qube system at 22°C using CHO-K1 cells stably expressing hKCNQ1 channel. Assay conditions were similar to the SK assay except for the voltage protocol. Extracellular buffer contains (in mM): 130 NaCl, 6 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 40 sucrose, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH = 7.4 with NaOH. Intracellular buffer contains (in mM) 110 K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 8 NaCl, 4.68 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 5 HEDTA, and 4 Mg-ATP added right before experiments, pH = 7.0 with KOH. hKCNQ1 channel inhibition was measured by peak current level at 4 s long depolarization to 50 mV from a –80 mV holding potential. The compound effect on the hNav1.5 channel was tested on the QPatch (Sophion) system at room temperature using CHO-K1 cells stably expressing hNav1.5 channel. QPatch is a different automated electrophysiology system than the Qube and uses 48-well plates. Extracellular buffer contains (in mM): 137 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH = 7.3 with NaOH. Intracellular buffer contains (in mM): 120 CsF, 20 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 10 NaCl, pH = 7.2 with CsOH. hNav1.5 channel inhibition was measured by steady-state peak current level at –10 mV depolarization of 400 ms at 1 Hz from a holding potential of –80 mV. In contrast to Qube assays, compound effect was tested by perfusing individual cells with compounds of increasing concentrations to construct cumulative dose–response curves. All dose–response data points were normalized to time-matched wells/cells treated with DMSO. Dose–response curves were plotted as mean ± SD and fitted with the Hill equation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>DSF assay</title><p>DSF assay was performed in DSF assay buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.005% wt/vol GDN, 0.0005% wt/vol CHS).

As efforts to solve structures of the wild-type hSK2 channel were unsuccessful, the authors engineered a chimera containing the intracellular domain of the SK4 channel, the subtype of SK channel that was successfully solved in a previous study (reference 13). The authors present many new and exciting findings, including opening of an internal gate (similar to SK4), for the first time resolving the S3-S4 linker sitting atop the outer vestibule of the pore and unanticipated plasticity of the ion selectivity filter, and the binding sites for apamin, one new small molecule inhibitor and another small molecule activator. Appropriate functional data are provided to frame interpretations arising from the structures of the chimeric protein; the data are compelling, the interpretations are sound, and the writing is clear. This high-quality study will be of interest to membrane protein structural biologists, ion channel biophysicists, and chemical biologists, and will be valuable for future drug development targeting SK channels.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have done a nice job of revising the manuscript to address the issues raised in the first round of review and I have no further suggestions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107733.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cassell</surname><given-names>Samantha J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Novartis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Weiyan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Novartis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Krautwald</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Novartis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Khoshouei</surname><given-names>Maryam</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Novartis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Basel</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Yan Tony</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Novartis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>Joyce</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Novartis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Wendy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Peukert</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Novartis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Weihofen</surname><given-names>Wilhelm</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Novartis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Whicher</surname><given-names>Jonathan R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Novartis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>The small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel 2 (SK2) is an important drug target for treating neurological and cardiovascular diseases. However, structural information on this subtype of SK channels has been lacking, and it has been diOicult to draw conclusions about activator and inhibitor binding and action in the absence of structural information.</p><p>Here the authors set out to (1) determine the structure of the transmembrane regions of a mammalian SK2 channel, (2) determine the binding site of apamin, a historically important SK2 inhibitor whose mode of action is unclear, and (3) use the structural information to generate a novel set of activators/inhibitors that selectively target SK2.</p><p>The authors largely achieved all the proposed goals, and they present their data clearly.</p><p>Unable to solve the structure of the human SK2 due to excessive heterogeneity in its cytoplasmic regions, the authors create a chimeric construct using SK4, whose structure was previously solved, and use it for structural studies. The data reveal a unique extracellular structure formed by the S2-S3 loop, which appears to directly interact with the selectivity filter and modulate its conductivity. Structures of SK2 in the absence and presence of the activating Ca2+ ions both possess non-K+-selective/conductive selectivity filters, where only sites 3 and 4 are preserved. The S6 gates are captured in closed and open states, respectively. Apamine binds to the S2-S3 loop, and unexpectedly, induces a K+ selective/conductive conformation of the selectivity filter while closing the S6 gate.</p><p>Through high-throughput screening of small compound libraries and compound optimization, the group identified a reasonably selective inhibitor and a related compound that acts as an activator. The characterization shows that these compounds bind in a novel binding site. Interestingly, the inhibitor, despite binding in a site diOerent from that of apamine, also induces a K+ selective/conductive conformation of the selectivity filter while the activator induces a non-K+ selective/conductive conformation and an open S6 gate.</p><p>The data suggest that the selectivity filter and the S6 gate are rarely open at the same time, and the authors hypothesize that this might be the underlying reason for the small conductance of SK2. The data will be valuable for understanding the mechanism of SK2 channel (and other SK subtypes).</p><p>Overall, the data is of good quality and supports the claims made by the authors. However, a deeper analysis of the cryo-EM data sets might yield some important insights, i.e., about the relationship between the conformation of the selectivity filter and the opening of the S6 gate.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted focused 3D classification to identify subsets of particles with the S6 open and the SF in a conductive state but were not able to isolate such a particle class. This indicates that either none or a very small percentage of particles exists in a fully conductive state. This sentence was included in the results section:</p><p>“Focused 3D classification of the S3-S4 linker was unsuccessful in identifying particles subsets with a dilated extracellular constriction suggesting that either none or a very small percentage of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound SK2-4 is in a conductive state”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some insight and discussion about the allosteric networks between the SF and the S6 gate would also be a valuable addition.</p></disp-quote><p>The extracellular constriction is in the same non-conductive conformation in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound and Ca<sup>2+</sup> -free SK2-4 structures suggesting that the conformation of S3-S4 linker/SF and the S6 are not allosterically coupled. We predict that Ca<sup>2+</sup> opens the intracellular gate and another physiological factor (not yet identified) promotes extracellular gate opening. These sentences were added to the results and discussion: “This along with the similar conformation of the S3-S4 linker in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> -bound and Ca<sup>2+</sup> -free states of SK2-4 suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dependent intracellular gate dynamics are not coupled to the conformation of the S3-S4 linker. Other yet to be identified physiological factors may be required to dilate the extracellular constriction.”</p><p>“Alternatively, other physiological factors, such as PIP2[46,47] or protein-protein interactions[48-50], may exist in live cells that modulate the interaction between S3-S4 linker and the selectivity filter.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have used single-particle cryoEM imaging to determine how small-molecule regulators of the SK channel interact with it and modulate their function.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The reconstructions are of high quality, and the structural details are well described.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The electrophysiological data are poorly described. Several details of the structural observations require a mechanistic context, perhaps better relating them to what is known about SK channels or other K channel gating dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended, additional details for electrophysiological data were added to the results, methods, and figure legends for clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The most pressing point I have to make, which could help improve the manuscript, relates to the selectivity filter (SF) conformation. Whether the two ion-bound state of SK2-4 (Figure 4A) represents a non-selective, conductive SF occluded by F243 or represents a C-type inactivated SF, further occluded by F243, is unclear. It would be important to discuss this. Reconstructions of Kv1.3 channels also feature a similar configuration, which has been correlated to its accelerated C-type inactivation.</p></disp-quote><p>Structural overlays of Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound SK2-4, HCN, and C-type inactivated Kv1.3 selectivity filters demonstrate that each have conformational diVerences and it is diVicult to definitively determine if the SK2-4 selectivity filter is in a non-selective conformation like HCN or a C-type inactivated conformation like Kv1.3. Based on the number of ions observed in the filter and the position of Tyr361 we believe the selectivity filter most closely resembles that of HCN. Importantly, the selectivity filter conformation observed in the SK2-4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> -bound and Ca<sup>2+</sup> -free structures is ultimately nonconductive due to the Phe243 extracellular constriction blocking K<sup>+</sup> eVlux.</p><p>A comparison of the SK2-4 selectivity filter to HCN and C-type inactivated Kv1.3 was included in Figure 4 and this sentence was included in the results section:</p><p>“The selectivity filter of SK2-4 resembles that of to HCN in both the position of Tyr361 and the number of K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites (Fig 4E,F,G,H)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, binding of a toxin derivative to Kv1.3 restores the SF into a conductive form, though occluded by the toxin. It appears that apamin binding to SK2-4 might be doing something similar. Although I am not sure whether SK channels undergo C-type inactivation like gating, classical MTS accessibility studies have suggested that dynamics of the SF might play a role in the gating of SK channels. It would be really useful (if not essential) to discuss the SF dynamics observed in the study and relate them better to aspects of gating reported in the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>Extracellular toxin binding to SK2-4 and K<sub>v</sub>1.3 induce a conformational change in the selectivity filter to produce a canonical K<sup>+</sup> selective structure with four coordination sites. However, the mechanism by which the toxins produce the conformational change is diVerent. For SK2-4, apamin interacts primarily with S3-S4 linker residues and induces a shift in the S3-S4 linker away from the pore axis. This in turn prevents the hydrogen bonds between Arg240 and Tyr245 of the S3-S4 linker and Asp363 at the C-terminus of the selectivity filter to produce a selectivity filter conformation with four K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites. For K<sub>v</sub>1.3, the sea anemone toxin ShK binds directly to the C-terminus of the selectivity filter disrupting interactions required for the C-type inactivated structure and thereby inducing the conformational change. These sentences were added to the results:</p><p>“Toxin induced selectivity filter conformational change has also been reported for K<sub>v&lt;/sub 1.3 with the sea anemone toxin ShK. However, unlike apamin binding to SK2-4, ShK binds directly to the Kv 1.3 selectivity filter to convert a C-type inactivated conformation to a canonical K<sup>+</sup> selective structure with four coordination sites [39,40]. The change in selectivity filter conformation in apamin-bound SK2-4 seems to be driven instead by the weakening of interactions between the selectivity filter and the S3-S4 linker.”</sub></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The SF of K channels, in conductive states, are usually stabilized by an H-bond network involving water molecules bridged to residues behind the SF (D363 in the down-flipped conformation and Y361). Considering the high quality of the reconstructions, I would suspect that the authors might observe speckles of density (possibly in their sharpened map) at these sites, which overlap with water molecules identified in high-resolution X-ray structures of KcsA, MthK, NaK, NaK2K, etc. It could be useful to inspect this region of the density map.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe strong density near Y361 or D363 that could be confidently model as water. However, in the structures of SK2-4 bound to apamin and compound 1 Tyr361 in the selectivity filter rotates 180° and forms a hydrogen bond with Thr355 in the pore helix. The homologous hydrogen bond is also observed in SK4 and the conductive/ K<sup>+</sup> selective selectivity filter conformation of Kv1.3. The rotation of Tyr361 to form a hydrogen bond with Thr355, reorientation of Asp363 and Trp350 into hydrogen bonding position, and the presence of four K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites upon binding of apamin and compound 1 strongly suggest that the selectivity filter is in a K<sup>+</sup> selective/conductive conformation. The Tyr361/Thr355 hydrogen bond is now described in the paper and shown in Figures 4D, 5D, and S6F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This is a fundamentally important study presenting cryo-EM structures of a human small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK2) channel in the absence and presence of calcium, or with interesting pharmacological probes bound, including the bee toxin apamin, a small molecule inhibitor, and a small molecule activator. As eOorts to solve structures of the wild-type hSK2 channel were unsuccessful, the authors engineered a chimera containing the intracellular domain of the SK4 channel, the subtype of SK channel that was successfully solved in a previous study (reference 13). The authors present many new and exciting findings, including opening of an internal gate (similar to SK4), for the first time resolving the S3-S4 linker sitting atop the outer vestibule of the pore and unanticipated plasticity of the ion selectivity filter, and the binding sites for apamin, one new small molecule inhibitor and another small molecule activator. Appropriate functional data are provided to frame interpretations arising from the structures of the chimeric protein; the data are compelling, the interpretations are sound, and the writing is clear. This high-quality study will be of interest to membrane protein structural biologists, ion channel biophysicists, and chemical biologists, and will be valuable for future drug development targeting SK channels.</p><p>The following are suggestions for strengthening an already very strong and solid manuscript:</p><p>(1) It would be good to include some information in the text of the results section about the method and configuration used to obtain electrophysiological data and the limitations.

C-type inactivation of the filter in Shaker was seen in 150 mM K using the W434F mutant (PMC8932672) or in 4 mM K for the WT channel (PMC8932672), and similar results have been reported for Kv1.2 (PMC9032944; PMC11825129) and for Kv1.3 (PMC9253088; PMC8812516) channels. For Kv1.3, C-type inactivation occurs even in 150 mM K (PMC9253088; PMC8812516). Not unlike what is seen here with apamin, binding of the sea anemone toxin (ShK) with a Fab attached (or the related dalazatide) inserts a Lys into the selectivity filter and stabilizes the conducting conformation of Kv1.3 even though the Lys depletes occupancy of S1 by potassium (PMC9253088; PMC8812516). Or might the conformation of the filter be controlled by regulatory processes in SK2 channels? I think connecting the dots here would enhance the impact of this study, even if it remains relatively speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to reviewer 2’s comments for a comparison of the selectivity filter structure between SK2-4 and C-type inactivated K<sub>v</sub>1.3 and a discussion of toxin induced selectivity filter conformational change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is known about how the functional properties of SK2 channels (where the filter changes conformation) diOer from SK4, where the filter remains conducting (reference 13)?
