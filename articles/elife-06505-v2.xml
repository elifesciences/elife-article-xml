Because CRL activity is dependent upon NEDD8, Cif blocks ubiquitin dependent trafficking of Perforin-2 and thus, its bactericidal activity. Collectively, these studies further underscore the biological significance of Perforin-2 and elucidate critical molecular events that culminate in Perforin-2-dependent killing of both intracellular and extracellular, cell-adherent bacteria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06505.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06505.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06505.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A wide range of bacteria and other microbes can infect animals and cause disease. Throughout evolution, these microbes and their hosts have been fighting never ending arms races in which the microbes deploy ever more elaborate weapons, while the hosts adapt to defend themselves. An animal's first line of defense is provided by its ‘innate’ immune system. This system is activated by the general features of microbial cells; for example, the molecules that make up the walls surrounding most bacteria. Microbes must defeat the innate immune system in order to cause disease, and ultimately to spread from one host to the next.</p><p>One component of innate immunity is a protein called Perforin-2 that is present in most, if not all, animal cells. This protein forms pores on bacterial cells, causing them to split open and die. However, it was not clear how Perforin-2 is switched on and what, if anything, bacteria do to counteract it. To address these questions, McCormack et al. infected human and mice cells with bacteria that cause serious diseases of the digestive tract.</p><p>The experiments show that when animal cells detect bacteria, or merely a fragment of their cell wall, a specific group of proteins, called the CRL complex, attaches a molecule called ubiquitin to Perforin-2. Ubiquitin works much like the shipping label of a package, enabling the efficient targeting of Perforin-2 to the invading bacteria. McCormack et al. also show that some bacteria use a protein called a cell cycle inhibiting factor (or Cif for short) to inhibit the CRL complex. This blocks the ubiquitin labeling of Perforin-2, which renders it a useless weapon that can no longer be directed towards bacteria.</p><p>Mice that are infected with a bacterium called <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> become seriously unwell and often die. However, McCormack et al. found that mice infected with mutant <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> that lacked Cif remained healthy. Also, mice that lacked Perforin-2 are highly susceptible to infectious diseases. McCormack et al.'s findings reveal how Perforin-2 is activated during the innate immune response and how some bacteria can defeat this pivotal defense. In the current age of antibiotic resistant bacteria, these studies may spur the development of new drugs that restore or increase the activity of Perforin-2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) regulate numerous cellular processes including signal transduction, gene expression, development, and cell cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosu and Kipreos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>). CRLs are modular complexes that are assembled from a profusion of subunits. However, most share a similar architecture. At the core of each lies an elongated cullin upon which other CRL subunits assemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosu and Kipreos, 2008</xref>). Adaptor molecules bind to the cullin's extended amino-terminal domain and are themselves bound by receptors that provide substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardozo and Pagano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lydeard et al., 2013</xref>). The RING subunit binds to the cullin's globular carboxy-terminal domain and acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for recruiting the complex's ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2). The placement of the substrate and E2 at opposite ends of the elongated cullin translates into a separation of ∼50 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merlet et al., 2009</xref>). This gap prohibits ubiquitylation of the substrate. This problem is solved by an additional E2 enzyme, such as UBC12, that conjugates NEDD8, an 8.6 kDa member of the ubiquitin family of proteins (UniProt entry Q15843, Pfam identifier PF00240), to a conserved lysine within the carboxy-terminal domain of the cullin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>). Cullin neddylation induces a conformational change that places the ubiquitin E2 and substrate in sufficient proximity for ubiquitylation to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saha and Deshaies, 2008</xref>). Thus, CRL-dependent ubiquitylation of a protein substrate is itself dependent upon cullin neddylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morimoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sakata et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Cycle inhibiting factors (Cifs) are bacterial effector proteins that inactivate CRLs through deamidation of NEDD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crow et al., 2012</xref>). They are delivered to the cytosol of eukaryotic cells by type III secretion systems of some Gram-negative pathogens including <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> and enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marches et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charpentier and Oswald, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jubelin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taieb et al., 2011</xref>). Upon entering the cytosol Cifs proceed to deamidate Gln40 of NEDD8 thus producing a Glu residue at that position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui et al., 2010</xref>). Because CRL activity is dependent upon NEDD8, this enzymatic modification prevents the ubiquitylation of CRL substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marches et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saha and Deshaies, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Toro et al., 2013</xref>). The discovery of Cif and elucidation of its enzymatic mechanism can be traced back to initial reports that certain pathogens cause cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Rycke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nougayrede et al., 2001</xref>). It is now known that Cif causes the accumulation of cell cycle inhibitors by blocking their ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marches et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taieb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Samba-Louaka et al., 2008</xref>). It has been proposed that Cif mediated cell cycle arrest provides enteric pathogens, such as EPEC and <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, with a stable platform by decreasing the turnover rate of intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Samba-Louaka et al., 2009</xref>). In theory this mechanism could promote colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. Although this is certainly a well reasoned hypothesis, to the best of our knowledge it remains untested. In addition, CRLs regulate diverse cellular processes. Although the majority of these processes probably have no role in limiting pathogen virulence, others may. Therefore, it is not yet known how the deamidation of NEDD8 by Cif contributes to pathogenicity.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that Perforin-2 (macrophage-expressed gene 1; MPEG1) is an effector of the innate immune system that limits the proliferation and spread of medically relevant Gram-negative, -positive, and acid fast bacteria. For example, expression of Perforin-2 in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) is associated with the killing of intracellular <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar <italic>Typhimurium</italic> (hereafter <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>), methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Mycobacterium avium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCormack et al., 2013b</xref>). Moreover, siRNA knockdown of Perforin-2 expression abolished the ability of MEFs to destroy intracellular bacteria unless the siRNA transfected cells were also complemented with a siRNA resistant Perforin-2-RFP expression plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCormack et al., 2013b</xref>). More recently, knockdown of Perforin-2 allowed <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, an obligate intracellular pathogen that normally replicates within epithelial cells, to proliferate within mammalian macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fields et al., 2013</xref>). In vivo, Perforin-2 is critical for protection against MRSA and <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36a">McCormack et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Additional studies by McCormack et al. suggest that Perforin-2 has a primary role in the destruction of bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36a">McCormack et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, Perforin-2 remains a poorly characterized molecule. To address this deficiency, we sought to characterize the molecular events required for the activation and deployment of Perforin-2 through a variety of in vitro and in vivo infection models. In this study we show that Perforin-2 is ubiquitylated by a CRL complex containing CUL1 and βTrCP in response to infectious bacteria or pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as LPS. Ubiquitylation triggers a rapid reorganization of Perforin-2-RFP within the cytosol and is absolutely required for its bactericidal activity. Due to its ability to inactivate CRLs, the bacterial effector protein Cif blocks ubiquitylation of Perforin-2 and its subsequent redistribution within infected cells. This blockade prevents Perforin-2-dependent killing of bacteria in vitro. In vivo, wild-type <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> is significantly more virulent than a <italic>cif</italic> mutant. This difference was not observed with Perforin-2 deficient mice which succumb to an otherwise non-lethal dose of either wild-type or Cif<sup>−</sup> bacteria. With regards to pathogenicity, these latter results suggest that the inhibition of Perforin-2-dependent killing is the primary function of Cif.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Perforin-2 is ubiquitylated and co-immunoprecipitates with components of a CRL complex</title><p>Perforin-2 contains an amino-terminal membrane attack complex perforin (MACPF) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This domain is also present in the pore-forming components of complement and Perforin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Podack and Tschopp, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dennert and Podack, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Podack and Dennert, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiScipio et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lichtenheld et al., 1988</xref>). Moreover, crystallographic studies of MACPF domains have revealed structural similarities to bacterial pore-forming CDCs (cholesterol dependent cytolysins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosado et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Slade et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Law et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the presence of a MACPF domain within Perforin-2 suggests that it may also have the ability to form lytic pores. This hypothesis is supported by the recovery of Perforin-2 from bacteria and images of pores with an average diameter of 100 Å in lipid membranes of mammalian cells expressing Perforin-2 and bacterial cell walls exposed to Perforin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36a">McCormack et al., 2015</xref>). The MACPF domain of Perforin-2 is immediately followed by a domain of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We have dubbed this domain the Perforin-2 (P2) domain because it has been conserved throughout evolution in Perforin-2 orthologs and is only associated with the MACPF domain of Perforin-2. Although the function of the Perforin-2 domain remains to be elucidated, its conservation suggests that it is essential. The presence of a putative transmembrane alpha helix is an additional feature that distinguishes Perforin-2 from Perforin-1 and the pore-forming components of complement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Topological modeling and sequence analyses indicate that Perforin-2 is a type I transmembrane protein with a relatively short carboxy–terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCormack et al., 2013b</xref>). The localization of Perforin-2 to vesicles staining with markers for endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, early endosomes, and plasma membrane is consistent with this prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36a">McCormack et al., 2015</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06505.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain organization of human C8a, C9, Perforin-1, and Perforin-2.</title><p>The pore forming components of complement (C8α and C9), Perforin-1, and Perforin-2 all contain membrane attack complex perforin (MACPF) domains and amino-terminal signal peptides (SPs). MACPF domains are also present in other components of complement (C6, C7, and C8β). The presence of a MACPF domain within Perforin-2 suggest that it is also a mediator of innate immunity. Unlike C6-C9 and Perforin-1, Perforin-2 is predicted to be an integral membrane protein because it alone contains a membrane spanning alpha helix (TM) followed by a short cytosolic tail. An additional distinguishing feature of Perforin-2 is the P2 domain which is of unknown function but conserved amongst Perforin-2 orthologs.

This topology would also place Perforin-2's 40 amino acid long carboxy-terminal domain in the cytosol. Therefore, we hypothesized that regulatory proteins may interact with the carboxy-terminal domain of Perforin-2 to govern its bactericidal activity. To identify these proteins we used Perforin-2's carboxy-terminal domain as bait for macrophage-expressed gene products in a yeast two-hybrid system and identified UBC12 as a Perforin-2-interacting protein.

The molecular mechanism of this effect is undoubtedly the blockade of NEDD8-dependent ubiquitylation of Perforin-2 by Cif, as suggested by our in vitro studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Monoubiquitylation of Perforin-2 signals its cellular redistribution</title><p>Having determined that ubiquitylation is necessary for Perforin-2 activity, we next sought to determine the number of and linkages between ubiquitin monomers as these properties determine the fate of ubiquitylated proteins. For example, polyubiquitylation through K48 linkages target proteins for degradation by the proteasome while K63 polyubiquitylation is often involved in cell signaling. Alternatively, ubiquitylation may terminate after the addition of a single ubiquitin molecule to the target protein. This is termed monoubiquitylation and typically serves as a sorting signal that directs the modified protein to one or more subcellular compartments. To determine the type of Perforin-2 ubiquitylation we probed Perforin-2-GFP immunoprecipitates with a linkage independent ubiquitin antibody (P4D1) as well as antibodies specific for K48 and K63 polyubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Consistent with previous results, the P4D1 antibody recognized Perforin-2-GFP immunoprecipitated from transfected knockout MEFs that were stimulated with IFN-γ and LPS. Ubiquitylation was not detected in the absence of LPS. In addition, MLN4924, a small molecule that inhibits cullin neddylation, also blocked LPS stimulated ubiquitylation of Perforin-2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>). This latter result provides additional confirmation that Perforin-2 is ubiquitylated by a CRL complex. We estimate that ubiquitylation increases the mass of Perforin-2-GFP by ≤10 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given that ubiquitin has a mass of 8.5 kDa, this suggest that Perforin-2-GFP is monoubiquitylated. Since Perforin-2-GFP is a 105 kDa molecule, this relatively small increase in its mass also explains why mass shifts are not apparent on gels of less resolution; for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Consistent with monoubiquitylation, antibodies specific for K48 or K63 polyubiquitylation did not recognize ubiquitylated Perforin-2-GFP (data not shown). Although other forms of polyubiquitylation through K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, or M1 linkages—in addition to chains of mixed linkages—are also possible, polyubiquitylation is inconsistent with the small increase in the mass of Perforin-2-GFP. This suggests monoubiquitylation serves as a sorting signal that directs Perforin-2 to a specific compartment within the cell or location on the plasma membrane.<fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06505.014</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Perforin-2 is monoubiquitylated.</title><p><italic>Mpeg1</italic> knockout MEFs were transfected with GFP or Perforin-2-GFP expression plasmids and stimulated with IFN-γ in the presence or absence of LPS.

Although we initially identified an interaction between UBC12 and Peforin-2 in a yeast two-hybrid screen, this result is rather curious as this NEDD8 conjugating enzyme is not thought to directly interact with CRL substrates. Thus, it is not clear if our initial two-hybrid hit reflects a bona fide or fortuitous interaction. Nevertheless, we subsequently demonstrated that Perforin-2 coimmunoprecipitates CUL1, UBC12, and βTrCP from lysates of mammalian cells. As an F-box substrate receptor, βTrCP may provide the primary and specific interaction between Perforin-2 and the CRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>). It is also likely that phosphorylation of Perforin-2 precedes its ubiquitylation because βTrCP has been shown to recognize phosphorylated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winston et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strack et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2003</xref>).

F-box proteins such as βTrCP, which we have shown interacts with Perforin-2, provide substrate specificity within the multisubunit complex. Because βTrCP is known to recognize phosphorylated substrates, it is likely that TLR signaling activates one or more kinases that phosphorylate Perforin-2 prior to its association with the CRL. SKP1 serves as an adaptor between βTrCP and the cullin scaffold. An ubiquitin E2 ligase and a RING protein—either RBX1 or 2—dock at the opposite end of the elongated cullin. The E1 enzyme NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) activates NEDD8. The E2 ligase UBC12 then covalently binds NEDD8 to CUL1.

Thus, we conclude that PAMPs trigger CRL-dependent monoubiquitylation of Perforin-2's cytosolic domain. As described below, this conclusion is further supported by our studies with the bacterial effector protein Cif. Mutagenesis of conserved lysines within Perforin-2's carboxy-terminus also prevented its ubiquitylation and abolished its bactericidal activity. We have also shown that these mutations prevent the cellular redistribution of Perforin-2 in response to LPS. Likewise, we have shown that Cif blocks Perforin-2 trafficking. Because the destruction of bacteria involves a direct interaction between Perforin-2 and a bacterium, the inability of a cell to route Perforin-2 abolishes its bactericidal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36a">McCormack et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Perforin-2 was originally identified as a potential marker of mature macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spilsbury et al., 1995</xref>). However its expression is not limited to professional phagocytes. In human and murine cells, including non-immune cells, the expression of Perforin-2 can be induced by interferons or intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fields et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCormack et al., 2013b</xref>). The gene encoding Perforin-2 is evolutionarily ancient and is present in all but one species of bony vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Angelo et al., 2012</xref>). As with mammalian Perforin-2, infectious bacteria also induce the expression of a Perforin-2 ortholog (MPEG1.2) in zebrafish. Although ubiquitylation was not investigated, upregulation of MPEG1.2 has been shown to require NFκB and the TLR adaptor MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benard et al., 2014</xref>). In non-vertebrate species the expression of Perforin-2 orthologs is constitutive in some tissues and/or inducible by pathogenic bacteria or LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kemp and Coyne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bathige et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to similar patterns of expression, the function of Perforin-2 is also conserved across species. For example, Perforin-2 has been shown to limit the burden of <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> and <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benard et al., 2014</xref>). Additional studies indicate that Perforin-2 orthologs provide similar bactericidal activity in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kemp and Coyne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bathige et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Because Perforin-2 has broad bactericidal activity, is expressed in a variety of cell types and tissues, and is evolutionarily ancient, it is likely that evolution has endowed bacterial pathogens with novel strategies to defeat Perforin-2. In this study we have identified the bacterial effector protein Cif as one such example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14C</xref>). We have shown that Cif blocks ubiquitylation and trafficking of Perforin-2. This blockade prevents Perforin-2 from reaching the bacterium and explains how Cif inhibits Perforin-2-dependent killing in vitro and enhances pathogenicity in vivo. These properties are abolished by a mutation in the catalytic site of Cif<sub>Yp</sub>. An equivalent mutation has been previously shown to abolish the deamidase activity of Cif<sub>Ec</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marches et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hsu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jubelin et al., 2009</xref>). Because we have also demonstrated that the bactericidal activity of Perforin-2 is dependent upon its ubiquitylation by a CRL complex, we can conclude that Cif abolishes the bactericidal activity of Perforin-2 through deamidation of NEDD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14C</xref>). Moreover, the absence of Perforin-2 in <italic>Mpeg1</italic> knockout mice negated the benefit of Cif in vivo. Similar results were observed by siRNA knockdown of Perforin-2 expression in vitro. These results indicate that the inactivation of Perforin-2 is not a secondary or ancillary function of Cif. Rather, our results demonstrate that Cif enhances virulence primarily through inactivation of Perforin-2 as opposed to other mechanisms such as reduced turn-over of epithelial cells. Although Cif is the first definitive example of a bacterial product that blocks the bactericidal activity of Perforin-2, it is likely that others remain to be discovered.</p><p>Our observation that Cif blocks monoubiquitylation of Perforin-2 and its trafficking within the cell is consistent with other transmembrane proteins for which monoubiquitylation is known to serve as a sorting signal directing their subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hicke and Dunn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>). In our accompanying manuscript we provide evidence that suggest Perforin-2 polymerizes and forms pores on bacteria adherent to the plasma membrane or within the endosomal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36a">McCormack et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we propose a model in which monoubiquitylation of Perforin-2 initiates its trafficking towards bacteria at either location to facilitate Perforin-2-dependent destruction of bacterial pathogens. We also observed that the MACPF and P2 domains of Perforin-2 are cleaved from its transmembrane and cytosolic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36a">McCormack et al., 2015</xref>). Although it is not yet known when cleavage occurs within the Perforin-2-dependent killing pathway, cleavage may explain the lack of colocalization of Perforin-2-RFP and Cif<sup>−</sup> bacteria in confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). Although bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> and EPEC block the critical event—ubiquitylation—that initiates the trafficking of Perforin-2 to its final destination, other pathogens may target events further upstream or downstream of ubiquitylation in order to preserve their cellular integrity and flourish.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and bacterial organisms</title><p>RAW 264.7 (TIB-71), CMT93 (CCL-223), Caco-2 (HTB-37) cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA.

Targeted clones were screened by PCR. From 90 clones, 2 positive clones were selected that had undergone homologous recombination and were identified through Southern blot analysis. One ES clone was utilized for the generation of chimeric mice by injection using C57Bl/6J blastocysts as the host. The resulting female chimeras were further mated with C57Bl/6J male mice for germ line transmission. The heterozygous mice (F<sub>1</sub> mice) were interbred to obtain wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous littermates (F<sub>2</sub>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We agree that this is an interesting story that is well told, but could benefit from additional experiments to better define the mechanism and from more modest claims.</p><p>1) The authors need to tone down some of their claims, such as the following:</p><p>a) Abstract – starting statement: “Perforin-2 (MPEG1) is a principal mediator of vertebrate innate immunity that efficiently eliminates pathogenic bacteria from infected cells”;</p><p>b) Abstract – second statement: “Given the potent bactericidal activity of Perforin-2, bacterial pathogens must block its activation or otherwise circumvent its bactericidal activity in order to survive and cause disease”. It is not proven that P-2 on its own is bactericidal;</p><p>c) Abstract – concluding statement: “These studies illustrate that Perforin-2 is central in the evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen”;</p><p>d) Impact statement – “The survival and proliferation of enteric bacterial pathogens is dependent upon inactivation of Perforin-2”. This is an overstatement since they have only shown this for one pathogen;</p><p>e) The relative importance of Prf-2 compared to other mechanisms of innate immunity and bacterial defense is unclear. Moreover Prf-2 may work in conjunction with known defenses (i.e. the statement in the third paragraph of the Introduction that P-2 is not ancillary to other mechanisms is unproven).</p><p>2) Ubiquitin is 8.5 kDa. Every western blot that shows ubiquitination of P2 does not show any band shift compared to the inactive/un-ubiquitylated form. What is the explanation?</p><p>3) Cul1 and UBC12 (E3 and E2 ligases) would polyubiquitylate the cell cycle inhibitors to degrade them. Do they also polyubiquitylate P-2? If so why is it not degraded? Do proteasome inhibitors have an effect on bacterial killing? If it is monoubiquitylation on P-2 what makes the Ubi-ligase switch from poly-Ubi on cell cycle inhibitors to mono-Ubi on P-2? Is it neddylation or ubquitylation that is important? E3s give substrate specificity to Ubi-ligases. It is hard to understand the same E3 ligase Cul1 recognizes such diverse substrates.

It is not proven that P-2 on its own is bactericidal;</italic></p><p><italic>c) Abstract – concluding statement: “These studies illustrate that Perforin-2 is central in the evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen”;</italic></p><p><italic>d) Impact statement – “The survival and proliferation of enteric bacterial pathogens is dependent upon inactivation of Perforin-2”. This is an overstatement since they have only shown this for one pathogen;</italic></p><p><italic>e) The relative importance of Prf-2 compared to other mechanisms of innate immunity and bacterial defense is unclear. Moreover Prf-2 may work in conjunction with known defenses (i.e. the statement in the third paragraph of the Introduction that P-2 is not ancillary to other mechanisms is unproven).</italic></p><p>We have revised our manuscript and impact statement rhetoric accordingly.</p><p><italic>2) Ubiquitin is 8.5 kDa. Every western blot that shows ubiquitination of P2 does not show any band shift compared to the inactive/un-ubiquitylated form. What is the explanation?</italic></p><p>We now show that Perforin-2 is monoubiquitylated. Since Perforin-2-GFP is 105 kDa, monoubiquitylation increases its mass by a mere 7%. On some gels this small increase is not apparent. However, a band shift is readily apparent in newly added figures showing gels that have been run considerably longer than before. We have also noted the apparent discrepancy in our revised text (please see the subsection “Monoubiquitylation of Perforin-2 signals its cellular redistribution”).</p><p><italic>3) Cul1 and UBC12 (E3 and E2 ligases) would polyubiquitylate the cell cycle inhibitors to degrade them. Do they also polyubiquitylate P-2? If so why is it not degraded? Do proteasome inhibitors have an effect on bacterial killing?</italic></p><p>In our revised manuscript we show that Perforin-2 is monoubiquitylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). We also show that ubiquitylation is required for the trafficking of Perforin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12 fig13">Figures 12, 13</xref>). Based upon this new data and analyses, it is unlikely that the proteasome is involved in regulating Perforin-2 activity.</p><p><italic>If it is monoubiquitylation on P-2 what makes the Ubi-ligase switch from poly-Ubi on cell cycle inhibitors to mono-Ubi on P-2?</italic></p><p>This is an interesting mechanistic question. However, the mono/poly determinant does not appear to be well understood within the CRL field and is beyond the scope of our current study.</p><p><italic>Is it neddylation or ubquitylation that is important?</italic></p><p>They are both equally important. Perforin-2 activity/trafficking is dependent upon ubiquitylation by a CRL. The activity of the CRL is dependent upon neddylation. Greater clarity is provided by a new summary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>) that outlines the key mechanistic steps in the Perforin-2 dependent killing pathway.</p><p><italic>E3s give substrate specificity to Ubi-ligases. It is hard to understand the same E3 ligase Cul1 recognizes such diverse substrates.</italic></p><p>Technically it is substrate receptors, such as bTrCP, that provide substrate specificity. A conserved domain within substrate receptors, the F-box, allows them to interact – often through adaptors – with cullins. In this way a large repertoire of substrate receptors may interact with a small number of cullins. Previously we did not sufficiently explain these somewhat complicated systems. This deficiency is addressed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref> and elsewhere within the text as appropriate.</p><p><italic>In the accompanying manuscript, the authors hint that proteolytic cleavage of Prf-2 to release the active domain from the membrane may be the mechanism of Prf-2 activation – can a change in membrane localization/MW of Prf-2 be shown to be dependent on ubiquitylation?</italic></p><p>In our accompanying manuscript we show that Perforin-2 is cleaved and map the approximate cleavage sites. Moreover, the cleavage products are associated with bacteria. These new findings are discussed within our revised manuscript (Discussion). In future studies we will determine if cleavage occurs before or after ubiquitylation. However, we do demonstrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12 fig13">Figure 12, 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2">Video 1, 2</xref> that Perforin-2 relocalization is dependent on ubiquitylation.</p><p><italic>4) It has not been demonstrated what ubiquitylation of Perforin-2 does exactly, besides correlating with bactericidal function: does it affect relocalization within the cell, proteolytic processing, etc.? These studies are simple to perform (confocal, as performed in the accompanying paper, or sequencing of native, activated Perforin-2 to determine whether it has been proteolytically processed) and would make the paper stronger.</italic></p><p>The suggested studies have been added to our revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12 fig13">Figures 12 and 13</xref>). We can now state definitively that ubiquitylation is necessary for the relocalization of Perforin-2.</p><p><italic>5) Is perforin-2 being routed to proteasomal degradation? Or is this K63 signaling?</italic></p><p>Neither. Newly added data shows that Perforin-2 is monoubiquitylated and that monoubiquitylation serves as a routing signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11 fig12 fig13">Figures 11, 12, 13</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) The EPEC strain E2438/69 in the subsection “Cell culture and bacterial organisms” and elsewhere in the manuscript is presumably E2348/69 (reverse 3 and 4), which is the prototypic EPEC strain used in the last 30 years.</italic></p><p><italic>In addition, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>legend, the strain designation of E2438/69 (</italic>cif::IS<italic>) is not defined anywhere. Presumably this is the wild type E2348/69 (not E2438) which has a naturally occurring mutation in the</italic> cif <italic>gene. Or could it be that a</italic> cif <italic>mutation was deliberately made by insertion of an IS element?</italic></p><p>This was a typo. As indicated by the reviewers the correct strain name is E2348/69. As per Marches et al., this strain harbors a natural IS within <italic>cif</italic>. We have revised our figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figure 5, 6</xref>) and text for clarity.</p><p><italic>7) CRL activity is cell cycle-regulated by neddylation. Does that mean P-2 activity is also cell cycle regulated? P-2 needs to be ubiquitylated by CRL to get active? Does that have any effect on the host cell cycle?</italic></p><p>We do not believe that the first sentence is entirely correct. Rather, it is our understanding from the literature that a CRL regulates cell cycling and not the other way around. The ability of the CRL to recognize its substrate, via a F-box substrate receptor, is often dependent upon substrate modification, such as phosphorylation. In either case, we have no evidence that Perforin-2 is cell cycle regulated.</p><p><italic>8) The KO mice need to be backcrossed into the background strain for multiple generations in order to be certain that differences in background aren't responsible for the effects attributed to P-2. This is a standard requirement for KO experiments.</italic></p><p>In our initial study the Perforin-2 mutation was backcrossed 7-10 times, a point that is now made clear (subsecton “Generation of Mpeg1 knockout mice”). However, we agree that is not sufficient to remove doubts as per the cause of the phenotype. Therefore we now include additional animal studies with genetically pure 129X1/SvJ mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9 D-F</xref>). The results with these new mice are similar to those previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9 A-C</xref>). Therefore we are confident that the reported phenotypes are due to Perforin-2 deficiency and not the result of passenger mutations or differences between strains.</p><p><italic>9) It is unclear why, in the in vivo infectious studies, there is a discrepancy between fecal shedding CFUs (Figure 8–figure supplement 1) and the CFU counts associated with the intestine (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><italic>Figure 10</italic></xref><italic>). In the intestinal counts (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref><italic>), there are significant differences in the CFUs of the wild type and</italic> cif <italic>mutant strains in the P2 +/+ and P2 +/- mouse strains. But no differences are seen between the strains in the fecal counts. Were fecal counts tested only at 12 hours post infection while bacteria associated with the intestine counted 10 days post infection? If so, then the data in Figure 8–figure supplement 1 showing no difference in fecal shedding may be misleading. In any event, this difference should be discussed.</italic></p><p>The discrepancy is indeed due to timing – fecal pellets were collected 12 hours post inoculation while organ loads were done at day 10. We agree that the fecal shedding at 12 hours is confusing and in retrospect, the data is unnecessary. As such, we have removed it from our revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) Please explain for the non-specialized reader what is NEDD8.</italic></p><p>We have added “the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8” to our Abstract.
