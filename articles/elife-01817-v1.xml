sheet, while large scale cell movements occur across the entire embryo. In amniote (reptiles, birds, mammals) embryos, the deep layers arise by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) at a morphologically stable midline structure, the primitive streak (PS). We know very little about how these events are controlled or how the PS is maintained despite its continuously changing cellular composition. Using the chick, we show that isolated EMT events and ingression of individual cells start well before gastrulation. A Nodal-dependent ‘community effect’ then concentrates and amplifies EMT by positive feedback to form the PS as a zone of massive cell ingression. Computer simulations show that a combination of local cell interactions (EMT and cell intercalation) is sufficient to explain PS formation and the associated complex movements globally across a large epithelial sheet, without the need to invoke long-range signalling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01817.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01817.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01817.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A key process during the development of an embryo involves a single layer of cells reorganizing into three ‘germ layers’: the ectoderm, which becomes the skin and nervous system; the mesoderm, which gives rise to the skeleton, muscles and the circulatory and urinogenital systems, and the endoderm, which gives rise to the lining of the gut and associated organs. The process of forming these three layers is known as gastrulation.</p><p>To date most experiments on gastrulation in vertebrates have been performed on frog embryos. However, the embryos of amniotes, the group of ‘higher’ vertebrates that comprises reptiles, birds and mammals, differ from those of frogs in a number of ways. Now Voiculescu et al. have used a combination of experimental and computational techniques to shed new light on gastrulation in chick embryos.</p><p>Just prior to gastrulation, the cells of the amniote embryo are arranged in a flat disk, one cell thick, called the epiblast. The cells of the epiblast then move to form the mesoderm and endoderm (in a process called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition). These cell movements also lead to the formation of a structure called the primitive streak that establishes the left-right symmetry of the organism, and also defines the midline of the body.</p><p>Now Voiculescu et al. have shown that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition starts before the primitive streak appears, and that two main processes drive gastrulation. One involves cells inserting themselves between other cells at the midline of the epiblast, which causes a double whorl-like movement within the plane of the epiblast. At the same time small numbers of cells leave the epiblast, and as these cells accumulate under the epiblast, they initiate a positive feedback effect by which they encourage more cells to leave the epiblast. Voiculescu et al. found that this ‘community effect’ involves signalling by a protein called Nodal. This protein effectively amplifies the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and leads to the appearance of the primitive streak at the midline.</p><p>Using computational modelling, Voiculescu et al. argue that the movements of gastrulation can be explained entirely based on local interactions between cells, without the need for cells to send signals over long distances to guide cell movements, as had been generally believed.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01817.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01817.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>epithelial–mesenchymal interactions</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>cell movements</kwd><kwd>primitive streak</kwd><kwd>modelling</kwd><kwd>computer simulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/C512753/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern</surname><given-names>Claudio D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0000296 ID: 52264</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern</surname><given-names>Claudio D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program Organization (HFSP) Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT00189/2001-M</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voiculescu</surname><given-names>Octavian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RCDF 088380/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voiculescu</surname><given-names>Octavian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>249892 - GEMELLI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern</surname><given-names>Claudio D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of two local cell interactions, intercalation and ingression amplified by a community-effect, is sufficient to explain the global movements of amniote gastrulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Before gastrulation, the embryo of reptiles, birds and most mammals is a large flat disc of epithelial cells (epiblast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pasteels, 1940</xref>). In the chick, the 50,000 or so cells that comprise the embryonic epiblast (area pellucida, 3–5 mm in diameter) move as two bilaterally symmetrical whorls, known as the ‘Polonaise’ pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gräper, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wetzel, 1929</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, stage EGK XI-XIV). The movements continue for 8–10 hr, culminating in the formation of a stable morphological structure in the posterior midline, the primitive streak (PS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, stage HH2). Stage HH2 is very brief, as the PS then quickly narrows and elongates along the midline of the embryo, reaching about 2/3 of the diameter of the area pellucida in a further 8–10 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, stages HH3 and 3<sup>+</sup>). Once the PS forms, cells in the epiblast lateral to the PS start moving directly into it along trajectories perpendicular to its axis (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spratt, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nicolet, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellairs, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stern, 2004b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, stages HH3-3<sup>+</sup>). The PS acts as a gateway for gastrulation as epiblast cells internalize via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nieto, 2011</xref>) and generate mesoderm and endoderm beneath the epiblast layer. At present we do not understand the cellular or molecular mechanisms of any of these events, nor do we know whether they are controlled separately or represent the manifestation of a single underlying process.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01817.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Diagrams depicting the early stages of chick development.</title><p>The upper row of diagrams shows embryos at stages XI-XIV (pre-primitive streak), 2 (early streak), 3 (mid-streak) and 3<sup>+</sup> (mid- to late streak), viewed from the dorsal (epiblast) side. The arrows denote the main morphogenetic movements (‘Polonaise’) occurring within the plane of the epiblast. After stage 4 (end of gastrulation), convergence of cells towards and ingression through the anterior part of the streak slows down or ceases (although these movements continue through the middle and posterior parts of the streak), while the epiblast anterior to the streak (prospective neural plate) elongates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sheng et al., 2003</xref>); later, the streak starts to regress, further lengthening the neural plate posteriorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spratt, 1947</xref>).

One type of model invokes long-range, diffusible chemotactic attractants or repellents emanating from various parts of the embryo, to which epiblast cells respond as individuals. For example, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vasiev et al., 2010</xref>) suggested that the tip of the PS produces repellents for cells in the rest of the epiblast, while (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sandersius et al., 2011</xref>) proposed that the PS acts as a ‘chemotactic dipole’, secreting repellents at the tip and attractors at the base, to which epiblast cells respond. Differential adhesion between cells destined to ingress and the rest of the epiblast is also invoked by some models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vasiev et al., 2010</xref>). All of these models are complicated by the fact that the extracellular matrix, presumed to be the substrate over which the epiblast moves, is secreted by both epiblast and underlying hypoblast and actually moves along with the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrisson et al., 1985a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrisson et al., 1985b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zamir et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zamir et al., 2008</xref>). Some models do not envision the extracellular matrix as a substrate for cell movements. One of these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei and Mikawa, 2000</xref>) focused on streak elongation, proposing that oriented cell division could drive this process. Another class of mechanism involves epithelial intercalation of epiblast cells at right angles to the future midline in the presumptive domain of the PS, which is initially located along the posterior edge of the epiblast: this could drive the elongation of this domain and may also contribute to the Polonaise movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>). However none of these models is sufficient to account for all four major movements of chick gastrulation: the Polonaise of the early epiblast, the elongation of the PS, the movement of epiblast cells towards the streak and their ingression through the streak (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). To date, only a very complex combination of various unrelated mechanisms, involving oriented cell division in the streak, secretion of signals by the streak that repel its tip (‘mechanism M3’ of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vasiev et al. (2010)</xref>), induced cell polarization of the epiblast and differential adhesion of the prospective mesendoderm to neighbouring cells (‘mechanism 11’ of Table 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vasiev et al.

One of these is how the PS is maintained as a morphologically stable structure despite the fact that cells are continuously moving into and out of it. We know very little about the dynamics of EMT for individual cells, how collective EMT arises and how the PS is maintained as a stable structure despite its constantly changing cellular composition. The PS acts like the blastopore (a canal connecting the outer and inner layers of the embryo) of lower vertebrates, but the PS does not have an obvious opening, raising the question of how cells are internalized through an apparently solid structure. It is also unclear how the epiblast preserves its integrity and characteristic columnar epithelial organisation of cells with apical-basal polarity during this process.</p><p>Here we address these questions and provide evidence that the epiblast is highly dynamic and that local cell interactions are sufficient to explain global morphogenetic movements across a large epithelial sheet without the need for long-range signalling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Conventional time-lapse video microscopy reveals that the PS appears abruptly, forming a triangular structure within 10–30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Close to the PS, the epiblast displays cells with various degrees of apical narrowing and baso-lateral expansion (designated 1–5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L–P</xref>), indicative of bottle-like cells undergoing EMT.

Using SEM, we observed that the apical surface of the epiblast displays depressions 3–4 cells wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bancroft and Bellairs, 1974</xref>) at stages XIII-2 (just before and as the PS appears); these increase in width and depth by stage 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), suggesting coordinated apical constriction. In multi-photon time-lapse sequences, ingression events can be seen to accelerate as the streak forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video3 video4">Videos 3, 4</xref>).

Few cells far from the streak complete their delamination (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). Ingression increases as cells approach the PS so that most of them ingress within 1 hr; however, cells reaching it at the same time do not necessarily ingress synchronously (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,F</xref>) and some ingressions occur away from the PS midline. For example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, a cluster of cells highlighted with different colours at the far left of the lower right hand panel (dorsal view of the epiblast) shows that cells that are close to each other ingress at different times and different positions along their trajectory towards the PS (middle of the panel): one of the red cells (higher in the panel) ingresses furthest from the streak and earliest, whereas the other red cell (the lowest in the group) ingresses only when it reaches the streak.

To test this, we grafted small groups of ingressed cells from the posterior early PS (stage 2–3) of quail embryos, under the epiblast of pre-PS stage chick embryos (stage XII–XIII) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We chose these cells because they only contribute to lateral mesoderm and not to axial tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatada and Stern, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</xref>); this differs from grafts of organizer or Koller's sickle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izpisua-Belmonte et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bachvarova et al., 1998</xref>), both of which contribute to and induce an organizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izpisua-Belmonte et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bachvarova et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Streit et al., 2000</xref>). The grafted cells induce PS markers in the adjacent epiblast within 4 hr (<italic>cBra</italic>, 8/8 embryos, <italic>cSnail2</italic>, 10/10) and massive ingression ensues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). After 14 hr, a second, host-derived streak develops from the graft site (8/11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), whereas the grafted cells (prospective lateral mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatada and Stern, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</xref>]) migrate away. When a similar graft is made using mesoderm from more lateral cells that have emerged from the PS, no such induction occurs (see below). This is consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vakaet, 1973</xref>) using full-thickness grafts of posterior mature PS (‘nodus posterior’). Our results implicate the mesoderm as the source of the inductive signals. Early ingressed cells induce mesendodermal identity and increase the probability of other epiblast cells undergoing EMT, suggesting that the PS forms and maintains itself by positive feedback mediated by a community effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gurdon, 1988</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01817.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cells in EMT trigger a chain reaction of EMT in a Nodal-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EMT cells from the early PS of a quail embryo (left) are grafted under the epiblast of a pre-PS chick embryo (right).

Candidates include pathways implicated in mesendoderm induction (FGF, TGFβ/Nodal) and/or patterning (canonical Wnt, BMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carnac and Gurdon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Standley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stern, 2004a</xref>). We co-transplanted recently ingressed cells with COS cells secreting specific inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>) or beads soaked in chemical modulators of each pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>). SU5402 (FGF-inhibitor), Crescent, Dkk and alsterpaullone (canonical-Wnt-modulators), chordin and noggin (BMP-inhibitors) did not inhibit induction (n = 9 each except Dkk, n = 7). However, Cerberus (BMP- and Nodal-inhibitor, 9/9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and Cerberus-Short (Nodal-inhibitor, 8/9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), as well as SB4315412 (10/12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and SB505124 (11/12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) (inhibitors of TGFβ superfamily receptors ALK4/ALK7) all prevented both the induction of PS markers (<italic>cBra</italic>, <italic>cSnail2</italic>) and ingression of epiblast cells adjacent to the graft. Importantly, they can do this without loss of the markers in the graft cells themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>). Control COS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) do not prevent induction by the grafted mesoderm. Grafts of mesoderm from outside the PS do not induce the markers either in the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J,K</xref>) or absence (not shown) of beads or COS cells. These results suggest that TGFβ-related factors, and most likely Nodal, are required for the community effect by newly-ingressed mesendoderm. <italic>Nodal</italic> is expressed before streak formation in a posterior domain of the epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Skromne and Stern, 2002</xref>), but its activity is initially blocked by Cerberus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</xref>), an antagonist produced by the hypoblast. This expression domain seems to be identical to the region in which we previously found cells to undergo intercalation parallel to the marginal zone, driven by the Wnt-PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>). The domain of <italic>Nodal</italic> expression and intercalation adopts the shape of the forming streak.</p><p>Thus, two separable local cell interactions (intercalation and EMT amplified by a community effect) are necessary for PS formation. Are they sufficient to explain PS shape and appearance as well as the complex pattern of tissue movements before and during gastrulation? To address this question we used an agent-based model where these cell behaviours are explicitly added to a simple representation of a bounded epithelial sheet (‘Materials and methods–Description of the model’). The model assigns various states (e.g., Wnt-PCP, Nodal) to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; Table 2); cells modify their states and execute behaviours based upon their current internal state and interactions with their neighbours (e.g., oriented intercalation, self-amplifying EMT; see Table 3 for a summary of the model rules).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01817.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Different views of a simulation of normal development.</title><p>These diagrams provide an explanatory key for the simulation videos and illustrate the principal signals, cell behaviours and the major tissues involved in gastrulation. Three time points are shown: stage XI, stage 2 and stage 3+. The upper 7 rows are dorsal views onto the epiblast; the lower 3 rows are oblique views. Colours are additive when a cell is positive for more than one displayed state (see e.g., the row labelled ‘combined’, which symbolises the sum of all features in the rows above it for the forming primitive streak). Nodal(+) cells are shown in red (top row), Wnt-PCP(+) cells in yellow (second row). Cells positive for both Nodal and Wnt-PCP appear orange (third row). At Stage XI all cells in the future streak-forming region are Nodal and Wnt-PCP positive. Later, most continue to have both activities but some cells are only positive for Nodal (red). Cells undergoing EMT are shown in blue and ‘mesendodermal’ cells in aquamarine (fourth row). For combinations of Nodal, Wnt-PCP, EMT and mesendoderm, note that Nodal(+)-EMT cells appear purple (red + blue); if also Wnt-PCP(+) then approximately violet (red + yellow + blue) (‘combined’). The hypoblast is shown chocolate-coloured and the endoblast greenish-slate (rows 6 and 8). Hypoblast displacement by the endoblast (at stage XIV; between stages XI and 2 in the Figure) disinhibits Nodal in the overlying epiblast (see text). Sequential cell positions are integrated by remembering all previous time points to form ‘trails’, as shown in row 7. For clarity, trails made from 15% of the cells are shown. The last three rows depict the embryo viewed from an oblique angle. In row 8 (‘hypoblast and endoblast’), the position of the lower layer can be seen (also see above, <italic>lower layer</italic>). Initially this consists only of hypoblast (chocolate). At later stages, endoblast (greenish-slate) partially displaces the hypoblast. The epiblast is also seen from below (‘epiblast ventral view’, row 9), allowing clear visualization of EMT (blue/purple/violet) and emerging and emerging middle layer (aquamarine) cells. The final row, ‘epiblast dorsal view’ (row 10), displays the epiblast from above with a pseudo-surface applied, simulating indentations caused by ingressing cells. These indentations sum as cells approach the posterior midline, generating a midline groove at the PS. The pseudo-surface is created by tessellating points representing the top of each epithelial cell (using the cell body for cells undergoing EMT).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01817.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01817.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01817-fig6-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig6s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01817.017</object-id><label>Figure 6—figure Supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Modelling: hierarchical time implementation.</title><p>Time is represented as ‘ticks’.

When cooperativity of EMT is triggered in the intercalation domain (by disinhibition of Nodal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</xref>], because of the displacement of the hypoblast away from the posterior Nodal-expressing zone), massive ingression occurs. In line with experimental observations, this causes the movement pattern to be altered, with cells now entering the PS along direct lateral-to-medial trajectories. The simulations faithfully recreate the large-scale Polonaise movements as well as PS formation and its role as a gateway for gastrulation via cell ingression.

As expected, increasing the strength of intercalation causes the streak to converge and elongate more rapidly, and vice versa. We also examined the kinetics of ingression by changing the mean of the logistic curve defining the probability of ingression (m<sub>N</sub> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 5.1</xref>, ‘Materials and methods–Description of the model’) which effectively alters the community effect threshold and by changing the spatial range of effector cells (σ<sub>d</sub> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10">Equation 5.2</xref>; d<sub>max</sub> was co-modified to remain 4 × σ<sub>d</sub>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> shows images from simulations in which m<sub>N</sub> is varied from 6.0 to 10.0 (bracketing 8.0 used in the study) and images from simulations where σ<sub>d</sub> is varied from 5.0 to 20.0 μm (bracketing the 10.0 μm used in this study). Parameter changes that increase the strength of the ingression community effect (smaller m<sub>N</sub> or larger σ<sub>d</sub>) tend to produce more diminutive streaks since incorporation of new cells into the streak (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ11 equ12 equ13 equ14">Equations 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2</xref>) is less able to compensate for increased loss by ingression.</p><p>In the model, events in the PS (intercalation and ingression) coupled with the cells in the non-PS epiblast spatially equilibrating amongst themselves results in the global epiblast movement pattern. As the PS converges, cells just lateral and anterior shift posteriorly and medially to ‘fill-in’ the area being evacuated. This shifting is propagated to successively more distant cells. The anterior and lateral epiblast thus sweeps posteriorly and medially. At the same time, convergence and extension in the PS generates movement along the midline; this is mainly directed anteriorly, as the marginal zone limits posterior extension. Together these processes yield both the circumferential (lateral epiblast) and anterior (posterior midline epiblast) components of the Polonaise movement pattern as seen in normal embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spratt, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To distinguish the roles of intercalation and ingression (EMT) in the global Polonaise cell movements, we blocked medio-lateral intercalation by electroporation of a mixture of morpholinos against components of the Wnt-PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>) and followed the movement of cells elsewhere in the epiblast by using the carbocyanine dye DiI to label a lattice of cells throughout the epiblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I–J</xref>). At pre-streak stages, we observe a complete arrest of the Polonaise movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gräper, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wetzel, 1929</xref>) across the entire epiblast (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video8 video10">Videos 8, 10</xref>; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> compare G, normal embryo, with I, where Wnt-PCP was blocked in the intercalation domain). Massive ingression is still triggered at the appropriate time, but in a posterior domain close to the margin of the embryo rather than at the midline. In these experiments, cells move posteriorly towards this zone of concentrated ingression along abnormal, straight-line trajectories (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> compare H, normal embryo, with J, blocked intercalation). These findings suggest that shaping of the early PS in the normal embryo is mainly driven by intercalation, which results in coalescence and extension in the midline and the Polonaise movement pattern. After its formation, the PS is maintained as a zone of massive ingression that generates a more direct pattern of cell convergence, with cell trajectories perpendicular to the axis of the PS (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, stage 3+).

In the chick, some argue that all precursors of the streak arise from and multiply in a very small region of the posterior epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei and Mikawa, 2000</xref>), whereas others propose that the precursors of the early mesendoderm are present in all regions of the early epiblast, based on the observation that HNK1<sup>+</sup>/Acetylcholinesterase<sup>+</sup> cells are scattered randomly throughout the pre-PS epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drews, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canning and Stern, 1988</xref>), contribute to mesendoderm and are required for PS formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stern and Canning, 1990</xref>). Here we show that ingression of cells starts well before gastrulation, by individual cells sparsely scattered across the epiblast, in a pattern similar to the HNK1<sup>+</sup> cells. Our results strongly suggest that the early ingressing cells correspond to, or are a subset of the HNK1<sup>+</sup> population, which also explains why early ingressed mesoderm cells can rescue PS formation in embryos from which HNK1<sup>+</sup> cells have been ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stern and Canning, 1990</xref>). There are interesting parallels with the sea urchin, where gastrulation is initiated by maternally specified ‘pioneer’ cells, the Primary Mesenchyme cells (PMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sherwood and McClay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McClay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sweet et al., 2002</xref>), also characterised by their expression of Acetylcholinesterase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drews, 1975</xref>), which carries the HNK1 epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bon et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canning and Stern, 1988</xref>). At present, it is not known when and how HNK1+ cells are specified in the chick epiblast, but they share two key characteristics with their sea urchin counterparts: they are required for proper gastrulation (mesendoderm formation) and have inductive abilities. We propose that as in the sea urchin, amniote mesendoderm formation is initiated before the PS forms by ‘pioneer’ cells that ingress as individuals at relatively low frequency throughout the epiblast.</p><p>Our results indicate that, in the presence of Nodal activity, these early ingressing cells can trigger a chain reaction of EMT, induce the expression of mesendodermal markers and PS formation. In zebrafish, when the Nodal pathway is compromised, only about 60 cells still ingress instead of the ∼2500 that normally do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keller et al., 2008</xref>), consistent with a community-effect mediated by Nodal being conserved in vertebrates. In sea urchin, however, the inductive effect of PMCs on gastrulation is mediated by Notch signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sherwood and McClay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McClay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sweet et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The amniote hypoblast (a transient layer of cells) plays a crucial role in coordinating the timing of PS formation with other cell movements. Medio-lateral intercalation in the epiblast prior to the start of gastrulation acts to displace and re-shape the Nodal domain and the prospective mesendodermal territory to the midline. Later in development, cell intercalation seems to continue to play a role in axial elongation by driving convergence/extension movements in the midline mesoderm and the overlying neuroectoderm (prospective floor plate), after the initial appearance of notochord cells. These later movements in the mesoderm and prospective floor plate are also found in anamniotes, as has been demonstrated in Xenopus and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ezin et al., 2006</xref>), whereas the early (pre-gastrulation) movements are unique to amniotes. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how the displacement of the chick hypoblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</xref>) (expressing <italic>Cerberus</italic>) by the endoblast, or of the mouse anterior visceral endoderm (AVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Perea-Gomez et al., 2002</xref>), expressing <italic>Cerberus</italic> and <italic>Lefty1</italic>) leads to extensive EMT and PS formation. We propose that apart from a role in nutrition of the embryo, the hypoblast/AVE acquired the function of delaying PS formation while repositioning the streak precursor cells to the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stern and Downs, 2012</xref>). This occurs because the <italic>Nodal</italic>-expressing domain also expresses components of the Wnt-PCP pathway and undergoes intercalation, independently of ingression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>). Distinct molecular pathways mediate the dual role of the hypoblast: FGF, which controls the Wnt-PCP pathway and positions the PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>), and Nodal antagonism (perhaps together with Wnt antagonism), which regulates the timing of PS formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</xref>).</p><p>We suggest the following model of amniote gastrulation. (I) In the stages leading up to gastrulation, cells in a crescent-shaped posterior region of the epiblast express <italic>Nodal</italic> and the Wnt-PCP system. The Wnt-PCP system drives oriented intercalation of epithelial cells, parallel to the marginal zone (perpendicular to the future body axis). Nodal is a potent enhancer of EMT activity (ingression) and sensitizes cells to activity in neighbouring cells (community effect). However, underlying the epiblast is the hypoblast, a suppressor of Nodal activity (through Cerberus). Thus cells outside the posterior region (Nodal-negative) and cells within the region (Nodal-positive but hypoblast suppressed) only attempt EMT at a low rate, and most of these attempts are unsuccessful: they do not result in cell ingression. The Wnt-PCP system causes this posterior cohort of Nodal-positive cells to converge to, and extend along, the midline. Movement of these cells towards the midline draws in neighbouring cells, the displacements are propagated outwards and, through the geometry of the roughly circular epiblast confined within the marginal zone, the Polonaise movement pattern ensues. (II) Endoblast derived from the posterior germ wall (the deep, yolky cells of the area opaca, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stern, 1990</xref>) displaces the hypoblast away from the posterior part of the embryo, unleashing Nodal activity in the Nodal-positive population, now localized at the posterior midline. Under the influence of Nodal, ingression accelerates and becomes self-reinforcing, generating the PS. The now massive loss of cells through ingression within the midline PS pulls in lateral neighbours and the displacements are propagated laterally, resulting in a transverse movement pattern. As lateral cells enter the PS, they become Nodal and Wnt-PCP positive and fuel the process. The PS continues to elongate through incorporation of lateral cells and oriented intercalation.</p><p>Together, our results suggest that amniote gastrulation is a population event. The PS is not a fixed gateway for cell internalization but rather a dynamic, self-reinforcing concentration of individually ingressing cells. These results provide a mechanism for the self-maintenance of stable morphological structures as their cell composition changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joubin and Stern, 1999</xref>). They also demonstrate that large-scale movements and morphogenesis of entire epithelial sheets can be driven by local cell interactions, without the need for signalling over long distances.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Embryos were cultured by a modification of the New culture technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stern and Ireland, 1981</xref>).

Imaging was performed with either a Leica SP2 or MP2 microscope, fitted with a Tsunami XI infrared laser tuned at 895 nm, using a x40 (N.A. = 0.8) lens. Image processing was done using ImageJ, Volocity and Imaris software. For labelling small groups of cells in the embryo, stock CM-DiI (Molecular Probes, 1 mg/ml in ethanol) was diluted 1:20 in 0.25 M sucrose and applied with a finely-drawn microcapillary attached to a mouth tube.</p><p>Mesoderm grafts were done essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stern and Canning, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izpisua-Belmonte et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Streit et al., 2000</xref>). Using insect pins, the endoderm of donor quail embryos at early stage HH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>) was removed, then the mesoderm underlying the posterior PS was dissected out.

The current model builds on previously described versions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodenstein and Stern, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fisher and Bodenstein, 2006</xref>). Simulated biological cells are the model agents. A two- or three-dimensional simulated tissue is constructed as a cohort of these model cells. Cells execute individual cellular programs leading to actions. The cellular programs reference internal states and external cues, the latter of which may include the states and actions of neighbouring cells. The pooled behaviour of the entire cohort of cells leads to tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodenstein, 1986</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Simulations overview</title><p>Computer simulations were run under Redhat Linux on a Dell M4600 multi-core workstation. For the current study, a spherical cell model was used although a cylindrical extension (tether) is added for cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) but still attached to the epiblast. Cell–cell interactions are defined by local neighbour relations and by near-neighbour (abutting) relations. Cells in the epithelial layer calculate near-neighbours by transient polygonal constructions (an approximate Voronoi tessellation). Cells independently cycle and divide. They maintain a variety of internal states which may be altered by cell–cell interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3">Tables 2, 3</xref>). These states refer to known molecular mediators (e.g., Nodal, Wnt-PCP), or cell types and/or behaviours (e.g., EMT, intercalation orientation). Mediator states generally influence cells on a stochastic basis with probability distributions that are affected by cell interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Time and space considerations</title><p>The model uses a hierarchical time structure to reconcile simulated events with real events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). ‘Ticks’ represent the smallest model time unit corresponding to biological real time. During each tick the simulation performs certain global functions; each cell is addressed individually and its actions are based partly on the combined effects of the various influences described above. Many of these actions involve iterative processes. This hierarchical structure generates a checkpoint system whereby various actions that are not necessarily correlated within the model can be coordinated and the model tissue can be time-matched to the biological tissue. This also allows model parameters to be specified in simple real-world terms (e.g., the length of G2 is 30 ± 3 min) without the need to specify details of how the program manages the underlying mechanics. In the current simulations a tick is designed to mimic 10 min of biological time. In similar fashion, the model divides space into ‘clicks’ which correspond to specified real-world dimensions. Unlike ticks, clicks are divisible and space is not quantized beyond the floating-point limits of the computer platform. In the current simulations, a click is defined as 1.0 μm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Embryonic stages</title><p>Simulations are designed to model the chick epiblast from about Stage XI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eyal-Giladi and Kochav, 1976</xref>) to about Stage 3+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>) and correspond to about 12 hr of embryonic time. Stage 2 is reached approximately halfway through the simulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Embryonic layers</title><p>The model simulates three embryonic layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stern, 2004a</xref>) with different levels of detail. The ‘upper layer’ consists of the epiblast proper and marginal zone (MZ). Upper layer cells interact with each other in terms of behaviour (e.g., maintain separation, divide, grow, move) as well as information (e.g., integrating the signals received by a cell and responding appropriately). The ‘middle layer’ is made up of cells that ingress from the epiblast and convert to mesenchyme. Middle layer cells are represented as discrete objects and interact with the overlying epiblast on an informational basis; however, their post-ingression behaviours and movements are not modelled here. The ‘lower layer’ is a schematized representation of the hypoblast/endoblast layer and does not contain model cells. Polygons representing the expanding endoblast and retreating hypoblast are animated over the course of the simulation relative to events occurring in the other layers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Initial conditions</title><p>Simulations begin at Stage XI when the chick epiblast is about 3–6 mm across and contains on the order of 25,000–50,000 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stern, 2004a</xref>). The initial model epiblast contains about 1000 cells confined to a plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, Stage XI column). A circular array of boundary cells surrounds the epiblast in the same plane and represents the MZ. A cohort of about 90–100 cells in the posterior epiblast is initialized to represent epiblast adjacent to Koller's sickle, or SAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodenstein and Stern, 2005</xref>). This area expresses both <italic>Nodal</italic> and the planar cell polarity (PCP) mediators <italic>Prickle-1</italic>, <italic>Flamingo-1</italic> and <italic>Vangl2</italic> and undergoes medio-lateral intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Initially the lower layer contains only the hypoblast, represented as a circular domain of similar dimensions as the epiblast; the middle layer is empty.

Cells ‘swell’ during metaphase and divide symmetrically, with each daughter cell being half the parental volume before growing to full size.

MZ cells themselves are provided as a growing boundary: they do not divide but their number is modified as needed to surround a growing epiblast, maintaining their intercellular spacing.</p><p>MZ shape is determined by application of a displacement vector to individual MZ pseudo-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This displacement vector (<bold>v</bold><sub><bold>MZ</bold></sub>) is the sum of a curvature vector (<bold>v</bold><sub><bold>curv</bold></sub>), an epiblast density vector (<bold>v</bold><sub><bold>dens</bold></sub>) and an area correction vector (<bold>v</bold><sub><bold>area</bold></sub>) (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1.1</xref>); these vectors are calculated and applied once at the beginning of each tick. The curvature vector (<bold>v</bold><sub><bold>curv</bold></sub>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 1.2</xref>) has direction and magnitude based on the local curvature and acts to flatten the MZ ring at each point. The density vector (<bold>v</bold><sub><bold>dens</bold></sub>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 1.3</xref>) is directed outwards from the epiblast with a direction based on the local curvature and a magnitude based on the local density of epiblast cells. In essence, a high local cell density abutting the MZ will push the MZ outwards in that location. The area correction vector (<bold>v</bold><sub><bold>area</bold></sub>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 1.4</xref>) is calculated to manage overall cell density of the epiblast despite local changes in the shape of the MZ. The curvature vector is in line with the density vector and either subtracts (if the MZ is locally convex) or adds (if locally concave). (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2 equ3 equ4">Equations 1.1–1.4</xref>).

This is formulated using a logistic function with ‘effective neighbour equivalents’ (N<sub>eff</sub>) as the dependent variable (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 5.1</xref>). N<sub>eff</sub> in turn includes components representing the cell itself, near-neighbours in the epiblast plane and more distant local neighbours whose effect is attenuated with distance (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10">Equation 5.2</xref>). Three classes of Nodal-secreting effector cells are distinguished: (i) the receiving cell itself (if already secreting Nodal); (ii) <italic>near-neighbour</italic> cells (those directly abutting the receiving cell in the epithelial layer), and (iii) <italic>local neighbour</italic> cells (those within some proximity, excluding near-neighbours).

This community effect on cell ingression is modelled using Nodal as the direct effector. However the model can accommodate one or more other effectors that become active either secondary to Nodal action or by a mechanism involving disinhibition after the hypoblast becomes replaced by endoblast. The base rate of ingression is low for cells in Nodal-negative regions (anterior and lateral epiblast) or Nodal-positive but refractory regions (the PS forming region prior to hypoblast withdrawal). When the hypoblast withdraws, cells in the PS region become Nodal-active and the rate of ingression increases. As the process continues, Nodal-positive ingressing cells accumulate beneath the epithelium and cooperativity accelerates. As the steep region of the logistic curve is reached, massive ingression occurs. The influx and incorporation of lateral epiblast into this zone of massive ingression fuels the process and helps to keep it localized. Nodal-active t-emt cells where exposure to Nodal is at or beyond a threshold are prohibited from rejoining the epithelium, as are cells where the cell body has descended fully beneath the BM. The threshold is chosen as the magnitude of the Nodal effect that a Nodal-positive cell would have on itself in the absence of hypoblast inhibition. Thus, reversion is prohibited for disinhibited Nodal-positive cells, but also for disinhibited Nodal-negative cells if surrounded by numerous Nodal-positive neighbours.

For each cell, a polygon is calculated such that each edge is perpendicular to and passes though a line connecting the centre of the cell with that of its near-neighbour and bisects the separation between the cells. This polygon is roughly analogous to a Voronoi region (VR) and is termed the pseudo-Voronoi region (pseudo-VR). Voronoi regions often are termed ‘cells’. To avoid confusion with biological cells, the term region will be used here. For a true Voronoi region, each edge should maintain equal distance from the physical cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okabe et al., 2000</xref>]. For biological cells schematized as variable size spheres (circles in two-dimensions) the edges would therefore be curved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2006</xref>). The straight-sided polygons used here are simplifications adequate for the proposed cell behaviours and computationally simpler. The centroid of the pseudo-VR is then determined and a displacement vector created from the current cell centroid to the polygon centroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>). A single near-neighbour is highlighted in this diagram, but all near-neighbours are involved. Each near-neighbour movement causes its own pseudo-VR to change and the process is propagated across the tissue. Although here cells begin in a regular array, cells in the model are not so constrained. Application of this vector acts to move the cell to a more ‘central’ location among its near-neighbours and when applied to the cell population in iterative fashion tends to make cell density homogeneous throughout the tissue. This is recognizable as a form of Lloyd’s algorithm or Voronoi iteration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Lloyd's algorithm is asymptotic and customarily run to some arbitrary convergence criterion. In the current simulations, OI continuously alters the positions of a subset of cells in the posterior epiblast. Since OI and equilibration (Voronoi iteration, or VI) occur simultaneously, the latter never approaches equilibrium—there is no fixed endpoint and the non-OI (i.e., anterior and lateral epiblast) cells are continuously ‘playing catch-up’. Hence the algorithm is run for a fixed number of iterations (1000 per tick) rather than to some equilibrium criterion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-10-2"><title>Oriented intercalation</title><p>An ‘OI-orientation’ vector state is maintained for cells programmed to undergo intercalation (i.e., Wnt-PCP-positive). During each tick, the vector for each cell is re-calculated as the normalized sum of the cell's current OI-orientation vector and the normalized sum of the OI-orientation vectors of the cell's near-neighbours. This gives equal weight to the cell's current vector and the consensus orientation of its neighbours. Iterative re-calculation of these vectors is done until a stable arrangement is reached among the Wnt-PCP-positive cells (consensus).</p><p>When Wnt-PCP-positive cells divide, each daughter inherits both the positive Wnt-PCP state and the OI-orientation vector of the parent cell, the latter then being refined by interaction with its near-neighbours. By the same mechanism, newly Wnt-PCP-positive cells are seamlessly incorporated into the existing cohort.</p><p>MZ cells maintain a reference OI-orientation vector derived from the local curvature. Wnt-PCP cells abutting the MZ cue off of these MZ cells and this acts to orient the contiguous cohort of Wnt-PCP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Intercalation uses an OI-movement vector (<bold>v</bold><sub><bold>oi</bold></sub>) for each Wnt-PCP-positive cell, which is re-calculated ‘on the fly’ as a function of the position of the cell, that of its near-neighbours and their various OI-orientation vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Both the cell and at least one of its near-neighbours must be Wnt-PCP positive for this interaction to occur.</p><p>The magnitude of the <bold>v</bold><sub><bold>oi</bold></sub> vector is equal to |sinθ|; thus, displacement ceases when (if) the target is reached (θ = 0) and is maximum if the cells are side-by-side (furthest from the ideal position). Only one near-neighbour is shown for simplicity, but the displacement vectors to all near-neighbours are summed to produce the final oriented intercalation displacement vector. Since the algorithm is applied iteratively to all cells, during the each iteration the near-neighbour(s) will also move according to the same algorithm. Thus, rather than the cell moving completely to align with near-neighbours, the cell and its neighbours will both incrementally move towards an equilibrium position. In the illustration both cell and near-neighbour have parallel orientation vectors although this is not necessary (or even common) in the simulations.</p><p>Iterative application of this vector-directed movement causes neighbouring cells to realign with each other and produces convergence and extension of the involved population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wallingford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keller and Davidson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by grants from the BBSRC, MRC and ERC to CDS and fellowships from HFSP and the Wellcome Trust to OV.
