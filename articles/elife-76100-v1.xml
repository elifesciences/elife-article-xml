protein substrate. By debranching ubiquitin chains composed of K48 linkages, the proteasome-associated ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase UCHL5/UCH37 serves as a positive regulator of protein degradation. How UCH37 achieves specificity for K48 chains is unclear. Here, we use a combination of hydrogen-deuterium mass spectrometry, chemical crosslinking, small-angle X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular docking, and targeted mutagenesis to uncover a cryptic K48 ubiquitin (Ub) chain-specific binding site on the opposite face of UCH37 relative to the canonical S1 (cS1) ubiquitin-binding site. Biochemical assays demonstrate the K48 chain-specific binding site is required for chain debranching and proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins modified with branched chains. Using quantitative proteomics, translation shutoff experiments, and linkage-specific affinity tools, we then identify specific proteins whose degradation depends on the debranching activity of UCH37. Our findings suggest that UCH37 and potentially other DUBs could use more than one S1 site to perform different biochemical functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>deubiquitinase</kwd><kwd>Proteasome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM110543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strieter</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The proteasomal deubiquitinase UCHL5/UCH37 uses a face distinct from the canonical ubiquitin binding site to engage K48-linked ubiquitin chains and catalyze chain debranching.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein ubiquitination is a dynamic post-translational modification that has profound effects on cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oh et al., 2018</xref>). Once tagged with ubiquitin (Ub), a protein target can be forced to change cellular location, assemble into a multiprotein complex, or suffer the fate of degradation. These diverse functions are orchestrated by a wide array of different Ub modifications. In addition to mono- and multimono-ubiquitination, Ub can be assembled into polymeric chains composed of different linkages (M1, K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63), lengths, and architectures (unbranched and branched) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). Central to the regulation of Ub-dependent signaling events is the ability to remove Ub modifications. These actions are executed by a family of proteolytic enzymes called deubiquitinases (DUBs).</p><p>There are nearly 100 human DUBs that fall into seven distinct subfamilies: USPs, OTUs, UCHs, Josephin, MINDY, ZUP1, and JAMM/MPN+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clague et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leznicki and Kulathu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mevissen and Komander, 2017</xref>). Members of the OTU, MINDY, JAMM, and ZUP1 families generally target specific linkages within Ub chains, leaving behind the Ub moiety directly attached to a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdul Rehman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul Rehman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hermanns et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hewings et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwasna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>). USPs, on the other hand, tend to display selectivity for the protein directly anchored to Ub and are rather promiscuous toward different chain types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faesen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ritorto et al., 2014</xref>). In some cases, there are DUBs capable of targeting a specific chain type and removing Ub directly from a variety of different substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gersch et al., 2017</xref>). These fundamentally distinct activities are thought to require the same primary Ub-binding site (termed the S1 site), which steers the Ub C-terminal scissile bond into the active site for cleavage. A secondary binding site—a S1´ site—enables substrate discrimination. With chain type-specific DUBs, for example, the S1 site interacts with the Ub (i.e. distal Ub) whose C-terminus is attached to another Ub molecule, and the S1´ site positions the proximal Ub of a chain (i.e. the subunit supplying the Lys or N-terminus) to allow only one linkage to gain access to the catalytic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mevissen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>). We thought the same set of rules would apply to the K48 chain-specific DUB UCH37.</p><p>Through association with the 26 S proteasome and INO80 chromatin remodeling complexes, UCH37 (also called UCHL5) plays a fundamental role in many cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamazaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jørgensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qiu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yao et al., 2006</xref>). Although its function in the context of the INO80 complex is poorly understood, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deol et al., 2020</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2021</xref>) recently reported that the proteasome-bound form specifically binds K48 chains and catalyzes the removal of K48 branchpoints to promote degradation. Protein substrates that depend on the Ub chain debranching activity of UCH37 for degradation, however, remain unknown. Complicating the identification of substrates is the fact that UCH37 has other known biochemical activities. As a member of the UCH family, UCH37 removes small adducts from the C-terminus of Ub and more recent studies have shown that the DUB can act as a peptidase by cleaving Ub from the N-terminus of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Based on known structures of monoUb bound to UCH37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sahtoe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vander Linden et al., 2015</xref>), the hypothesis is that both the C-terminal hydrolase and debranching activities utilize the same S1 site during catalysis. The S1 site is composed of a series of residues that form a rim leading into the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The DEUBAD domain of RPN13 further promotes Ub binding by properly positioning both the flexible active site crossover loop (CL), which is a characteristic feature of all UCHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnston et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Popp et al., 2009</xref>), and the C-terminal helical region of UCH37. One would therefore speculate that during chain debranching, the S1 site would be occupied by the K48-linked distal Ub, as this subunit is the one removed from the branched chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In this orientation, the other two Ub subunits at the branchpoint would also be expected to engage UCH37; however, the precise mechanism by which branched chains are selectively processed by UCH37 remains unknown. A region that has received little attention in any of the UCHs is the face located on the opposite side of the CL relative to the S1 site. We thought that by defining how K48 chains interact with UCH37, we could begin to dissect the impact of K48 chain binding and debranching on a proteome-wide level.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The catalytic domain (CD) of UCH37 confers K48 linkage specificity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of UCH37 bound RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> (PDB ID: 4UEL; see also 4WLR) highlighting residues comprising the canonical S1 (cS1) Ubiquitin (Ub)-binding site (shown in pink).

Using a combination of hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), NMR, chemical crosslinking, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and molecular docking, we find a cryptic K48 Ub chain-binding site located on the opposite face of UCH37 relative to the cS1 site. K48 linkage specificity is conferred by two regions: one composed of an aromatic-rich helix-loop-helix motif and another containing L181. Targeted mutagenesis reveals that the K48-specific sites are necessary for chain binding and removing K48 branchpoints, but not for C-terminal hydrolysis. By reconstituting proteasome complexes with mutants of UCH37 either defective in Ub binding at the cS1 site (frontside) or K48 chain binding (backside), we find that only the latter is required for regulating the degradation of substrates modified with branched chains. When the front- and backside mutants are expressed in cells lacking UCH37, the frontside mutant can rescue wild-type (WT) activity but the backside mutant cannot. With complete mutational control over the activity of UCH37, we are then able to identify branched chain-modified proteins whose abundance and turnover depend on K48 chain binding. Our results suggest that not all DUBs use a single S1 site to perform all the necessary biochemical functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>K48 linkage selectivity is embedded in the catalytic domain of UCH37</title><p>Previously, we found that UCH37 exclusively interacts with K48 chains regardless of overall architecture but only cleaves the K48 linkage if it is present at a branchpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deol et al., 2020</xref>). UCH37 is composed of a catalytic domain (CD) and a C-terminal helical domain termed the UCH37-Like Domain (ULD). Whether both domains are required for K48 specificity is unclear. Thus, to address this issue, we first performed a series of pulldown experiments with a panel of homotypic Ub chains. Both inactive full-length UCH37 (UCH37<sup>C88A</sup>) and the inactive form of the CD (CD<sup>C88A</sup>) exclusively pulldown K48 chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>).

Size exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) shows the CD forms a 1:1 complex with a K48-linked Ub trimer (tri-Ub) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G-H</xref>), indicating a single CD is necessary and sufficient for K48 specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HDX-MS reveals slower exchange on the backside of UCH37 upon binding K48 chains</title><p>To identify the K48 Ub chain-specific binding sites in UCH37, we turned to HDX-MS. We decided to use UCH37<sup>C88A</sup> bound to the DEUBAD (DEUBiquitinase ADaptor) domain of its partner protein RPN13 (referred to as the UCH37•RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> complex). Like the CD, the UCH37•RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> complex binds K48 chains with 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F-H</xref>), but more importantly, the addition of RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> releases UCH37 from an autoinhibited state thereby enhancing the binding affinity toward mono-Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamazaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qiu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sahtoe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vander Linden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yao et al., 2006</xref>). This enables the investigation of a wide range of interactions from mono-Ub to branched trimers, which is necessary for uncovering cryptic Ub-binding sites outside of the cS1 site.</p><p>After obtaining initial data showing that high peptide coverage for UCH37 (97%) and RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> (98%) can be achieved at a resolution of 7–14 amino acids, we moved on to a proof-of-concept experiment with mono-Ub. Specifically, we compared the deuterium uptake between mono-Ub bound UCH37<sup>C88A</sup>•RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> and free UCH37<sup>C88A</sup>•RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup>. A heat map corresponding to the differential deuterium uptake plots of individual peptides of UCH37<sup>C88A</sup> shows a region near the C-terminus of the CD (residues 205–218) that undergoes slower exchange in the presence of Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). There is also slow exchange in the adjoining helical ULD domain (residues 257–270).

UCH37<sup>C88A</sup>•RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> was mixed with either K48 di-Ub, tri-Ub, or K6/K48 tri-Ub and subjected to HDX-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Differential heat maps comparing the chain-bound to mono-Ub-bound form were calculated to identify sites undergoing slower exchange outside of the S1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). From these data it is apparent that slow exchange in residues comprising helices α5 and α6 is exclusive to K48 chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). The α5–6 motif is located on the backside of UCH37 relative to the S1 site and is not predicted to interact with Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>We envisioned two possible scenarios that could account for protection of the α5–6 motif. The first is that the distal K48-linked Ub subunit binds the S1 site while the proximal interacts with a portion of the CL. Examining the structures of mono-Ub bound to the S1 site of UCH37, there does not seem to be enough space between Ub and the CL to accommodate another Ub molecule. Thus, it is plausible that the C-terminal portion of the ULD acts as a hinge to allow for the DEUBAD domain and the CL to move closer to the α5–6 motif, decreasing its mobility and thus reducing the exchange rate. The second is that lower deuterium uptake could simply reflect the presence of a cryptic Ub-binding site.</p><p>If the α5–6 motif is the preferred binding site for K48 chains, then K48 chain binding should occur to a similar extent regardless of whether the S1 site is occupied because the α5–6 motif is on a distinct face. However, if S1 together with the CL forms a K48 specific binding motif, then covalent attachment of Ub to the active site Cys should block binding to K48 chains. Surprisingly, we find that mono-Ub still binds Ub ~UCH37•RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup>, albeit with twofold lower affinity compared to the apo complex, and the binding of K48 di-Ub is not altered at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). HDX data support these results. Weak but reproducible protection of the α5–6 motif is observed upon addition of mono-Ub to Ub ~UCH37•RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup>, and the degree of protection becomes much more pronounced when either K48 di-Ub or K6/K48 tri-Ub is added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>). It appears that when Ub is conjugated to UCH37, binding of either K48 di-Ub or K6/K48 tri-Ub affords stronger protection of the α5–6 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This could be due to an allosteric effect resulting in enhanced binding or a situation in which K48 chains only interact with the backside because sampling of both faces is shutdown. Binding data support the latter by showing that Ub conjugation does not improve the affinity toward K48 di-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>) or K6/K48 tri-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>). Together, these data indicate the cS1 site is dispensable for binding K48 chains and suggest that specificity is conferred through interactions mediated by the α5–6 motif on the backside of UCH37.</p><p>The reciprocal HDX data on the DEUBAD domain is also informative. Titrating in K48 di-Ub or K6/K48 tri-Ub to Ub~UCH37<sup>C88A</sup>•RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> results in slower exchange in two partially overlapping peptides—338–348 and 344–356—corresponding to helices 5 and 6 of the DEUBAD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–K</xref>). The exchange rate for the same set of residues is not perturbed by mono-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), indicating that slower deuterium uptake is unique to K48 chains. As the existing structure of Ub~UCH37•RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> shows, α5–6 of the DEUBAD interacts with the CL to form a contiguous surface facing the backside of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L–M</xref>). Thus, the DEUBAD along with the CL could provide one Ub-binding site while the α5–6 motif of UCH37 provides another. Alternatively, the DEUBAD could restrict the motion of the CL to afford a conformation conducive to chain binding.</p><p>Although UCH37 binds K48 chains independent of chain architecture, branched chains are cleaved with higher efficiency than homotypic K48 chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deol et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shorkey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we expected to find distinct regions that become more protected in the presence of branched chains. Instead, we only observe differences in the degree of deuterium uptake, as the exchange rates within the same regions of protection are faster with K6/K48 tri-Ub relative to K48 di- and tri-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>). These results suggest the interaction between UCH37•RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> and branched chains is more dynamic than that with unbranched K48 chains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Backside binding is confirmed by chemical crosslinking</title><p>If the backside affords a K48-specific binding surface, we hypothesized that individual Ub subunits would crosslink distinct sites.

The relative abundance of each site was estimated from the area under the curve of the extracted ion chromatogram. Mapping these data onto the structure of UCH37 reveals that α10 of the ULD is the primary crosslinking site when the diazirine is at position-46 of mono-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This result is entirely consistent with the Ub-bound structure, which shows A46 of Ub pointing directly toward α10. Peptides corresponding to α6, the C-terminal end of the CL, and 211–217 loop are also trapped by the diazirine-modified mono-Ub, but to a much lesser extent compared to the α10 peptide. These results confirm that mono-Ub also binds the backside α5–6 motif in addition to the cS1 site.</p><p>In accord with the HDX-MS data, K48 chains shift the preferred crosslinking sites to the backside of UCH37. The proximal subunit of K48 di-Ub (Ub<sup>prox</sup>) almost exclusively crosslinks a peptide corresponding to α6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The distal subunit (Ub<sup>dist</sup>), which generally displays weaker crosslinking compared to the proximal Ub, traps several sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The most prevalent is near the C-terminal end of the CL. Other less abundant sites include α6, and a peptide fragment comprising residues 183–206. Crosslinked peptides corresponding to RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> were not detected. Our crosslinking data together with HDX-MS therefore uncover two distinct regions on the backside of UCH37 that are involved in the interaction with unbranched K48 chains: the α5–6 motif and a more diffuse region composed of the C-terminal end of the CL along with the 176–190 and 211–217 loops. These data also suggest there is preferred orientation for the two subunits of K48 di-Ub, with Ub<sup>prox</sup> binding α5–6 and Ub<sup>dist</sup> interacting with a series of flexible loops near the C-terminus of the CL.</p><p>We then wanted to know whether the K48-linked portion of a branched chain adopts a similar orientation. Like the Ub<sup>prox</sup> from K48 di-Ub, we found that the diazirine at position-46 of the Ub<sup>prox</sup> from K6/K48 tri-Ub shows a strong preference for crosslinking the α6 region of UCH37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), but there is significantly more crosslinking at the C-terminus of CL compared to the unbranched chain. The crosslinking pattern for the K48-linked Ub<sup>dist</sup> also resembles the Ub<sup>dist</sup> of the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>); however, there are subtle differences in the degree to which peptides from 183 to 206 and 211–217 are crosslinked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Unbranched and branched chains might therefore engage UCH37 in a similar manner, but the K48-linked portion of a branchpoint might not be confined to an orientation in which the proximal subunit is localized to the α5–6 motif. As a result, the K48-linked subunits of branched chain could be more prone to swapping positions.</p><p>The non-K48-linked subunit at a branchpoint could further enable subunits to swap positions. The crosslinking data shows that the 211–217 loop is one of the most prevalent sites trapped by the K6-linked Ub<sup>dist</sup> of K6/K48 tri-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). For position-46 of the K6-linked Ub<sup>dist</sup> to be projected toward residues 211–217, Ub<sup>prox</sup> would have to be positioned near the C-terminus of the CL thereby placing the K48-linked Ub<sup>dist</sup> at the α5–6 motif. If K48 cleavage occurs with a branched chain in this configuration, the α5–6 motif would ostensibly be the S1 site dedicated to isopeptidase activity. Regardless of the precise orientation of the two K48-linked subunits, our data unexpectedly place the scissile bond on the opposite face relative to the cS1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), suggesting cleavage occurs from the backside.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Docking models of the K48 di-ubiquitin (Ub):UCH37•RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> complex.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) HADDOCK docking models show two poses corresponding to the interaction between K48 di-Ub and UCH37 along with their fit to experimental small-angle X-ray scattering data of the K48 di-Ub:UCH37<sup>C88A</sup>•RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup> complex.

We therefore measured the frequency with which residues of UCH37 and Ub come into close contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). Residues deemed significant are two standard deviations from the mean. Based on this analysis, it is evident that the conserved aromatic residues F117 and F121 form the nexus of the α5–6 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This aromatic-rich region interacts with the I44 patch of Ub regardless of the orientation of K48 di-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). When Ub<sup>prox</sup> is docked at α5–6 (pose 1), I44 and F45 form contacts with both F117 and F121 of UCH37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Swapping Ub<sup>prox</sup> with Ub<sup>dist</sup> (pose 2), forces L8, I44, and V70 of Ub to interact with F117 and F121 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The preference for Ub<sup>prox</sup> binding to α5–6 could, in part, stem from polar contacts, as there are three residues in α5–6 (E116, S120, and D122) predicted to engage Ub<sup>prox</sup> and only two for Ub<sup>dist</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>L181 of UCH37 appears to play an integral role in the second Ub-binding site. In one docking model, L181 contacts L8 of Ub<sup>dist</sup>, and in another it is near I44 of Ub<sup>prox</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). Additional contacts are established with other residues located in different loop regions, for example, E160 and W58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), or with a backbone amide of Ub<sup>prox</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These models suggest that binding to both backside sites can only be accomplished with the K48 linkage, as other linkages do not place the two I44 patches in the correct orientation for engagement. The models also suggest cleavage of the K48 isopeptide bond could occur from the backside if there is movement of residues surrounding the active site (e.g. Q82 in pose 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>An aromatic-rich motif in α5–6 is required for backside binding</title><p>Targeted mutagenesis confirms the importance of the α5–6 motif and L181 in K48-specific binding.

This issue is certainly germane to Ub<sup>prox</sup> considering the spectrum of this subunit in the presence of the C88A complex is nearly identical that of mono-Ub bound to the same complex. The spectra collected for Ub<sup>dist</sup>, however, tell a different story. A marked upfield shift in the <sup>1</sup>H dimension is observed for Ub<sup>dist</sup> I44 in the presence of the C88A complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The same peak is completely absent from the spectrum of Ub<sup>dist</sup> bound to the F117A complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Proteins that are uniquely upregulated by UCH37<sup>F117A</sup> participate in mitochondrial membrane organization, mitochondrial transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and nucleotide metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These data suggest that the backside, and thus K48 chain binding and debranching, is important for regulating the levels of proteins related to mitochondrial function and nucleotide metabolism during oxidative stress. By contrast, the frontside appears to regulate the abundance of proteins involved in chromosome organization, DNA metabolism, and DNA repair, as evidenced by an accumulation upon expression of UCH37<sup>I216E</sup>.</p><p>To validate these findings, we wanted to examine the effects of UCH37<sup>I216E</sup> and UCH37<sup>F117A</sup> on the turnover of specific proteins exhibiting higher abundance upon expression of the latter but not the former. We chose to focus on POLR2D and mitofusin-2 (MFN2). POLR2D (also referred to as Rpb4) regulates various stages of the mRNA life cycle through its interactions with RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farago et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goler-Baron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harel-Sharvit et al., 2010</xref>). MFN2 is a conserved dynamin-like GTPase localized to the outer membrane of mitochondria, and along with MFN1, regulates mitochondrial dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zorzano et al., 2010</xref>). We first compared the levels of POLR2D and MFN2 in WT and UCH37<sup>KO</sup> cells by immunoblotting and found that both proteins are more abundant in the absence of UCH37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). We then assessed relative turnover rates. In WT cells, POLR2D and MFN2 are rapidly depleted after shutting off translation; however, in UCH37<sup>KO</sup> cells, both proteins remain relatively stable, indicating that turnover is impaired without UCH37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Degradation of POLR2D and MFN2 can only be rescued in UCH37<sup>KO</sup> cells expressing UCH37<sup>I216E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting the turnover of these proteins is regulated by the K48 chain-specific binding and debranching activity of UCH37.</p><p>Lastly, we sought to check whether heterotypic chains bearing K48 linkages accumulate on the putative substrates in the absence of UCH37. MFN2 has previously been shown to be modified with K6-linked chains during mitochondrial stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gersch et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we used a K6-specific affimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Michel et al., 2017</xref>) to isolate polyubiquitinated proteins from WT and UCH37<sup>KO</sup> cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Western blot analysis of the K6-linked conjugates shows higher levels of polyubiquitinated MFN2 (polyUb-MFN2) and K48 linkages in UCH37<sup>KO</sup> cells relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increases the overall amounts. Addition of the K48 linkage-specific DUB OTUB1 results in the cleavage of Ub conjugates attached to MFN2, indicating the K6 chains also contain K48 linkages, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Michel et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the ability of UCH37•RPN13 to hydrolyze polyUb-MFN2 argues that the K6/K48 chains have branchpoints. These data therefore point to specific substrate proteins whose degradation is potentiated by the ability of UCH37 to debranch K48 Ub chains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we describe how UCH37—a DUB with fundamental roles in chromatin biology and protein degradation—achieves specificity for K48 Ub chains. The surprising finding is that the cS1 site, which is thought to be the principal Ub-binding site, is dispensable for K48-linkage-specific binding. Specificity is instead accomplished by avid binding to the opposite face of the enzyme relative to the S1 site. Mutational analysis shows the backside is not only required for K48 chain binding but also chain debranching and the ability of UCH37 to promote proteasomal degradation. Defects in the cS1 site and backside have distinct effects on the turnover of a subset of proteins, enabling the identification of branched chain-modified substrates whose degradation depends on UCH37. These results raise an intriguing question of whether some DUBs use more than one S1 site to perform different biochemical activities.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A model for chain debranching</title><p>Considering the mechanisms by which some USP DUBs target both Ub chains and ubiquitinated substrates, the most logical model for the different activities of UCH37 would invoke a single S1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). USP30, for example, is thought to use the same S1 site to cleave K6-linked Ub chains and remove Ub from numerous mitochondrial outer membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gersch et al., 2017</xref>). Chain type specificity and substrate promiscuity are both possible due to an accessible active site geometry and the presence of a second Ub-binding site, termed the S1´ site. A similar scenario can be envisioned for UCH37. When the substrate is a C-terminal adduct or an N-terminally ubiquitinated protein, the Ub moiety interacts with the cS1 site and the scissile peptide bond enters the active site because the flexible CL moves out of the way. By contrast, when the substrate is a branched Ub chain, the distal moiety binds the S1 site and the proximal Ub interacts with a portion of the CL only if a K48 linkage is present between the two subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Our data, however, suggest that in addition to the cS1 site there is another S1 site located on the backside (termed noncanonical S1 or ncS1 site) dedicated to binding and catalyzing K48 chain debranching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Whether the α5–6 motif or the region containing the CL and L181 serves as the ncS1 site depends on the orientation of the K48 chain most conducive to catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Unbranched K48 chains, which are generally poor substrates, appear to preferentially bind the proximal Ub at the α5–6 motif. In this orientation, molecular docking analysis suggests the isopeptide bond would be sterically shielded from the catalytic Cys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; pose 1). An arrangement that might be more catalytically productive is one in which the two subunits swap positions. With the proximal Ub near the CL and L181, the K48 distal Ub can still interact with the α5–6 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), but the scissile bond could be in a better position for cleavage as the docking model shows that the only residue blocking access to C88 is Q82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; pose 2).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed debranching model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface depiction of UCH37 showing the canonical S1 (cS1) ubiquitin (Ub)-binding site and the new K48-specific binding sites identified in this study. (<bold>B</bold>) Proposed mechanism for chain debranching using the K48-specific binding sites. The K48-linked portion of a branched chain engages the K48-specific Ub-binding sites in two different orientations: one with the proximal Ub (Ub<sup>prox</sup>) docked at the α5–6 motif and the other with the distal Ub (Ub<sup>dist</sup>) bound to that site. As the docking models show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), the K48 isopeptide bond is less obstructed and closer to the catalytic C88 residue when the K48 Ub<sup>dist</sup> moiety is bound to α5–6 and Ub<sup>prox</sup> is bound near the L181 region. In this orientation, the other Ub<sup>dist</sup> at the branchpoint is positioned near the frontside of the enzyme. With K48 isopeptide bond cleavage occurring on the backside, the α5–6 motif would serve as the noncanonical S1 (ncS1) site and the L181 region would be the ncS1´ site.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76100-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>How the third Ub that branches off from the proximal subunit facilitates isopeptidase activity remains an open question. One possibility is that it provides enough steric bulk to shift the equilibrium in favor of the proximal subunit binding near the CL and L181, which would allow the isopeptide bond to move closer to the catalytic Cys. However, this model alone does not explain why Ub must be at all three positions of a branchpoint, as we have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deol et al., 2020</xref>), nor does it explain the enhanced selectivity and debranching activity conferred by RPN13. Another scenario, more consistent with the data, is one in which the non-K48 distal Ub forms weak interactions with the frontside of the enzyme, for example, the 211–217 loop. The precise orientation is unknown but considering the I216E substitution does not affect the rate of debranching, the nature of the interaction between the non-K48 distal Ub and the frontside is unlikely to resemble mono-Ub binding the cS1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). With the non-K48 distal Ub on the frontside, the proximal Ub would be forced to reside near the CL and L181 and the K48 distal Ub would be bound to the α5–6 motif. Cleavage of the branched chain would mean the α5–6 motif acts as the ncS1 site. Thus, UCH37 could potentially use distinct S1 sites for different biochemical functions. Future studies will focus on elucidating the precise mechanism by which UCH37 together with RPN13 discerns between unbranched and branched chains.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Substrates requiring the debranching activity of UCH37 for degradation</title><p>The different biochemical activities of UCH37 present challenges in pinpointing which proteins depend on the K48 chain debranching activity for degradation. This issue can be addressed with mutants that specifically disrupt K48 chain binding and debranching without altering hydrolytic activity, that is, F117A and F121A. By comparing the effects of UCH37<sup>F117A</sup>, UCH37<sup>F121A</sup>, and UCH37<sup>I216E</sup>, on total protein abundance we found that the mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2 and the RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2D depend on the K48 chain binding and debranching activity of UCH37 for degradation. Previous studies have shown that MFN2 is polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome in response to cellular stress. The E3 ligase HUWE1 modifies MFN2 with Ub chains bearing a mixture of K6, K11, and K48 linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leboucher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Michel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Senyilmaz et al., 2015</xref>). Our results are not only consistent with these findings, but also provide direct evidence that the chains attached to MFN2 contain branchpoints that are removed by UCH37 to facilitate degradation.</p><p>Why chain debranching is required for the efficient removal of MFN2, or any other protein, by the proteasome is less clear. There could be several reasons. For example, the removal of branchpoints could assist in the transfer of a polyubiquitinated protein from an effector protein to the proteasome. The proteasomal shuttle protein HHR23A contains two Ub-binding UBA domains, one with a preference for K48 linkages and the other displaying no linkage selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sims et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Varadan et al., 2005</xref>). Coordination between the two UBA domains could enable high affinity binding to a K48 branched chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haakonsen and Rape, 2019</xref>). This would prioritize branched chain-modified substrates for degradation, but debranching would have to occur to allow the proteasome to takeover. A similar scenario can be envisioned for the transfer of substrates between the AAA + ATPase p97/VCP and the proteasome, as p97 is required for the degradation of MFN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>) and been shown to act as an effector of branched chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yau et al., 2017</xref>). In our in vitro degradation assays, however, these shuttling factors are largely absent.</p><p>The model we favor is one in which debranching facilitates clearance of chains removed by the intrinsic proteasomal DUB RPN11 after each round of degradation. Unfolding and translocating Ub chains through the pore of the proteasome present a major roadblock for the degradation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Worden et al., 2017</xref>). Cotranslocational removal of Ub modifications by the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent JAMM/MPN DUB RPN11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yao and Cohen, 2002</xref>), which resides directly above the entrance to the pore of the 19 S AAA + ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dambacher et al., 2016</xref>), alleviates this issue. However, the Ub chains that are cleaved en bloc by RPN11 can remain bound to the proteasome and inhibit additional rounds of degradation. This scenario could be more acute with branched chains compared to their unbranched counterparts considering the 19 S subunit RPN1 strongly prefers binding K11/K48 branched chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boughton et al., 2020</xref>). Debranching by UCH37 could then attenuate Ub chain binding, freeing the Ub receptors of the proteasome for another round of degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for UCH37-catalyzed debranching in the INO80 complex</title><p>Structural studies have elegantly shown that the DEUBAD domain of the INO80 subunit NFRKB/INO80G (INO80G<sup>DEUBAD</sup>) inhibits binding of Ub to UCH37 by obscuring elements comprising the cS1 Ub-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sahtoe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vander Linden et al., 2015</xref>). The principal driver of the blockade is the interaction between the L38 pocket of the S1 site and the FRF loop of INO80G<sup>DEUBAD</sup>. What is also striking about the structure of UCH37•INO80G<sup>DEUBAD</sup>, is the extended helix α6 of INO80G<sup>DEUBAD</sup> that drapes over the backside of the enzyme. Y142 in α6 forms direct contacts with L181 on the backside of UCH37. According to our data, L181 comprises a backside Ub-binding site. Thus, in addition to the cS1 site, key residues of the K48 chain-specific binding site could be blocked by INO80G<sup>DEUBAD</sup>. This suggests the INO80 complex could potentially inactivate all activities of UCH37. That said, the INO80 complex is instrumental in many of the same biological processes upregulated in knockout cells expressing the UCH37<sup>I216E</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Poli et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that UCH37 functions primarily through the cS1 site in the context of entire INO80 complex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our data uncover an entirely unique region of UCH37 required for K48 chain specificity, chain debranching, and promoting the proteasomal degradation of branched chain-modified proteins. What is particularly exciting is the prospect that a DUB can use different S1 sites to target Ub chains and ubiquitinated substrates, suggesting inhibitors could be designed to block one activity but not the other. For instance, a small molecule that specifically blocks Ub chain binding and debranching could serve as a powerful tool to probe the role of UCH37-catalyzed debranching in many biological paradigms.</p><p>Our findings could also be relevant to other UCH family members. The tumor suppressor BAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbone et al., 2013</xref>), which has been implicated in various cellular processes, shares 42% sequence identity with the CD of UCH37. The aromatic residues forming the nexus of UCH37’s K48 chain-specific binding and debranching activities are also conserved in BAP1 (F118 and F122). Due to the ability to deubiquitinate histone H2AK119ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sahtoe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheuermann et al., 2010</xref>), most studies have focused on the nuclear activities of BAP1. Much less is known about BAP1’s cytoplasmic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Szczepanski and Wang, 2021</xref>). Using the backside aromatic-rich motif, it is possible that cytoplasmic BAP1 acts in a K48 chain editing capacity, with target specificity dictated by many of its interacting partners.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>*All materials written in the following format: REAGENT/ RESOURCE (Source, Identifier).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Anti UCH37 (Abcam, Cat. #

The q-range sampled was from 0.013 to 0.5 Å<sup>–1</sup>, where q = 4πsinθ/λ and 2θ is the measured scattering angle. Three second exposures are collected for each frame over the course of 40 min during the SEC run. SEC-SAXS chromatographs are generated, and initial SAXS curves are analyzed using Scatter. Samples were analyzed at room temperature in 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM TCEP.

Quenched samples were immediately injected into the HDX platform. Upon injection, samples were passed through an immobilized pepsin column (2.1 × 30 mm) (Waters Corp.) at 150 µL/min for inline digestion.

The resulting MS data files were submitted to ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) 3.0 software (Waters Corp.) to identify the peptic peptides in the undeuterated protein samples. Peptides included in the HDX analysis peptide set had a PLGS score greater than 7, and the MS spectra were verified by manual inspection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26-3"><title>Data processing</title><p>Data from peptic peptides generated from PLGS were imported into DynamX 3.0 (Waters Corp.), with peptide quality thresholds of MS1 signal intensity greater than 5000, maximum mass error of 1 ppm, minimum products per amino acid greater than 0.3, and PLGS score greater than 7. Following the automated peptide search and ion detection, each spectrum was manually inspected to ensure the corresponding m/z and isotopic distributions at various charge states were properly assigned to the appropriate peptic peptide. The relative deuterium incorporation plot and overall deuterium uptake heat map for each peptic peptide were generated by DynamX 3.0. DynamX 3.0 calculated the relative deuterium incorporation by subtracting the weight-averaged centroid mass of the isotopic distribution of peptic peptides of undeuterated sample from that of samples exposed to deuterated buffer at various time points. All HDX-MS experiments were performed in triplicate, with single preparations of each purified protein complex. Since all differential HDX-MS experiments were conducted under the same conditions, the differences in the back exchange for each experiment would be negligible. Thus, the reported deuterium uptake levels are relative, neglecting the effect of the back exchange. The percent relative deuterium uptake was calculated by dividing the relative deuterium uptake of each peptic peptide by its theoretical maximum uptake. To generate heat maps of individual residues, the HDX data from all overlapping peptides were consolidated to individual amino acid values by averaging each residue. Briefly, for each residue, the deuterium incorporation values were calculated by dividing the total relative deuterium uptake of the peptic peptide by the peptide length. The differential deuterium uptake plot was generated by subtracting the relative deuterium uptake of peptic peptide of one complex by that of another. Statistical significance for the differential HDX data is determined by t-test for each time point, and a 98% confidence limit for the uncertainty of the mean relative deuterium uptake of ±0.6 Da was calculated as described. Differences in deuterium uptake between two states that exceed 0.6 Da is considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Lentivirus packaging, infection, and cell line creation</title><p>Lentiviral packaging and target cell transductions were performed by the Cell Culture Core Facility at UMASS Amherst’s Institute for Applied Life Sciences (Amherst, MA).

MS3 precursors were fragmented by high energy CID with 55% energy and analyzed using the Orbitrap (AGC 5 × 104; maximum injection time 150 ms, resolution was 10,000 at 2 Th isolation window).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>E.R.S. declares outside interest in Relay Therapeutics</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Resources, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Resources, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76100-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>Tables of ITC, SEC-MALs, FP, Ub-AMC kinetics, SucLLVY, emetine chase, AHA pulse chase and TMT correlation analysis.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76100-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata2"><label>Source data 2.</label><caption><title>Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry analysis of UCH37 and RPN13<sup>DEUBAD</sup>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76100-data2-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata3"><label>Source data 3.</label><caption><title>Tandem Mass Tagging proteomics analysis.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76100-data3-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata4"><label>Source data 4.</label><caption><title>Uncropped gel images of Western blot analysis and gel based kinetic analysis.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76100-data4-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata5"><label>Source data 5.</label><caption><title>Full NMR spectra of mono-Ub and K48 di-Ub in presence and absence of UCH37.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76100-data5-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting figures; Source Data files have been provided for all of the Figures.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Babik</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Deol</surname><given-names>KK</given-names></name><name><surname>Fejzo</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Tonelli</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Strieter</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyles</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2021">2021</year><data-title>A Cryptic K48 Ubiquitin Chain Binding Site on UCH37 is Required for its Role in Proteasomal Degradation</data-title><source>Mendeley Data</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.17632/423f5cj79n.1</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the NIH (RO1GM110543 to E.R.S.) and a NIH Chemistry and Biology Training Grant (T32GM008515 to J.D. and S.B.).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Andreas Martin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers primarily asked for clarifications, some additional information about experimental conditions, editing of the text, and possibly a better representation of the main findings, summarized in a model that illustrates the most likely pose of backside-bound branched ubiquitin and how it could reach the catalytic Cys.</p><p>2) To further elucidate the role of UCH37 for proteasomal substate degradation, distinguish between Ub-chain binding and debranching contributions, and assess the reason for the observed strong degradation inhibition when the backside binding site is mutated, it would be helpful to include a direct comparison between degradation data for backside-mutant and catalytically inactive UCH37, at least for the in vitro experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript provides important new insights into UCH37-mediated ubiquitin binding and cleavage at the 26S proteasome, and is therefore well suited for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after some concerns listed below have been addressed.</p><p>1) The HDX data in Figure S2 F and H show a stronger protection of the backside binding site by the branched Ub trimer if the front S1 site is occupied by a crosslinked mono-ubiquitin. The authors may consider commenting on this apparently better binding. Is this due to the differences in available binding sites or possibly indicating some sort of cooperativity?</p><p>2) When characterizing critical residues for backside Ub binding, the authors report ~ 20-fold reduced UCH37 debranching activity for the F117A and F121A mutants, and the table in Figure 6A lists kcat/Km values, but N/A for kcat and Km. How was kcat/Km determined, if the individual values are N/A?</p><p>(Also, the header of the table in Figure 6A should say &quot;enzyme&quot; not &quot;substrate&quot;).</p><p>3) It is observed that proteasomes replenished with F117A or F121A mutant UCH37 fail to in-vitro degrade titin I27 or UBE2S-UBD model substrates carrying branched ubiquitin chains. This finding is intriguing, considering that the main proteasomal deubiquitinase Rpn11 cleaves off entire ubiquitin chains, and proteasomes for instance in budding yeast lack UCH37.</p><p>It would be worth testing proteasomes with catalytically inactive UCH37-C88A in these in vitro degradation experiments to distinguish whether UCH37's debranching activity is indeed required, or its backside binding may act as a receptor in orienting a substrate for degradation.</p><p>Based on their findings with cellular substrates, the authors hypothesize in the discussion that debranching may assist in the transfer of polyubiquitinated substrates from an effector protein to the proteasome, yet none such effector was present in the in vitro degradation experiments, and further investigating the role of UCH37 binding versus debranching may shine more light on that.</p><p>4) It is surprising that the turnover of AHA-labeled newly synthesized proteins (NSPs) in cells is completely inhibited by UCH37-F117A containing proteasomes (Figure 6H). Are indeed ALL NSPs expected to contain branched ubiquitin chains and depend on debranching for degradation?</p><p>In this regard it would also be interesting to know what approximate fraction of the GFPU model substrate contains branched chains.</p><p>Do the authors assume a possible dominant inhibitory effect of the UCH37 backside mutations, maybe because substrate-removed ubiquitin chains cannot be efficiently cleared or dissociate from the proteasome if they are still branched? Would the authors expect a difference between multiple- and single-turnover degradation of their polyubiquitinated titin or UBE2S model substrates?</p><p>Consistent with an inhibitory effect could also be that replenishing proteasomes in cells with the UCH37-F117A mutant apparently leads to 20% lower GFPU degradation than having no UCH37 at all (Figure 6G), and the authors may comment on that.</p><p>5) At odds with the observation that all NSPs are affected by the UCH37-F117A mutation appears to be that WT and UCH37-KO cells show only a minimal difference in total protein levels (Figure S7), and exposure to oxidative stress through treatment with H2O2 was necessary to see a significant difference suitable for the TMT-based proteomics experiments. In this context as well, the authors should consider testing the catalytically inactive UCH37-C88A mutant in comparison with the binding-deficient F117A mutant and the UCH37 KO.</p><p>Throughout the discussion, it is claimed that the turnover of various cellular proteins, including POLR2D and MFN2, is regulated by the K48 chain-specific binding and debranching activity of UCH37. However, only the binding aspect was directly assessed through the backside mutations, whereas the role of debranching activity in comparison was not tested, but implied.</p><p>6) The manuscript would benefit from a more specific model on how backside-bound branched ubiquitin chain may be oriented and get cleaved using the catalytic C88. Of course, the available data do currently not allow a detailed mechanistic view of debranching, but the discussion of binding modes and how a branched Ub chain may reach the catalytic active site could be improved to leave the reader with a more specific model than what is currently presented (e.g. in Figure 7I).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript is an important contribution to the field and worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The comments below mostly offer suggestions to make the manuscript more accessible to a general audience.</p><p>Introduction: The authors should define 'S1' to make the manuscript more accessible to all readers.</p><p>Figure 1: In panel E (the SEC-MALS experiment), what is the peak that elutes at 19 minutes for sample UCH37(CD)C88A:K48 triUb?</p><p>On p. 6, it's stated that Rpn13-DEUBAD addition enables investigation of a wider range of Ub interactions, but it's not clear why this would be the case.</p><p>The use of the word 'extant' at line 169 p. 6 may need to be checked and as well in a later appearance.</p><p>Figure 2: residues in the surface diagrams should be labeled, especially on the rotated structures. It might also be worth labeling where the S1 site is.</p><p>The acronym CL for cross-over loop on p. 6 is not defined, nor introduced.</p><p>In Figure 3 would be more useful if it also included the location of the catalytic cysteine (C88), the canonical S1 site labeled, and more residue numbers. This same recommendation applies to Figure S3D. The table in Figure S3C would be more useful if it was color coded (or indicated in some other way) to show peptides corresponding to the front versus back binding site.</p><p>p. 9, line 270: the relative differences for peptides 183-206 and 211-217 should be explicitly stated, possibly better represented by normalizing and plotting the data in Figure S3C, and/or Figure 3 could be referenced here.</p><p>Figure 4: Pose 3 seems to be unsupported by the data shown in Figure 3. How does the SAXS data fit to the UCH37:Rpn13-DEUBAD structure without ubiquitin? This could be used as an indicator of the sensitivity of this method to Ub binding in this context. Perhaps pose 3 should be tested further if included as a main figure by adding di-Ub to Rpn13-DEUBAD bound to the ULD. To avoid confusion, the word 'model' should probably be included with 'Pose'. Similarly, D-H could be confused as definitive structures. To validate the models further, amino acid charge swapping could done for panels F, G and H. This additional experimental data may not be necessary if it's clearer that the structures shown are only models.</p><p>Figure 5: The molar ratio and concentrations should be included for the NMR data. What are the small peaks that appear in some but not all spectra – for example in the complex of B (green), free state for D and monoUb of the F117A complex of F? Why do they vary in intensity? Also why does I44 at the apparent free state position seem to have a split resonance peak shape in the complexed F117A sample? Perhaps the free monoUb spectrum should be included for comparison.</p><p>The HDX data seem to indicate that monoUb binds to the front side and the F117A mutation is in the backside. However monoUb binding is apparently affected by NMR in the F117A mutation (Figure 5F). This combination of data seems to suggest that the F117A mutation causes allosteric effects at the frontside as well as loss of binding to the backside. If true this may affect interpretation of the data in Figure 6 and 7.</p><p>Figure 7I needs labeling. What is in orange exactly? Is the model trying to show a Ub in the chain binding to the DEUBAD in the backside binding mode? This figure amplifies concerns regarding Figure 4. There is NMR evidence that Rpn13-DEUBAD does not bind to monoUb albeit without UCH37 present (DOI 10.1016/j.molcel.2010.04.019, Figure S4A).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76100.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript provides important new insights into UCH37-mediated ubiquitin binding and cleavage at the 26S proteasome, and is therefore well suited for publication in eLife after some concerns listed below have been addressed.</p><p>1) The HDX data in Figure S2 F and H show a stronger protection of the backside binding site by the branched Ub trimer if the front S1 site is occupied by a crosslinked mono-ubiquitin.

Mol Cell 2020 and data now shown in Figure 2 – Supplementary Figure 2), suggesting there is little cooperativity when Ub occupies the S1 site. Moreover, the addition of K48 di-Ub also results in stronger protection on the backside when the S1 site is blocked (compare Figure 2C and 2D) and the measured K<sub>d</sub>s for binding free and Ub-bound forms are nearly the same.</p><p>We surmise that when the S1 site is free, a Ub chain can sample either the front or backside of UCH37. However, when the S1 site is blocked, binding only occurs on the backside. This shift in the population of Ub chain bound UCH37 could lead to stronger protection on the backside. We have added a few sentences in the text to clarify the differences we observe in the uptake plots:</p><p>“It appears that when Ub is conjugated to UCH37, binding of either K48 di-Ub or K6/K48 tri-Ub affords stronger protection of the α5–6 motif (Figures 2D, S2H). This could be due to an allosteric effect resulting in enhanced binding or a situation in which K48 chains only interact with the backside because sampling of both faces is shutdown. Binding data support the latter by showing that Ub conjugation does not improve the affinity toward K48 di-Ub or K6/K48 tri-Ub (Figure 2 – Supplementary Figure 2).” Pages 7-8, Lines 216-222.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) When characterizing critical residues for backside Ub binding, the authors report ~ 20-fold reduced UCH37 debranching activity for the F117A and F121A mutants, and the table in Figure 6A lists kcat/Km values, but N/A for kcat and Km.

In this initial submission, we show that proteasomes replenished with inactive UCH37 C88A (rC88A) are unable to promote the degradation of polyubiquitinated titan and UBE2S-UBD (Figure 6D). We also show similar results in our 2020 Molecular Cell paper. The results mirror those using proteasomes replenished with either F117A or F121A (shown in the same gel as rC88A; Figure 6D). Thus, the failure to degrade proteins by UCH37 C88A- or F117A/F121A-replenished proteasomes suggests the lack of activity with the latter is due to the inability to debranch and not just the loss of K48 chain binding. We realize the significance of these findings was not clearly conveyed in the main text. We have now added a sentence clarifying our findings:</p><p>“In the presence of K6/K48 and K48/K63 HMW Ub chains, WT- and I216E-replenished (rWT and rI216E) Ptsms generate smaller Ub conjugates, but the results with F117A- and F121A-replenished (rF117A and rF121A) Ptsms essentially mirror those with the inactive rC88A variant (Figure 6C). Degradation is also affected by F117A and F121A. Using K11/K48-polyUb-UBE2S-UBD and K48/K63-polyUb-titin-I27<sup>V15P</sup> as substrates, a decrease in polyubiquitinated species and a concomitant increase in Ptsm-derived peptides is observed with rWT and rI216E Ptsms but not with rF117A, rF121A, and rC88A Ptsms (Figure 6D).</p><p>Because the rC88A Ptsms retain the ability to bind K48 chains, these results imply that the loss of chain debranching, not just chain binding, leads to the failure to degrade branched polyubiquitinated proteins.” Page 14, lines 410-418.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on their findings with cellular substrates, the authors hypothesize in the discussion that debranching may assist in the transfer of polyubiquitinated substrates from an effector protein to the proteasome, yet none such effector was present in the in vitro degradation experiments, and further investigating the role of UCH37 binding versus debranching may shine more light on that.</p></disp-quote><p>Effector proteins are indeed absent from our in vitro degradation assays. In the revised Discussion, we state that due to the absence of effector proteins in our degradation assays, we favor a model in which chain debranching by UCH37 facilitates the clearance of chains removed by RPN11 after each round of degradation. Thus, UCH37 prevents product inhibition.</p><p>“In our in vitro degradation assays, however, these shuttling factors are largely absent.</p><p>The model we favor is one in which debranching facilitates clearance of chains removed by the intrinsic proteasomal DUB RPN11 after each round of degradation. Unfolding and translocating Ub chains through the pore of the proteasome presents a major roadblock for the degradation process (Worden et al., 2017). Co-translocational removal of Ub modifications by the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent JAMM/MPN DUB RPN11 (Verma et al., 2002; Yao and Cohen, 2002), which resides directly above the entrance to the pore of the 19S AAA+ ATPases (Dambacher et al., 2016), alleviates this issue. However, the Ub chains that are cleaved en bloc by RPN11 can remain bound to the proteasome and inhibit additional rounds of degradation. This scenario could be more acute with branched chains compared to their unbranched counterparts considering the 19S subunit RPN1 strongly prefers binding K11/K48 branched chains (Fushman Structure paper). Debranching by UCH37 could then attenuate Ub chain binding, freeing the Ub receptors of the proteasome for another round of degradation.” Page 20, lines 600-612.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is surprising that the turnover of AHA-labeled newly synthesized proteins (NSPs) in cells is completely inhibited by UCH37-F117A containing proteasomes (Figure 6H). Are indeed ALL NSPs expected to contain branched ubiquitin chains and depend on debranching for degradation?</p><p>In this regard it would also be interesting to know what approximate fraction of the GFPU model substrate contains branched chains.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have proof that all NSPs with branched chain modification are dependent on debranching for degradation, but our data using debranching-deficient UCH37 suggests that the degradation of majority of NSPs is dependent on UCH37.</p><p>That said, this is a very interesting question. We are quite keen on understanding to what extent proteins are modified with branched chains. We are currently using various enrichment strategies along with middle-down MS to assess the degree of chain branching. Our findings will be reported in a separate manuscript in the near future.</p><p>To more directly address the reviewer’s point, the data in Figure 7H would seem to suggest that the UCH37 substrate MFN2 is primarily modified with branched chains. The addition of OTUB1 and UCH37 to polyubiquitinated MFN2 leads to nearly complete dismantling of the chains (lanes 2-3 and 5-6 in the MFN2 blot on top).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the authors assume a possible dominant inhibitory effect of the UCH37 backside mutations, maybe because substrate-removed ubiquitin chains cannot be efficiently cleared or dissociate from the proteasome if they are still branched? Would the authors expect a difference between multiple- and single-turnover degradation of their polyubiquitinated titin or UBE2S model substrates?</p></disp-quote><p>Our hypothesis is that UCH37 prevents product inhibition after each round of degradation by debranching substrate-removed ubiquitin chains and thus facilitating dissociation (see lines 594-609 in the revised manuscript). According to this model, we would predict that UCH37 would have little impact on the degradation process under single-turnover conditions. Under multi-turnover conditions, such as those reported in this manuscript, however, there would be a dependence on UCH37’s ability to debranch chains. We are currently testing this hypothesis and will report the findings in another manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Consistent with an inhibitory effect could also be that replenishing proteasomes in cells with the UCH37-F117A mutant apparently leads to 20% lower GFPU degradation than having no UCH37 at all (Figure 6G), and the authors may comment on that.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and added the following sentences.</p><p>“Of note, the degradation of GFP<sup>u</sup> is lower in cells expressing UCH37<sup>F117A</sup> compared to the null background. This could be due to an inhibitory effect caused by the inability to efficiently clear Ptsmbound Ub chains that are removed from the substrate during translocation into the proteolytic chamber (see Discussion).” Pages 14-15, lines 431-434.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) At odds with the observation that all NSPs are affected by the UCH37-F117A mutation appears to be that WT and UCH37-KO cells show only a minimal difference in total protein levels (Figure S7), and exposure to oxidative stress through treatment with H2O2 was necessary to see a significant difference suitable for the TMT-based proteomics experiments. In this context as well, the authors should consider testing the catalytically inactive UCH37-C88A mutant in comparison with the binding-deficient F117A mutant and the UCH37 KO.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 6I, the majority of NSPs are turned over rather quickly. Most short-lived proteins are in low abundance (Li et al. Mol Cell 2021) and thus difficult to detect under steady-state conditions such as those in Figure 7 – Supplementary Figure 1. Thus, we think there is little overlap between the NSPs in Figure 6I and the proteins in Figure 7 – Supplementary Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout the discussion, it is claimed that the turnover of various cellular proteins, including POLR2D and MFN2, is regulated by the K48 chain-specific binding and debranching activity of UCH37. However, only the binding aspect was directly assessed through the backside mutations, whereas the role of debranching activity in comparison was not tested, but implied.</p></disp-quote><p>In in vitro degradation experiments we found that proteasomes replenished with either inactive UCH37 (C88A) or backside mutants fail to degrade two different substrates with different branched chains (Figure 6D). If the inability to bind chains with the backside mutant was the sole reason for the impaired degradation, then we would expect to observe degradation with the binding competent C88A mutant. However, C88A also shuts down the degradation of branched chain-modified proteins (Figure 6D). Based on these results, we thus assume that the turnover of proteins like POLR2D and MFN2 is regulated by the K48 chain-specific binding and debranching activity of UCH37.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The manuscript would benefit from a more specific model on how backside-bound branched ubiquitin chain may be oriented and get cleaved using the catalytic C88. Of course, the available data do currently not allow a detailed mechanistic view of debranching, but the discussion of binding modes and how a branched Ub chain may reach the catalytic active site could be improved to leave the reader with a more specific model than what is currently presented (e.g. in Figure 7I).</p></disp-quote><p>We added Figure 4I to show how the isopeptide bond is positioned relative to the catalytic cysteine in two different docking models.

The S1 site is composed of a series of residues that form a rim leading into the active site (Figure 1A). The DEUBAD domain of RPN13 further promotes Ub binding by properly positioning both the flexible active site crossover loop (CL), which is a characteristic feature of all UCHs (Johnston et al., 1999; Popp et al., 2009), and the C-terminal helical region of UCH37. One would therefore speculate that during chain debranching, the S1 site would be occupied by the K48-linked distal Ub, as this subunit is the one removed from the branched chain (Figure 1B). In this orientation, the other two Ub subunits at the branchpoint would also be expected to engage UCH37; however, the precise mechanism by which branched chains are selectively processed by UCH37 remains unknown. A region that has received little attention in any of the UCHs is the face located on the opposite side of the CL relative to the S1 site. We thought that by defining how K48 chains interact with UCH37, we could begin to dissect the impact of K48 chain binding and debranching on a proteome-wide level.” Page 4, lines 109-124.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: In panel E (the SEC-MALS experiment), what is the peak that elutes at 19 minutes for sample UCH37(CD)C88A:K48 triUb?</p></disp-quote><p>The UV peak at 19 minutes does not have any light scattering data, therefore no molecular weight information can be extracted from the peak.

In the spectrum with the F117A mutant, we are now only looking at binding to one of those sites, namely the frontside.

In the I216E complex, we observe resonances corresponding to the bound and unbound states of monoUb. However, in the spectrum with the C88A complex, we only observe the bound peaks.
