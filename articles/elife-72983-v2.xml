ontogeny of differentiation. The origin of new cells needed to regenerate lost tissue, and whether they are pluripotent or have de- or trans-differentiated, remains one of the most important open questions . Additionally, it is not known whether developmental gene regulatory networks are reused or whether regeneration specific networks are deployed. Echinoderms, including sea stars, have extensive ability for regeneration, however, the technologies for obtaining transgenic echinoderms are limited and tracking cells involved in regeneration, and thus identifying the cellular sources and potencies has proven challenging. In this study, we develop new transgenic tools to follow the fate of populations of cells in the regenerating larva of the sea star <italic>Patiria miniata</italic>. We show that the larval serotonergic nervous system can regenerate following decapitation. Using a BAC-transgenesis approach we show that expression of the pan ectodermal marker, <italic>sox2</italic>, is induced in previously <italic>sox2</italic> minus cells , even when cell division is inhibited. <italic>sox2</italic>+ cells give rise to new <italic>sox4</italic>+ neural precursors that then proceed along an embryonic neurogenesis pathway to reform the anterior nervous systems. sox2+ cells contribute to only neural and ectoderm lineages, indicating that these progenitors maintain their normal, embryonic lineage restriction. This indicates that sea star larval regeneration uses a combination of existing lineage restricted stem cells, as well as respecification of cells into neural lineages, and at least partial reuse of developmental GRNs to regenerate their nervous system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Patiria miniata</kwd><kwd>sea star</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>lineage conversion</kwd><kwd>specification</kwd><kwd>sox genes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF.

Decades of research have provided extensive understanding of how embryonic cells acquire their fate through the action of GRNs and the sequential turning on, and off, of regulatory genes. During embryogenesis, these developmental GRNs start from a very particular cell type, the single-celled zygote, while in regeneration another source of multi-, or toti-potent cells must be the source of cells for regeneration. The source of the cells, their molecular state and how, or even whether, developmental GRNs are re-established in these cells are open questions. This knowledge, however, is needed as a prerequisite for understanding the molecular mechanisms of regeneration. Furthermore, an understanding of whether any processes are homologous or if there are taxon-specific mechanisms that are related to the ability for extensive or limited regeneration awaits sufficient sampling across the metazoa.</p><p>The deuterostomes, that is vertebrates, invertebrate chordates, echinoderms and hemichordates, are an especially important system to study from the standpoint of regeneration. The vertebrates, with some few exceptions, have limited capacity for regeneration that is usually restricted to specific cells, tissues and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodriguez and Kang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>). The emerging evidence points to the use of tissue-specific stem cells and corresponding specific niches as a cellular source for regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kragl et al., 2009</xref>). Echinoderms on the other hand have an impressive ability for extensive whole body regeneration found in most species of the phylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferrario et al., 2020</xref>). For this reason, there has been extensive research into the mechanisms of regeneration in many species of echinoderms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferrario et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kondo and Akasaka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dupont and Thorndyke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piovani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vickery et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García-Arrarás et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mashanov and Zueva, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mashanov et al., 2020</xref>). For example, molecular and ultrastructural studies in brittle star arm regeneration point to use of adjacent epithelial cells to differentiate into sclerocytes needed for arm skeleton regeneration, recapitulating, at least in part, a development program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piovani et al., 2021</xref>). Comprehensive studies in the regeneration of radial nerve chords in sea cucumbers also point to the use of radial glial dedifferentiation in nervous system regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mashanov and Zueva, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mashanov et al., 2015a</xref>). The emerging consensus from these and other studies is that echinoderms rely extensively on wound-adjacent dedifferentiation for regenerating lost tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferrario et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mashanov and Zueva, 2019</xref>). Conversely, expression of stem-cell marker genes have been identified as possible cell sources in some species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mashanov et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reinardy et al., 2015</xref>). Whether echinoderms and vertebrates use similar cellular sources and mechanisms for regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joven and Simon, 2018</xref>) is important for untangling whether these mechanisms are causative of whole-body versus limited regeneration potential. Understanding these processes in naturally regenerating contexts also has important implications for improved translational applications of induced pluripotent stem cells and other stem cell therapies.</p><p>To date, however, while there has been a comprehensive series of studies of the molecular and ultrastructural basis of regeneration in many species of echinoderms, there have been no cell lineage tracking studies. Only cell tracking can definitively establish the origin and trajectory of cells during regeneration and resolve the debate as to the role of stem cells versus cellular reprogramming in echinoderms. Cell tracking, however, is technically challenging, especially in adult echinoderms where there are many cells and cell types, and regeneration proceeds over days or weeks. Transgenic tools are also limited in adult echinoderms. Indeed, the challenges associated with accurately tracking cell lineages have greatly limited the taxonomic distribution of animals for which we have this knowledge across the metazoa.</p><p>Here, we sought to fill this important gap by turning to the echinoderm larval regeneration model. Echinoderms, typically for many marine invertebrates, have a biphasic lifestyle, producing a planktonic larval form that exists for up to many months before undergoing dramatic metamorphosis. It has now been well documented that the larval forms are also capable of extensive regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oulhen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vickery et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kasahara et al., 2019</xref>). We have recently introduced the larval sea star <italic>Patiria miniata</italic> as a model system for the study of whole body regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cary et al., 2019b</xref>). Sea stars, as typical for echinoderms, have extensive regenerative capacities, a feature which extends across both their adult and larval life phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vickery et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vickery et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben Khadra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hernroth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oulhen et al., 2016</xref>). Although pentaradial as adults, there are many parallels between echinoderm larval development and early vertebrate development, particularly in the formation of the anterior-posterior axis and development of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angerer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hinman and Burke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Range et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, while vertebrates and sea stars have very different regenerative capacities, there are commonalities in their early development. There are also extensive genomic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cary and Hinman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cary et al., 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cary et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cary et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gildor et al., 2019</xref>) and detailed developmental GRNs available for <italic>P. miniata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cary et al., 2020</xref>) allows comparisons between developmental and regenerative GRNs and clear gene orthology mapping.</p><p>Previous work has shown that when these sea star larvae are decapitated, they are able to regenerate their anterior structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cary et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oulhen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vickery et al., 2001</xref>). Larvae have an anterior serotonergic nervous system, which we show here is removed by this decapitation. Extensive previous work in <italic>P. miniata</italic> embryos has shown how these neurons form during embryogenesis. The SRY-box transcription factor (TF), <italic>sox2</italic> (formerly <italic>soxb1</italic>), is expressed broadly throughout the ectoderm by blastula stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yankura et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Sox4+</italic> (formerly <italic>soxc</italic>) neural progenitors arise in the ectoderm, and then divide asymmetrically to produce LIM homeodomain TF <italic>lhx2</italic>+ (formerly <italic>lhx2/9</italic>) daughter cells, which in turn divide asymmetrically to form differentiated serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheatle Jarvela et al., 2016</xref>). This occurs within the anterior ectoderm, which expresses TFs such as <italic>six3</italic> and f<italic>oxq2</italic>, and is a <italic>wnt</italic> ligand negative territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheatle Jarvela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yankura et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we took advantage of cell-type-specific markers of differentiated neurons to confirm that the sea star larvae are able to regenerate their anterior nervous system. We establish a novel photoconvertible BAC reporter system to trace populations of cells to determine the cellular origin of these regenerated neurons. This allows us to specifically test whether regenerated neurons arise through embryonic neurogenesis pathways, and to determine the origin and potency of progenitors. Using a small molecule inhibitor of nuclear DNA replication (to question whether new gene expression can arise in the absence of divisions that are a prerequisite of stem cell origin), we show that expression of the putative pluripotency factor <italic>sox2</italic> is induced in previously <italic>sox2</italic> minus cells at the wound site. As this occurs even in the absence of new cell division, this result suggests that these cells are respecified rather than arising from asymmetric stem cell division. Both the newly induced and existing, <italic>sox2</italic>+ cells now give rise to new <italic>sox4</italic>+ neural precursors that then proceed along an embryonic neurogenesis pathway to reform the anterior nervous systems. The <italic>sox2</italic>+ cells contribute to only neural and ectoderm lineages, indicating that these progenitors maintain their normal, embryonic lineage restriction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Patiria miniata</italic> larvae fully regenerate their nervous system</title><p>Sea star bipinnaria larvae have an extensive nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murabe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakajima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hinman and Burke, 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B’’</xref> shows the 7-day post fertilization (7dpf) <italic>P. miniata</italic> larval nervous system labeled via localization of anti-synaptotagmin B (SynB) and serotonin antibodies.

This bisection, therefore, removes much of the anterior nervous system, including the anterior ciliary band loop (preoral ciliary band), the dorsal ganglia, as well as the mouth and its associated neurons. We tested whether these bisected larvae regenerate their nervous system. By one week post bisection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–C’</xref>), we find neural bodies and axonal tracts along the newly formed anterior ciliary band and complex neural networks lateral to the mouth suggestive of the dorsal ganglia. The reformed mouth also has associated neurons. We also specifically examined the serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D’–i</xref>). This neural subtype is found in the dorsal ganglia where they are present as clusters of large cell bodies with long axonal processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D’–e</xref>). These cells originally form in the anterior-most ectoderm of the late gastrula but migrate posteriorly to a location dorsal to the mouth in the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheatle Jarvela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yankura et al., 2013</xref>). Serotonergic neurons are also found on the lower lip of the mouth where they have smaller cell bodies and shorter axonal processes. We therefore reasoned that serotonergic neural bodies were removed entirely by our manual bisection protocol. Indeed, when we bisect the larvae across the midline, 40 of 45 stained larvae show no remaining serotonergic neurons 1 day later, when they were first assayed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F’–f</xref> shows one such example. Of the remaining five, only one or two cells were found which, due to their location, are likely those normally associated with the lower lip of the mouth.</p><p>By examining a time series of regeneration, we show that serotonergic neurons are first revealed by antibody staining at the anterior regenerating leading edge in 8/14 larvae 5 days following bisection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G’–g</xref>). By 7 days post bisection (dpb), serotonergic neurons are found in 12/15 regenerating larvae at the anterior edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H’–h</xref>).

It is important to note therefore, that <italic>foxq2</italic> is now expressed in cells that, in the normal larvae, reside along the middle of the AP axis and would never normally express anterior markers such as <italic>foxq2</italic>.

We have previously shown that cell division occurs throughout the normal larva, but then decreases in the early bisected larva and is then predominantly localized to the wound adjacent anterior at 3dpb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cary et al., 2019b</xref>). Thus, localized <italic>sox2</italic> expression precedes the formation of the proliferative zone but then remains within this anterior region. This regenerative proliferative zone is readily visualized by staining for 5-Ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU), by incubating larvae for one to six hours in EdU sea water. This costaining shows that <italic>sox2</italic> is highly expressed throughout this ectodermal zone and within some of these proliferating cells at 3dpb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and that this remains through to 5dpb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–g</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p><italic>Sox4</italic> expression, a marker of neural precursor cells, is also observed at the wound site within one day following bisection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–h’</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>). In 3dpb larvae, <italic>sox4</italic> expression is detected at the regeneration leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Fluorescent labels allow for the detection of coexpression of genes and colocalization of gene expression with EdU staining. The large number of cells at these stages make colocalization difficult to establish through conventional confocal microscopy and thus we used Imaris Software (Oxford Instruments) 3D visualization analysis to identify overlapping signals with confidence (Imaris visualization is shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h’ and i’</xref> j’, k1, k2).

Proliferating <italic>sox4+</italic> cells are also detected in the regenerating ectodermal/endodermal mouth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). By 5dpb, <italic>sox4</italic> expression is concentrated to the regenerating anterior, again in dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–j’</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>).</p><p>The expression of <italic>lhx2</italic> is also detected by 5-7dpb in dispersed cells at the regenerating leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> K-K2, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2J</xref>).

We modified an approach we have used previously in which eGFP (GFP) was homologously recombined into the <italic>sox4</italic> coding region of a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clone, to replace the coding sequence of sox4 with that of GFP while leaving the endogenous basal promoter and 5’UTR in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckley and Ettensohn, 2019</xref>). When the sox4:GFP recombinant BAC is injected into embryos, it faithfully expresses GFP in <italic>sox4+</italic> cells, recapitulating endogenous <italic>sox4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheatle Jarvela et al., 2016</xref>). It should be noted that transgenic DNAs are inherited mosaically and thus any individual larva expresses the reporter in only a subset of cells. This demonstrates that the approximately 150 Kbp surrounding the genomic locus of the <italic>sox4</italic> coding region, including the endogenous basal promoter, is sufficient to drive correct expression of the transgenic GFP reporter gene.</p><p>We now exchanged GFP for the photoconvertible Kaede sequence.

We therefore generated a sox2:Kaede BAC. We first tested whether this BAC recombinant recapitulated normal Sox2 expression in sea stars. After BAC injection, zygotes started to express Kaede at 24-48hpf in broad patches of ectodermal cells. By larval stage, Kaede was detected on the ectoderm including the ciliary bands, dorsal ganglia, and ectodermally derived neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C'</xref>). This localization pattern recapitulates the embryonic <italic>sox2</italic> expression pattern reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yankura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yankura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>We next generated a sox4:Cardinal BAC recombinant so that we could examine the potential colocalization of sox2+ and sox4+ lineages. This is the same BAC recombinant as sox4:Kaede (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) but with the Kaede coding sequencing replaced by Cardinal (FPbase ID: 7EWEM), which fluoresces in the far-red range (633 nm). These two BAC recombinants were co-injected to identify potential double labeling of <italic>sox2</italic>+ cell lineages (green, red, or yellow depending on the assay) and <italic>sox4</italic>+ cell lineages. It is important to note that multiple constructs when co-injected into echinoderm zygotes are then co-integrated, and are therefore inherited in the same cellular lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheatle Jarvela et al., 2014</xref>). When we examine expression in normal developing larvae, we find that sox4+ cells overlap completely with <italic>sox2+</italic> cells on the ectoderm as is expected in normally developing larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D-D''</xref>), although not all <italic>sox2+</italic> cells are <italic>sox4+</italic>, as <italic>sox2+</italic> also produce non neural ectoderm.</p><p>We next photo-converted the double BAC recombinant larvae (i.e. all sox2:Kaede<sup>+</sup> cells are converted to red), and immediately bisected the larvae and allowed them to regenerate for 2–3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Strikingly, we found new (green+ cells) expression of <italic>sox2</italic>, indicating that cell that had not previously expressed <italic>sox2</italic> are now expressing the <italic>sox2</italic> gene following bisection. Furthermore, four of 15 observed larvae exhibited cells with colocalized green Kaede (new <italic>sox2</italic> expression) and Cardinal (<italic>sox4</italic>,far red, pseudo-colored blue) at the regenerating leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> B(b-b3))at 3dpb. For example, in the larva shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, there are 3 cells located at the left side of the regeneration leading edge that contain green Kaede and Cardinal. As the green Kaede reporter labels de novo sox2 expression, this shows that these new <italic>sox2+</italic> cells start to express <italic>sox4</italic> and thereby enter into neurogenesis pathways. We observe only few newly expressing <italic>sox2+</italic> and <italic>sox4+</italic> cells in this assay, likely as our reporter system is mosaic, and because there are in reality only small numbers of newly expressing <italic>sox2+</italic> cells at this stage. Our whole mount in situ analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> also suggested that there will be new <italic>sox2+</italic> cells, and that these will become sox4+. The Cardinal reporter can potentially represent both pre-existing and regenerative <italic>sox4</italic> expressions. However, it is important to note that at the time of bisection, all labeled sox4+ cells overlapped with <italic>sox2+</italic> lineage in the imaged larvae. In other words, all Cardinal + cells are also red Kaede+ at the time of photoconversion. Thus, the sox4:Cardinal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> must be expressed after wounding. This therefore supports the hypothesis that cells derived from non <italic>sox2+</italic> lineages are induced to express <italic>sox2</italic> in regenerating larvae and will contribute to neural progenitors. Indeed when we follow these larvae through to 7dpb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>) we find fluorescence in the neural projections which are characteristic of fully formed neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a1-a3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sox4+ cells are specified from Sox2+ cells at the regeneration leading edge.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental design.

Stem cells, by definition, require an asymmetric division to produce a new daughter cell type and maintained stem cell. Thus new <italic>sox2</italic> expression should not be present when cell division is blocked if it is solely derived from asymmetric stem cell division. We bathed sea star larvae in Aphidicolin, a conserved inhibitor of cell division, that is particularly well characterized in echinoderms where it is known to block DNA polymerase function, nuclear break down and microtubule organizing centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mashanov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishioka et al., 1984</xref>). We first used a serial dilution test to determine that the 25 µM of Aphidicolin was the minimum concentration needed to reliably inhibit cell division as assayed by EdU staining, while cells in DMSO controls divided normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We incubated regenerated larvae in the drug or vehicle for up to 1 week, with daily changes into fresh drug or vehicle, and analyzed them every 24 hr to test that Aphidicolin consistently blocked cell division over this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The aphidicolin treatment, therefore, covered the phases of regeneration, and preceded the first observed <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox4</italic> expression by at least one day.

Significant questions remain surrounding the source of new cells needed to regenerate lost tissues and organs, their potencies and whether developmental GRNs are re-used. A further open question is whether any of these processes are shared across taxa, and can explain the differing capacities for regeneration.</p><p>Echinoderms are an especially important system for the study of these questions as they are well known for their extensive capacities for regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben Khadra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrne, 2020</xref>). There has, therefore, been extensive research on regeneration of multiple species, tissues and stages in echinoderms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vickery et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kasahara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García-Arrarás et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mashanov and Zueva, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piovani et al., 2021</xref>). While providing important insight and an emerging consensus on the role of local dedifferentiation, the availability of transgenic tools has precluded the cell lineage analysis needed to definitively identify cell sources and their potencies. The discovery that many echinoderm larvae are able to regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolff and Hinman, 2021</xref>), opens the possibility to use genetic engineering tools that are available for embryos, to probe regeneration. Additionally, developmental GRNs and the cell specification pathways are extremely well characterized for many species of echinoderms, providing an opportunity to compare developmental to regenerative GRNs of the same larval cell types. In this study, we develop a new BAC-based transgenesis protocol to identify and track the cellular sources of regenerated neurons of the sea star bipinnaria larva, and to compare neurogenesis pathways between development and regeneration.</p><p>We show that bipinnaria larvae of the bat star, <italic>P. miniata</italic>, are able to regenerate their anterior nervous system. Sea star larvae have remarkably complex nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elia et al., 2009</xref>) given their small size and presumably simple behavior. We took advantage of the highly specific marker of differentiated serotonergic neurons, which includes immunoreactivity to anti-serotonin antibody (Sigma, S5545), characteristic axonal projections, and location within the larvae, to confirm that these neurons are removed by surgery and reform within 21 days. The removed pre-oral ciliary band and lip of the mouth are also reformed during regeneration.</p><p>We used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to show that genes involved in embryonic AP axis specification are re- expressed along the axis of bisected larvae. For example, <italic>foxq2</italic>, <italic>six3,</italic> and <italic>wnt3</italic> are key nodes in the embryonic GRN for axial specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheatle Jarvela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yankura et al., 2013</xref>), and are re-expressed along the AP axis of the posterior regenerating segment. Reestablishing axial patterning is a commonly observed early feature in many species undergoing whole body regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gehrke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reddien, 2019</xref>), which we now show also occurs in sea star larvae. <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>sox4</italic> expression is similarly induced adjacent to the wound site within one day. This region will form a proliferative epithelial zone by the third day following bisection. In embryos, <italic>sox2</italic> is expressed throughout the ectoderm, while <italic>sox4+</italic> cells are scattered throughout the ectoderm where they function as precursors for multiple neural types in the larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheatle Jarvela et al., 2016</xref>). This is the first indication that there is a resetting of gene expression states adjacent to the wound and is consistent with a broad respecification of these cells.</p><p>One of the most fascinating questions in regeneration is whether animals reuse their embryonic GRNs to regenerate cell types. If different pathways are used, this indicates that there are regeneration-specific GRNs deployed after traumatic wounding. This further suggests that such pathways may independently evolve under different selection pathways than the embryonic pathways. If embryonic GRNS are reused, the challenge is to understand how they are reactivated in non-zygotic cells. The new expression of embryonic axial patterning genes across the bisected larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>) is consistent with re-entry into an embryonic state. We further show, using FISH and using IMARIS to confidently assess colocalization of signal, that <italic>sox2</italic>+ cells overlap with <italic>sox4</italic>+ cells, that <italic>sox4</italic> expression overlaps with <italic>lhx2</italic> expression, which in turn overlaps with <italic>elav</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that these gene products mark the embryonic neurogenesis pathways, and that ectodermal <italic>elav</italic> expression is a marker of differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheatle Jarvela et al., 2016</xref>). We have also previously shown that <italic>lhx2</italic> is needed for the differentiation of serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheatle Jarvela et al., 2016</xref>). This data therefore supports the hypothesis that embryonic serotonergic neurogenesis pathways are reactivated in the induced <italic>sox2</italic>+ cells, although we are not yet able to show that any of these gene products are functionally required for neurogenesis in the regeneration context.</p><p>The presence of <italic>sox2</italic>+ and <italic>sox4</italic>+ cells adjacent to the wound site provide the possibility that these are the cellular source of regenerated neurons. Cell tracking however is needed to test whether these cells do indeed form neurons, and to identify the cellular origin of <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox4</italic> expression. The wound adjacent expression could arise from existing <italic>sox2</italic>+ or <italic>sox4</italic>+ cells in the larvae. This would suggest that these cells function as a resident stem cell population of regenerated neurons. Alternatively, they would arise from other, existing, cells, which may either be derived from an additional source of stem cell or through de- or trans-differentiation. We therefore developed a novel transgenic reporter system based on BAC recombineering that takes advantage of highly stable, irreversibly photoconvertible, fluorescence Kaede reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ando et al., 2002</xref>). The injected BAC DNA construct is stably inherited in clonal lineages of cells after one to several embryonic cell division and hence the reporter will express mosaically. In the system we developed, cells that are currently expressing the gene of interest will fluoresce green, and may also contain red FP if they have previously expressed the gene prior to photoconversion. Using this reporter system, we show that the <italic>sox4</italic> gene is expressed in existing <italic>sox4</italic>+ cells, and in cells that have not expressed <italic>sox4</italic> within the last seven days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We reasoned that new neural precursor cells (i.e. green only <italic>sox4</italic>+ cells) may be continuously generated as a normal development process and therefore not specifically induced by wounding. We therefore compared the formation of new <italic>sox4</italic>+ neural precursors in development and regeneration. We find many new sox4+ cells being produced in early embryos (days 2–5 development) as expected, but this has almost entirely stopped by swimming larval phase (days 4–7 development) and resumed upon wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The subsidence of <italic>sox4</italic>+ cell formation in the larval stage is consistent with data showing that the serotonergic postmitotic neuronal number is stable in larvae from day 4 or 5 of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using the same experimental strategy, but now with sox2 BAC reporter, we show the <italic>sox2</italic> gene is also expressed in existing and new cells. Using an additional Cardinal reporter, we show that some, but not all, of these new <italic>sox2</italic>+ cells become <italic>sox4</italic>+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), indicating that they can become neural precursors but also other cell types. We followed these reporters through regeneration to show that they are later found in cells with characteristic axonal projections and located in the lower lip of the mouth, and dorso-lateral domains adjacent to the mouth as stereotypic of serotonergic neurons. Thus, we show that these wound-induced <italic>sox2</italic> cells do become neurons, other ectodermal cells and mouth endo/ectoderm in a similar lineage potential as the embryonic <italic>sox2</italic>+ lineage.</p><p>The existing, <italic>sox2+ sox4</italic>+ cells that continue to express these genes (i.e. the yellow cells in our assay) likely function as resident ectodermal- and neural- stem cells as we show that they are dividing and contribute to neural and ectodermal tissues. We wanted to investigate whether the new <italic>sox2</italic>+ cells (green) arose from existing cells or might arise from another, possibly totipotent resident stem cell population. As stem cells must, by definition, divide to produce a daughter that can be directed along a new differentiation pathway we used small molecule inhibitors to block cell division following bisection. We find that new <italic>sox2</italic>+ cells still emerge in these larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This therefore shows that new sox2+ expression does not require the asymmetric division from a stem cell progenitor, and instead, therefore, is the result of respecifying existing cells.</p><p>The human and mouse orthologs of the sea star sox2 gene have well-characterized functions in the induction of pluripotency and maintenance of stem cells, especially neurogenic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feng and Wen, 2015</xref>). In combination with Oct4, Klf4, and c-Myc, sox2 can reprogram human and mouse somatic cells to pluripotent states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>). Other models of echinoderm regeneration have implicated, although not demonstrated, a role for orthologs of these pluripotency factors in de-differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mashanov and Zueva, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mashanov et al., 2015a</xref>). We have also previously shown that <italic>Klf4</italic> is expressed at the wound edge following bisection and is thus presumably co-localized with <italic>sox2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cary et al., 2019b</xref>). The new wound-induced expression of <italic>sox2</italic>, therefore, presents the hypothesis that induction of <italic>sox2</italic> expression is the actual cause of the dedifferentiation of cells, and/or may now function to maintain an ectodermal stem cell population. We have not yet formally shown whether new induction of <italic>sox2</italic> leads to dedifferentiation (i.e. reprogramming into a progenitor state), or whether there are other types of reprogramming, as we do not know the differentiation state of cells induced to express <italic>sox2</italic> or whether these cells now adopt an identical molecular signature to existing <italic>sox2</italic> cells. The extent of lineage conversion are unknown and open questions in stem cell biology in any system, and yet is critical knowledge for translational applications of stem cells. The work here provides foundational knowledge in a tractable system to work toward answers to these questions. We have shown that once respecified, <italic>sox2+</italic> cells are restricted to become ectoderm, and the lip of mouth ectoderm/endoderm cell types, indicating that they are multi-potent but germline restricted. In embryos, <italic>sox2+</italic> cells are also restricted to ectodermal lineages and the lip of the mouth, and therefore, the wound-induced sox2+ cells now enter their normal, embryonic lineage. A subset of these induced cells recapitulate an embryonic neurogenesis pathway to reform serotonergic neurons around the mouth, and the latero-dorsal ganglia.</p><p>As new model systems are added to the study of regeneration, they present an opportunity to re-examine our understanding of regeneration and the ways in which cellular reprogramming is induced by wounding. Early concepts around cellular origins of whole body regeneration suggested a dichotomy between use of stem cells and de- or trans-differentiation, although more recent studies suggest a greater complexity, with a range of mechanisms often existing in any given species. For example, the freshwater planarian, <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>, utilizes a population of heterogeneous pluripotent somatic stem cells, called neoblasts, to proliferate and differentiate to replace body parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sánchez Alvarado, 2006</xref>). Recent work shows that specialized neoblasts can also divide to produce neoblasts that are pluripotent, suggesting a plasticity of their fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raz et al., 2021</xref>) Species such as Hydra and axolotl, refate differentiated cells either through dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>). Although, Hydra also utilizes interstitial cells as a population of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Siebert et al., 2008</xref>). Cellular plasticity also varies widely, from the totipotent planarian neoblasts to lineage restricted progenitors used by vertebrate animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kragl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu and Pearson, 2016</xref>).Our data indicate that echinoderm larvae induce non-stem cells into ectodermal neural stem cells, possibly through dedifferentiation or other mechanisms of fate conversion, as we see de novo sox2+ cells becoming neurons in regenerating larvae. This is reminiscent of the mechanisms of refating seen in cnidarian models such as <italic>Hydra</italic>. Additionally, we show that there is a maintained lineage of <italic>sox2</italic>+ and <italic>sox4</italic>+ progenitors in bisected larvae, also reforming the nervous system, as we see yellow neurons in regenerating larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This at a broad level echoes the use of lineage restricted stem cells seen in vertebrates and other systems. We posit that echinoderms may have a natural capacity to maintain a cellular plasticity that permits induction of new lineage stem-cells, as well as an ability to use existing lineage-restricted stem cells and that this flexibility may underlie their extensive abilities for regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The three colored groups were defined as follows: if the net FI ratio of 560 nm/488 nm &gt;5, the cell is considered as a red cell; if the ratio is between Y and 5, the cell is considered as a yellow cell; if the ratio of 560 nm/488 nm&lt; Y, the cell is considered as a green cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Inhibition of cell division</title><p>To inhibit cell division, we used aphidicolin (Sigma A0781) at a dosage of 8.3 μg/g (25 μM) in sea water. To prevent drug elimination, we changed Aphidicolin and vehicle (DMSO) every 24 hr, so the larvae were continuously exposed. The first treatment was done immediately post-injury, followed by two more drug changes every 24 hr. Control animals received 0.08% DMSO (vehicle) incubation. The aphidicolin treatment, therefore, covered the phases of regeneration, and preceded the first observed sox2 and sox4 expression by at least 1 day. These treatment parameters were established after a series of pilot experiments using two drug concentrations (25 uM, 50 uM), followed by 1 hr incubation in 15 uM EdU, which was detected by standard protocol (invitrogen C10637). To elucidate sox2+, sox4+ cells fate without cell division the fertilized eggs were injected with sox2, sox4 Bacs, 1-week-old larvae were bisected, photoconverted, incubated in aphidicolin solution for 3 days and then imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Sample size of experiments</title><p>At least 30–50 embryos and/or larvae in three to five separate trials were analyzed in each in situ and immunostaining experiment. For quantification of FPs expression in live embryos and/or larvae were analyzed 7–10 samples from three to five separate matings for each injection of each BAC construct.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Primers for probe amplification.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72983-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>List of antibodies.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72983-supp2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>List of BAC.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72983-supp3-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72983-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated in this study are included in the manuscript.

new transgenic tools for marking and following cells involved in regeneration. The authors find that these animals can regenerate their nervous system by the re-specification of existing cells, which are induced to express the embryonic neurogenesis program. The experimental approach is robust and creative and the data interpretation sound. For its contribution to our understanding of how cells are induced to contribute to specific cell lineages during regeneration, this work will be of interest to the broad community of researchers in regenerative and developmental biology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72983.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Newmark</surname><given-names>Phillip A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Morgridge Institute for Research</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.07.455526">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.07.455526v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

We agree that this is an important control, and have repeated this experiment to include earlier time points. Regenerating larvae were incubated continuously in aphidicolin for 24hrs with changes into new dishes with aphidicolin at each 24h. We also extended the time period out to 6 days. Thus larvae were incubated continuously for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 days in aphidicolin that was never more than 24hr in diluted SW. These larvae were then treated with EdU to test for cell proliferation at each of these time points in addition to the 72h reported in the original manuscript. This new data is now presented as Supplementary Figure 6. This shows clearly that aphidicolin completely stops any cell proliferation as assayed by EdU staining. As a new finding, It also shows that the aphidicolin treated larvae do not regenerate the anterior structures as we see limited formation of anterior structures in aphidicolin treated compared to vehicle controls.</p><p>We added the following text into the methods section:</p><p>“We incubated regenerated larvae in the drug or vehicle for up to one week, with daily changes into fresh drug or vehicle, and analyzed them every 24h to test that Aphidicolin consistently blocked cell division over this time (Figure 6—figure supplement).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For all figures please include sample sizes (the numbers of larvae analyzed and the numbers of cells analyzed in each larva). For figures 5 and 6, it is unclear how many samples were analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included all of this information for each figure either directly in the figure plate or within the figure legend.</p><p>We also added the following text into the methods section:</p><p>“Sample size of experiments</p><p>At least 30-50 embryos and/or larvae in 3-5 separate trials were analyzed in each in situ and immunostaining experiment. For quantification of FPs expression in live embryos and/or larvae were analyzed 7-10 samples from 3-5 separate matings for each injection of each BAC construct.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The bottom panel of Figure 4F is not described in the figure legend or text. Please describe or delete it.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight on our part. We have now added the following text in the figure legend to explain this part of the figure:</p><p>“(F) Quantification of Sox4 specification in embryos, larvae and regeneration.

Quantification data of 5dpf larvae (Kaede converted at 2dpf embryonic stage, or embryonic conversion) and 7dpf larvae (Kaede converted at 4dpf larval stage, or larval conversion) were then processed for statistical analyses using the website https://www.estimationstats.com/#/. Shared control comparison was performed using Hedge’s g comparison. The confidence interval width was 95%. Hedge’s g was chosen because it compares effect sizes across experiments and is corrected for small-sample bias. The p-value was calculated with the permutation T test.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reviewer #1's public review raised concerns about the description of the bac transgenesis system used here as &quot;a lineage tracing system&quot; and suggests replacing it with wording that more accurately reflects the true nature of these reporters. Please either revise the manuscript accordingly or provide a rationale for describing the system in this way.</p></disp-quote><p>The BAC reporter system that we use in this study works in the following way. BAC recombinant DNA is injected into the oocyte and after one to several rounds of embryonic cleavage, the DNA likely becomes integrated into the genome. The DNA is stably inherited by all of the progeny of this cell. Since the recombined fluorescent reporter is under the control of the endogenous basal promoter and native enhancer elements, the fluorescent reporter will express in the same spatio-temporal domain as the endogenous gene, but only in the clones of cells in which the DNA is inherited. We showed (Figure 3—figure supplement) that once a functional fluorescent protein is produced, it is very stable and will remain detectable above background for at least 7 days.</p><p>We therefore think that once FP is detected, it stably marks all of the lineage of the cell that expressed the gene – even after the gene is no longer being expressed. In this way it is a faithful marker of this lineage. We do agree with the reviewer’s comment that the FP will not trace the entire lineage of cells that express this gene at any time point as the original DNA reporter is mosaically inherited. This limitation can be overcome by examining enough larvae to ensure that all possible lineages are identified, but acknowledge that in our experiments, some <italic>sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> and soxc4+ lineages could certainly be missing from the analysis. We have therefore used this reviewers suggestion and made the following changes:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>“In this study we develop new transgenic tools to follow the fate of populations of cells in the regenerating bipinnaria larva of the sea star Patira minaita.”</p><p>Introduction<italic>:</italic></p><p>“We establish a novel photoconvertible BAC reporter system to trace populations of cells to determine the cellular origin of these regenerated neurons.”</p><p>Results<italic>:</italic></p><p>“To test this hypothesis, we needed to establish a reporter system reporter that would distinguish new sox4+ cells from existing sox4+ cells and also follow their fate for several days. The BAC DNA construct is stably inherited by clones of cells and therefore present mosaically in the cells of the larvae. “</p><p>In multiple places we have also changed the term “lineages” to “cells” to better convey that the entire lineage is not examined.</p><p>Discussion, deleted the following sentence:</p><p>“To our knowledge, this is the first time that any cell lineage tracing studies have been performed in echinoderm regeneration.”</p><p>Added the following:</p><p>“The injected BAC DNA construct is stably inherited in clonal lineages of cells after one to several embryonic cell division and hence the reporter will express mosaically.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Reviewer #1's public review asked for clarification about the infrequency of observing newly specified sox2<sup>+</sup> cells that also express sox4 (Figure 5), so it would be helpful for the authors to provide additional interpretations about rarely observed colocalization patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>There are several reasons that we think that these cells are seen rarely. The first is likely because the BAC reporter system only labels lineages mosaically (as explained for point 4 above). Therefore in any one larvae, only some of the possible cells will be labelled. The second is that we think these cells are very rare. We designed the timing of the experiment to capture the possible newly expressing cells in the early process of specification, before excessive cell proliferation and think therefore that we are capturing the first positive cells and that these are rare. Many of the newly expressing <italic>sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells will form non neural ectoderm, and are therefore not expected to coexpress sox4.</p><p>We have made the following edits in the results to clarify this finding:</p><p>“We observe only few newly expressing sox2<sup>+</sup> and sox4+ cells in this assay, likely as our reporter system is mosaic, and because there are in reality only small numbers of newly expressing sox2<sup>+</sup> cells at this stage.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Reviewer #1's public review also suggested that the final paragraph of the discussion be revised to reflect the current, more nuanced and complex understanding of how stem cells, specialized/committed stem cells, and de- and trans-differentiating cells contribute to different animal models of regeneration, including Hydra and axolotl.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we have not properly explained the complexity of mechanisms used in these model systems and have changed to final paragraph as below and have also included the relevant citations</p><p>“As new model systems are added to the study of regeneration, they present an opportunity to re-examine our understanding of regeneration and the ways in which cellular reprogramming is induced by wounding. […] We posit that echinoderms may have a natural capacity to maintain a cellular plasticity that permits induction of new lineage stem-cells, as well as an ability to use existing lineage-restricted stem cells and that this flexibility may underlie their extensive abilities for regeneration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should provide a supplementary table providing details on the length, sequence region, and accession number for each probe used for WMISH and FISH riboprobes.</p></disp-quote><p>This information is now provided in Supplementary file1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The &quot;Historic Kaede&quot; label in red text in Figure 6 is difficult to read superimposed upon the red staining in the image.
