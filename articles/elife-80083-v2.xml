epithelium. However, it remains unclear how diverse basal cells are and how distinct subpopulations respond to airway challenges. Using single cell RNA-sequencing and functional approaches, we report a significant and previously underappreciated degree of heterogeneity in the basal cell pool, leading to identification of six subpopulations in the adult murine trachea. Among these, we found two major subpopulations, collectively comprising the most uncommitted of all the pools, but with distinct gene expression signatures. Notably, these occupy distinct ventral and dorsal tracheal niches and differ in their ability to self-renew and initiate a program of differentiation in response to environmental perturbations in primary cultures and in mouse injury models in vivo. We found that such heterogeneity is acquired prenatally, when the basal cell pool and local niches are still being established, and depends on the integrity of these niches, as supported by the altered basal cell phenotype of tracheal cartilage-deficient mouse mutants. Finally, we show that features that distinguish these progenitor subpopulations in murine airways are conserved in humans. Together, the data provide novel insights into the origin and impact of basal cell heterogeneity on the establishment of regionally distinct responses of the airway epithelium during injury-repair and in disease conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>basal cell heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>organotypic cultures</kwd><kwd>lung repair</kwd><kwd>airway epithelium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-HL135834-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardoso</surname><given-names>Wellington V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-144744</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinner</surname><given-names>Debora</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Flow Cytometry Core and NIH/NCI Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA013696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Califano</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR001873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Califano</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 CA197745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Califano</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 OD012351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Califano</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 OD021764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Califano</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of unbiased scRNA-sequencing and functional approaches in organoid cultures and injury-repair models in vivo reveals major heterogeneity in adult murine airway basal cells, which is established prenatally and conserved in humans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Basal cells (BCs) are tissue-specific adult multipotent stem cells of various organs, including skin, esophagus, olfactory, and the airway epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rock et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McKeon, 2004</xref>). In the respiratory tract, BCs are found largely as a continuous layer of cells at the base of the pseudostratified epithelium of extrapulmonary airways in mice, and extending to small intrapulmonary conducting airways in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rock et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rock et al., 2009</xref>). A large body of studies, over decades, has shown that BCs are essential for the homeostatic maintenance and repair of the respiratory epithelium. Dysregulated airway BC activities by environmental exposures and repeated injuries are known to result in aberrant self-renewal and epithelial differentiation, often associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and pre-neoplastic lesions that can lead to lung squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rock et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shaykhiev, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hynds and Janes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferone et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The abundance and crucial role of these cells in the airway epithelium have, for many years, raised questions about whether BCs may represent a homogenous or a molecularly diverse pool of stem cells. Initial clues suggesting BC heterogeneity came from studies showing that they could differ in their ability to retain label in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays, and exhibit distinct clonogenic behavior due to different ability to activate the <italic>Krt5</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borthwick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schoch et al., 2004</xref>). This hypothesis was further strengthened by the identification of a subpopulation of <italic>Krt14</italic> +BCs, shown by lineage tracing to rapidly expand to generate additional BCs but not differentiated components of the damaged airway epithelium post-injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>). Long-term clonal analysis using a <italic>Krt5<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> mouse line in combination with mathematical modeling, suggested that airway BCs comprise two subpopulations of multipotent stem cells. These were present in equal numbers and differed in their commitment from a <italic>bona fide</italic> stem cell to an intermediate luminal progenitor, not particularly associated with a specific cell niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watson et al., 2015</xref>). Mouse models of lung injury-repair have shown that, immediately after severe injury of the airway epithelium and prior to regeneration of the luminal cells, two discrete BC subpopulations can be identified and distinguished by expression of determinants of cell fate commitment to the secretory or ciliated cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pardo-Saganta et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis and computational modeling approaches have provided new insights into BC diversity in the adult lung and are helping describe the differences in BC subpopulations as the manifestation of discrete, co-existing cell states. One such study reports two BC states in the adult human lung, based on the degree of maturation of these cells, distinguished by the expression levels of TRP63 and NPPC (natriuretic peptide C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vieira Braga et al., 2019</xref>). Another study, also in human lungs, stratifies BCs into multipotent, proliferating, primed secretory, and activated subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carraro et al., 2020</xref>). A third study, reports human BCs as proliferating, differentiating, or quiescent, and shows differential spatial enrichment of these populations, with proliferating and differentiating BCs present only in large airways, while quiescent BCs populate both large and small airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Travaglini et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In mice, a combination of scRNA-Seq profiling and lineage tracing assays provided relevant information about cellular hierarchies and BC trajectories during differentiation but did not report on the diversity and distribution of BC subtypes in the tracheal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plasschaert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Montoro et al., 2018</xref>). Using a sampling criterion based primarily on their spatial distribution, distinct BC phenotypes have been identified in tissues surgically dissected from the dorsal and ventral mouse trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tadokoro et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these observations support the notion that the basal stem cell pool is diverse, while leaving key unresolved questions. What is the actual spectrum of BC diversity in a resting, unperturbed state of the adult murine trachea? Does BC diversity translate into distinct abilities to regenerate or undergo aberrant repair in injured airways? Is there any evidence of conservation in these features between mouse and human airways?</p><p>To address these questions, we used an unbiased scRNA-Seq approach to identify components of the BC pool in adult <italic>Trp63<sup>CreERT2</sup>; Rosa26<sup>lox-STOP-lox-tdtomato</sup></italic> mice and examined their differences in functional in vitro assays and in vivo models of injury-repair. Our studies show a previously underappreciated BC heterogeneity in the adult murine airway, with six molecularly distinct BC subtypes. Among these, we identified two major subpopulations characterized by their abundance, unique signature, and regional distribution in the tracheal epithelium. Functional analyses showed that these two subpopulations responded differently to perturbations when isolated and cultured as organoids, and during repopulation of the airway epithelium post-injury in intact animals. Finally, we found that BC heterogeneity is established during embryonic development and showed that key features of murine BCs are conserved in BC from human airways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>scRNA-Seq reveals six distinct BC subpopulations in adult murine trachea under homeostasis</title><p>Mouse models of lung injury have provided major insights into how BCs contribute to regenerating the airway epithelium. Nevertheless, there is still limited information on how diverse the BC stem cell pool is in the unperturbed adult murine trachea. Although previous studies using scRNA-Seq approach provided clear evidence of BC heterogeneity, methodological differences, including choice of mouse lines for BC isolation, the ability to capture all subpopulations, and choice of computational analysis, have not allowed a full understanding of the extent to which steady-state BCs differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plasschaert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Montoro et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To have a more precise idea about the composition of the BC pool, we specifically sorted these cells using a <italic>Trp63<sup>CreERT2</sup>; Rosa26<sup>lox-STOP-lox-tdtomato</sup></italic> mouse line known to label universally all BCs, thus providing a greater chance to identify all subtypes. This choice was supported by extensive evidence of <italic>Trp63</italic> expression in BCs throughout the body and the inability of these cells to form in the absence of <italic>Trp63</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daniely et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Romano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fletcher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 1999</xref>).

However, RA signaling disruption had a much greater impact in the induction of KRT13 in BC-2-BMS than in BC-1-BMS-derived cultures (BC-1-BMS: 5.46 ± 0.85% vs BC-2-BMS: 13.06 ± 1.72%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>).

This raised the question whether RA signaling was differentially active in these two BC subpopulations in the intact adult trachea under homeostatic conditions. To address this issue, we used a RARE-LacZ reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rossant et al., 1991</xref>) extensively shown to label cells activating RA signaling in various tissues and contexts. We compared the distribution of LacZ signals in the ventral and dorsal epithelium in tracheal sections of adult mutants co-stained with X-gal and markers of basal, secretory and multiciliated cells. Surprisingly, LacZ signals were clearly present in luminal cells of both ventral and dorsal epithelium but not in BCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggested that, under homeostatic conditions, BCs are unlikely to activate RA signaling. However, the presence of components of the RA biosynthetic pathway in BCs suggests that they may produce RA or its precursors making available to neighbor luminal cells to drive or maintain their differentiation program. Consistent with this, there is evidence that skin BCs (keratinocytes) metabolize retinoid precursors and serve as a source of retinol for differentiation of the upper skin layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurlandsky et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, BC-1 differs from BC-2 in its enrichment in Retinol metabolism genes, suggesting that BC-1 could be better equipped of producing RA compared with BC-2. This could presumably contribute to generate the dorsal-ventral differences in sensitiveness of the tracheal epithelium to an RA-deficient environment. Further studies are required to proper explore this speculation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>BC-2 shows markedly distinct behavior during initiation of repair of the damaged epithelium in mouse models of injury</title><p>These intriguing observations led us to inquire whether severe injury of the airway epithelium in the intact animal could reveal intrinsic differences in the BC-1 vs BC-2-mediated repair programs. For this, we used two established mouse models of lung injury-repair in vivo. Intraperitoneal injection of Naphthalene, a byproduct of the cigarette smoke metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes results in massive injury and sloughing of club cells of the airway epithelium. In the trachea, repair is subsequently initiated by activation of a BC program of regeneration that repopulates the epithelium within 2–3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tata et al., 2018</xref>). Polidocanol is a detergent/sclerosing agent that induces extensive and severe epithelial sloughing when injected intratracheally in mice, also eliciting a BC-mediated regenerative response that reconstitutes the airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paul et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Injury was induced with Naphthalene (Nap) or Polidocanol (Poli) in 8 week-old adult mice and animals were euthanized during active epithelial repopulation (Nap: 5dpi; Poli: 7dpi) and later (both: 15dpi), once regeneration was well advanced in the tracheal epithelium.

Analysis of cell proliferation showed no dorsal-ventral difference in KI67 labeling in BCs from uninjured control tracheas. KI67 labeling was increased in BCs during repair post-injury and was disproportionally higher in dorsal BCs from 7dpi-Poli tracheas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the dorsal epithelium showed a striking induction of KRT13 expression in KRT5 + cells and a massive increase in KRT13 + cells in the nascent regenerating luminal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Although also induced in the ventral epithelium, KRT13 labeling occurred in a significantly smaller scale and allowed regeneration to proceed. Indeed, in 5dpi-Nap mice KRT13 +labeling in the tracheal epithelium increased dorsally from 0.71 ± 0.37% (control) to 45.47 ± 4.74%, while ventrally labeling increased from 0.2 ± 0.12% (control) to 8.36 ± 2.55%.

We have previously shown that, in the embryonic mouse lung, airway epithelial cells destined to become BCs (pre-BCs) are already specified at an early stage, when airways are still forming, but have to undergo a series of maturation events to become properly functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).

Tracheas were isolated from E18.5 embryos and triple-labeled for KRT5 with each marker and a-SMA (which served as a reference for the dorsal location). This revealed significant differential enrichment of BC-1 and BC-2 markers, consistent with the pattern identified in the adult trachea.

These uncommitted progenitors exhibit comparable levels of canonical BC markers but have distinct signatures and differ from each other in their ability to initiate a metaplastic program of differentiation. Remarkably, their intrinsic differences in phenotype appear to be largely determined by their spatial localization and established when BCs are still developing in the embryonic trachea.

Furthermore, tensile/structural properties (e.g., stiffness, collapsibility) of the membranous (dorsal) trachea vs cartilaginous (ventral) trachea could also contribute to the intrinsic differences in cell behavior observed between BC-1 and BC-2.

This could be ascribed to the fact that the BC-1 and BC-2 markers identified in our unbiased approach were expressed in both ventral and dorsal subpopulations at different levels, but not enough to consistently distinguish cartilaginous vs non-cartilaginous BCs in our assays. Moreover, these experiments were not designed to isolate and study specifically inter-cartilaginous BCs.</p><p>The potential clinical significance of these findings is intriguing as they point to a differential susceptibility of the BC-1 and BC-2-derived epithelia to activate a potentially pathological program associated with <italic>Krt13</italic>. Squamous metaplasia is a common pre-neoplastic finding in smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD).

The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jason R Spence (Reviewer #1); Darrell N Kotton (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please add the additional expression data as requested by the reviewers i.e. immunostaining and QPCR were indicated.</p><p>2) Please edit the manuscript to add additional clarification of data and methods where requested.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Were there any markers that were expressed in a binary on/off fashion that can be used to distinguish BC1 vs. BC2. Currently, the data supports that mRNA or protein changes between differentially expressed markers are significant but subtle. If there were more clear binary markers, it would be useful for the field to more easily identify specific subpopulations.</p><p>– Can the authors show the dorsal and ventral nature of staining using two or more (I.e. TGM2, CAV1) markers on a transverse section of the trachea? Is there a sharp boundary for these markers at the mid-line?</p><p>– What measures were taken to ensure the purity of BC1 and BC2 of the surgically dissected dorsal and ventral trachea (i.e. for Figure 2). The data shown in Figure 2B is after 7 days in culture, but was any characterization done immediately after sorting to show enrichment of these populations?</p><p>– For Figure 2G, the assumption from reading the text is that the same number of starting cells was used for tracheosphere initiation; however, this is not specifically stated in the text. Can the authors please clarify?</p><p>– The authors refer to the KRT13 expression in BC2 organoids (Figure 2K) as an &quot;aberrant differentiation program&quot;; however, this reviewer wonders if this is actually the normal differentiation program for BC2s, and how the author can distinguish a normal from abnormal differentiation program in these cells? The data presented in Figure 3 (injury models) show KRT13 activation followed by resolution at day 15. This may indicate that an increase in KRT13 followed by a resolution in BC2 (dorsal) tracheal basal cells is part of the natural injury repair process and not an aberrant program.</p><p>– The LOF experiments in Figure 4 are striking.

A panel of useful markers is established in figure 1 that potentially distinguishes BC-1 from BC-2 (e.g. Cd44, Cav1, Krt17, Isl1, Tgm2) – however, these markers are not consistently used throughout the manuscript despite their emphasis early in the story. Could the authors provide an additional mention and comparison more consistently throughout? For example, figure 1D would be much improved by adding this panel of markers to the profiles. The injury response studies (figure 3) in vivo would also benefit from a reprise of the kinetics of expression of these markers post-injury.</p><p>2. Beyond the molecular profiles, some of the functional differences seem mild/subtle, even if statistically significant (e.g. CFE differences between BC-1 and BC-2 during culture outgrowth are scored as 7% and 10%, a subtle difference, with no difference in organoid sizes after outgrowth). What do these subtle differences mean and can the authors comment on their relevance to in vivo proliferative capacity – e.g. is there any difference in terms of proliferative responses in vivo after injury that authors could quantify, e.g by regional Edu uptake? In addition, it is unclear to this reviewer what quantitative differences in differentiation repertoires there might be between BC-1 and BC-2. Krt13 is one of the significant differences between BC-1 and BC-2, but how about the expression patterns of other cell lineage makers after ALI culture?</p><p>3. In some places the terminology chosen by the authors is confusing or unexplained. For example, the &quot;signatures&quot; of BC-1 and BC-2 &quot;appeared to be the most stem-like BC populations&quot; – it is not clear what the authors mean by &quot;stem-like&quot; and whether they are referring to specific markers (not mentioned) or functionality (not explicitly tested for stemness.) Consider explaining or deleting.</p><p>4. The authors emphasize that dorsal and ventral basal cells are different because of different &quot;niches&quot;, without studying what these niches or signals might be. Have the authors considered that the different structures, tensile/structural properties (e.g. stiffness, collapsibility) of the membranous (dorsal) trachea vs cartilaginous (ventral) trachea may contribute to epithelial intrinsic differences in cell behavior without differential niche signals. The removal of cartilage (<italic>Sox9</italic> deletion studies in vivo) would then remove these structural differences by changing tensile properties of the local tissue (rather than removing a signaling niche), thus minimizing BC differences, as the authors observed in their knockout tracheas. Could the authors discuss or test for these alternative possibilities since conventional niche-stem cell signaling differences (e.g. &quot;cartilage-derived signals&quot;) were not formally assayed in the present work to warrant such strong conclusions about distinct biological niches.</p><p>5. How different is the RA signaling activation between BC-1 vs. BC-2 or ventral vs. Dorsal regions? The authors demonstrated that RA signaling plays important roles in Krt13 expression by adding RA inhibitor, BMS, into ALI culture media, suggesting the importance of the niche environment for the determination of the cellular identities, BC-1 and BC-2. However, it is still unclear whether RA signaling is highly activated in BC-1 compared to BC-2. In addition, which niche cells such as chondrocytes or fibroblast secrete RA to BC-1 is unclear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript would benefit from some additional information/experiments.</p><p>1) Material and methods seem to indicate that the basal cells isolated for organoid and ALI cultures were not sorted. Figure 2H shows some contamination with stromal cells, especially for the BC2 cultures. It is, therefore, possible that signals from these stromal cells are maintaining these BC1 vs BC2 phenotypes. To address this the authors may need to co-culture GFP positive BC1 isolated from a mouse in which all cells or basal cells are GFP + with Tomato positive BC2 isolated from a mouse in which all cells or basal cells are tomato +. Alternatively, basal cells could be isolated from mice in which Foxg1 positive cells express the Diphtheria toxin receptor so that stromal cells can be killed in culture.</p><p>2) What are the different signals coming from the dorsal vs ventral stromal niches?

The D-V differential enrichment is much clear in these preparations. We can identify defined boundaries of staining in some cases. Although these boundaries are consistently associated with the dorsal (smooth muscle layer) tracheal mesenchyme, it is overall difficult to define exactly where they occur. We ascribe this to differences in the orientation of the histological sections which could not be precisely positioned for this purpose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What measures were taken to ensure the purity of BC1 and BC2 of the surgically dissected dorsal and ventral trachea (i.e. for Figure 2).

This was particularly challenging for the dorsal BCs, given the much smaller membranous region of the trachea. Thus, we relied in our highly efficient protocols of tissue microdissection, differential adhesion and expansion of these BCs for obtaining pure populations of these cells. The efficiency of our protocols was consistent with our findings of differential behavior between these two BC populations both in 3D organoid assays and in air-liquid interface organotypic cultures. Notably, we now provide evidence that these organoids are not contaminated with mesenchymal cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For Figure 2G, the assumption from reading the text is that the same number of starting cells was used for tracheosphere initiation; however, this is not specifically stated in the text.

Can the authors show supporting evidence using another quantitative approach such as qRT-PCR?</p></disp-quote><p>We found that qRT-PCR analysis of tissue lysates could not reliably assess the quantitative differences in basal cell expression of these markers for the following reasons. As clearly shown in our immunofluorescence stainings, nearly all of our BC-1 and BC-2 markers were also expressed in other epithelial cell populations (parabasal, luminal cells) and/or mesenchymal cells of the developing trachea. The expression of these markers in other cell populations did not necessarily follow the same behavior of that in the basal cells, making comparisons between WT and mutants inaccurate when assessed in cell lysates. Since the differences in expression were remarkable and demonstrated accurately by immunofluorescence, we measured the local levels of fluorescence staining as our quantitative approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Can primitive basal cells (I.e. early embryonic) be patterned in vitro by placing them in co-culture with cartilage or smooth muscle?</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to address this question in embryonic tracheal explant cultures but found complexities that required experiments beyond the scope of our present work. Some of these complexities included: (1) We could not accurately determine when the differences in D-V distribution of these markers were established in the embryonic trachea and whether these differences were triggered by early ventral signals associated with the initiation of the cartilage program or later by inductive signals arising from the cartilage primordia. (2) Our analysis of the <italic>Foxg1Cre</italic>; Sox9f/f did not allow to properly address this question since <italic>Sox9</italic> was deleted constitutively from the earliest Foxg1-expressing mesenchymal cells in the developing trachea. Thus, co-culturing the early embryonic tracheal epithelium with an already formed cartilage was unlikely to result in the expected patterning effects. (3) Further studies are required to determine precisely when the developing pre-basal cell precursors are patterned and diversified in the murine trachea. As we previously reported (Yang et al., Dev Cell 2018), p63+ Nkx2-1+ basal cell precursors can be identified as early as the stage of lung specification in the foregut. Although subsequently restricted to the trachea, these p63+ cells are scattered throughout the pseudostratified epithelium and only later (after E14.5-15.5) are segregated into a layer of prebasal cells. Thus, at the early stages of tracheal development these layers (luminal, basal) are undefined, initially unseparated from the dorsal (esophageal) epithelium and difficult to manipulate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Some caveats for the authors to consider to make this work even stronger are:</p><p>1.

Furthermore, we have performed immunofluorescence analysis of these markers both in the Naphthalene and Polidocanol mouse injury models in vivo; these results are now shown in the revised Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Krt13 is one of the significant differences between BC-1 and BC-2, but how about the expression patterns of other cell lineage makers after ALI culture?</p></disp-quote><p>Our observation of a higher colony-forming efficiency in dorsal (BC-2)-derived organoids is in agreement with data from a previous study that showed increased colony-forming efficiency in BCs isolated from the dorsal trachea compared to ventral BCs in similar organoid assays (Tadokoro et al., 2021).</p><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have examined the proliferative capacity of these populations in vivo in models of injury-repair. We now show that the dorsal (BC-2) population has a higher proliferative capacity (shown by Ki67 labeling) during initiation of repair and that is particularly striking after Polidocanol injury (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, we have also investigated the quantitative differences in the differentiation repertoires of BC-1 and BC-2 in these injury models. We show that the increase in the dorsal Krt13 population seen post-Polidocanol (and to a lesser extent post-Naphthalene) is accompanied by a major decrease in number of secretory (CC10, Scgb3a2) and multiciliated (Foxj1) cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Lastly, as also requested by the reviewer, we investigated how markers of BC-1 and BC-2 behaved during repopulation of airway epithelium in these models of injury. We now show that the ventral and dorsal enrichment of these marker is remarkably maintained in these populations as the epithelium is undergoing repair. This further supports the idea that the regeneration-repair of the ventral and dorsal epithelium is mediated by BC-1 and BC-2-mediated programs of expansion and differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In some places the terminology chosen by the authors is confusing or unexplained. For example, the &quot;signatures&quot; of BC-1 and BC-2 &quot;appeared to be the most stem-like BC populations&quot; – it is not clear what the authors mean by &quot;stem-like&quot; and whether they are referring to specific markers (not mentioned) or functionality (not explicitly tested for stemness.) Consider explaining or deleting.</p></disp-quote><p>We referred to them as &quot;the most stem-like” because in contrast to the other BC populations, the BC-1 and BC-2 were not characterized by enrichment in genes associated with differentiated (luminal) cellular phenotypes, such as Krt13 (Basal-squamous) or Secretoglobin and Mucin-related genes (Basal-secretory). Thus, while not based on enrichment for stem cell specific markers, BC-1 and BC-2 were characterized rather by exclusion of markers that identified the other BC populations. We have clarified this further in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

How different is the RA signaling activation between BC-1 vs. BC-2 or ventral vs. Dorsal regions? The authors demonstrated that RA signaling plays important roles in Krt13 expression by adding RA inhibitor, BMS, into ALI culture media, suggesting the importance of the niche environment for the determination of the cellular identities, BC-1 and BC-2. However, it is still unclear whether RA signaling is highly activated in BC-1 compared to BC-2. In addition, which niche cells such as chondrocytes or fibroblast secrete RA to BC-1 is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we investigated sites of RA activation in the adult tracheal epithelium dung homeostasis using the RARE-LacZ reporter mice (Rossant et al., 1991). These mutants have been extensively shown to label cells activating RA signaling in various tissues and contexts. We compared the distribution of LacZ signals in the ventral and dorsal epithelium in sections of adult trachea co-stained with X-gal and markers of basal, secretory and multiciliated cells. Although LacZ signals were present in luminal (secretory, multiciliated) cells of both ventral and dorsal epithelium, we found no evidence of labeling in BCs (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This suggests that, under homeostatic conditions, BCs are unlikely to activate RA signaling. However, the presence of components of the RA biosynthetic pathway in BCs suggests that they may produce RA or precursors making available to neighbor luminal cells to drive or maintain their differentiation program. Indeed in the human skin there is evidence that basal cells (keratinocytes) metabolize retinoid precursors and serve as a source of retinol for differentiation of the upper layers of skin (Kurlansky et al., J Biol. Chem. 1996).</p><p>Interestingly, BC-1 differs from BC-2 in its enrichment in gene components of the retinoid pathway or associated with it (KEGG: Retinol metabolism), suggesting that ventral (BC-1) may be better equipped of producing RA compared to dorsal (BC-2). This could potentially generate dorsal-ventral differences in sensitiveness of the tracheal epithelium to an RA-deficient environment manifested by the massive Krt13 induction in dorsal-derived BC cultures. Our previous studies in the developing lung showed that RA is very active early in the embryonic tracheal mesenchyme but later, during cartilage differentiation, signals already largely declined. (Malpel et al., Development 2000).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript would benefit from some additional information/experiments.</p><p>1) Material and methods seem to indicate that the basal cells isolated for organoid and ALI cultures were not sorted.
