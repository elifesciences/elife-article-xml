In approximately 30% of the cases, patients with congenital myopathies carry either dominant or recessive mutations in the ryanodine receptor 1 (<italic>RYR1</italic>) gene; recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations are accompanied by reduction of RyR1 expression and content in skeletal muscles and are associated with fiber hypotrophy and muscle weakness. Importantly, muscles of patients with recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations exhibit increased content of class II histone deacetylases and of DNA genomic methylation. We recently created a mouse model knocked-in for the p.Q1970fsX16+ p.A4329D RyR1 mutations, which are isogenic to those carried by a severely affected child suffering from a recessive form of RyR1-related multi-mini core disease. The phenotype of the RyR1 mutant mice recapitulates many aspects of the clinical picture of patients carrying recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations. We treated the compound heterozygous mice with a combination of two drugs targeting DNA methylases and class II histone deacetylases. Here, we show that treatment of the mutant mice with drugs targeting epigenetic enzymes improves muscle strength, RyR1 protein content, and muscle ultrastructure. This study provides proof of concept for the pharmacological treatment of patients with congenital myopathies linked to recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ryanodine receptor mutations</kwd><kwd>congenital myopathy</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd><kwd>muscle function</kwd><kwd>epigenetic enzymes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SNF 310030_184765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treves</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss Muscle Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRSMM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zorzato</surname><given-names>Francesco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NeRAB</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treves</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>RYR1 Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zorzato</surname><given-names>Francesco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Physiological and biochemical studies show that the treatment of a transgenic mouse model carrying recessive Ryr1 mutations with a combination of class II histone deacetylase inhibitors and DNA methyl transferase inhibitors significantly improves skeletal muscle function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle contraction is initiated by a massive release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the opening of the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1), a calcium release channel, which is localized in the SR terminal cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rios and Pizarro, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Endo, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleischer and Inui, 1989</xref>). The signal causing the opening of the RyR1 is the depolarization of the sarcolemmal membrane, which is sensed by voltage-dependent L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (dihydropyridine receptor [DHPR]) located in invaginations of the sarcolemma referred to as transverse tubules (TTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rios and Pizarro, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franzini-Armstrong and Jorgensen, 1994</xref>). Communication between DHPR and RyR1 occurs in specialized intracellular junctions between TT and SR called Ca<sup>2+</sup> release units (CRUs). Skeletal muscle relaxation is brought about by SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake via the activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum CaATPAses (SERCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacLennan, 2000</xref>). Dis-regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals due to defects in key proteins (RyR1 and DHPR) involved in excitation-contraction (EC) coupling (ECC) is the underlying feature of several neuromuscular disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jungbluth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Treves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lawal et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, mutations in <italic>RYR1</italic>, the gene-encoding RyR1, are causative of malignant hyperthermia (MH; MIM #145600), central core disease (CCD; MIM #11700), specific forms of multi-minicore disease (MmD; MIM # 255320), and centronuclear myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jungbluth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Treves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lawal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacLennan and Philips, 1992</xref>). A great deal of data has shown that <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations result mainly in four types of channel defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Treves et al., 2008</xref>). One class of mutations (dominant, MH-associated) causes the channels to become hypersensitive to activation by electrical and pharmacological stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacLennan and Philips, 1992</xref>). The second class of <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations (dominant, CCD-associated) results in leaky channels leading to depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from SR stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Treves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lawal et al., 2020</xref>). A third class of <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations also linked to CCD causes EC uncoupling, whereby activation of the voltage sensor Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 is unable to cause release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the SR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avila et al., 2003</xref>). The fourth class comprises recessive mutations, which are accompanied by a decreased content of mutant RyR1 channels on SR membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilmshurst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Monnier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Patients with congenital myopathies such as MmD carrying recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations belonging to class 4 channel defects, typically exhibit non-progressive proximal muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jungbluth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>This reduced muscle strength is consistent with the lower RyR1 content observed in adult muscle fibers that should result in a decrease of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the SR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilmshurst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Monnier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jungbluth et al., 2005</xref>). The decrease of RyR1 expression is also associated with moderate fiber atrophy, which may additionally contribute to the decrease of muscle strength. In addition to the depletion of RyR1 protein, muscles of patients with recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations exhibit striking epigenetic changes, including altered expression of microRNAs, an increased content of HDAC-4 and HDAC-5, and hypermethylation of more than 3600 CpG genomic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rokach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachmann et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, in muscle biopsies from four patients, hypermethylation of one of the internal <italic>RYR1</italic> CpG islands correlated with the increased levels of HDAC-4 and HDAC-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rokach et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In order to study in more detail the mechanism of disease of recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations, we developed a mouse model knocked in for two mutations, isogenic to those identified in a severely affected child with recessively inherited MmD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein et al., 2012</xref>). Such a mouse model carries the p.Q1970fsX16 + p.A4329D RyR1 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elbaz et al., 2019</xref>) and will henceforth be referred to as double heterozygous (dHT). Characterization of the muscle phenotype of dHT mice demonstrated that it faithfully recapitulates not only the physiological and biochemical changes, but also the major muscle epigenetic signatures observed in muscle biopsies from MmD patients. In the present study we treated dHT mice with drugs targeting epigenetic enzymes and evaluated the physiological effects of the treatment on muscle function as well as on muscle structure. Our results show that treatment of dHT mice with drugs targeting epigenetic enzymes rescues muscle strength, increases RyR1 protein content, and improves muscle morphology, that is, the treatment partially rescues CRUs (the intracellular sites containing RyR1) and mitochondria. This study provides proof of concept for the treatment of patients with congenital myopathies linked to recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations, with small molecules inhibiting DNMT and histone deacetylases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effect of TMP269 and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine on the in vivo muscle phenotype of dHT mice</title><p>We first examined the pharmacokinetics and bio-distribution of TMP269, the class IIa HDAC inhibitor we selected for this study. After intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 25 mg/kg body weight of TMP269 dissolved in polyethylenglycol 300 (PEG300) (500 µl/kg) and <italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (250 µl/kg), blood and/or skeletal muscles were collected at different time points and the content of TMP269 was quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duthaler et al., 2019</xref>). The peak blood concentration of TMP269 was achieved approximately 1 hr after injection. The circulating levels of TMP269 decay within 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, the class II HDAC inhibitor diffuses into skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>), and as expected, its concentration profile in skeletal muscle follows that observed in blood. Although the level of TMP269 accumulating in skeletal muscle is lower compared to that present in blood, its concentration in muscle is adequate to induce an inhibitory effect on class IIa HDACs activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). An identical protocol was used to monitor the optimal dose of 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza), an FDA-approved DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaminskas et al., 2005</xref>). Administration of TMP269 + 5-Aza for 15 weeks resulted in hypomethylation of 165 protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) in soleus muscles. Gene Ontology analysis showed that most of the hypomethylated genes belong to pathways involved in gene transcription, kinase activity, and membrane targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>). Importantly, administration of TMP269 + 5-Aza for 15 weeks increases the acetylation of Lys residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata1">Appendix 2—figure 2—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata2">Appendix 2—figure 2—source data 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata3">Appendix 2—figure 2—source data 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata4">Appendix 2—figure 2—source data 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata5">Appendix 2—figure 2—source data 5</xref>) and of H3K9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2B and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata1">Appendix 2—figure 2—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata2">Appendix 2—figure 2—source data 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata3">Appendix 2—figure 2—source data 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata4">Appendix 2—figure 2—source data 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata5">Appendix 2—figure 2—source data 5</xref>) in total homogenates from <italic>flexor digitorum brevis</italic> (FDB) fibers isolated from wild type (WT) and dHT mice, compared to that observed in fibers from vehicle-treated WT and dHT mice. This result unequivocally indicates that the inhibition of the deacetylation activity of class IIa HDACs by TMP269 occurs in the nuclei. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref> also shows that in the absence of TMP269 + 5-Aza treatment, the level of H3K9 acetylation in myonuclei from FDB fibers isolated from dHT mice is 50% lower compared to WT. This result is consistent with: (i) higher deacetylation activity by class IIa HDACs in vehicle-treated dHT mice compared to TMP269 + Aza-treated dHT mice and WT mice; (ii) enrichment of class II HDACs in the nuclei of dHT mice. Furthermore, these results confirm that the drugs reach skeletal muscles where they exerted their biological function.</p><p>We next conducted a series of experiments to determine how the drug treatment affects in vivo skeletal muscle function. To this end we injected 6-week--old WT and dHT mice with vehicle alone (PEG300 + NMP), with TMP269 alone (25 mg/kg), 5-Aza alone (0.05 mg/kg), or with the two drugs combined on a daily basis and investigated their effects on the in vivo skeletal muscle phenotype by analyzing forelimb grip force using a grip strength meter. Administration of each drug singly, namely TMP269 or 5-Aza alone, does not induce any change in the grip strength of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top left and middle panels). The combined drug treatment did not affect the grip strength of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top right panel). In dHT mice, TMP269 alone causes a small but significant increase of grip strength after 10 weeks of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, low left panel). However, the increased grip strength in dHT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lower right panel) was more evident by the combined drug treatment. In particular, this effect became apparent 4/5 weeks after starting the drug treatment and peaked at 10 weeks. The combined drug treatment rescues approximately 20% of muscle grip strength in dHT mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for raw data on the grip strength of individual dHT mice before and after treatment with TMP269 + 5-Aza).

We calculated the total running distance of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top panels) and dHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom panels) mice injected with vehicle and compared it to that of mice treated for 15–18 weeks with TMP269 + 5-Aza. Three weeks of training improved running performance in both mouse groups. Nevertheless, on day 20 the total running distance of WT mice injected with vehicle alone was approximately 70% greater compared to that of vehicle-treated dHT mice: the total running distance of vehicle-treated WT and dHT mice was 186.27 ± 16.70 km n = 4 vs. 59.93 ± 21.38 km n = 5, respectively (mean ± SD, Mann-Whitney two-tailed test, calculated over the 20 days of running, *p &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, treatment of dHT mice with TMP269 + 5-Aza has a remarkable effect on the total running distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lower panel). The beneficial effect begins 1 week after treatment commencement, and on day 20 the total running distance achieved by dHT mice injected with TMP269 + 5-Aza was two times higher compared to that covered by dHT mice injected with vehicle alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lower panel; Mann-Whitney two-tailed test; on day 20, p = 0.041): the total running distance for vehicle-treated and drug-treated dHT mice was 59.93 ± 21.38 km n = 5 and 125.90 ± 16.39 km n = 5, respectively (mean ± SD, Mann-Whitney two-tailed test, calculated over the 20 days of running *p &lt; 0.05). The longer running distance was also associated with an increased median cruise speed of the drug-treated dHT mice compared to vehicle-treated dHT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panels) (Mann-Whitney two-tailed test, calculated over the 20 days running period, *p &lt; 0.05). The epigenetic modifying drugs most likely affect a number of genes, which in turn leads to an improvement of the in vivo muscle performance of the dHT mice; the latter effect may result from an improvement of the mechanical properties of skeletal muscles and/or by an influence of the drugs on the metabolic pathways of muscles. In the next set of experiments, we investigated the mechanical properties of intact <italic>extensor digitorum longus</italic> (EDL) and soleus muscles from WT and dHT mice after injection of vehicle and of TMP269 + 5-Aza.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Effect of TMP269+5-Aza treatment on isometric force development in muscles from WT and dHT heterozygous mice</title><p>EDL and soleus muscles isolated from mice treated for 15 weeks with vehicle or TMP269 + 5-Aza were stimulated with a single 15 V pulse of 1.0 ms duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C, E and G</xref>) or by a train of pulses delivered at 150 Hz for 400 ms (EDL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>) or 120 Hz for 1100 ms (soleus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and H</xref>) to obtain maximal tetanic contracture.

We used single FDB fibers (i) because they are a mixture of fast and slow twitch muscles and (ii) since intact single fibers from EDL and soleus muscles from 22-week--old mice are nearly impossible to obtain.

Patients can present a variety of symptoms and phenotypes depending on whether the mutations are dominantly or recessively inherited. In particular, patients with recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations often display involvement of extraocular muscles leading to ophthalmoplegia and or ptosis as well as involvement of respiratory muscles, often requiring assisted ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jungbluth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Treves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lawal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilmshurst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jungbluth et al., 2005</xref>). Children may also present physical abnormalities including club foot, scoliosis, facial dysmorphisms, winged scapula, and/or pectus excavatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jungbluth et al., 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, the most disturbing symptom present at infancy in children carrying recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations are hypotonia and proximal muscle weakness. In the most severe cases, muscle weakness also impairs masticatory muscles causing dysphagia, whereby the affected infants are fed via percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy, a procedure which influences the quality of life of the affected individuals and his/her family members. To date there are no therapies available for congenital myopathies.</p><p>In order to target these unmet clinical needs we exploited the heterozygous mouse model we created carrying compound heterozygous RyR1 mutations (p.Q1970fsX16 + p.A4329D), for a preclinical study aimed at developing a therapeutic strategy for patients with congenital myopathies. In particular, we tested small molecules targeting epigenetic modifying enzymes such as class II HDACs and DNMT on male mice. The reason for performing experiments only on male mice is twofold: (i) their muscle mass is generally greater than that of females and (ii) we wanted to avoid variability linked to hormonal fluctuations. Though the cross-sectional area of fibers is larger in males than in females, the fiber type composition is similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Staron et al., 2000</xref>), thus we are confident that the beneficial effects of the treatment with TMP269 + 5-Aza we observed on muscle function will occur in male and female mice alike. Here, we show that the combined treatment with TMP269 and 5-Aza-2 deoxycytidine have strong ergogenic effects on muscle functions, tested both in vivo and in vitro. The improvement of muscle performance is consistent with the increase of both peak calcium transients and RyR1 protein content in total muscle homogenates and is apparently not associated with changes in the fiber type composition or changes of the minimal Feret’s diameter of muscle fibers. We are confident that this study provides proof of concept for a therapeutic strategy aimed to enhance muscle strength in patients affected by congenital myopathies linked to recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations.</p><p>Our data shows that the improvement of muscle performance in vivo is mainly due to the amelioration of muscle strength in slow twitch fibers. The muscle ultrastructure demonstrates a partial rescue of the ECC machinery (more triads, less of them being incomplete) and of the associated mitochondria and may explain in part the rescue of muscle function. The elucidation of the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the improvement in strength specifically of slow twitch fibers caused by genome-wide effects of drugs inhibiting epigenetic modifying enzymes is an arduous challenge. However, we believe that a few assumptions can be taken into account to understand our data. First, histopathology of muscle biopsies from patients harboring <italic>RYR1-</italic>related congenital myopathies show fiber type I predominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lawal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jungbluth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kondo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bevilacqua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lawal et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the recovery of muscle function after pharmacological treatment should occur to a greater extent in slow twitch fibers compared to fast twitch fibers, since the latter types of fibers are mostly absent. Increasing the strength of slow twitch fibers would greatly benefit patients. Furthermore, this interpretation of the histopathology of human skeletal muscle biopsies is consistent with our previous results on the dHT mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elbaz et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, we found that the RyR1 array disarrangements and morphological alterations are more noticeable in fast glycolytic muscles such as EDLs compared to soleus muscles, a result in line with the idea that skeletal muscle oxidative fibers are more resistant to the damaging effects linked to the expression of recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elbaz et al., 2019</xref>). If this is the case, then upon pharmacological treatment, slow oxidative fibers should recover their function to a greater extent than fast twitch glycolytic fibers. We found that HDAC4 transcript levels in soleus muscles from dHT mice treated with a combination of TMP269 + 5-Aza decreases to a value similar to that found in WT littermates. Though we don’t have a clear explanation for this observation, it appears to be in line with the proposal that high levels of class II HDACs are indicative of muscle damage or age-related atrophy and reduced expression of class II HDACs is associated with an increased running endurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Potthoff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Consalvi et al., 2011</xref>). Second, it was recently demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of class II HDACs causes deacetylation not only of nuclear histones but also of other targets, including MyHC and PGC1alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo et al., 2019</xref>), an event which causes an increase of the cytoplasmic level of the PGC1alpha protein. Interestingly, PGC1alpha is a crucial regulator of oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Handschin and Spiegelman, 2006</xref>). We found that administration of class II HDAC and DNMT inhibitors to dHT mice induces an increase in the number of mitochondria in slow twitch fibers. This result is in agreement with the observed increase in PGC1alpha activity observed after treatment with class II specific HDAC inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo et al., 2019</xref>). Third, reconstitution of the RyR1 arrays in the junctional SR might restore the RyR1 retrograde signal, which is important for the activation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents across T tubular membranes. Since the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 to RyR1 ratio is lower in slow twitch muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delbono and Meissner, 1996</xref>), reactivation of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 calcium current might occur to a larger extent in slow twitch muscles from dHT-treated mice compared to fast twitch muscles. Though Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 calcium currents are not relevant for skeletal muscle ECC, they have been implicated in a broad range of muscle functions, including fatigue resistance, protein synthesis, and calcium-dependent signaling pathways involved in the maintenance of proper skeletal muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the combined pharmacological treatment with an FDA-approved DNMT inhibitor and TMP269 improves muscle strength and performance in a mouse model for recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> congenital myopathy. Further studies are needed to define the exact mechanism of the ergogenic effects of these genome-wide epigenetic modifying drugs; nevertheless, our results provide the proof of concept for the development for pharmacological treatment of patients with congenital myopathies linked to recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><p>All experiments involving animals were carried out on 16- to 21-week-old male mice unless otherwise stated.

For spontaneous locomotor activity, after 15 weeks of treatment with vehicle or TMP269 + 5-Aza, mice were individually housed in cages equipped with a running wheel carrying a magnet as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elbaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mosca et al., 2013</xref>). Wheel revolutions were registered by reed sensors connected to an I-7053D Digital-Input module (Spectra), and the revolution counters were read by a standard laptop computer via an I-7520 RS-485-to-RS-232 interface converter (Spectra). Digitized signals were processed by the ‘‘mouse running’’ software developed at Santhera Pharmaceuticals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briguet et al., 2004</xref>). Total running distance (kilometer) and speed (km/h) were evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Ex vivo muscle strength assessment</title><p>To test muscle force ex vivo, EDL and soleus muscles were dissected from 21-week-old male WT and dHT mice, after 15 weeks of treatment with vehicle alone, or with the combination of TMP26915-Aza. Isolated EDL and soleus muscles were mounted onto a muscle force transducing setup (MyoTronic, Heidelberg, Germany) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mosca et al., 2013</xref>). Muscle force was digitized at 4 kHz by using an AD Instrument converter and stimulated with 15 V pulses for 1.0 ms. Tetanus was recorded in response to a train of pulses of 400 and 1100 ms duration delivered at 10/20/50/100/150 Hz, and 10/20/50/100/120 Hz, for EDL and soleus, respectively. Specific force was normalized to the muscle cross-sectional area [CSA_wet weight (mg)/length (mm)_1.06 (density mg/mm<sup>3</sup>)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks and Faulkner, 1988</xref>).

Muscles were washed with Tyrode’s buffer to block the collagenase activity and gently separated from tendons using large to narrowest set of fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. Fibers obtained by this procedure remained excitable and contracted briskly when assayed experimentally. Finally, fibers were placed on laminin coated (5 µl of 1 mg/ml mouse laminin from Thermo Fisher) 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek corporation) for measurements of the resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] or on ibiTreat 15µ-Slide four well (Ibidi) for electrically evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elbaz et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Measurements of resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and of electrically evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients</title><p>Single FDB fibers were isolated from 4 to 5 male mice per group and allowed to adhere to laminin-treated 35 mm glass bottom dishes for 1 hr at 37°C.

Fibers were rinsed twice with fresh Tyrode’s solution, and measurements were carried out in Tyrode’s solution containing 50 µM BTS. Measurements were carried out with a Nikon Eclipse inverted fluorescent microscope equipped with a 20× PH1 DL magnification objective. The light signals originating from a spot of 1 mm diameter of the magnified image of FDB fibers were converted into electrical signals by a photomultiplier (Myotronic, Heidelberg, Germany). Fibers were excited at 480 nm and then stimulated either with a single pulse of 50 V with a duration of 1 ms or with a train of pulses of 50 V with a duration of 300 ms delivered at 100 Hz. Fluorescent signals were acquired using PowerLab Chart7. Changes in fluorescence were calculated as ΔF/F0 = (Fmax−Frest)/(Frest). Kinetic parameters were analyzed using Chart7 software.

Could the authors comment on steps taken to ensure similar dye loading?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to ensure similar Mag-Fluo4 loading into FDB fibers we carefully controlled time and temperature during the dye loading incubation. Briefly, FBD fibers were first placed in a Warner Instruments RC-27NE chamber mounted in a P6 platform and kept for 15 min in an incubator at 19.0° C. Then the buffer solution in the chamber was replaced with Tyrode's containing 10 M MagFluo4-AM and the FDB fibers were incubated with the new solution for 10 min at 19.0° C. The resulting mean resting MagFluo-4 fluorescence in FDB fibers from WT and dHT mice was similar. Since, the average resting [ca<sup>2+</sup>] as determined with fura-2 was similar in FDB from WT and dHT mice (page 13, lines 248-252) we assume that there are no major differences in the amount of dye loaded into FDB fibers from vehicle treated WT, dHT and drug treated dHT mice.</p><p>We have added a new figure (Appendix 3-figure 1) showing the resting Mag-Fluo-4 fluorescence level (arbitrary units) in FDB fibers. We have also added a sentence commenting on the similar dye loading in the revised manuscript (page 13 lines 252-258).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) The discussion refers to correlations between HDAC4 expression levels and MEF2-dependent gene expression- is expression of any MEF2 target genes altered by TMP269+Aza treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>In the discussion of the unrevised manuscript, we pointed out that it is an arduous challenge to define the exact mechanism underlying the effect of drugs inhibiting epigenetic modifying enzymes. On the basis of data present in the literature, we speculated on potential explanations which may account for the selective effect on slow twitch muscles of TMP269/Aza treatment. In the revised manuscript we deleted the sentence referring to the speculation concerning MEF-2 dependent gene expression (lines 396 and 397 of the unrevised manuscript). Prompted by the reviewer's comment, we performed new RT-PCR experiments on Soleus muscles from mice treated for 15 weeks with vehicle or drugs, and we analysed the expression of Ryr1 together withSlc2a4 (encoding Glut4), a gene which has been reported to be MEF-2 dependent (Liu et al.,1994 J. Biol. Chem 269: 28514-28521).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, soleus muscles from dHT exhibit a decrease of expression of GLUT4 (gene Slc2a4, right panel). At variance with the Ryr1 transcript (left panel), the expression of GLUT4 does not exhibit a statistical significant increase upon TMP269+5-Aza treatment.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>qPCR of Ryr1 and Slc2a4 expression levels in soleus muscles isolated from WT and dHT mice treated for 15 weeks with vehicle or TMP269+5-Aza.</title><p>Each symbol represents the value (mean of duplicate) from a single mouse.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73718-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Concerning requirements for further experimental data, &quot;….that the study would benefit from additional simple mechanistically relevant experiments.&quot;</p><p>(a) In Figure 1 average muscle strength data is plotted for each genotype group of mice and it is not clear from this data representation whether all mice show improvement in muscle strength. Data for individual mice before and after treatment would make a compelling case for improved muscle function in all individuals.</p></disp-quote><p>In the new Figure 1A—figure supplement 1 we show the raw data pertaining to the grip strength of each vehicle and drug treated dHT mouse before and after 10 weeks of drug treatment. Although there was some variability in the response between the dHT mice which were tested, Figure 1A-supplement 1 clearly shows that in each dHT mouse the treatment with TMP269+5-Aza induces an increase of grip strength. This information has also been added in the revised text (page 7 lines 154-156 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) It is not clear whether the ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with Mag-Fluo4 was calibrated for dye loading.</p></disp-quote><p>See answer to point a) of reviewer 2</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) The inhibitors appear beneficial only for slow oxidative soleus fibers, the implications of this for treatment of myopathy in humans could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Histopathological findings on muscle biopsies from patients with RYR1-related congenital myopathies show fiber type 1 predominance (Kondo et al., 2012 Am J Med Genet. 158A:772-778; Bevilacqua et al., 2011 Neuropath Appl Neurobiol 37: 271-284; Lawal et al., 2018 Neurotherapeutics 15:885-899). Thus, the recovery of muscle function after pharmacological treatment should occur to a greater extent in slow twitch fibers compared to fast twitch fibers, since the latter types of fibers are mostly absent. We have added a sentence in the discussion of the revised manuscript (page 22, lines 420-424) to emphasize the potential relevance of our preclinical study for the treatment of patients affected by congenital myopathies linked to recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) The authors have examined HDAC4 expression levels but a key determinant of Class IIa HDAC function is their subcellular localization -in the nucleus they ac as MEF2 repressors and it would be informative to know whether HDAC4 is more nuclear in the dHT mice and whether TMP269+Aza treatment alters its localisation.</p></disp-quote><p>Appendix 2-Figure 2 of the revised manuscript (Figure S2 of the unrevised manuscript) shows that TMP269+5-Aza treatment rescues the acetylation of H3K9, a histone protein associated with nuclear chromatin. This result unequivocally indicates that the inhibition of the deacetylation activity of class IIa HDACs by TMP269 occurs in the nuclei. In addition, Supplementary Figure S3 also shows that in the absence of TMP269+5-Aza treatment, the level of H3K9 acetylation in FDBs from vehicle -treated dHT mice is 50% lower compared to FDBs from WT mice. Histone H3 is one of the main histone proteins involved in the structure of chromatin in eukaryotic cells and its acetylation is linked to active transcription.</p><p>The results shown in Appendix 2-Figure 2 indicate that deacetylation activity linked to class IIa HDACs is higher in vehicle treated dHT mice. Assuming that the enzymatic turn-over rate of class IIa HDACs from WT is similar to that of dHT mice, the increase of deacetylation activity in dHT is consistent with an enrichment of HDAC proteins in the nuclei of dHT. The recovery of the H3K9 acetylation brought about by TMP269+5-Aza treatment reflects the inhibitory effect of TMP269 on the enzymatic activity of the class IIa HDACs rather than alteration of the HDAC4 protein trafficking, because to our knowledge there are no data showing that TMP269 stimulates calmodulin-dependent kinase 2 whose phosphorylation activity promotes nuclear efflux of HDAC4. We added a sentence in the revised manuscript to highlight the results of Figure S3 (page 6, lines 126- 133).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(C) Reviewer 3 has the following revision requests:</p><p>(1) Concerning the manuscript:</p><p>(a) The longitudinal studies with drug treatment of the knock-in mice are well-conducted. It appears that all the experiments were conducted with male mice. The authors may want to discuss how sex may impact the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for performing experiments only on male mice was twofold: (i) their muscle mass and force development is generally greater than that of females and (ii) we wanted to avoid variability linked to hormonal fluctuations. Although the cross sectional area of muscle fibers of female mice is smaller compared to that of male mice, there is no differences in fiber type composition (Staron et al., 2000 J Histochem Cytochem 48: 623-629). Thus, assuming the fraction of slow twitch fibers within skeletal muscle is the same between male and female we are confident that the therapeutic effect of TMP269+5-Aza treatment will occur also in females. We have added a sentence on the revised version of the manuscript (page 21, lines 399-404).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) The authors conducted genome-wide DNA methylation analysis and identified a group of genes that underwent hypo-methylation with the treatment of TMP269 and 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine.

Preliminary TMT mass spectrometry analysis of muscles from dHT and WT before treatment suggest that there are a large number of proteins (&gt;3000) in EDL and Soleus muscles exhibiting differential expression in dHT compared to WT. The full characterization and validation of these data sets represents a new project in itself. We think it is goes beyond the goal of the presents study to perform RNAseq in muscles from drug and vehicle treated WT and dHT mice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
