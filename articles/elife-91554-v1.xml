precision, and/or accuracy. Here, we present an optimized charge transfer RNA sequencing (tRNA-Seq) method that combines previous developments with newly described approaches to establish a protocol for precise and accurate tRNA charge measurements. We verify that this protocol provides robust quantification of tRNA aminoacylation and we provide an end-to-end method that scales to hundreds of samples including software for data processing. Additionally, we show that this method supports measurements of relative tRNA expression levels and can be used to infer tRNA modifications through reverse transcription misincorporations, thereby supporting multipurpose applications in tRNA biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tRNA</kwd><kwd>aminoacylation</kwd><kwd>tRNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>Whitfeld reaction</kwd><kwd>tRNA stability</kwd><kwd>small-RNA sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM147118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>Lucas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Improved chemical, molecular biology, and computational approaches establish an optimized method for accurate and precise quantification of tRNA expression, modifications, and aminoacylation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Quantification of transfer RNA (tRNA) aminoacylation, also referred to as charge, has been performed using radiolabeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wolfson and Uhlenbeck, 2002</xref>), amino acid analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill and Struhl, 1986</xref>), northern blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ho and Kan, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Varshney et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stenum et al., 2017</xref>), DNA microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dittmar et al., 2005</xref>), and high-throughput sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2017</xref>). While radiolabeling is highly accurate, it is limited to purified tRNAs undergoing lab manipulation. Northern blotting uses differential migration of acylated tRNA during electrophoresis to measure acylation levels but has many known limitations such as cross-binding probes, low sensitivity, low throughput on multiple tRNAs, insufficient band separation, etc. Chemical differentiation of acylated tRNAs combined with DNA microarrays were introduced to circumvent the problems with northern blotting, but has since been superseded by high-throughput sequencing approaches that enable quantification on all tRNAs in one experiment.</p><p>Chemical differentiation of acylated tRNAs is achieved using the Malaprade reaction to attack the 2,3-dihydroxyls on the 3’ ribose of deacylated tRNA, causing ring opening and destabilization. The destabilized base is then eliminated using high pH and heat, resulting in a one base truncated 3’ sequence of uncharged tRNAs compared to those protected by aminoacylation. This sequence of reactions was characterized and used extensively in the past in an effort to sequence RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Whitfeld and Markham, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Whitfeld, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khym and Cohn, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neu and Heppel, 1964</xref>), and while futile for RNA sequencing, the single-base truncation has proven highly useful to ‘tag’ deacylated tRNAs. We shall refer to this reaction sequence as the ‘Whitfeld reaction’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The accuracy and robustness of aminoacylation measurements depend on two parts: the completeness of the Whitfeld reaction and the quality of tRNA sequencing (tRNA-Seq). A major problem in tRNA-Seq is base modifications, known to be numerous on tRNAs. These can lead to stalling, misincorporation, skipping, or falloff during the reverse transcription (RT) step of the sequencing protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Motorin et al., 2007</xref>). The RT polymerase is most severely affected by base modifications disrupting the Watson-Crick base pairing, while other modifications are often less impactful or silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sas-Chen and Schwartz, 2019</xref>). To increase RT readthrough the demethylase AlkB has been used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cozen et al., 2015</xref>), while more recently optimization of incubation conditions, including low salt and extended incubation time, can similarly increase readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrens et al., 2021</xref>). Several other factors can also lead to errors in tRNA-Seq such as low RNA integrity, incomplete deacylation prior to adapter ligation, adapter ligation bias, PCR amplification bias, and errors in read alignment, necessitating further protocol optimization to overcome these issues.</p><p>Adapter ligation bias is another well-documented problem in small-RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhuang et al., 2012</xref>), but receives little attention in most tRNA-Seq protocols where it is particularly problematic because adapters often incorporate a barcode for sample multiplexing. The problem is further exacerbated when tRNA-Seq is coupled with the Whitfeld reaction, because this creates different sequence contexts for ligation of aminoacylated and deacylated tRNAs. One solution is to optimize conditions such that the ligation goes to completion. To that end, the tRNA secondary structure provides a useful opportunity as it contains four nucleotides on the 3’ end that do not participate in the base pairing of the acceptor stem. These are the discriminator bases followed by the invariant CCA-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These free nucleotides can be engaged in base pairing by an oligo splint designed to guide the ligation of the adapter and can improve tRNA specificity and ligation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shigematsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Summary illustrating the steps of the charge transfer RNA sequencing (tRNA-Seq) method we used to measure aminoacylation, relative expression, and tRNA modification levels.</title><p>First, the Whitfeld reaction (detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) is used to discriminate between tRNAs with and without an aminoacylation by cleaving off the 3’ base of deacylated tRNA. Second, the tRNA secondary structure exposes the discriminator base (N) followed by the CCA/CC-end, creating a sticky end for splint-assisted ligation to a barcoded adapter. P at the 5’ end of adapter oligos indicates phosphorylation. Stars (*) on the 3’ end of splint and adapter oligos indicate modifications to block self-ligation. Third, using the purified ligation product, RT-PCR is used to generate cDNA. Fourth, the cDNA is converted into a dsDNA library and sequenced to determine tRNA charge, expression, and modifications.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91554-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the Whitfeld reaction with acylated and deacylated transfer RNA (tRNA) leading to generation of CCA and CC-ending tRNAs.</title><p>For deacylated tRNA, 3’ adenosine is oxidized by periodate and then cleaved off by lysine-induced β-elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rammler, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uziel, 1973</xref>).

It arises due to the high error rate of the RT polymerase when reading through modified bases in addition to frequent falloff. In combination, reads will often not have any continuous stretch of more than 15 nt that perfectly match its reference. This is a problem for almost all alignment algorithms because they rely on some variation of subsequence matching to enable speed-up. The problem has been addressed by clustering of the reference sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffmann et al., 2018</xref>) as well as masking known modified positions in the reference sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrens et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In recent years many variations of the tRNA-Seq method have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cozen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shigematsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thomas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lucas et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pinkard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warren et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamagami and Hori, 2023</xref>), but only a few couple it with the Whitfeld reaction to probe aminoacylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrens et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watkins et al., 2022</xref>) and little is known about the precision and accuracy of these measurements. Here, we present an up-to-date method for charge tRNA-Seq that integrates new and existing developments, including improved Whitfeld reaction chemistry, splint-assisted ligation, high readthrough RT-PCR, and improved read mapping, enabling us to measure tRNA charge, expression, and modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We perform tests of the quantitative capabilities of the method and determine its precision and accuracy. Finally, we provide an open-source code repository, enabling others to use our read processing, mapping, and statistical tools on their own data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/krdav/tRNA-charge-seq">https://github.com/krdav/tRNA-charge-seq</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davidsen, 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimizing the Whitfeld reaction for charge tRNA-Seq</title><p>The use of periodate oxidation to discriminate aminoacylated tRNA by sequencing was first used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dittmar et al., 2005</xref>, for microarray measurements and then elegantly adapted to high-throughput sequencing by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2017</xref>. However, we found noticeable differences between the conditions reported optimal for periodate oxidation in biochemical assays in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khym and Cohn, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neu and Heppel, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khym and Uziel, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dyer, 1956</xref>) and those used in charge tRNA-Seq today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrens et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watkins et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pavlova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsukamoto et al., 2022</xref>).

We found that complete oxidation is achieved after just 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, panel A) and therefore chose 10 min as optimal, with incubation on ice and in the dark because sunlight induces periodate oxidation side reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erskine et al., 1953</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Optimizing the chemistry of charge transfer RNA sequencing (tRNA-Seq).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time required to complete periodate oxidation of the <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA-Lys-CCA oligo on ice.

While this cleavage reaction is complex, involving several semi-stable intermediates and different pathways depending on the pH, it appears to be induced by high pH and the presence of a primary amine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uziel, 1975</xref>). Lysine has been identified as a good source of primary amine and incubation at 45°C has been found optimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khym and Cohn, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neu and Heppel, 1964</xref>).

We found complete cleavage after just 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, panel B); however, this step also serves as deacylation step and some aminoacylations were still measurable after up to 90 min of lysine cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel A).

This is likely due to the generation of dialdehydes that cross-link lysines; therefore, we chose to use ethylene glycol which forms formaldehyde upon periodate quenching.

To achieve this with enough throughout, we chose to ligate the samples to barcoded adapters to enable sample pooling before the RT-PCR step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017</xref>). However, we found that the measured charge was highly variable between replicates and that the measurements were biased by the barcode identity to an unacceptable degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We hypothesized that this is due to ligation bias commonly encountered in blunt-end ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhuang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jayaprakash et al., 2011</xref>) and reasoned that increasing ligation efficiency could mitigate the bias. Our attempts to improved ligation efficiency failed as we were never able to reach more than ~50% ligation of the input tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>); however, we note that others have reported high blunt-end ligation efficiency using an optimized adapter design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrens et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Splint-assisted ligation improves efficiency</title><p>Inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2015</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shigematsu et al., 2017</xref>, we turned to splint-assisted ligation. This approach utilizes that tRNAs have four nucleotides protruding from the 3’ end and therefore available for base pairing: the discriminator base, which can be any of the four RNA nucleotides, followed by the invariant CCA-end. The splint oligo is designed to bind both the 3’ end of tRNAs and the 5’ end of an adapter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), thus bringing the two into proximity and increasing ligation efficiency. However, whereas earlier uses of splint-assisted ligation could assume that all tRNAs end on CCA, we have a mix of CCA and CC-ending tRNAs and therefore needed to use two splints. As tRNAs compete for ligation it is imperative that CCA-ending tRNAs, with stronger interaction with the splint, is not favored over CC-ending tRNAs. Fortunately, we observed a near-complete ligation between all of our nine barcoded adapters and both CCA-ending human tRNA and a CC-ending <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA-Lys oligo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, panels A and B). The ligation was specific as it was fully dependent on complementarity between the tRNA and the splint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, panel C). As we are only interested in ligation between tRNA and adapter, we block all other possible ligations through dephosphorylation of the 5’ tRNA nucleotide and oligo modifications blocking the 3’ end of adapter and splint oligos. This affords us the advantage of using a pure DNA splint without any RNA nucleotides as those used in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shigematsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pinkard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warren et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thomas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lucas et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we validated that tRNA processed using the one-pot Whitfeld reaction could be effectively used as substrate in the ligation reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, panel E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, panel A). We noted that a small amount of unligated tRNA appeared in reactions with tRNA oxidized with periodate. This unligated tRNA is of unknown origin and largely refractory to further ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, panel B); however, as shown later using charge titration, this did not have a measurable impact on the accuracy of the aminoacylation measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Combining optimizations results in a robust method for measuring tRNA charge</title><p>After combining the optimized Whitfeld reaction with subsequent splint-assisted ligation, we used the RT-PCR method proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrens et al., 2021</xref>, using the TGIRT polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mohr et al., 2013</xref>) to maximize the readthrough of modified nucleotides.

The RT-PCR was primed by an oligo containing a 10 nt unique molecular identifier (UMI) to diversify the sequence context for the subsequent circular ligation and allow collapsing of reads derived from the same tRNA molecule during data analysis.

Similarly, we validated the completeness of deacylation using deacylated controls and the integrity of the tRNA CCA-end using non-oxidized controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>, panels B and C). We then measured the baseline charge of H1299 cells grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) using four replicates, observing excellent repeatability and high charge for most codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, panel F).

Most commonly, the Bowtie1 or Bowtie2 aligners have been applied using various settings to accommodate short reads and the many mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cozen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clark et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pinkard et al., 2020</xref>). However, while these are ultra-fast and widely used for RNA-Seq, Bowtie1 does not support alignments with insertions or deletions, and although Bowtie2 does, it does not guarantee that the best alignment is returned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). We reasoned that many users of tRNA-Seq would rather sacrifice computational speed than mapping accuracy and therefore we apply a full all-against-all local alignment using the Smith-Waterman algorithm to provide the guaranteed best alignment(s). This is possible because the set of tRNA transcripts in a typical species is only a few hundred sequences and thus we are able to align 1e8 tRNA-Seq reads to a human tRNA reference with 457 sequences in less than 8 hr on an Intel Core i7-8700K Processor (12 threads, 4.70 GHz).</p><p>In addition to the choice of read alignment method, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrens et al., 2021</xref>, found that using an SNP-tolerant alignment substantially improved mapping when modified positions causing RT misincorporations were defined as SNPs and that new modifications could be inferred from the data and used to further improve the alignment. We adapted this approach by masking modified positions in the reference to ‘N’ while relying solely on the misincorporation information embedded in the sequencing data. We extracted this information using a first-pass alignment and then used mismatch frequencies to pick positions for reference masking. As such, this is an iterative process because the alignment will change slightly with a new masked reference. In addition to the number of iterations, masking is only applied on positions with a minimum mismatch frequency (min_mut_freq) and frequency is calculated either including or excluding reads with multiple transcript alignments (unique_anno_float). Furthermore, a parameter (frac_max_score) controls the sharing of a mask to highly similar transcripts. To find the optimal combination of parameters for reference masking we performed a grid search with the objective of finding the masking that resulted in the least number of reads assigned to transcripts with multiple codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel A). This lead to 533 positions in the 455 sequence reference getting masked and resulting in an alignment improvement, reducing the reads with multiple codon alignments from 11.71% to 5.09%.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Masking of the reference sequences improves alignment performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Grid search optimization of parameters determining the extent of reference masking (see Materials and methods section for details).

We have presented a robust method for measuring tRNA charge and extensively validated it in the relevant context of human tRNA. Furthermore, we have quantified the measurement precision of charge and relative expression. Accuracy was only quantified for charge measurement whereas this is more challenging for expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2015</xref>). One step toward accurate expression level measurements is efficient adapter ligation, such as the splint-assisted ligation method used herein; however, future versions of tRNA-Seq should strive toward providing better validation and controls for relative expression measurements. In our version of the Whitfeld reaction we use lysine to induce base cleavage at low pH. We have later been made aware that ornithine is an even better inducer of cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uziel, 1975</xref>) and thus, the pH of the cleavage reaction could be lowered even further and possibly combined with Cu<sup>+2</sup> as a deacylation catalyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kroll, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schofield and Zamecnik, 1968</xref>) to shorten incubation times.</p><p>In our experience, as well as others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shigematsu et al., 2017</xref>), splint-assisted ligation is highly efficient compared to blunt-end ligation. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrens et al., 2021</xref>, achieved high-efficiency blunt-end ligation, allowing inclusion of non-mature tRNAs without the normal CCA-end. Nevertheless, our results highlight the difficulty of using blunt-end ligations for tRNA-Seq and provide an alternative approach of splint-assisted ligation to help mitigate those issues. One potential issue with our approach is that the tRNA<sup>His</sup> sequence is not ideal for splint-assisted ligation due to the additional G added to the 5’ end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heinemann et al., 2012</xref>) and thus shielding the discriminator base from base pairing with the splint. Despite this, reads mapping to tRNA<sup>His</sup> are surprisingly abundant and contain both CC and CCA-ends. In future versions of this method, we see the possibility of combining our optimizations with the on-bead sample processing developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watkins et al., 2022</xref>, to eliminate gel purification steps and achieve faster and cleaner processing.</p><p>We solve the tRNA alignment problem by non-heuristic alignment which is guaranteed to return the best alignment. This is computationally demanding but nevertheless quite possible on the small number of tRNA transcript references. A more challenging problem is the application of reference masking to improve the annotation accuracy. We used unique codon annotation as the objective in our optimization, but this is a surrogate as the ground truth is unknown. Further improvements could be achieved by simulation of tRNA reads including realistic RT misincorporations, indels, and falloff and optimizing alignment to this simulated ground truth. Additionally, annotation performance could be increased further using tools, such as hidden Markov models, to model complex phenomena such as interaction between modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez-Alias et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we report a robust charge tRNA-Seq method that has been thoroughly tested and validated as precise and accurate for charge measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and RNA extraction</title><p>The human cell line H1299 was acquired from ATCC and tested to be free from mycoplasma (MycoProbe, R&amp;D Systems).

Then, 1 mL ice-cold 80% IPA containing 100 mM sodium acetate (pH = 4.5) was added, RNA was precipitated, washed twice, dried, and reconstituted in 10 μL 100 mM sodium acetate (pH = 4.5). These deacylated samples were then submitted to the charge tRNA-Seq sample processing described below, except using lysine at pH = 9.5 and 90 min incubation at 45°C to ensure complete deacylation. From this, incubation time in lysine (pH = 8) was chosen to be 4 hr. To compare the RNA integrity after cleavage with lysine vs. borax, samples of 10 μg whole-cell RNA were prepared in 10 μL 100 mM sodium acetate (pH = 4.5) and added 50 μL of either 1 M lysine (pH = 8) or 100 mM sodium borate (pH = 9.5).

For deacylated control samples, RNA was prepared by first performing a deacylation step on the input RNA by incubation in 1 M lysine (pH = 8) at 45°C for 4 hr, followed by purification using the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (50 μg). The RNA concentration was adjusted to 1 μg/μL, 10 μL was transferred to a fresh tube, and 1 μL <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA spike-in control was added. Initially, the spike-in control contained 5 ng/μL <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA-Lys-CCA, later 5 ng/μL of each <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA-Thr-CGT CCA-Phos and <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA-Thr-CGT CCA was also included. To this 5 μL freshly prepared 200 mM NaIO<sub>4</sub> was added following 10 min incubation on ice, in the dark. For non-oxidized control samples, NaCl was used instead of NaIO<sub>4</sub>. The oxidation was quenched by adding 5 μL 50% (vol/vol) ethylene glycol (~9 M) and incubating for 5 min on ice and 5 min at room temperature, in the dark. Then 50 μL 1 M lysine (pH = 8) with 1 μL SuperaseIn was added and tubes were incubated for 4 hr at 45°C. To dephosphorylate RNA 8 μL 10× rCutSmart Buffer and 1 μL rSAP was added followed by 30 min incubation at 37°C. RNA was then purified using the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (50 μg), eluting with 30 μL water. A 6 μL sample was then denatured by mixing with 2× urea loading buffer (8 M urea, 30 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM EDTA, 0.02% [wt/vol] bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol, pH adjusted to 4.7–5) and incubating 2 min at 90°C. The tRNA fraction was then isolated on a 10% Urea-TBE gel using SYBRGold staining and a blue light transilluminator for visualization. Gel elution was done by crushing the gel with a disposable pestle, adding 200 μL gel elution buffer and 1 μL SuperaseIn, then snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, and incubating at 65°C for 5 min with shaking. This gel slurry was filtered through a Spin-X filter followed by tRNA purification using the Oligo Clean &amp; Concentrator kit. The concentration of purified tRNA was measured, then it was annealed in NEBuffer 2 by heating to 94°C for 2 min followed by cooling 1 °C/s to 4°C. 35 ng of the annealed tRNA was transferred to a PCR tube and to this was added 20 pmol annealed adapter:splint partial duplex, 1 μL 10× NEBuffer 2, 2 μL 10× T4 RNA ligase buffer, 4 μL 50% PEG-8000, 1 μL SuperaseIn, and 1 μL T4 RNA ligase 2. The annealed adapter:splint partial duplex was made by making an equimolar mix of the CCA and CC splint oligos, then using this to make an equimolar mix with the adapter oligo and annealing this in NEBuffer 2 by heating to 94°C for 2 min followed by cooling 0.3 °C/s to 4°C.

Then 1 μL 25 mM dNTPs was added and the incubation was resumed at 42°C for 16 hr on a thermocycler with the heated lid set to 50°C. The RNA template was hydrolyzed by adding 1 μL 5 M NaOH followed by incubation at 95°C for 3 min. The samples were then purified using the Oligo Clean &amp; Concentrator kit and the cDNA was isolated on a gel and purified similarly to the initial tRNA isolation, eluting with 7 μL water. cDNA was circularized by transferring 5.5 μL cDNA to a PCR tube and adding 2 μL 5 M betaine, 1 μL 10× CircLigase buffer, 0.5 μL 1 mM ATP, 0.5 μL 50 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 μL CircLigase.

The optimal number of PCR cycles was determined by preparing three PCRs, incubating them with <italic>X</italic>=10, 12, and 14 and running 4 μL of each reaction on a 4–12% TBE gel. The PCRs with optimal <italic>X</italic>, resulting in abundant amplification product with little PCR crossover, were purified using the DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator-5 kit and resolved on a 4–12% TBE gel. The gel was stained using SYBRGold and visualized using a blue light transilluminator to isolate the library DNA by cutting out the size range covering all possible insert lengths (170–290 bp). Gel elution was done by crushing the gel with a disposable pestle, adding 300 μL TBE, snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, and incubating at room temperature overnight with mixing. If necessary, elution time could be decreased by incubation at higher temperature, although this required adding higher salt concentrations to prevent DNA reannealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>, panel B). The gel slurry was filtered through a Spin-X filter following DNA purification using the DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator-5 kit and eluting with 20 μL 10 mM Tris (pH = 8).

The oxidation reaction was performed by adding 10 μL 100 mM sodium acetate (pH = 4.5) and 20 μL 200 mM NaIO<sub>4</sub> followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Oxidation was quenched using 20 μL 50% ethylene glycol and incubated 30 min at room temperature in the dark.

To the eluate 400 μL 1 M lysine (pH = 8) and 1 μL SuperaseIn was added followed by 5 hr incubation at 45°C and purification using the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (using two 50 μg columns). The product, a 1 nt truncated and 3’ phosphorylated oligo named <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA-Thr-CCA-Phos, was resolved on a gel to isolate the full-length oligo, as described for the other control. Half of this product was submitted to dephosphorylation using rSAP and purified using the Oligo Clean &amp; Concentrator kit yielding <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA-Thr-CCA.

For adapters A1, A2, A3, and A4 the barcode sequence was 8 nt starting at the 5’, for adapters l1N, l2N, and l3N the barcode sequence was truncated to 5 nt to make space for a preceding six random nucleotides to diversify the sequence context engaged in ligation.</p><p>The design of adapters used for splint-assisted ligation was influenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2015</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shigematsu et al., 2017</xref>, but with several important differences listed below. First, we do not use ribonucleotides at any positions in our adapters or splint oligos. This affords us higher quality oligos due to the higher coupling efficiency of deoxyribose during oligo synthesis as well as robustness against hydrolysis of DNA compared to RNA. A primary reason to use ribonucleotides in the adapters and splint oligos is to increase ligation efficiency; however, we achieved ~100% ligation efficiency on isolated human tRNA using our design without ribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, panel A). Second, instead of ligating the adapter to the 3’ and the splint to the 5’ of the tRNA, we only ligate the adapter and block the splint from ligating using a 3’ C3 spacer, as well as dephosphorylating the 5’ of the tRNA. Similar to the blunt-end ligation adapters, a 3’ dideoxycytidine is included on all adapters to block self-ligation and concatemer formation. Third, we use two different lengths of splint oligos with overhang compatible with NCCA and NCC-ending tRNA. Fourth, our adapters vary in length by the size of their barcodes, from 5 to 8 nt. This is to offset the sequencing reading frame of read P2 (P7) as it progresses into the 3’ end of the tRNA, thus increasing the sequence diversity and base calling quality.</p><p>The RT-PCR oligo was designed in a similar way as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017</xref>, with a 5’ phosphorylation for subsequent circular ligation of the cDNA and an 18-atom hexa-ethyleneglycol spacer (iSp18) to terminate the polymerase extension and avoiding rolling-circle amplification during the PCR to attach Illumina P7/P5 sequences. The RT oligo has a random purine base on the 5’ to increase circular ligation efficiency. We added an additional nine random nucleotides following this purine to increase the diversity of the sequence engaged in circular ligation. These random nucleotides also provide a UMI with 524,288 possible sequences that enable collapsing of reads derived from the same tRNA molecule. The UMI is also used as a general sample quality control by comparing the number of observed UMI sequences with the number expected.

Mismatches, gaps, and RT truncations were extracted by redoing the Smith-Waterman alignment between the read and its unmasked transcript annotation using a match score of 1, a mismatch score of –2, a gap opening score of –3, and a gap extension score of –2. Using this new alignment, mismatched, gaps, and the index at the end of the alignment were extracted. Then for each transcript the fraction of reads having mismatches and gaps at a given position was calculated, additionally the percentage drop in coverage at each position is reported, here referred to as RT stops. For both mutation, gap fractions and RT stops, the UMI corrected read count was used. We provide a boilerplate example of the whole read processing workflow on GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/krdav/tRNA-charge-seq/blob/main/projects/example/process_data.ipynb">https://github.com/krdav/tRNA-charge-seq/blob/main/projects/example/process_data.ipynb</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Reference masking</title><p>A human tRNA transcript reference for alignment was made from hg38 annotations in GtRNAdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan and Lowe, 2016</xref>). These sequences were deduplicated and mitochondrial tRNAs and spike-in control sequences were appended. Then a BLAST database was generated, as required by SWIPE, using the makeblastdb application. To further improve the alignment specificity, a masked reference was made by converting positions with high likelihood of mismatch to Ns such that these have no negative contribution on the alignment score. Position-wise mismatch frequency was found as described above and filtered using a minimum of 200 transcript observations and 100 observations on each position. These were then turned into a masked reference using four tuning parameters for picking the positions to mask. unique_anno: Only count reads with a unique transcript annotation. min_mut_freq: The minimum mismatch frequency to trigger masking. frac_max_score: The minimum fraction of the maximum alignment score between two reference sequences to expand the masked positions in one reference to another, requiring both positions to have the same nucleotide and the acceptor position to have less than 100 observations. The purpose is for an abundant transcript to donate its masking to a highly similar, but less abundant, transcript likely having the same RNA modifications. iteration: The number of masking iterations to perform. When changing the reference for alignment by masking the annotations can change, thus changing the position-wise mismatch frequency and the resulting reference masking. Running multiple iterations of reference masking stabilizes this change.</p><p>To find the optimal combination of tuning parameters a grid search was performed, testing all combinations of parameters shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel A. The objective of the search is to minimize the percentage of reads assigned to transcripts with multiple anticodons. Alternatively, the objective could be to minimize the percentage of reads assigned to multiple transcripts; however, this objective can lead the tuning parameters toward masking only a single transcript out of a family of highly similar transcripts, resulting in assignment of unique annotations to truncated reads, which cannot truly distinguish between transcripts of high similarity. This problem is less concerning using minimization of multiple anticodons since most families of highly similar transcripts have identical anticodons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Barcode replicate test</title><p>For the barcode replicate test shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the RNA used was first incubated 8 hr at 20°C in intracellular physiological buffer, similar to the 8 hr timepoint described in the ‘Aminoacylation half-life’ section below. This provided tRNA containing a spectrum of charge levels, spanning from almost fully acylated isoleucine tRNAs to almost fully deacylated asparagine tRNA. A single 10 μg sample of this RNA was then subjected to the one-pot Whitfeld reaction and subsequent tRNA isolation and ligation to each of the nine adapters as described for charge tRNA-Seq sample processing above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Charge titration test</title><p>Whole-cell RNA was reconstituted with 100 mM sodium acetate (pH = 4.5) and adjusted to 1 μg/μL while keeping the RNA cold throughout. Half of this was moved to a fresh tube and deacylated by adding 5× volumes of 1 M lysine (pH = 8), incubating at 45°C for 4 hr, and purifying using the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit. Meanwhile, the other half was stored at –80°C. The concentration of the deacylated RNA was adjusted to 1 μg/μL and mixtures of intact and deacylated RNA were made using the following percentages of intact/deacylated RNA: 100/0, 85/15, 70/30, 55/45, 40/60, 25/75, 10/90, 0/100. Then these mixtures were subjected to the charge tRNA-Seq sample processing protocol described above with between four and eight barcode replicates across independently prepared sequencing libraries, sequenced on different flow cells.</p><p>Reads were processed and the aminoacylation charge of each transcript was extracted to relate the measured with the predicted charge. However, the actual mixing ratios may deviate from the ones noted above due to inaccuracies in measuring the RNA concentration of intact and deacylated RNA, and due to depletion of certain tRNA species during the deacylation process, e.g., tRNAs sensitive to hydrolysis or depurination. We address this using a correction factor, <italic>F<sub>i</sub></italic>, described below.

The buffer used was an intracellular physiological buffer at 1× containing: 19 mM NaCl, 125 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM spermidine, 30 mM HEPES, adjusted to pH = 7.2 with KOH.

By combining recent advances in tRNA sequencing with lysine-based chemistry that is more gentle on RNA, splint oligo-based adapter ligation, and full alignment of tRNA reads, they generate an interesting new protocol. The lab protocol is complemented by a software tool that is openly available on Github. Many of the points highlighted in this protocol are not new, but have been used in recent protocols such as Behrens et al. (2021) or McGlincy and Ingolia (2017). Nevertheless, a strength of this study is that the authors carefully test different conditions to optimize their protocol using a set of well-designed controls.</p><p>The conclusions of the manuscript appear to be well supported by the data presented. However, the lack of benchmarking relative to other methods remains as a key criticism also after this revision.</p><p>(1) The manuscript reports a different method to measure aminoacylation of tRNA. The main point that remains unsatisfactory is a better benchmarking of such aminoacylation measurements against the state of the art. In the current form of the revised manuscript it is not possible to estimate how much the results of this new protocol differ from alternative methods and in particular from Behrens et al. (2021). Here it will be helpful to perform experiments with samples similar to those (like HEK cells or yeast cells) used in the mim-tRNAseq study and not with H1299 cells.</p><p>The claim that a comparison to every published protocol is not feasible is not a good argument for not performing any benchmarking experiments. Such benchmarking experiments are not meant to define the ground truth but are needed to estimate the difference in the outcome of different protocols. I agree with the authors that precision/reproducibility is essential when developing a new protocol. But the analysis and comparison should not stop there.</p><p>(2) The reported protocol can not only be used for quantification of tRNA aminoacylation but it can also be used for tRNA quantification and analysis of tRNA modifications.

The improved methods for discrimination of aminoacyl-tRNAs from non-acylated tRNAs, more efficient splint-assisted ligation to modify the tRNAs' ends for the following RT-PCR reaction, and the use of an error-tolerating mapping algorithm to map the tRNA sequencing reads provide new tools for anyone interested in tRNA concentrations and functional states in different cells and organisms.

We address these pointwise below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript of Davidsen and Sullivan describes an improved tRNA-seq protocol to determine aminoacyl-tRNA levels. The improvements include: (i) optimizing the Whitfeld or oxidation reaction to select aminoacyl-tRNAs from oxidation-sensitive non-acylated tRNAs; (ii) using a splint-assisted ligation to modify the tRNAs' ends for the following RT-PCR reaction; (iii) using an error-tolerating mapping algorithm to map the tRNA sequencing reads that contain mismatches at modified nucleotides.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The two steps, the oxidation, and the splint-assisted ligation are yield-diminishing steps, thus the protocol of Davidsen and Sullivan is an important improvement of the current protocols to enhance the quantification of aminocyl-tRNAs.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The oxidation and the selection of aminoacyl-tRNA is the first step in all protocols. Thereafter they differ on whether blunt ligation, hairpin (DM-tRNA-seq, YAMAT-seq, QuantM-seq, mim tRNA-seq, LOTTE tRNA-seq), or splint ligation is used and finally what detection method is applied (i-tRAP, tRNA microarrays). What is the correlation to those alternative approaches (e.g. i-tRAP (PMID 36283829), tRNA microarrays (PMID: 31263264) etc.)? What is the correlation with other approaches with which this improved protocol shares some steps (DM-tRNA-seq, mim-tRNA-seq)?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the fair assessment and fully agree that our work would benefit from a large comparison between all known tRNA-seq methods. We did directly compare many elements of our method to those of other methods (e.g. ligation efficiency and barcode bias); however, as noted by the reviewer we did not perform a direct end-to-end comparison with all other methods. An ideal comparison would require running several different sample conditions and technical replicates through our protocol and repeating the process across a half dozen or so other methods as they are described. Unfortunately, this approach is unlikely to be feasible since each method uses different oligos, reagents and kits, and all would have to be acquired at substantial cost. Some methods also rely on other detection methods such as microarrays, qPCR, or Illumina sequencing, which would also make this goal all the more onerous. There are also different pipelines for data processing that, in some instances, make the final results hard to compare. In short, this would be a monumental and expensive task to do comprehensively. We also worry that, even if these experiments were conducted such that some variables were concluded to be superior, they could still be challengeable based on perceived or actual protocol differences from the prior art. In summary, we think that an overall comparison with each method would be ideal, but practical concerns limit us to optimizing and comparing the variables that we found to be most prone to introducing bias in the results.</p><p>For methods that measure tRNA expression levels (DM-tRNA-seq, YAMAT-seq, QuantM-seq, mim-tRNA-seq, LOTTE tRNA-seq etc.) there are some fundamental problems regarding absolute quantification using NGS that preclude simple comparisons. These problems are well known in the field of microRNA (Fuchs et al. (2012) [PMID: 25942392]) and arise due to several factors introduced during processing steps such as purification, ligation, reverse transcription and amplification. With the lack a “true” quantitation benchmark it would be difficult to make quantitative claims from each. Therefore, in our own work we benchmark tRNA expression levels for sample-to-sample reproducibility (i.e. precision) as further explained in the response to reviewer #2.</p><p>For comparison to methods that measure tRNA charge we did have an opportunity to compare our results with those of another study. To this end, we have added a figure comparing the baseline charge found using our method and the one used in Evans et al. (Revised manuscript Figure 2—figure supplement 9). This comparison finds broadly similar results for tRNA charge, including similar trends for a subset of Glu, Ser and Pro codons that are notable for their lowered basal tRNA charge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Davidsen and Sullivan present an improved method for quantifying tRNA aminoacylation levels by deep sequencing. By combining recent advances in tRNA sequencing with lysine-based chemistry that is more gentle on RNA, splint oligo-based adapter ligation, and full alignment of tRNA reads, they generate an interesting new protocol. The lab protocol is complemented by a software tool that is openly available on Github. Many of the points highlighted in this protocol are not new but have been used in recent protocols such as Behrens et al. (2021) or McGlincy and Ingolia (2017). Nevertheless, a strength of this study is that the authors carefully test different conditions to optimize their protocol using a set of well-designed controls.</p><p>The conclusions of the manuscript appear to be well supported by the data presented. However, there are a few points that need to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the acknowledgement of the strength of our aminoacylation controls and agree that our method is relying on many aspects of the mentioned prior work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) One point that remains unsatisfactory is a better benchmarking against the state of the art. It is currently impossible to estimate how much the results of this new protocol differ from alternative methods and in particular from Behrens et al. (2021). Here it will be helpful to perform experiments with samples similar to those used in the mim-tRNAseq study and not with H1299 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that more rigorous benchmarking would be desirable. As also noted in the response to reviewer #1, a full end-to-end comparison of methods would be ideal but would be onerous and expensive in practice, so we focused on optimizing the steps we found to be most prone to introducing bias in the data.</p><p>We agree that Behrens et al., (2021) has substantial methodological overlap with our work and was instrumental in our efforts; however, the focus of their manuscript was largely on quantification of tRNA abundance and modifications, rather than the tRNA charge. In fact, tRNA charge was only determined for yeast in that study. Quantifying the abundance of short RNAs using NGS is very difficult (Fuchs et al. (2012) [PMID: 25942392]) and will likely require the use of a mixture of tRNAs as spike-in references for normalization (Bissels et al. (2009) [PMID: 19861428]). In the case of Behrens et al. (2021), they did not use a spike-in tRNA reference, but instead correlated gene copy number with their measured tRNA abundance. They also compare to Northern blotting for two tRNA transcripts, showing a directionally similar result; however, no quantitative claims can be made measurement accuracy. Until a good method of normalizing tRNA quantification is found, we believe that sample-to-sample reproducibility (i.e. precision) is the most useful objective to optimize because this will allow detection of differential expression. Towards that end, we quantified the precision of our method (Figure 4 and its two supplementary figures) with associated statistics, which can be used to estimate the number of samples required to detect significance during differential expression analysis. For tRNA charge, quantification is easier, which is why we present statistics on both accuracy and precision. In this case we can better compare results across methods, and so we have added a comparison of our results to the charge quantification from Evans et al. (2017) (Figure 2—figure supplement 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) While the protocol aims to implement an improved method for quantification of tRNA aminoacylation, it can also be used for tRNA quantification and analysis of tRNA modifications. It will increase the impact of this study if the authors benchmark the outcomes of their protocol with other tRNA sequencing protocols with samples similar to these papers, which will be important for certain research teams that are unlikely to implement two different tRNA sequencing methods. Are there any possible adaptations that would allow the analysis of tRNA fragments?</p></disp-quote><p>The first part of this comment regarding comparison of methods is addressed in response to in the prior reviewer comment and in the response to reviewer 1. In the specific case of tRNA modifications, the issue is similar to abundance quantification in that a “true” reference of modified tRNA is likely necessary for proper quantification, alongside testing of each method simultaneously.</p><p>Regarding tRNA fragments, our method is not suitable for this use case. This is because our adapter ligation step depends on an intact tRNA structure with either CCA or CC overhang on the 3’-end and thus we almost exclusively get reads with CCA/CC ends and no reads from fragments. This specificity is good for increasing charge quantification accuracy but not good for the methods versatility. For a more versatile method we recommend Watkins et al. (2022) [PMID: 35513407].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Like Behrens et al. (2021), Davidsen and Sullivan use TGIRT-III RT for their analyses. The enzyme is not currently available in a form suitable for tRNA-seq. It would be very helpful to test different new RT enzymes that are commercially available. The example of Maxima RT - Figure 2 Supp 6 - shows significantly lower performance than the presented TGIRT-III RT data. In lines 296-298, the authors mention improvements to the protocol by using ornithine. Why are these improvements not included?</p></disp-quote><p>We share similar concerns that the TGIRT-III enzyme is no longer commercially available. It became unavailable while we were preparing this manuscript, reflected by the fact that almost all our figures are made using this enzyme. Others have discovered this too and Lucas et al. (2023) [PMID: 37024678] tested several RT polymerases using TapeStation as a readout for readthrough. As they reported that Maxima has good performance, we decided to test it on a full run with replicates. The results are outlined in Figure 2—figure supplement 6 and for resubmission we have added a table to the appendix that compares the alignment statistics. Unfortunately, the readthrough of the Maxima polymerase on cytoplasmic tRNAs is not as high as for TGIRT-III; however, interestingly it seems to have better performance for mitochondrial tRNAs (Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 6). Regardless, in the initial paper submission we failed to evaluate whether this readthrough difference affected charge measurements. We have now fixed this by adding Figure 2—figure supplement 7, which shows that there are no differences in charge measurements TGIRT-III vs. Maxima. Not surprisingly, there are substantial differences between polymerases when looking at relative tRNA abundance (<italic>which affirms the discussion above related to the difficulty of tRNA abundance quantification</italic>); however, the high sample-to-sample reproducibility remains intact with either polymerase. An exhaustive search for better polymerases is warranted but falls outside the scope of our work.</p><p>Regarding the improvements suggested by us, using ornithine as a cleavage catalyst instead of lysine, we first learned about this possibility later and thus only want to make readers aware that other options exist. We have clarified the paragraph to make this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) A technical concern: The samples are purified multiple times using a specific RNA purification kit. Did the authors test different methods to purify the RNA and does this influence the result of the method?</p></disp-quote><p>In the past, we have relied exclusively on alcohol precipitation but during the development of this protocol we found it easier and more reproducible to use column-based purification when possible. However, as we have not made a direct comparison this remains anecdotal evidence. Nonetheless, to minimize any possible bias of column-based purification you will notice that we use columns with binding capacity 5x higher than the highest amount of RNA/DNA added to the column.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The study would benefit from an explicit step-by-step protocol, including the choice of adapters that are shown to work best in the protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point! We have included tables with all the oligos used (Supplementary file 1), a detailed step-by-step protocol with pictures of anticipated gel results (Supplementary file 2) and an overview of the RNA/DNA manipulations to make it clear where adapter sequences are located (Supplementary file 3). For the data processing we provide a comprehensive example in the Github repository. All this was included in our first submission of this manuscript (as well as on bioRxiv), but we suspect this was not readily accessible to the reviewers. We will make sure that these documents are going to be available through eLife and have emphasized their existence in the main text of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>To stratify this improvement a comparison to the most common methods should be made. For example, how do the results with the improved protocol with i-tRAP (PMID 36283829), tRNA microarrays (PMID: 31263264), or with the approaches the improved protocol shares with some other tRNA-seq approaches (DM-tRNA-seq, mim-tRNA-seq)?</p></disp-quote><p>Once again, we thank the reviewer for the good recommendations. The points about direct comparisons were discussed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>These are all great points; we address them below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>- Please use chemical conventions, e.g. for mcm5s2U and NaIO4 with superscript or subscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2F: Glu GAA is only 82% charged; can this be due to mcm5s2U (Figure 3 supp 2) leading to a misalignment? What happens to Ser-NNN? Why is mitochondrial tRNA so much less charged?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the Glu-GAA charge at baseline, we do not think this is an artifact of the mcm5s2U modification as it would then also be expected for Gln-CAA and Lys-AAA. The same occurs in the charge data in Evans et al. (2017) and they use a very different alignment strategy. Lastly, the charge titration and half-life experiments show no evidence of inaccuracy/bias for Glu-GAA.</p><p>But the question remains – why is the charge of Glu-GAA so low? At this point our best guess is speculative. It may have something to do with the strong enrichment of Glu-GAA codons in the A site found by ribosome profiling on mouse embryonic stem cells (Ingolia et al. (2011) [PMID: 22056041]).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Spell out &quot;clvg&quot; or &quot;dphs&quot; in the figure legend of Figure 2 and others.
