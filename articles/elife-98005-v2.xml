EVD is a viral haemorrhagic fever first caused by the Ebola Zaire virus (EZV), with a case fatality rate of 25–90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">In press, 2023b</xref>). A major outbreak in the northeastern provinces of DRC between 2018 and 2020 resulted in over 3300 reported cases and over 2100 deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">WHO Regional Office for Africa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The extent of the 2018–2020 Ebola outbreak in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and areas included in our study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Daily incidence in the northeastern DRC between August 2018 and March 2020.

More recently, vaccination has also become a tool for outbreak control, with two vaccines now licensed for use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">In press, 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Woolsey and Geisbert, 2021</xref>).</p><p>EVD outbreaks typically occur in resource-poor settings where limited communication and poor accessibility make logistics of surveillance and vaccination campaigns challenging. Understanding the spatial risk of future spread is therefore useful to allow response teams to focus efforts on high-risk areas. Mathematical and statistical models have been used extensively to forecast the spread of infectious diseases, including EVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chowell et al., 2017</xref>). Such models rely on a combination of statistical inference based on epidemiological data and information about the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of infection. However, the dynamics of EVD are frequently governed by changing contextual factors which are challenging to forecast quantitatively. For example, violent conflicts or flooding can seriously hinder, interrupt, or even reverse the impact of containment efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adongo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Wannier et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, changes in healthcare capacity and health-seeking behaviour of patients can strengthen or weaken efforts to reduce transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Funk et al., 2017</xref>). The timing and impact of these factors are notoriously difficult to predict using mathematical models.</p><p>Models are used by epidemic response experts to support decision-making in the field. In addition to models, experts also make judgements as to the future spread of the virus based on their interpretation of the current status of the outbreak combined with their knowledge of other less tangible factors such as the geography, climate (e.g. seasonal variation in accessibility of particular areas), and soft intelligence about the escalation of conflict in areas which may, as a result, be harder to access by response teams. There are clear costs and benefits to human-made and model-based forecasts. Whereas models are objectively based on observations of the past outbreak dynamics and current case data, experts have additional knowledge of the complex factors surrounding the outbreak response. It is therefore difficult to assess the impact mathematical models have on decision-making, how much modelled forecasts differ from those made by experts in the field, and whether either modelled or human forecasts are systematically more accurate or useful. Moreover, the knowledge of experts in the field of EVD epidemiology, with a good understanding of the geographical area of study, may provide an invaluable resource that is currently underused in forecasting.</p><p>Previous studies have aimed to establish the relative performance of humans and models in predicting infectious disease spread in human populations, particularly in the context of acute respiratory infections such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Three studies have evaluated the predictions of humans against models explicitly. The first of these evaluated short-term forecasts and season-wide predictions of reports of influenza-like illness in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Farrow et al., 2017</xref>) and two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bosse et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosse et al., 2023</xref>) compared short-term forecasts of cases of and deaths from COVID-19, firstly in Germany and Poland and secondly in the United Kingdom. All three studies found that humans tended to perform better than the mathematical and statistical models selected for comparison when predicting cases. However, the COVID-focused studies found that the human ensembles performed worse than the ensemble prediction of the models when predicting deaths. These results were maintained when only self-declared ‘experts’ were included in the forecasts. A number of other studies recorded expert predictions without comparison to mathematical models. A study conducted early in the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Recchia et al., 2021</xref>) evaluated the relative ability of laypeople and experts to predict the course of the UK epidemic over the first calendar year. The study found that both experts and laypeople typically underpredicted the impact overall; however, experts’ forecasts were more accurate and better calibrated than laypeople. A study of expert predictions in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">McAndrew and Reich, 2022</xref>) evaluated their weekly forecasts of case incidence and total deaths in the first year against a pooled ensemble of all predictions. The study found that the ensemble outperformed every expert individually over the period of the study. A similar study surveyed experts regarding the total number of cases and deaths from MPox in the United States during 2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">McAndrew et al., 2022</xref>); however, these predictions are yet to be evaluated. Overall, these studies provide evidence that human predictions can play a valuable role in epidemiological prediction, providing a comparator and complementary method to mathematical and statistical modelling.</p><p>In this article, we extend the use of expert forecasters to predict spatial risk of transmission in the context of a local outbreak. We made monthly forecasts of the geographic spread of EVD from November 2019 to March 2020 during the declining phase of the 2018–2020 outbreak in the DRC using both expert predictions collected through regular interviews and with two spatially explicit computational transmission models with different spatial interaction assumptions: a gravity model and an adjacency model (where transmission can only occur between contiguous regions; see the ‘Methods’ section for details). Alongside supporting situational awareness, these forecasts were motivated by an aim to inform site selection for a planned vaccine trial. The objective was to identify areas that had seen no cases yet and thus were not already being supported by vaccination and other interventions, but were at high risk of still becoming affected by the EVD outbreak, thus allowing estimation of efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Watson-Jones et al., 2022</xref>). Here we evaluate the performance of the forecasts and select ensembles of the methods in predicting continued transmission and flare-ups of EVD in health zones (HZs) close to the affected area. We further study variation in forecast quality against a selection of factors related to local demography, case history, and forecast implementation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expert elicitation</title><p>Experts in EVD epidemiology with knowledge of the local geography speaking English or French were identified originally by convenience sampling. The pool of experts was then expanded through recommendation from the identified experts (snowball sampling). This approach was best suited to capture the expertise of individuals who were most often temporarily based in the field.</p><p>A pilot study was carried out in November 2019. Subsequently, monthly interviews were held over WhatsApp in December 2019, January 2020, February 2020, and March 2020. All interviews were scripted. The main biases of this type of study (availability bias, representativeness bias, overconfidence, motivational bias, anchoring on past estimates) were briefly discussed during the first interview.</p><p>Experts were also provided with an interactive map of the outbreak area and surrounding HZs showing the number of total cases during the outbreak and during the two preceding weeks for reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). HZs were numbered to facilitate communication with the experts.</p><p>Experts were asked to estimate the number of reported probable and confirmed cases they would expect per HZ during the following month using the online MATCH Uncertainty Elicitation Tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Morris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Through this platform, the experts and the researcher (AR) interacted in real time. The ‘roulette’ (chips and bins) method was used. Experts were instructed to place a total of 20 chips over the available bins (0–1 cases, 2–4 cases, …, 48–50 cases). Therefore, each chip represented for the expert a 5% probability that the number of cases was in the bin where the chip was placed. This process aimed to capture the uncertainty surrounding the expert’s estimates.</p><p>The experts were asked to estimate the number of reported cases they would expect in the HZ where there had been one or more cases in the two preceding weeks, as well as Goma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The experts were then asked to identify any additional HZ where they would predict one or more cases during the following month with &gt;5% probability, and to also estimate the number of reported cases they would expect in these HZ. In the pilot study, carried out in October 2019, experts were asked to forecast the number of cases they expected during November 2019 in 10 HZs: Beni, Goma, Kalunguta, Katwa, Lolwa, Mabalako, Mambasa, Mandima, Nyankunde, and Oicha.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Health zones included in the model and expert elicitation survey.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) shows the provinces around the affected area, and included in the transmission model, and the red box shows the area detailed in panel (B).

Other zones with moderate cases—Kalanguta (5) and Mambasa (4)—were assigned lower probabilities and generally did not exceed higher case thresholds.

Collectively, the experts scored best at the highest threshold (20 cases) and worst for forecasts of the lowest threshold (2 cases). The models also performed better at higher thresholds than low thresholds, but the difference was less pronounced. Overall, the gravity model ranked best among all forecasts at the two-case threshold. It also ranked best for this threshold in the month of February and consistently in the top half of forecasts in December and January; however, it performed comparatively poorly in March, ranking higher than only one of the experts. The adjacency model also performed better than the experts overall for the two-case threshold. Related to this, including the models improved the ensemble forecast. Although the gravity model performed better than the adjacency model for higher thresholds, together the models performed similarly to the expert ensemble forecast overall. In January and February, the gravity model performed well compared to the adjacency model and the expert ensemble; however in March, both models performed particularly badly compared to the experts for all thresholds. None of the experts performed consistently well relative to the others; experts 3 and 10 performed best for the two-case threshold, whereas experts 13 and 14 did best for higher thresholds.</p><p>To evaluate how the different forecasts may impact decision-making, we ranked the HZs for each month, based on the probability of exceeding each threshold of cases forecast by each ensemble and by the model alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In general, the model and the ensembles all ranked HZs that did reach the threshold highly. In some cases, the model performed better, ranking HZs that did meet the threshold higher than the experts, specifically ranking Beni higher than Mandima in higher thresholds (≥ 6 and 10 cases) for the forecast of January, where Beni ultimately had cases and Mandima did not, in that month.

In contrast, Oicha and Komanda had the most nominations with 7 and 5 each, and 6 and 4 of the 10 experts interviewed allotted greater than 5% chance of two or more cases in December, with attributed probabilities ranging between 5% and 95% chance of crossing the two-case threshold.</p><p>In January, six of the eight experts interviewed nominated Butembo (1, 2, 4, 5, 9, and 11 with probabilities of 5–85% of crossing the two-case threshold) while three of them also nominated Katwa (2 and 9 giving 85% and 5 giving 5%). Kalunguta and Manguredjipa were also nominated by one expert each, 5 with 10% and 11 with 50%, respectively.

When considering the Brier score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we found that the gravity model performed comparably to some experts when forecasting for December and February. The adjacency model performed worse than all the experts in every month except February.

Since the outbreak dynamics of Ebola are highly sensitive to the changeable context in which they take place, mathematical models and expert opinions are expected to have different strengths and weaknesses, with models benefiting from objective inference from previous observations and experts able to utilize detailed knowledge about the outbreak and the changing surrounding context to make informed projections of risk. By interviewing experts and asking them to forecast risk in a structured way, we were able to compare the performance of their forecasts against those made with well-established modelling approaches in a quantifiable and robust way.</p><p>Overall, the forecasts made by the group of experts as a whole performed similarly to those of the model, with a few consistent exceptions. The model performed better than the experts when considering the lowest threshold in 4 of the 5 months covered by the survey, but performance was more comparable for the higher thresholds. The model also performed marginally better when ranking HZs by risk of ongoing transmission, indicating that use of a model may improve prioritization of HZs when attributing resources.</p><p>We found that both methods performed better when considering higher case thresholds. This is likely to be due to a combination of bias in both forecast types towards under-prediction of cases and the fact that there were few instances where the higher thresholds were reached.</p><p>Although individual experts frequently outperformed ensembles in individual instances, no individual expert outperformed the ensembles overall. This supports the practice of considering predictions from a range of experts over a smaller number of more specialist or experienced experts. The models tended to perform similarly to the ensemble representing more consistent performance across all forecasts.</p><p>Experts tended to be more biased than models, especially at low case thresholds with a tendency to over-predict cases to a greater degree than models. This bias reduced rapidly as the case threshold increased. This may be interpreted as over-cautiousness from the experts regarding the potential for geographic spread of the virus but confidence that transmission could be contained quickly. This trend reflects a pattern among previous introductions into new HZs earlier in the pandemic, where a small number of cases were reported, but the local outbreak was quickly stopped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, our study is the first to record experts’ assessment of geographical risk at a local level during an epidemic and the first comparison of outbreak response experts' predictions to those of models in real time. Although direct comparison is not possible, our results lead to conclusions that are broadly similar to those from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Farrow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bosse et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosse et al., 2023</xref>); however, each of these studies found that ensemble expert forecasts performed better than the comparison models, whereas our study found no clear performance difference. This may suggest that experts are better at predicting simple time series than geographic distribution of cases. However, we cannot view these findings independently from the different survey designs or study contexts.</p><p>There are a number of important limitations to consider when interpreting our results. The context within which we conducted the study has important implications for interpretation. Due to the timing and logistics of setting up the questionnaire, the study only began in the closing phase of the epidemic, whereas the relative performance of experts and models may differ during different phases of the epidemic. For example, in the early phase where dynamics are driven more by infectious transmission than established response practices, or during the peak where changes in intervention strategy may be more influential. The stage of the epidemic also meant that there was a substantial trend towards ‘negative’ results (i.e. no threshold exceedance), which is likely to favour some forecasting methods over others.</p><p>Additionally, experts were not all interviewed on the same day, and interviews occurred several days before the beginning of the month they were forecasting. In some cases, experts were interviewed up to 2 weeks prior to the beginning of the month. This means that the information available differed both between experts and with the model, which was run considering data up to the first day of each month. This reduces our ability to compare models to experts directly; however, it could also be argued that this is a ‘built-in’ factor which represents the inherent challenge of eliciting predictions from experts. In addition, the interview process for experts was quite taxing and required a phone call, which can cause scheduling challenges during an epidemic response. It may be that other methods with less arduous and more flexible data entry would improve responses.</p><p>Our analysis represents the comparison of expert forecasts to only two specific forecasting models. There is a great range of models that could have been applied in this context which may have differed in performance to those we used. We chose these models for convenience since we were applying them to the outbreak at the time of the interviews. It is also possible that some of the experts involved in the study had ingested results from our model, which were available through our online dashboard, or other models being used at the time.</p><p>Since our findings, like those of similar studies, suggest that models and experts perform comparably in this context, there is an argument that models have no value in informing expert decision-making. It can be argued, however, that models remain useful in outbreak response. Firstly, while the models performed similarly to the ensemble forecasts of the experts, there was no individual expert that performed consistently better than the models. Secondly, models are much more easily scaled and generalized, making them simple to deploy in new contexts and to adapt as epidemics grow. Expert interviews are time-consuming and often inconvenient, especially in the context of outbreak response activities, which are characteristically fast paced. Models therefore offer a more convenient route to a quantified insight, which from our results performs comparably to the way groups of experts may think. Finally, there are ways to combine both methods. For example, in the event that expert forecasts can be garnered, joint ensembles can capture information from both the expert and modelled forecasts. Further, we suggest that models can offer a role in aiding decision-making by providing confidence in or calling into question expert advice that is being considered.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our analysis evaluated performance of experts and models when forecasting the spatial spread of Ebola, representing the first such study incorporating local geographic distribution and the first to focus on an epidemic in a resource-poor setting. We found that forecasts made by experts and models performed comparably overall, but experts tended to be slightly more biased towards predicting that a small number of cases would persist. The results support the use of models in outbreak response and provide insight into how models and expert opinion could be combined when tackling future epidemics.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, Conceived and designed the modelling framework and the evaluation of forecasts.

Their study ran from November 2019 to March 2020 during the Ebola virus outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo. Their key result concerned predicted numbers of cases in a defined set of zones. They found that neither the ensemble of models nor the group of experts produced consistently better predictions. Similarly, neither model performed consistently better than the other, and no expert's predictions were consistently better than the others'. Experts were also able to specify other zones in which they expected to see cases in the next month. For this part of the analysis, experts consistently outperformed the models. In March, the final month of the analysis, the models' accuracy was lower than in other months, and consistently poorer than the experts' predictions.</p><p>A strength of the analysis is use of consistent methodology to elicit predictions from experts during an outbreak that can be compared to observations, and that are comparable to predictions from the models. Results were elicited for a specified group of zones, and experts were also able to suggest other zones that were expected to have diagnosed cases. This likely replicates the type of advice being sought by policymakers during an outbreak.</p><p>A potential weakness is that the authors included only two models in their ensemble. Ensembles of greater numbers of models might tend to produce better predictions. The authors do not address whether a greater number of models could outperform the experts.</p><p>The elicitation was performed in four months near the end of the outbreak. The authors address some of the implications of this. A potential challenge for the transferability of this result is that the experts' understanding of local idiosyncrasies in transmission may have improved over the course of the outbreak. The model did not have this improvement over time. The comparison of models to experts may therefore not be applicable to early stages of an outbreak when expert opinions may be less well-tuned.</p><p>This research has important implications for both researchers and policy-makers. Mathematical models produce clearly-described predictions that will later be compared to observed outcomes. When model predictions differ greatly from observations, this harms trust in the models, but alternative forms of prediction are seldom so clearly articulated or accurately assessed. If models are discredited without proper assessment of alternatives then we risk losing a valuable source of information that can help guide public health responses. From an academic perspective, this research can help to guide methods for combining expert opinion with model outputs, such as considering how experts can inform models' prior distributions and how model outputs can inform experts' opinions.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>I am grateful to the authors for their responses to my previous comments. I think their updates have made the paper much clearer. I do not think the updates change the opinions already given in the public review so I have not modified it.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98005.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The manuscript by Munday et al. presents real-time predictions of geographic spread during an Ebola epidemic in north-eastern DRC.

We recognise and endorse their characterisation of the study in the public reviews and are greatful for their interest and support for this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I initially found Table 1 difficult to interpret. In the final two columns, the rows relate to each other but in the other columns, rows within months don't relate to each other. Could this be made clearer?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful suggestion. We agree that this is a little confusing and have now added vertical dividers to the table to indicate which parts of the table relate to each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1A, the colours are the same as in the colour-bar for Figure 1B but don't have the same meaning. Could different colours be used or could Figure 1A have its own colour-bar to aid clarity?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your query. The colours are not the same pallette, but we appreciate that they look very similar. To help the reader we have changed the colour palette of panel A and added a legend to the left.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3, can labels for each expert be aligned horizontally, rather than moving above and below the timeline each month?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your perspective on this. We made the concious dicision to desplay the experts in this way as it allows the timeline to be presented in a shorter horizontal space. We appreciate that others may prefer a different design, but we are happy with this one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On lines 292 and 293, the authors state that experts were less confident that case numbers would cross higher thresholds. It seems that this would be inevitable given the number of cases is cumulative. Could this be clarified, please?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We agree that this wording is confusing. We have now reworked the entire section in response to another reviewer. The equivalent section now reads:</p><p>Experts correctly identified Mabalako as the highest-risk HZ in December. They attributed an average 82% probability of exceeding 2 cases; Mabalako reported 38 cases that month, exceeding all thresholds, although the probability assigned to exceeding the higher thresholds was similar to that of Beni (3 cases)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Some methodological details seem to be missing. Most importantly, the results present multiple ensembles (experts, models, and both), but I can't seem to find anywhere in the Methods that details how these ensembles are calculated. Also, I think it would be useful to define the variables in each equation. It would have been easier to connect the equations to the description if the variables were cited explicitly in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out these omissions. We have included the following paragraph to detail how ensemble forecasts were calculated.</p><p>“Enslemble forecasts</p><p>Ensemble forecasts were calculated as an average of the probabilities attributed by the members of the ensemble. For the expert ensemble the arithmetic mean was calculated across all experts with equal weighting. Similarly the model ensemble used the unweighted mean of the model forecasts. For the mixed (model and expert) ensemble, the mean was weighted such that the combined weight of the experts forecasts and the combined weight of the models forecasts were equal.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Overall, I think the results provide a strong analysis of model vs. expert performance. However, some sections were highly detailed (e.g., the text usually discusses results for every month and all health zones), which clouded my ability to see the salient points. For example, I found it difficult to follow all the details about expert/model predictions vs. observations in the &quot;Expert panel and health zones...&quot; subsection; instead, the graphical illustration of predictions vs. observations in Figure 4 was much easier to interpret. Perhaps some of these details could be trimmed or moved to the supplementary material.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your honest feedback on this point. We have shortened this section to highlight the key points that we feel are the most important. We have also simplified the text where we discuss the health zones nominated by experts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 5C is a nice visualization of the fallibility of relying on a single individual expert (or model). I wonder if it would be useful to summarize these results into the probability that a randomly selected expert outperforms a single model. Is it the case that a single expert is more unreliable than a single model? The discussion emphasizes the importance of ensembles and compares a single model to an ensemble of experts, but eliciting predictions from multiple experts may not always be possible.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this. We agree that this is an important point that eliciting expert opinions is not a trivial task and should not be taken for granted. We agree with the principle of your suggestion that it would be useful to understand how the models compare to indevidual experts. We don’t however believe that an additional analysis would add sufficiently more information than already shown in Figure 5, which already displays the full distribution of indevidual experts for each month and threshold. If you would like to try this analysis yourself, the relevant data (the indevidual score for each combination of expert, threshold, heal zone and month) is included in the github repo (https://github.com/epiforecasts/Ebola-Expert-Elicitation/blob/main/outputs/indevidual_results_with_scores.csv).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) Figure 2: the color scales in each panel are meant to represent different places, correct? The figure might be easier to interpret if the colors used were different.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We have now changed the palette of panel A to differ from panel B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Equation 7: is o(c&gt;c_thresh) meant to be the indicator function (i.e. 1 if c&gt;c_thresh) and 0 otherwise?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising this. The function o is the same as in the previous equation – an observation count function. We appreciate that this is not immediately clear so have added a sentence to explain the notation after the equation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Table 1: a brief description of the column headers would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now extended the table caption to include more description of the columns.</p><p>“Table 1: Experts and health zones included in each round of the survey. The left part of the table details the experts interviewed (highlighted in green) the health zones included in the main survey in each month. In addition, the right part of the table details the health zones nominated by experts and the number of experts that nominated each one.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
