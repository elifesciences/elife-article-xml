Neuroanatomical variation at the regional level is hypothesized to provide functional expansion, building upon ancestral anatomy needed for basic functions. Classically, animal models used to study evolution have lacked tools for detailed anatomical analysis that are widely used in zebrafish and mice, presenting a barrier to studying brain evolution at fine scales. In this study, we sought to investigate the evolution of brain anatomy using a single species of fish consisting of divergent surface and cave morphs, that permits functional genetic testing of regional volume and shape across the entire brain. We generated a high-resolution brain atlas for the blind Mexican cavefish <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> and coupled the atlas with automated computational tools to directly assess variability in brain region shape and volume across all populations. We measured the volume and shape of every grossly defined neuroanatomical region of the brain and assessed correlations between anatomical regions in surface fish, cavefish, and surface × cave F<sub>2</sub> hybrids, whose phenotypes span the range of surface to cave. We find that dorsal regions of the brain are contracted, while ventral regions have expanded, with F<sub>2</sub> hybrid data providing support for developmental constraint along the dorsal-ventral axis. Furthermore, these dorsal-ventral relationships in anatomical variation show similar patterns for both volume and shape, suggesting that the anatomical evolution captured by these two parameters could be driven by similar developmental mechanisms. Together, these data demonstrate that <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> is a powerful system for functionally determining basic principles of brain evolution and will permit testing how genes influence early patterning events to drive brain-wide anatomical evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain

conserved in vertebrate lineages across evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Holland and Holland, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charvet et al., 2011</xref>). While the arrangement for subregions of the brain remains constant, the overall size and shape of individual brain regions can vary considerably, even among closely related groups. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hoops et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pereira-Pedro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Neubauer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Briscoe and Ragsdale, 2018</xref>). Comparative neuroanatomical studies suggest that novel anatomical changes are built upon the conservation of ancestral brain anatomy, with anatomical changes resulting in the development of new regions that likely expand function and functional repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Woych et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the convergence of similar functional elaborations of the vertebrate brain, despite independent lineages of evolution, suggest some regions of the brain are primed for anatomical and ultimately functional diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schumacher and Carlson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Emery and Clayton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Northcutt, 2002</xref>). Although these comparative studies have provided a wealth of insight into the evolutionary history of neuroanatomy, pioneers in the field strongly advise diversifying our animal model pool to permit functional tests to theories underlying the evolution of the vertebrate brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Northcutt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Striedter, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Two central hypotheses are thought to drive anatomical brain evolution; the first suggesting that subregions brain-wide tend to evolve together, with selection operating on mechanisms that govern the growth of all regions, and the second positing that selection can act on individual brain regions, and that regions which are functionally related will anatomically evolve together independent of other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barton and Harvey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Montgomery et al., 2016</xref>). While data supporting each hypothesis exist, the large divergence times and poor understanding of evolutionary history in most comparative models makes generalizing these theories difficult. Additionally, these theories have largely been applied to studies analyzing anatomical size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barton and Harvey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wartel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Axelrod et al., 2018</xref>), overlooking how 3D shape of brain regions are impacted by evolutionary processes. Moreover, the relationship between the evolution of the size and shape of distinct anatomical regions is poorly understood, and it is unclear how these two important aspects of neuroanatomy explain the evolution of the brain.</p><p>While volume and shape are known to govern anatomical variation across the brain, there is still uncertainty of whether similar or distinct mechanisms govern both parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Reardon et al., 2018</xref>). However, most comparative studies tend to focus on either volume or shape, with some volume to shape analyses comparing trends across independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gómez-Robles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sansalone et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Montgomery et al., 2021</xref>). Current models to explore mechanisms driving volume and shape rely on non-model systems that lack experimental approaches, or model organisms that lack genetic diversity, creating an impediment for investigating basic principles of brain evolution. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ponce de Leon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mitchell, 1977</xref>). Non-traditional models can bridge this experimental gap, including experimental approaches to determine whether similar genetic and developmental mechanisms underlie general principles of evolution.</p><p>The blind Mexican cavefish <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> provides a powerful model for directly testing how genetic variation impacts brain-wide anatomical evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mitchell, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jeffery, 2008</xref>). <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> exists as a species with two distinct forms: river dwelling surface fish and cave dwelling populations that have independently evolved troglobitic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bradic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gross, 2012</xref>). This separation has led to high genetic diversity between populations which underlies the stark differences in phenotypes between surface and cave populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borowsky, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Warren et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, surface × cave hybrid offspring are biologically viable, allowing us to exploit the genetic differences between each population, and ultimately identify the genetic underpinnings of neuroanatomical evolution in the cavefish brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">O’Gorman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duboué et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, a hybrid population analysis using novel neurocomputational tools can be used to study covariation of neuroanatomy across a well-annotated atlas, and directly test whether cavefish brains exhibit support for either the developmental or functional constraint hypothesis. Finally, the relationship between brain region shape and volume can be analyzed in comparative and direct analyses, which will be critical in understanding how brain regions evolve in relationship to one another.</p><p>In the current study, we generated a brain-wide neuroanatomical atlas for <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> and applied new computational tools for assessing brain-wide changes in both brain region volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>) and shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conith et al., 2019</xref>). We then applied this atlas to hybrid brains to make associations between naturally occurring genetic variation of wildtype populations and neuroanatomical phenotypes. Our surface × cave hybrid data reveal that brain-region volume and shape are genetically specified to regulate brain-wide anatomical evolution in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>. Furthermore, volume and shape exhibit similarities in brain-wide anatomical covariation, suggesting that these two parameters share developmental mechanisms that are causing cavefish brains to contract dorsally and expand ventrally. These results suggest that selection may be operating on simple developmental mechanisms, that likely impact early patterning events to modulate the volume and shape of brain regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a single brain-wide atlas for all <italic>Astyanax</italic> morphs</title><p>To analyze regional variation in brain anatomy, we created a single atlas for all <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> morphs to provide neuroanatomical comparisons across surface, cave, and surface × cave hybrid populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>). A neuroanatomical analysis pipeline from zebrafish that performs automated segmentation of brains was then adapted and tested on <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). This tool provides a single atlas that can be continually segmented through brain regions to identify neuroanatomical differences across various molecularly and functionally defined sub-nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d, e</xref>). The segmentation accuracy was confirmed by a pairwise cross correlation of tERK staining and manual to automated segmentation overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a, b</xref>; &gt;98% tERK cross-correlation and &gt;78% segmentation cross-correlation). Previous brain atlases for model organisms were constructed using molecular markers that are known to demarcate specific subregions, such as transgenic lines and antibody labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Randlett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kunst et al., 2019</xref>). To determine whether our atlas maintains similar molecular accuracy, we developed a dual staining technique that combines RNA hybridization chain reaction (HCR) in situ hybridization with immunohistochemistry (IHC), resulting in automated segmentation of RNA in situ probes via total-ERK antibody registration.

The application of this atlas and these computational approaches to F<sub>2</sub> hybrid fish permits a brain-wide dissection of how neuroanatomy changes, and a powerful analysis of not only how different neuroanatomical areas evolve but also which areas co-segregate together. These studies suggest that brains of cave-adapted populations of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> are anatomically evolving via the developmental constraint hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Montgomery et al., 2016</xref>), with a brain-wide dorsal-ventral relationship, that suggests expansion of ventral regions is directly related to contraction of dorsal regions. Finally, this study is one of the first to directly assess how the volume and shape of brain regions relate to one another across genetically and phenotypically diverse populations of a single species.</p><p>Previous studies examining how the brain evolves have largely been restricted to comparative analyses between closely related, albeit different species, and these studies have revealed gross differences in neuroanatomy, connectivity, and function between derived animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Reardon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gómez-Robles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sansalone et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Montgomery et al., 2021</xref>). However, the <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> model system provides a powerful tool for assessing how the brain evolves in a single species with multiple divergent forms and an extant ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jeffery, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gross, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jeffery, 2001</xref>). Moreover, because surface and cave forms are the same species, the ability to produce surface/cave and cave/cave F<sub>2</sub> hybrid fish permits a powerful dissection of functional principles underlying brain evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">O’Gorman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duboué et al., 2011</xref>). We previously published population-specific neuroanatomical atlases for this species and used these to examine how gross neuroanatomy differs between surface and cave fish, and how physiology relates to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Loomis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jaggard et al., 2020</xref>). The current study extends applications of this model to further understand how the brain evolves, and includes a single atlas for all populations to functionally compare neuroanatomy in pure and hybrid offspring, automated brain segmentation for 180 annotated sub-populations of neurons, and the application of computational approaches for a complete whole-brain assessment of the evolution of the brain. In future studies, we will be able to utilize the genetic diversity of these populations to map anatomical traits and then functionally test how natural genetic variation in parental populations (e.g. surface, Pachón, etc.) impact the anatomical evolution of the cavefish brain.</p><p>Two competing hypotheses exist to explain brain evolution: one theory suggests that the majority of the brain evolves anatomically via changes to shared developmental programs, whereas others have suggested that more discrete regions will independently evolve based on shared function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Montgomery et al., 2016</xref>). Our data from two independent cavefish populations provides evidence that supports the notion that the developmentally related regions of the brain co-evolve, with the dorsal-caudal areas of the brain evolving together, and that regions such as the optic tectum and the cerebellum, two areas that constitute a large proportion of the dorsal-caudal region shrink in size. In contrast, rostral-ventral areas co-evolve together, such as the hypothalamus and subpallium, that are enlarged in cavefish. Importantly, we find in F<sub>2</sub> hybrid fish that reduced optic tectum and cerebellum are concomitant with an enlarged hypothalamus and subpallium, suggesting that expansion of some regions come at the expense of others. This anatomical outcome may suggest that early brain patterning genes and developmental mechanisms could be influencing the establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">O’Gorman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duboué et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>), leading to an asymmetrical shift in overall brain mass. Moreover, finding this in two separate populations suggests that these changes are common principles for fish evolving in a cave environment.</p><p>Early brain patterning is tightly regulated by genetic networks and developmental mechanisms that include organizing centers conserved across bilaterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sylvester et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Stoykova et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blaess et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Denes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Holland et al., 2013</xref>). These networks and mechanisms are controlled by both morphogen pathways, such as sonic hedgehog (shh) and bone morphogenic protein (bmp), and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Molina et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sasagawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wilson and Maden, 2005</xref>), like the <italic>homeobox gene</italic> cluster (<italic>hox</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hunt et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Krumlauf et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Spitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hatta et al., 1991</xref>), that orchestrate axis development and help regulate regional specification. Early forward genetic screens in model organisms led to the discovery of axial patterning genes, with mutants displaying drastic phenotypes impacting dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axis patterning. For instance, mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta and sonic hedgehog signaling pathways, in zebrafish, fly, and mice revealed severe phenotypic impacts in ventral forebrain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Maity et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schier et al., 1996</xref>). Our analyses suggest that two independently derived cavefish populations exhibit changes in early brain development that impact the majority of brain regions in a strictly dorsal-ventral fashion. While the divisions of the dorsal ventral axis are initially established via canonical pathways, such as <italic>shh</italic> and <italic>bmp,</italic> disruptions in downstream targets tend to be localized to specific ventral and dorsal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shimamura and Rubenstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Karaca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Portella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Diaz and Puelles, 2020</xref>). Therefore, our hybrid experiments may be the result of changes upstream of larger gene regulatory networks, impacting several genes that contribute en masse to the development of the dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Levine and Davidson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexandro et al., 2021</xref>).

Further genetic and embryonic analyses will be needed to answer many outstanding questions, including: do these anatomical changes reflect a developmental ‘hotspot’, and are these anatomical features a common outcome for evolving non-visual sensory dominance?</p><p>Additionally, degeneration of the eye and subsequent impact on the entire brain has not been extensively studied in cavefish. While eye formation begins in cavefish populations, the embryonic eye primordia quickly undergoes apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jeffery and Martasian, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yamamoto and Jeffery, 2000</xref>), followed by axon degeneration and denervation of retinal ganglion cells in the midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Soares et al., 2004</xref>). This loss of afferent ocular contacts contributes to a decrease in the overall growth and size of the optic tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Soares et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pottin et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, rescuing eye development via lens transplantation from a surface donor to a cave host results in increased tectal mass on the contralateral side of the transplanted lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Soares et al., 2004</xref>). Recent work has also hypothesized that changes in spatiotemporal gene expression of anterior neural markers impact both the eye and brain in a pleotropic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Menuet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pottin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alié et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, a remaining question is whether eye degeneration and changes in dorsal-ventral patterning are separate mechanisms impacting the brain, or share a common mechanism that results in the overall ventral expansion and dorsal contraction observed in these cavefish populations. While this study did not resolve these questions, we are currently utilizing our novel computational atlas to determine the overall impact of eye degeneration on brain-wide anatomy.</p><p>Past comparative neuroanatomical research has raised many unanswered questions for how neural circuits evolve, including how variation in brain development between closely related groups relate to functional convergence of specialized brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schumacher and Carlson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Emery and Clayton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Northcutt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Güntürkün, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Earl, 2022</xref>). For instance, it was initially thought that the pallial regions in lobe finned fishes (including tetrapod’s) and ray finned fishes evolved independently to produce convergent functional traits, evinced by variation in developmental processes, cell types, and circuitry involved in these emergent behaviors. However, recent work utilizing a well-preserved fossil of an ancient ray finned species suggests that ray finned fish initially possessed the same developmental processes as lobbed finned fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Figueroa et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, functional similarity of the pallium may be a homologous ancestral state that was maintained by the two groups and not a convergent feature derived independently. Although this recent finding supports a major revision of our understanding of vertebrate brain evolution, we agree with the field that variation in cell type diversity and complexity of forebrain circuit development across these derived extant groups present unique and non-overlapping neurological traits. Neuroanatomical discoveries like this provide a prime example that creative strategies, including examination of the fossil record for soft-tissue preservation and functional studies in a diversity of non-model organisms, will be necessary to reveal unique and generalized principles of neural evolution.</p><p>Recent neural evolutionary studies in several non-model species have shown that some brain regions provide evolutionary potential for convergent function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schumacher and Carlson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carlson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Earl, 2022</xref>). For example, several independently derived groups of weakly electric fish have convergently evolved electrogenerative and electroreceptive potentials through expansions of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schumacher and Carlson, 2022</xref>). This rather specific structural and functional innovation suggests that the cerebellum provides an anatomical substrate, with specific gene regulatory networks and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Güntürkün, 2012</xref>), that are best suited for fish to gain electroreceptive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schumacher and Carlson, 2022</xref>). While convergent functional innovations are observed in these independent lineages, the secondary consequences on behavior can vary from one species to another, suggesting that the process of evolution is acting upon functional expansion (electric properties), providing a substrate for novel behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schumacher and Carlson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carlson, 2016</xref>). In our study, two independently derived cavefish populations show convergent neuroanatomical variation across the dorsal-ventral axis, resulting in an overall expansion of specific sensorimotor regions, including the hypothalamus and subpallium. Both the hypothalamus and the subpallium have diverse functions, and many behavioral modifications in cavefish, including aggression, stress, and sleep, have been related to functional variation in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jaggard et al., 2018</xref>). We hypothesize that the reduction of dorsal regions preserves the energy needed to expand this ventral substrate of non-visual sensorimotor regions as anatomical potential to engender novel behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Moran et al., 2014</xref>). That these changes are found in independently evolved populations further supports this notion.</p><p>Other taxonomic groups have also experienced increases in anterior forebrain volume, leading to the formation of new cell types and layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Woych et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lust et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Briscoe et al., 2018</xref>). The functional expansion of the forebrain and flexibility of supramodal cognition in primate brains has been linked to convergent adaptations to specific subsets of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sneve et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaplin et al., 2013</xref>). These changes included an expansion to the size and organizational complexity of the cortex, while also developing novel forebrain circuits that permit a functional compacity to produce more complex cognitive and social behaviors. Our data points to a similar phenomenon, wherein subpallial and hypothalamic regions are expanding in these two cavefish populations that likely shifts the primary integrative processes in the optic tectum to the ventral forebrain. It will be paramount going forward to determine whether ventral anatomical expansion is leading to new cell types, and how these anatomical changes impact ancestral neural circuits in relation to cavefish behavior.</p><p>In addition to volume, evolutionary changes in shape of neuroanatomical regions have been shown to alter function of different regions. The mammalian cortex, for example, has evolved from a smoother lissencephalic cortex in more ancestral species to a folded one in more derived animals such as primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Elias and Schwartz, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Molnár et al., 2014</xref>). Folding of the cortex is thought to increase surface area and has been implicated in more complex processing of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Molnár et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tallinen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hofman and Falk, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">DeCasien et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abzhanov et al., 2006</xref>). However, we do know that shape variation has been shown to be a common adaptation in other tissues. Beak differences in Galapagos finches have been shown to change in accordance with the size of food sources, and such changes have been shown to rely on differences in bone morphogenic protein signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Parsons and Albertson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kozol et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choi et al., 2016</xref>). Craniofacial differences in African cichlids also have been shown to vary as an adaptive quality to food availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conith et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, standard methods for assessing complex shape features have been applied to studying brain shape evolution in non-model organisms, generating anatomical evolutionary hypotheses that have lacked an appropriate model for assessing functional mechanisms of anatomical evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Reardon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gómez-Robles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Molnár et al., 2014</xref>). By applying these morphological measuring and analyzing methods with our hybrid volume pipeline, we were able to see that complex shape phenotypes are likely genetically encoded, evidenced in hybrid intermediate phenotypes, and that similarities in covariation of shape and volume across dorsal and ventral regions may be impacted by shared mechanisms. However, due to the labor-intensive nature of shape analyses, we acknowledge that only 4 of 13 brain regions from the volumetric covariation analysis were assessed and are working to compare the remaining regions in our ongoing studies. Additionally, some of our shape variation could be capturing biological elements that are captured in the volumetric analysis, which we cannot rule out in the current analysis. While the functional and adaptive significance of differences in shape are not known, future work relating neuronal activity and function with differences in shape in this model could help address this question.</p><p>Together, these results support the developmental constraint hypothesis of brain evolution in cave-adapted <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> fish populations, suggesting early genetic and developmental impacts reshaping neuroanatomy brain-wide. This study represents the first computational brain atlas for a single species with multiple evolutionary derived forms, and the application of the atlas to hybrid animals represents the first assessment of how different neuroanatomical areas evolved in both volume and shape. Moreover, we can now combine this atlas with a myriad of cutting-edge tools that we have generated for this model, including functional neuroimaging and genome editing, that will allow researchers to identify the genetic mechanisms that explain these changes. The strong genetic and neuronal conservation of the vertebrate brain, as well as the simplified nervous system of fish, suggests that this model offers great potential to discover the general principles of evolution that impact the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish maintenance and husbandry</title><p>Mexican tetras (<italic>A. mexicanus</italic>) were housed in the Florida Atlantic Universities Mexican tetra core facilities.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Automated anatomical mapping finds brainwide evolution occurring in distinct developmental modules&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following reviewers have agreed to share their identity (Reviewer 2: Masato Yoshizawa; Reviewer 3: Daphne Soares).</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>The authors tackle the role of functional and developmental constraints in brain evolution, an important and long-standing question. The approach nicely tests the developmental constraint hypothesis, which was highlighted in their correlation studies of volumetric and shape change, but is less successful with functional constraints. The reviewers appreciate the advance of automated brain characterization including shape changes with the large quantity data on brain shape-genetics but raised questions about the ability to reliably detect smaller subregions. They noted the need to add additional data on dark-raised individuals and also raised questions about novelty. Given these issues and the amount of additional work it requires, the paper seems more appropriate for a specialized journal. Please see the detailed review comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To meet criteria for <italic>eLife</italic>, I would expect that the issues detailed should be addressed, and the following.</p><p>Additional external validations of the atlas should be provided. Molecular markers would be ideal for this process.</p><p>To identify whether the adaptation to cave environments proceeds by generalizable paths, an atlas for an unrelated Astyanax lineage should be compared.</p><p>L153 and Figure 4d,g. What is the statistical support for labeling Cluster 3 as an independent group? Is the node that branches cluster 3 from 2 statistically significantly supported?</p><p>Figure 4c. Does mapping the 6 clusters onto a brain reveal regional similarities in co-evolving region sizes?</p><p>Figure S5 legend is too sparsely worded to be clear. What the red circles represent should be clearly stated. What do the A and B and X and Y variables represent? These are not defined. &quot;PC1 describes preoptic width, while PC2 describes length.&quot; Correct me if I'm wrong, but here I think you mean something more subtle than what's stated. Shouldn't this be something about the loading of these PCs having an over representation of width/length distances. If the simple statement is true, why not report the absolute width and length in addition to the PCA?</p><p>Figure 5. As commented above, there is a conflation of PC with a simple length measurement. The optic tectum varies on PC1, and you show it is longer. How much of PC1 is explained by length, for example. Why not provide the length measurement?</p><p>Line 198-200. The conclusions from this paragraph are too strong. One issue is why one must invoke developmental constraints in the patterning of the brain. It may be true that expansion of one brain region comes at the expense of another, but these data do not demonstrate this.</p><p>Figure 5c,d. The differences between these two graphs are trivial, as I understand them, and there seems to be no new information provided by using two graphs. Why not just provide 5d, with regions labeled on the Y-axis?</p><p>Line 219-220. This conclusion is not supported by a direct analysis. Volume covariation and shape covariation are not directly compared. Rather, in the volumetric analysis, only 4 regions are analyzed, rather than 13 for the shape analysis. These should be analysed in the same way in order to make this statement. But even this would be simply a correlation.</p><p>But further, could a similar covariation (if found) be simply a result of the fact that volume is a function of the parameters (e.g., length, width) analysed during shape analysis? As a result, shape and volume are not orthogonal variables for which a finding of distinct developmental mechanisms would be compelling.</p><p>Line 260 and elsewhere. &quot;Our data show that the dorsal-caudal areas of the brain evolve together…&quot; This work shows that in the Pachon line has evolved in this way. The sample size is derived from F2 animals from a outcross of this line, and as such the separate animals represent unique genetic combinations of Pachon alleles, but it is from a single evolutionary trajectory. As such, additional examples of evolution (for example from another cave) may operate by changing other brain region sizes. I see that this caveat is then raised (L 266), but the conclusions remain overstated in this paper elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is not the authors' fault, but there is confusion between these two hypotheses in general – both (functional and developmental) can be regulated by genes. Developmental constraints can act brain-wide and local (like islet<sub>1/2</sub> expressing domain). Functional constraints can also act on local-nearby regions but also long distances such as between the cerebrum and cerebellum (co-evolution of cerebrum and cerebellum were presented as an example of the functional constraints). Thus, brain-wide or not is not such a good criterion to argue these two hypotheses although Montgomery et al., 2016 mentioned. To me, these two hypotheses are proxies of the question of whether the brain regions are regulated by developmental genes (Pax6, Hoxs, Otx etc) vs. functional axonal/synaptic genes (Netrin, semaphorin, GluN receptors etc). The authors briefly mentioned that cluster3 (subpallium and dorsal diencephalon) could be an example of the functional constraints but it was with not so positive reasons; that is, this region was not constrained by other regions (L258-259). If the authors would like to mention the functional constraints, I feel they need to show positive data, such as neural activities are not tightly associated with other brain regions compared with between the clusters 1 and 2.</p><p>My suggestion is that the authors may need to restate their research question to align what they have in the data.</p><p>here are the other points I am concerned about:</p><p>L34-39: &quot;Two central hypotheses are thought to drive anatomical brain evolution;…&quot;</p><p>I am afraid that the sentence for the developmental constraint hypothesis is a little misleading by stating &quot;..change together in a concerted matter.&quot; many studies showed the brain develops in a mosaic fashion. I guess the authors would like to state as &quot;the developmental constraints hypothesis suggests that most of the individual brain components tend to evolve together&quot; as Montgomery et al., 2016 stated.</p><p>Also the authors mentioned 'mosaic' relating to the functional constraints hypothesis, yet, in developmental biology, 'mosaic' is also used for developmental processes. I suggest the authors clarify whenever they use 'mosaic' for functional or developmental.</p><p>L101: &quot;…brain regions (Figure 2 – Supplement 1a and b)&quot;</p><p>need reference</p><p>Figure 4e and 4f, the figures were swapped according to the Main body text and Figure 5 figure legend.</p><p>Figure 5—figure supplement 1, difficult to understand where the landmarks were from. Please superimpose the preoptic area's image on the landmarks.</p><p>I do not see if the original image data and other related data will be shared or not.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this manuscript, I think it can eventually be a fantastic paper! I would be very happy to look at it again and I have no problems with the data. Please understand that my criticism is basically saying that I don't think you completely know HOW interesting/impactful your results are because you do not address to the long arguments and disagreements in the literature. I think you should spend a while really dissecting what people have been thinking about the evolution of vertebrate brain. Read the vast body of literature on brain evolution, the works of William Hodos, Ann Buttler, Georg Strieder and Glenn Northcutt especially come to mind right away. Your results based on their original work can be that much more insightful. These established authors have raised many questions which you can chime in with your new techniques. It will be a wasted opportunity to just argue that astyanax is a good model, show the reader WHY it is a good model, what do the results mean. I think then it will elevate the paper to an <italic>eLife</italic> level.</p><p>I am including one specific set of points on the abstract that illustrate the same issues again and again in the entire text (I'll be blunt because it is easier, keep in mind that I am a fan of the work):</p><p>&quot;Brain anatomy is highly variable and it is widely accepted that anatomical variation impacts brain function and ultimately behavior.&quot;</p><p>I think the initial statement of the abstract is already confounding. You are already not bringing evolutionary neuroscientists to your side. It is too simplistic. I think anyone who knows anything about the issue will either dismiss you, thinking that you have not done your homework in terms the literature, or that your knowledge of the subject is not sophisticated. There is an enormous body of evidence on the literature that show how conserved brains actually are. Diversity and homology are actually one of the main tenants of MANY brain evolutionary studies. Also revise the sentence to avoid repetition of &quot;anatomy/anatomical&quot; for stylistic reasons.</p><p>&quot;The structural complexity of the brain, including differences in volume and shape, presents an enormous barrier to define how variability underlies differences in function.&quot;</p><p>I respectfully disagree, the challenge is no longer in this level of analysis. Neurons themselves, circuits and modulation are the next frontier that will inform our questions. I think the first 2 sentences are weak and do not buttress the argument of why this study is important and novel. I would recommend to rewrite it.</p><p>&quot;In this study, we sought to investigate the evolution of brain anatomy in relation to brain region volume and shape across the brain of a single species with variable genetic and anatomical morphs.&quot;</p><p>Again this has been done for years, at this point of reading, I am not convinced why this is novel enough to give insights to the audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. I think here you really have the chance to drive your point that your results are really important, but you don't yet have the knowledgeable reader on your side.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Automated anatomical mapping finds brainwide evolution occurring in distinct developmental modules&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. The authors must check whether the eye-size is a confounding factor of the brain region volume changes. This could be done by a correlation analysis of eye-size vs brain regions/shape (PCA1 or PCA2 axis value).</p><p>2. The discussion and references on brain evolution need to be significantly expanded.</p><p>3. Please attend to the more minor revisions raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Thank you to the authors for their thoughtful responses to my concerns. I find the manuscript to be significantly improved. I feel that the arguments they make are now well-supported. I have a few relatively minor comments on places where the writing was not clear.</p><p>Is the segmentation by tERK with labels for region-specific markers done with ONLY the tERK information? Is there any chance that signal from the regional marker could influence the segmentation?</p><p>Lines 126-132. The figure references do not refer to the correct panels (wrong genes).

Most of the reviewers' concerns are resolved with a much improved clearer logical flow and newly added Molino cavefish and F2 hybrid data, further adding detailed shape and volume analyses. There are one major concern and several minor points in this resubmitted version of their manuscript.</p><p>Although the volume change analyses were now more elaborated, it is unclear if the eye size is a correlated factor to explain the antagonistic volume-changes between the dorso-caudal and ventro-rostral brain regions. The authors explained that this pattern of volume change is the result of developmental/genetic constrain with new F2 data, which is convincing. Yet, the major sensory difference at 6 days old – functional vs non-functional eyes (surface fish and cavefish, respectively) – could affect the brain anatomical changes. I assume that authors took whole body pictures before dissection (or, eyes were scanned together during brain imaging) and the eye-size parameter is available to test whether the whole brain landscape is basically correlated with the eye size. None of the other sensors including the olfactory epithelium, lateral line, and inner ear, was reported with significant differences between surface fish and cavefish, as far as I know. I believe the eye size is the important factor in arguing the brain architecture while I was reading through this manuscript, I assumed the brain developmental genes (otx, islet, emx) might regulate these changes but eye developmental genes (pax 6, lens genes) could be the major driver of these brain morphological changes, instead. To answer their research question, whether the whole brain regions or individual brain regions evolved, I believe the eye is the important brain region the authors should consider. F2 hybrids would be a great resource to check it.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80777.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Molecular markers would be ideal for this process.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that an addition of additional markers would make the manuscript stronger for publication. We have now added 5 additional markers. This involved not only adding additional antibody labels, but also devising an HCR protocol that was compatible with brain registration. This classically has been challenging as the harsh molecular washes for in situ hybridization often warp and distort brain tissue such that it cannot be correctly registered. HCR alleviated those concerns, and made for a high throughput strategy for labeling different molecular targets with known expression patterns. The addition of these markers show that the tested markers were bound to the segmented regions which were automatically computed by the program ANTs. Methods and results can be found in Figure 1, Figure 1 —figure supplement 1, and lines 105-118 and 422-440. We believe the addition of these experiments strengthens the validity of our atlas and will be incorporated into the downloadable atlas package.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To identify whether the adaptation to cave environments proceeds by generalizable paths, an atlas for an unrelated Astyanax lineage should be compared.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that assessing another population of fish is a valuable resource, and is needed for claims about ‘generalizability.’ To address this concern, we have repeated our methods that were previously presented for surface fish and Pachón cavefish on another, independently evolved cavefish population, Molino. This is a unique cave, in that it evolved completely independent of the Pachón population in a second migration sweep of surface fish invading caves. Our findings in Molino with brain anatomy in pure populations as well as F<sub>2</sub> hybrids parallels our findings in Pachón, suggesting that a ventral expansion and a dorsal contraction of the brain is found in multiple cavefish. These findings and discussions can be found in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and lines 132-148, 151-165, 169-188, 189-210, and 289-294.</p><p>While claims about evolutionary generalization cannot be made without. an exhaustive assessment of various animals that span the kingdom, similar findings in independently evolved Astyanax morphs suggests that these patterns of brain evolution are likely a generalized feature in these Mexican cavefish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L153 and Figure 4d,g. What is the statistical support for labeling Cluster 3 as an independent group? Is the node that branches cluster 3 from 2 statistically significantly supported?</p></disp-quote><p>The clustering in these studies were performed using hierarchical clustering, and while this approach is a widely used approach for clustering, it does not set the number of clusters, per se. The number of clusters from a hierarchical clustering approach can be as few as one (everything in one cluster) or as many as the number of individuals represented. For instance, the cluster maximum for the surface to Pachón hybrids was 6, while the surface to Molino hybrids was 12. Our cutoff was based on that branch point that gave the most distinct grouped clusters. In order to established statistical basis for calling these groups separate, we tabulated those R-values in each cluster and examined whether there was statistical significance suggesting that they were indeed different. Unsurprisingly, the t [13.82] and p-value [&gt;0.0001] for cluster 2 and 3 revealed that the two were significantly different, suggesting the two groups are indeed different. We have added statistical tables for all comparisons to the supplemental material, Figure 4 —figure supplement 5-10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4c. Does mapping the 6 clusters onto a brain reveal regional similarities in co-evolving region sizes?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the question and have gone back to map our 6 clusters onto the Astyanax atlas. We originally only mapped back the large subdivisions of our atlas due to labor constraints, but have now written additional code that maps back brain regions for all 180 areas into their respective clusters. This not only allowed us to address this reviewers concern, but we hope that it serves as a resource for the community.</p><p>After mapping all 180 regions that fell into 6 clusters back onto the brain, we found the same trend as we did with our 13 brain region clusters, specifically that all 6 clusters are arranged in a dorsal ventral fashion and fell into groups of closely adjacent regions. We also found that dorsal to ventral comparisons of the 6 clusters also showed strong negative associations similar to those found across cluster 1 and 2 of the 13 brain region atlas. We then repeated this analysis in surface to Molino F<sub>2</sub> hybrids and found that brain regions are grouped in 12 distinct dorsal to ventral clusters, with similar positive and negative relationships found in surface to Pachon F2 hybrids. We have now replaced Figure 4 with a new figure depicting the un-clustered and clustered arrays of the 180 brain regions, along with projection maps and coronal optical sections providing examples of the clustered regions. The previous Figure 4 has now been added to the supplemental data as Figure 4 – Supplement 1. Results and discussion text can be found in lines 169-188, 189-210, and 284-294.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S5 legend is too sparsely worded to be clear. What the red circles represent should be clearly stated. What do the A and B and X and Y variables represent? These are not defined. &quot;PC1 describes preoptic width, while PC2 describes length.&quot; Correct me if I'm wrong, but here I think you mean something more subtle than what's stated. Shouldn't this be something about the loading of these PCs having an over representation of width/length distances. If the simple statement is true, why not report the absolute width and length in addition to the PCA?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the sparse wording and mislabeling of the figure axes. We have added additional descriptive information into the figure legend to assist a reader in understanding our PCA plots. We have also expanded this legend to more clearly state the data presented. We apologize for this oversight, and thank the reviewer for calling our attention to it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5. As commented above, there is a conflation of PC with a simple length measurement. The optic tectum varies on PC1, and you show it is longer. How much of PC1 is explained by length, for example. Why not provide the length measurement?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that our presentation of these data was misleading. We meant to use PCA to determine statistical relationships between the 3d volumetric shape, and to show, broadly, how these varied in both x and y axis dimensions. However, our description in the text and generalized arrows along physical axes of the brain regions was a mistake. Our intent was not to conflate, but rather to make it easy for a reader to interpret. We have since edited Panels a and b in the figure, and added supplementary figures, Figure 5 —figure supplement 3-6, that provide wire diagrams and landmarks over the projected brain regions to elucidate the 3d complexity being analyzed.</p><p>In regards to the PCA, the PCA was generated by placing reference points at pre-defined areas on each neuroanatomical locus, applying 3-dimentional morphometrics, and then using principal component analysis of the high dimensionality data set to determine which principle components explained the largest amount of the difference between the two. The PCA showed the statistical relationship between morphs, and revealed that, as would be expected for a genetically determined trait, that F<sub>2</sub> hybrids showed intermediary values that spanned the range of surface cave. Often times, we found that a given principal component aligned with an expansion/contraction along either the x- or y-axis. Other times, the PCA explained a curvy-linear axis, as was the case for the cerebellum (in Figure 5b), and we highlighted that. However, the reviewer is correct: because the PCA was performed on 3d morphometrics and not linear data sets, true relationships between 3d data and x- and y-axis cannot be made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>But further, could a similar covariation (if found) be simply a result of the fact that volume is a function of the parameters (e.g., length, width) analysed during shape analysis? As a result, shape and volume are not orthogonal variables for which a finding of distinct developmental mechanisms would be compelling.</p></disp-quote><p>3D shape analysis is certainly a different parameter than volume, yet the two are both continuous variables. We show that the two continuous values correlate beyond statistical significance and believe this suggests that the two are likely related to each other. We do believe, however, as I think the reviewer is stating, that we could be capturing some measure of volume within our shape parameter, and we now make this point in the discussion (lines 386-387).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 198-200. The conclusions from this paragraph are too strong. One issue is why one must invoke developmental constraints in the patterning of the brain. It may be true that expansion of one brain region comes at the expense of another, but these data do not demonstrate this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the statement was too strong, in lieu of cluster mapping to demonstrate a concomitant tradeoff between dorsal-ventral poles of the brain. However, with the addition of the Molino cave analysis and subsequent mapping of hybrid brain clusters, we believe the data and analysis now supports this conclusion. We have edited the language in the text to now state “an anatomical tradeoff” that appears convergent across cave populations. These changes are now found in lines 167 and 187.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5c,d. The differences between these two graphs are trivial, as I understand them, and there seems to be no new information provided by using two graphs. Why not just provide 5d, with regions labeled on the Y-axis?</p></disp-quote><p>While these two graphs are very similar and we are happy to drop panel 5c we believe that for the sake of transparency, showing clustered and unclustered graphs are useful for the reader, and does not take away from the study. Again, we are happy to remove if needed, but have left unchanged as of now for transparency sake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 219-220. This conclusion is not supported by a direct analysis. Volume covariation and shape covariation are not directly compared. Rather, in the volumetric analysis, only 4 regions are analyzed, rather than 13 for the shape analysis. These should be analysed in the same way in order to make this statement. But even this would be simply a correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a direct comparison was not performed and have since softened the language throughout the paragraph (line 369-372). This includes pointing out that this is a first effort and will need to analyze the entire atlas in future work. Shape is significantly more laborious to assess, and we were not able to look at shape for every region. Moreover, we believe that the volume is a resource to the community, whereas shape was assessed to try to determine whether there was a relationship. We have also highlighted this discrepancy in the discussion (lines 418 to 420). We did however directly compare dimension reduced 3D morphometric values to volume in 6 regions of the 13 region atlas (Figure 5 —figure supplement 9 and lines 254-264). We hope these changes and the transparency of analytical terms satisfies the valid concerns of the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 260 and elsewhere. &quot;Our data show that the dorsal-caudal areas of the brain evolve together…&quot; This work shows that in the Pachon line has evolved in this way. The sample size is derived from F2 animals from a outcross of this line, and as such the separate animals represent unique genetic combinations of Pachon alleles, but it is from a single evolutionary trajectory. As such, additional examples of evolution (for example from another cave) may operate by changing other brain region sizes. I see that this caveat is then raised (L 266), but the conclusions remain overstated in this paper elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these statements were overstated without analyzing additional cave populations. We have since analyzed both pure Molino cavefish and surface to Molino cave F<sub>2</sub> hybrids. Molino pure and hybrid data was nearly identical to that of Pachón cavefish and suggests this dorsal-ventral shift in brain mass is likely a generalizable trait for Astyanax mexicanus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is not the authors' fault, but there is confusion between these two hypotheses in general – both (functional and developmental) can be regulated by genes. Developmental constraints can act brain-wide and local (like islet<sub>1/2</sub> expressing domain). Functional constraints can also act on local-nearby regions but also long distances such as between the cerebrum and cerebellum (co-evolution of cerebrum and cerebellum were presented as an example of the functional constraints). Thus, brain-wide or not is not such a good criterion to argue these two hypotheses although Montgomery et al., 2016 mentioned. To me, these two hypotheses are proxies of the question of whether the brain regions are regulated by developmental genes (Pax6, Hoxs, Otx etc) vs. functional axonal/synaptic genes (Netrin, semaphorin, GluN receptors etc). The authors briefly mentioned that cluster3 (subpallium and dorsal diencephalon) could be an example of the functional constraints but it was with not so positive reasons; that is, this region was not constrained by other regions (L258-259). If the authors would like to mention the functional constraints, I feel they need to show positive data, such as neural activities are not tightly associated with other brain regions compared with between the clusters 1 and 2.</p><p>My suggestion is that the authors may need to restate their research question to align what they have in the data.</p></disp-quote><p>These hypotheses are not singularly defined in the field, and interpretations of what developmental and functional means often varies from one usage to another. We agree with the reviewer that an argument for a “functional constraint” would be strengthened by functional experiments, and that arguments for developmental would be augmented by developmental genes such as Pax6 or Nkx2.2, while arguments for function would be bolstered by corresponding mechanisms involving ‘functional’ genes such as Netrin and semaphorins. While this is a long-term goal of the project, we are far away from having these results.</p><p>Due to these limitations, we have decided to remove the section arguing for functional constraint of cluster 3, and have tried to be more cautious in our arguments for these two hypotheses throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>here are the other points I am concerned about:</p><p>L34-39: &quot;Two central hypotheses are thought to drive anatomical brain evolution;…&quot;</p><p>I am afraid that the sentence for the developmental constraint hypothesis is a little misleading by stating &quot;..change together in a concerted matter.&quot; many studies showed the brain develops in a mosaic fashion. I guess the authors would like to state as &quot;the developmental constraints hypothesis suggests that most of the individual brain components tend to evolve together&quot; as Montgomery et al., 2016 stated.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s interpretation of our intent is correct, and we have tried to clarify the manuscript to better reflect that. The text now reads, “, that most of the brains regions tend to evolve together” (lines 37-42).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also the authors mentioned 'mosaic' relating to the functional constraints hypothesis, yet, in developmental biology, 'mosaic' is also used for developmental processes. I suggest the authors clarify whenever they use 'mosaic' for functional or developmental.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s confusion and have edited the text that describes the two hypotheses. We apologize for the vagueness and hope our revised text satisfies this reviewers concern.

I would be very happy to look at it again and I have no problems with the data. Please understand that my criticism is basically saying that I don't think you completely know HOW interesting/impactful your results are because you do not address to the long arguments and disagreements in the literature. I think you should spend a while really dissecting what people have been thinking about the evolution of vertebrate brain. Read the vast body of literature on brain evolution, the works of William Hodos, Ann Buttler, Georg Strieder and Glenn Northcutt especially come to mind right away. Your results based on their original work can be that much more insightful. These established authors have raised many questions which you can chime in with your new techniques. It will be a wasted opportunity to just argue that astyanax is a good model, show the reader WHY it is a good model, what do the results mean. I think then it will elevate the paper to an eLife level.</p><p>I am including one specific set of points on the abstract that illustrate the same issues again and again in the entire text (I'll be blunt because it is easier, keep in mind that I am a fan of the work):</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that an important discussion is needed on current unresolved topics underlying evolution of the brain and how the cavefish fills a need to study the mechanisms underlying anatomical and functional evolution of the brain. We have since edited the introduction significantly (especially lines 79-90) that provides background on how the brain is thought to evolve anatomically, along with two paragraphs in the discussion , (1) briefly discussing how unresolved questions can be addressed going forward utilizing non-traditional methods for neurological inquiry, such as the fossil record (e.g. soft tissue is poorly preserved) (line 330-346), and (2) recent studies in other non-model fish species that are providing a way forward for understanding and testing the functional significance of convergent changes in neuroanatomical evolution (lines 348-365).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Brain anatomy is highly variable and it is widely accepted that anatomical variation impacts brain function and ultimately behavior.&quot;</p><p>I think the initial statement of the abstract is already confounding. You are already not bringing evolutionary neuroscientists to your side. It is too simplistic. I think anyone who knows anything about the issue will either dismiss you, thinking that you have not done your homework in terms the literature, or that your knowledge of the subject is not sophisticated. There is an enormous body of evidence on the literature that show how conserved brains actually are. Diversity and homology are actually one of the main tenants of MANY brain evolutionary studies. Also revise the sentence to avoid repetition of &quot;anatomy/anatomical&quot; for stylistic reasons.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the vertebrate brain, or bauplan of the brain, has remained remarkably conserved. However, variation in the size, shape and function of individual brain regions can be highly variable and contributes greatly to the amazing diversity of behaviors we see across taxa. We have edited the text in the abstract and introduction to help clarify this point (lines 12-19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;The structural complexity of the brain, including differences in volume and shape, presents an enormous barrier to define how variability underlies differences in function.&quot;</p><p>I respectfully disagree, the challenge is no longer in this level of analysis. Neurons themselves, circuits and modulation are the next frontier that will inform our questions. I think the first 2 sentences are weak and do not buttress the argument of why this study is important and novel. I would recommend to rewrite it.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the function and modulation of circuits is fundamental to understanding behavioral evolution. We have edited the text to state that anatomy and function together create obstacles for determining how evolution of the brain results in novel behaviors. We have since rewritten the abstract and focus on how anatomical variation can lead to functional and ultimately behavioral variation (see lines 12-15 and 35-40)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;In this study, we sought to investigate the evolution of brain anatomy in relation to brain region volume and shape across the brain of a single species with variable genetic and anatomical morphs.&quot;</p><p>Again this has been done for years, at this point of reading, I am not convinced why this is novel enough to give insights to the audience of eLife. I think here you really have the chance to drive your point that your results are really important, but you don't yet have the knowledgeable reader on your side.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our arguments and language did not convey to the reader how the unique characteristics of this model, a single species with variable genetic and anatomical morphs, were leveraged through hybridization to functionally test how every brain region anatomically relates to one-another. We have since changethe sentence to read, “In this study, we sought to investigate the evolution of brain anatomy using a single species of fish consisting of divergent surface and cave morphs, that permits functional genetic testing of regional volume and shape across the entire brain.”(line 17-19) In addition, we believe that added paragraphs addressing previous concerns from the introduction and discussion will help the reader grasp the importance of this model in addressing how anatomical change impacts organismal function and behavior.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1.

Yet, the major sensory difference at 6 days old – functional vs non-functional eyes (surface fish and cavefish, respectively) – could affect the brain anatomical changes. I assume that authors took whole body pictures before dissection (or, eyes were scanned together during brain imaging) and the eye-size parameter is available to test whether the whole brain landscape is basically correlated with the eye size.
