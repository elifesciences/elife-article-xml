and animals alike: they might benefit from untapped resources or face unexpected costs or dangers such as predation. The conventional exploration/exploitation tradeoff is thus colored by risk sensitivity. A wealth of experiments has shown how animals solve this dilemma, for example, using intermittent approach. However, there are large individual differences in the nature of approach, and modeling has yet to elucidate how this might be based on animals’ differing prior expectations about reward and threat, and differing degrees of risk aversion. To capture these factors, we built a Bayes-adaptive Markov decision process model with three key components: an adaptive hazard function capturing potential predation, an intrinsic reward function providing the urge to explore, and a conditional value at risk (CVaR) objective, which is a contemporary measure of trait risk sensitivity. We fit this model to a coarse-grain abstraction of the behavior of 26 animals who freely explored a novel object in an open-field arena. We show that the model captures both quantitative (frequency, duration of exploratory bouts) and qualitative (with distinguished, cautious, tail-behind approach) features of behavior, including the substantial idiosyncrasies that were observed. Some animals begin with cautious exploration and quickly transition to a confident approach to maximize exploration for reward; we classify them as potentially more risk neutral and enjoying a flexible hazard prior. By contrast, other animals only ever approach in a cautious manner and display a form of self-censoring; they are characterized by potential risk aversion and high and inflexible hazard priors. Explaining risk-sensitive exploration using factorized parameters of reinforcement learning models could aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric abnormalities such as anxiety disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exploration</kwd><kwd>risk sensitivity</kwd><kwd>Bayesian reinforcement learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01hhn8329</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dayan</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/012kf4317</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dayan</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/018mejw64</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Machine Learning Cluster of Excellence, EXC number 2064/1 – Project number 39072764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dayan</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03zcxha54</institution-id><institution>Else Kröner-Fresenius-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ClinbrAIn: Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Brain Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dayan</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Despite these dueling aspects, investigations of novelty in reinforcement learning have mostly focused on neophilia driven by optimism in the face of uncertainty, and so information-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duff, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dayan and Sejnowski, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gottlieb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>). Neophobia has attracted fewer computational studies, apart from some interesting evolutionary analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greggor et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Excessive novelty seeking and excessive novelty avoidance can both be maladaptive – they are flip sides of a disturbed balance. Here, we seek to examine potential sources of such disturbances, for instance, in distorted priors about the magnitude or probabilities of rewards (which have been linked to mania; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Radulescu and Niv, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett and Niv, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eldar et al., 2016</xref>) or threats (linked to anxiety and depression; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop and Gagne, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paulus and Yu, 2012</xref>), or in extreme risk attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gagne and Dayan, 2022</xref>).</p><p>To do this, we take advantage of a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref> on the behavior of mice exploring a familiar open-field arena after the introduction of a novel object near to one corner. The mice could move freely and interact with the object at will. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref> performed detailed analyses of how individual animals’ trajectories reflected the novel object, including using DeepLabCut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>) to track the orientation of the mice relative to the object and MOSEQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiltschko et al., 2020</xref>) to extract behavioral ‘syllables’ whose prevalence was affected by it. The animals differed markedly in how they approached the object and in what pattern. For the former, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref> observed two characteristic positionings of the animals when near to the object: ‘tail-behind’ (bouts where the animal’s nose was closer to the object than the tail for the entire bout) and ‘tail-exposed’ (bouts where the animal’s tail is closer to the object than the nose at some point during the bout), associated, respectively, with cautious risk assessment and engagement. For the latter, there was substantial heterogeneity, with all animals initially performing tail-behind approach, but some taking much longer (or failing altogether) to transition to tail-exposed approach.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref> provide a model-free reinforcement learning account of their data, focusing on the prediction of threat and its realization in the tail of the striatum (TS). Here, we provide a model-based reinforcement learning account, focusing on the rich details of the dynamics of approach carefully characterized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref>. These include intermittency (i.e. why animals retreat from the object), approach drive (or why animals approach in the first place), the significant long-run approach of cautious animals despite having reached periods of ‘avoidance’ behavior, and how the intensity of approach increases when the other animals transition from risk assessment to engagement and then decreases in the long run of the ‘engagement’ phase. Our model provides an alternative explanation for why animals learn to avoid the novel object in a completely benign environment. Through modeling these additional statistics and behaviors, we reveal the multidimensional aspect of caution in exploration that cannot be captured just in terms of time spent at the object.</p><p>We model an abstract depiction of the behavior of individual mice by combining the Bayes-adaptive Markov decision process (BAMDP) treatment of rational exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dearden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duff, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guez et al., 2013</xref>) with two sources of risk sensitivity: the prior over the potential hazard associated with the object, and the conditional value at risk (CVaR) probability distortion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Artzner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gagne and Dayan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellemare et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In a BAMDP, the agent maintains a belief about the possible rewards, costs, and transitions in the environment and decides upon optimal actions based on these beliefs. Since the agent can optionally reuse or abandon incompletely known actions based on what it discovers about them, these actions traditionally enjoy an exploration bonus or ‘value of information’, which generalizes the famous Gittins indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gittins, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weber, 1992</xref>). In addition to beliefs about reward, the agent also maintains a belief about potential hazard, which is the first source of risk sensitivity. These beliefs are initialized as prior expectations about the environment and so are readily subject to individual differences.</p><p>In addition to beliefs about hazards which may be specific to a particular environment, we include a second, potentially more general, source of risk sensitivity. That is, we consider optimizing the CVaR, in which agents concentrate on the average value within lower (risk-averse) or upper (risk-seeking) quantiles of the distribution of potential outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rigter et al., 2021</xref>). In the context of a BAMDP, this can force agents to pay particular attention to hazards. More extreme quantiles are associated with more extreme risk sensitivity and again are a potential locus of individual differences (as examined in regular Markov decision processes in the context of anxiety disorders in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gagne and Dayan, 2022</xref>).</p><p>In sum, we present a behavioral model of risk-sensitive exploration, with an agent computing optimal actions using the BAMDP framework under a CVaR objective. This model provides a normative explanation of individual variability – the agent makes decisions by trading off potential reward and threat in a principled way. Different priors and risk sensitivities lead to exploratory schedules that differ in duration, frequency, and type of approach (risk assessment versus engagement) through time. We report features of the different behavioral trajectories the model is able to capture, providing mechanistic insight into how the trade-off between potential reward and threat leads to rational exploratory schedules. Behavioral phenotypes emerge from the interaction of the separate computational mechanisms elucidated by our model-based treatment. This paves the way for future experimental investigations of these mechanisms, including the unexpected non-identifiability of our two sources of risk sensitivity: hazard priors and CVaR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavior phases and animal groups</title><p>Our goal is to provide a computational account of the exploratory behavior of individual mice under the assumption that they have different prior expectations and risk sensitivities. We start from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref>’s observation that the animal approaches and remains within a threshold distance (determined by them to be 7 cm) of the object in ‘bouts’ which can be characterized as ‘cautious’ or tail-behind (if the animal’s nose lies between the object and tail) or otherwise ‘confident’ or tail-exposed. We sought to capture these qualitative differences (cautious versus confident) as well as aspects of the quantitative changes in bout durations and frequencies as the animal learns about their environment. To make this readily possible, we abstracted the data in two ways: averaging bout statistics over time and clustering the animals into three groups with operationally distinct behaviors.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref>’s classification into bouts can be seen as a very useful abstraction over some of the detailed complexities of the behavior. In order to focus narrowly on interaction with the object, we abstracted further. In particular, instead of modeling the details of the animals’ spatial interaction with the object, we fitted boxcar functions to the percentages of its time <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝑔</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext>cau</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo class="MathClass-open" stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>𝑡</mml:mi><mml:mo class="MathClass-close" stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo class="MathClass-punc" stretchy="false">,</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝑔</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext>con</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo class="MathClass-open" stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>𝑡</mml:mi><mml:mo class="MathClass-close" stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft1">\begin{document}$g^{\text{cau}}(t), g^{\text{con}}(t)$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> that the animal spends in cautious and confident bouts around time <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝑡</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft2">\begin{document}$t$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> in the apparatus. We can then well encompass the behavior of most animals via four coarse phases of behavior that arise from two binary factors: whether the animal is mainly performing cautious or confident approaches, and whether bouts happen frequently, at a peak rate, or at a lower, steady-state rate. The time an animal spends near the object in one of these phases reflects the product of how frequently it visits the object and how long it stays per visit.

As a result, the animal (at least during the course of the experiment) never accumulates sufficient evidence to learn the safety of the object or if the object yields rewards. Akiti et al.’s experiment did not last long enough to answer the question of whether all animals, even the most timid ones, eventually perform confident approach. Our model predicts that they will since the agent only accumulates negative evidence for the hazard function.

In the model, behavior reflects a battle between learning about potential threat and potential reward (neither of which actually exists). The substantial individual variability in the schedules of exploratory approach was explained by different risk sensitivities, forgetting rates, exploration bonuses, and prior beliefs about an assumed hazard associated with a novel object.

The former property induces an increasing approach duration over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arsenian, 1943</xref>). Furthermore, the exploration bonus associated with the object regenerates, as if the subjects consider its affordance to be non-stationary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dayan et al., 2000</xref>). This encourages even the most timid animals to continue revisiting it. Nevertheless, a main source of persistent timidity is a sort of path-dependent self-censoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dayan et al., 2020</xref>). That is, the agents could be so pessimistic about the object that they never visit it for long enough to overturn their negative beliefs.</p><p>In our model, timid behavior can, in principle, arise from either excessive risk sensitivity or overly pessimistic priors about the hazard function. Indeed, CVaR is a probability distortion-based risk measure that is calculated by boosting the probabilities associated with the worst possibilities. Such boosting has obvious parallels with the effect of increasing prior expectations about those worst possibilities – particularly if the consequence of the boosting is a path-dependent reluctance to gather the experience necessary to overwhelm the prior. Given their similar behavioral phenotypes in this task, we duly found that it was not possible to use the model to disentangle the extent to which priors versus values of <italic>α</italic> were responsible for the observed timidity/bravery. One key difference is that risk aversion continues to affect behavior at the asymptote of learning; something that might be revealed by due choice of a series of environments. Certainly, according to the model, forced exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huys et al., 2022</xref>) would hasten convergence to the true hazard function and the transition to confident approach.</p><p>Due to the complexity of the dataset, we made several rather substantial simplifying assumptions. First, the model employs a particular set of state abstractions, for instance, representing thigmotaxis as a notional ‘nest’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Simon et al., 1994</xref>). Motivated by tail-behind versus tail-exposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref>, we model approach using a dichotomy between cautious and confident approach states. This is likely a crude approximation to the continuous and multifaceted nature of animal approach behavior. For example, during approach, animals likely adjust their levels of vigilance continuously (or discretely; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lloyd and Dayan, 2018</xref>) to monitor threat, and choose different velocities for movement, and different attentional strategies for inspecting the novel object. We hope future works will model these additional behavioral complexities, perhaps with additional internal states, and corroborate these states with neurobiological data.</p><p>Second, the model only allows the frequency of approach, and not its duration, to decrease during the steady-state phase – some animals are better fit by decreasing duration. This limitation could be lifted in future models with, for example, a mechanism for boredom causing the animal to retreat when little potential reward remains at the object.</p><p>Third, the probability of being detected was the same between cautious and confident approaches, which may not be true in general. Note that the agent decides the type of approach before the bout and is incapable of switching from cautious to confident mid-bout or vice versa.</p><p>Fourth, we modeled the relative amount of time the animal spends at the object versus elsewhere in the environment, which depends on the differential risk in the two states. However, it is likely the animals avoid the novel object largely because of the object itself, rather than the potential danger associated with the arena since they spend much less time at the center of the arena during novelty than habituation days.</p><p>Finally, we restricted ourselves to a monotonic hazard function for the predator. It would be interesting to experiment with a non-monotonic hazard function instead, as would arise, for instance, if the agent believed that if the predator has not shown up after a long time, then there actually is no predator. Of course, a sophisticated predator would exploit the agent’s inductive bias about the hazard function – by waiting until the agent’s posterior distribution has settled. In more general terms, the hazard function is a first-order approximation to a complex game-theoretic battle between prey and predator, which could be modeled, for instance, using an interactive IPOMDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gmytrasiewicz and Doshi, 2005</xref>). How the predator’s belief about the whereabouts of the prey diminishes could also be modeled game-theoretically, leading to partial hazard resetting rather than the simplified complete resetting in our model.</p><p>Our account is model-based, with the mice assumed to be learning the statistics of the environment and engaging in prospective planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mobbs et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref> provide a model-free account of the same data. They suggest that the mice learn the values of threat using an analog of temporal difference learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sutton, 1988</xref>) and explain individual variability as differences in value initialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref>). The initial values are generalizations from previous experiences with similar objects and are implemented by activity of dopamine in the TS responding to stimuli salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref>). By contrast, our model encompasses extra features of behavior such as bout duration, frequency, and type of approach – ultimately arriving at a different mechanistic explanation of neophobia. In the context of our model, TS dopamine could still respond to the physical salience of the novel object but might then affect choices by determining the potential cost of the encountered threat (a parameter we did not explore here) or perhaps the prior on the hazard function. An analogous mechanism may set the exploration pool or the prior belief about reward – perhaps involving projections from other dopamine neurons, which have been implicated in novelty in the context of exploration bonuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</xref>) and information-seeking for reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ogasawara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>).</p><p>CVaR is known to come in different flavors in the case of temporally extended behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gagne and Dayan, 2021</xref> introduce two alternative time-consistent formulations of CVaR: nested CVaR (nCVaR) and precommitted CVaR (pCVaR). nCVaR and pCVaR both enjoy Bellman equations which make it possible to compute approximately optimal policies without directly computing whole distributions of the outcomes. We use nCVaR in this study for its computational efficiency. There is, of course, great current interest in distributional reinforcement learning, which does acquire such whole distributions, not the least because of prominent observations linking non-linearities in the response functions of dopamine neurons to methods for learning distributions of outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dabney et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Masset et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sousa et al., 2023</xref>).

While it is possible to compute CVaR directly from return distributions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gagne and Dayan, 2021</xref> showed that this can lead to temporally inconsistent policies where the agent deviates from its original plans (the authors called this the fixed CVaR or fCVaR measure).</p><p>Rather further removed from our model-based methods is work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonov and Dayan, 2023</xref>, who consider a model-free exploration strategy which exploits full return distributions to compute the value of perfect information which is used as a heuristic for trying actions with uncertain consequences. Future works can examine risk-sensitive versions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonov and Dayan, 2023</xref>’s computationally efficient model-free algorithm as one solution to the burdensome computations in our model-based method.</p><p>As reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref>, animals in the FONC condition in which the object is familiar (though the context is less so) transition quickly to tail-exposed approach and therefore spend more time near the object compared to animals in the UONC condition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref> models the FONC animals using low initial mean threat and high initial threat uncertainty. We directly compare the behavior of FONC animals against that of the 11 brave UONC animals, showing that FONC animals make choices that are comparable to the bravest UONC animals. FONC behavior is fit by significantly higher nCVaR’s <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf114"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝛼</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft114">\begin{document}$\alpha$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> than brave UONC behavior animals. This is surprising if we interpret <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf115"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝛼</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft115">\begin{document}$\alpha$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> as a trait that is stable through time. Unfortunately, due to the non-identifiability between <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf116"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝛼</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft116">\begin{document}$\alpha$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> and hazard priors, we cannot verify whether <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf117"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝛼</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft117">\begin{document}$\alpha$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> is actually higher for FONC animals than UONC animals. FONC animals are also characterized by both lower hazard prior means and standard deviations compared to UONC animals, implying greater certainty about the object’s safety. Furthermore, FONC behavior is fitted with lower exploration pools than brave UONC behavior. Taken together, we can understand the FONC animals as having both lower uncertainty about hazard and reward compared to the brave UONC animals at the start of the experiment. However, the hazard and reward uncertainties are higher than what we might expect of UONC animals at the end of the experiment, suggesting the novel context modulates both of these uncertainties. However, heterogeneity exists between FONC individuals in terms of nCVaR’s <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf118"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝛼</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft118">\begin{document}$\alpha$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>, hazard priors, and exploration pool, which allows another possibility: that both hazard and reward uncertainty are restored by forgetting during the time that passed between pre-exposure and the experiment.</p><p>Our model-based account recovers several behavioral phenotypes in addition to those considered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref>. First, intermittency in our model emerges from the fact that the (possibly CVaR perturbed) hazard function increases with time spent at the object. Therefore, it is rational for the model mice to retreat to the nest when the probability of detection becomes too high and wait until (they believe) the ‘predator has forgotten about them’, before venturing to the object again.</p><p>Second, we offer an alternative explanation for why animals avoid after risk assessment in a benign environment. In Akiti’s model, timid animals perform risk assessment because of the delay in model-free value updating from the initial threat at the object (at timestep <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf119"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝑡</mml:mi><mml:mo class="MathClass-rel" stretchy="false">=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft119">\begin{document}$t=10$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> in their account) to the time of decision (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf120"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝑡</mml:mi><mml:mo class="MathClass-rel" stretchy="false">=</mml:mo><mml:mn>8</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft120">\begin{document}$t=8$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>). In our model, avoidance arises from a rational trade-off between potential risk and reward: timid animals perform risk assessment because of the potential reward at the object and having found none, cease to approach because, although potential threat is lower than at the outset, it still outweighs the even further-reduced potential reward. The same exhaustion of the exploration bonus explains why the brave animals decrease their approach during the steady state of engagement. If the potential reward is low, there is no reason to return to the object at the initial, high rate of engagement.</p><p>Third, the temporally evolving battle between reward and threat also explains why brave animals increase their duration of approach when transitioning from risk assessment to engagement. During a confident approach, the animals harvest the exploration pool faster, at the cost of an increased probability of expiring. For brave animals, the hazard posterior decreases faster than the depletion of the exploration pool, and hence brave animals decide to save on travel costs by exploring the object longer in each bout.</p><p>Fourth, timid animals return to the object in the steady state of ‘avoidance’, albeit at a lower rate than during risk assessment. This was not considered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref>’s account. In our model, timid animals’ steady-state approach is explained by the regenerating exploration pool. Such regeneration is natural if the animals assume that the environment is non-stationary, allowing reward structures to change and thus potentially repaying occasional returns to the object if the potential threat has become sufficiently low. Similarly, the animal may believe that the threat is non-stationary. Threat forgetting may act on longer time scales than reward forgetting in our studied environment and is one possible explanation for the initial non-zero hazard functions of some brave animals in the FONC condition.</p><p>Finally, our model shows the multi-faceted nature of timidity during exploration. Not only do animals differ in time spent near the object but also in how quickly they transition from cautious to confident approach and their duration and frequency of approach along their exploration schedules. These proxies for timidity are imperfectly correlated. Indeed, an animal could believe that short bouts (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf121"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝜏</mml:mi><mml:mo class="MathClass-rel" stretchy="false">=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft121">\begin{document}$\tau=2$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) are very safe while long bouts (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf122"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝜏</mml:mi><mml:mo class="MathClass-rel" stretchy="false">=</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft122">\begin{document}$\tau=4$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) certainly lead to expiration.</p><p>Of course, agents do not need to be fully model-free or model-based. They can truncate model-based planning using model-free values at leaf nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keramati et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, replay-like prioritized model-based updates can update a model-free policy when environmental contingencies change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonov and Dayan, 2023</xref>). Finally, while online BAMDP planning can be computationally expensive, a model-based agent may simply amortize planning into a model-free policy which it can reuse in similar environments or even precompile model-based strategies into an efficient model-free policy using meta-learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Agents may have faced many different exploration environments with differing reward and threat trade-offs through their lifetimes and even over evolution that they have used to create fast, instinctive model-free policies that resemble prospective, model-based behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rusu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mattar and Daw, 2018</xref>). In turn, TS dopamine might reflect aspects of MF values or prediction errors that had been trained by an MB system following the precepts we outlined.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref>, ablating TS-projecting dopamine neurons made mice ‘braver’. They spent more time near the object, performed more tail-exposed approach, and transitioned faster to tail-exposed approach compared to control. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>, TS ablation affected the learning dynamics for actual, rather than predicted threat. Both ablated and control animals initially demonstrated retreat responses toward airpuffs, but only control mice maintained this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>). After airpuff punishment, ablated individuals surprisingly did not decrease their choices of water ports associated with airpuffs (while controls did). One possibility is that this additional exposure could have caused acclimatization to the airpuffs in the same way that brave animals in our study acclimatize to the novel object by approaching more, and timid animals fail to acclimatize because of self-censoring. Indeed, future experiments might investigate why punishment avoidance does not occur in ablated animals and whether the same holds in risk-sensitive exploration settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>). In other words, would mice decrease approach after reaching the ‘detected’ state, as expected by our model, or would they maladaptively continue the same rate of approach? Finally, while our study has focused on threat, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Menegas et al., 2017</xref> showed that TS also responds to novelty and salience in the context of rewards and neutral stimuli. That TS ablated animals spend more, rather than less time near the novel object suggests that the link from novelty to neophilia and exploration bonuses might not be mediated by this structure.</p><p>The behavior of the mice in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiti et al., 2022</xref> somewhat resembles attachment behavior in toddlers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainsworth, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowlby, 1955</xref>), albeit with the caregiver’s trusty leg (a secure base from which to explore) replaced by thigmotaxis (or, in our case, the notional ‘nest’). Characteristic to this behavior is an intermittent exploration strategy, with babies venturing away from the leg for a period before retreating back to its safety. Through the time course of exposure to a novel environment, toddlers progressively venture out longer and farther away, spending more time actively playing with the toys rather than passively observing them in hesitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arsenian, 1943</xref>). This is another example of a dynamic exploratory strategy, putatively arising again from differential updates to beliefs about threats and the rewards in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arsenian, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainsworth, 1964</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that there is substantial variation in the degrees of risk sensitivity across the mice. Previous works have reported substantial interpopulation and intrapopulation differences in risk sensitivity in humans which depend on gender, age, socioeconomic status, personality characteristics, wealth, and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rieger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frey et al., 2017</xref>).

For example, more cautious individuals could learn from merely observing the risky behavior of less cautious individuals. Furthermore, we have only considered risk sensitivity under epistemic uncertainty in our work. Risk-averse individuals, for instance, with <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf126"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝛼</mml:mi><mml:mo class="MathClass-rel" stretchy="false">&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft126">\begin{document}$\alpha \lt 1$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> may be more successful than risk-neutral agents in environments where there are unexpected dangers (unknown unknowns). Risk aversion is thus a temperament of ecological and evolutionary significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Réale et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with this, variability in timidity during exploration has been reported in other animal species and can be caused by differences in both prior experience and genotype. Fish from predator-dense environments tend to make more inspection approaches but stay further away, avoid dangerous areas (attack-cone avoidance), and approach in larger shoals compared to fish from predator-sparse environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Magurran and Seghers, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dugatkin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Magurran, 1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dugatkin, 1988</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Magurran, 1986</xref> report significant within-population differences in the inspection behavior of guppies and minnows, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown and Dreier, 2002</xref> directly manipulate the predator experience of glowlight tetras, leading to changes to inspection behavior. Similar inter- and intra-population differences in timidity have been reported in mammals. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coss and Biardi, 1997</xref>, the squirrel population sympatric with the tested predators stayed further away and spent less time facing the predator compared to the allopatric population. Furthermore, the number of inspection bouts differed between litters, between individuals within the same litter, and even between the same individuals at different times during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coss and Biardi, 1997</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kemp and Kaplan, 2011</xref>, marmosets differed in risk aversion when inspecting a potential (taxidermic) predator, but risk aversion was not stable across contexts for some individuals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">FitzGibbon, 1994</xref> reports age differences in inspection behavior – adolescent gazelles inspected cheetahs more than adults or half-growns.

(Neuron 110, 2022). Mice typically perform short bouts of approach followed by retreat to a safe distance, presumably to balance exploration to discover possible reward with the potential risk of predation. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in this exploratory behaviour, both across time as an individual subject becomes more confident in approaching the object, and across subjects; with some mice rapidly becoming confident to closely explore the object, while other timid mice never become fully confident that the object is safe. The current work aims to explain both the dynamics of adaptation of individual animals over time, and the quantitative and qualitative differences in behaviour between subjects, by modelling their behaviour as arising from model-based planning in a Bayes adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP) framework, in which the subjects maintain and update probabilistic estimates of the uncertain hazard presented by the object, and rationally balance the potential reward from exploring the object with the potential risk of predation it presents.</p><p>In order to fit these complex models to the behaviour the authors necessarily make substantial simplifying assumptions, including coarse-graining the exploratory behaviour into phases quantified by a set of summary statistics related to the approach bouts of the animal. Inter-individual variation between subjects is modelled both by differences in their prior beliefs about the possible hazard presented by the object, and by differences in their risk preference, modelled using a conditional value at risk (CVaR) objective, which focuses the subject's evaluation on different quantiles of the expected distribution of outcomes. Interestingly, these two conceptually different possible sources of inter-subject variation in brave vs timid exploratory behaviour turn out not to be dissociable in the current dataset as they can largely compensate for each other in their effects on the measured behaviour. Nonetheless, the modelling captures a wide range of quantitative and qualitative differences between subjects in the dynamics of how they explore the object, essentially through differences in how subject's beliefs about the potential risk and reward presented by the object evolve over the course of exploration, and are combined to drive behaviour.</p><p>Exploration in the face of risk is a ubiquitous feature of the decision-making problem faced by organisms, with strong clinical relevance, yet remains poorly understood and under-studied, making this work a timely and welcome addition to the literature.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- Individual differences in exploratory behaviour are an interesting, important, and under-studied topic.</p><p>- Application of cutting-edge modelling methods to a rich behavioural dataset, successfully accounting for diverse qualitative and qualitative features of the data in a normative framework.</p><p>- Thoughtful discussion of the results in the context of prior literature.</p><p>Limitations:</p><p>- The model-fitting approach used of coarse-graining the behaviour into phases and fitting to their summary statistics may not be applicable to exploratory behaviours in more complex environments where coarse-graining is less straightforward.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>All recommendations to authors from the first review were addressed in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100366.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Tingke</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tübingen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dayan</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tübingen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This work computationally characterized the threat-reward learning behavior of mice in a recent study (Akiti et al.), which had prominent individual differences.

An alternative way would be assuming that the exploration bonus slowly degraded over time or experience, and if doing so, there appears to be a possibility that the transition of the bout rate from peak to steady-state could be at least partially explained by such a decrease in the exploration bonus.</p></disp-quote><p>Section 2.2.3 explains the mechanism of the exploration bonus which motivates approach. We think that the mechanism suggested by the reviewer is, in essence, what is happening in the model. The exploration pool is indeed depleted over time or bouts of experience at the object. In the peak confident phase for brave animals and the peak cautious phase for timid animals, the rate of depletion exceeds the rate of regeneration, since the agent spends only a single turn at the nest between bouts. In the steady-state phase, the exploration pool has depleted so much previously that the agent must wait multiple turns at the nest for the pool to regenerate to a sufficiently high value to justify approaching the object again.</p><p>We have updated section 2.2.3 to explain that agents spend one turn at the nest during peak phase but multiple turns during steady-state phase. Hopefully, this makes our mechanism clear:</p><p>“In simulations, when 𝐺(𝑡) is high, the agent has a high motivation to explore the object, spending only a single turn in the nest state between bouts. In other words, the depletion from 𝐺0 substantially influences the time point at which approach makes a transition from peak to steady-state; the steady-state time then depends on the dynamics of depletion (when at the object) and replenishment (when at the nest). In particular, in the steady-state phases, the agent must wait multiple turns at the nest for 𝐺(𝑡) to regenerate so that informational reward once again exceeds the potential cost of hazard.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 237- (Section 2.2.6, 2.2.7, Figures 7, 9)</p><p>I was confused by the descriptions about nCVaR. I looked at the cited original literature Gagne &amp; Dayan 2022, and understood that nCVaR is a risk-sensitive version of expected future returns (equation 4) with parameter α (α-bar) (ranging from 0 to 1) representing risk preference. Line 269-271 and Section 4.2 of the present manuscript described (in my understanding) that α was a parameter of the model. Then, isn't it more natural to report estimated values of α, rather than nCVaR, for individual animals in Section 2.2.6, 2.2.7, Figures 7, 9 (even though nCVaR monotonically depends on α)? In Figures 7 and 9, nCVaR appears to be upper-bounded to 1. The upper limit of α is 1 by definition, but I have no idea why nCVaR was also bounded by 1. So I would like to ask the authors to add more detailed explanations on nCVaR. Currently, CVaR is explained in Lines 237-243, but actually, there is no explanation about nCVaR rather than its formal name 'nested conditional value at risk' in Line 237.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this error. We have corrected the paper to use nCVaR to refer to the objective and nCVaR's α, or sometimes just α, to refer to the risk sensitivity parameter and thus the degree of risk sensitivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 333 (and Abstract)</p><p>Given that animals' behaviors could be equally well fitted by the model having both nCVaR (free α) and hazard prior and the alternative model having only hazard prior (with α = 1), may it be difficult to confidently claim that brave (/timid) animals had risk-neutral (/risk-aversive) preference in addition to widespread (/low-variance) hazard prior? Then, it might be good to somewhat weaken the corresponding expression in the Abstract (e.g., add 'potentially also' to the result for risk sensitivity) or mention the inseparability of risk sensitivity and prior belief pessimism (e.g., &quot;... although risk sensitivity and prior belief pessimism could not be teased apart&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, we have duly weakened the wording in the Abstract to say “potentially more risk neutral”:</p><p>“Some animals begin with cautious exploration, and quickly transition to confident approach to maximize exploration for reward; we classify them as potentially more risk neutral, and enjoying a flexible hazard prior. By contrast, other animals only ever approach in a cautious manner and display a form of self-censoring; they are characterized by potential risk aversion and high and inflexible hazard priors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Shen and Dayan build a Bayes adaptive Markov decision process model with three key components: an adaptive hazard function capturing potential predation, an intrinsic reward function providing the urge to explore, and a conditional value at risk (CvaR, closely related to probability distortion explanations of risk traits). The model itself is very interesting and has many strengths including considering different sources of risk preference in generating behavior under uncertainty. I think this model will be useful to consider for those studying approach/avoid behaviors in dynamic contexts.</p><p>The authors argue that the model explains behavior in a very simple and unconstrained behavioral task in which animals are shown novel objects and retreat from them in various manners (different body postures and patterns of motor chunks/syllables). The model itself does capture lots of the key mouse behavioral variability (at least on average on a mouse-by-mouse basis) which is interesting and potentially useful. However, the variables in the model - and the internal states it implies the mice have during the behavior - are relatively unconstrained given the wide range of explanations one can offer for the mouse behavior in the original study (Akiti et al). This reviewer commends the authors on an original and innovative expansion of existing models of animal behaviour, but recommends that the authors revise their study to reflect the obvious challenges . I would also recommend a reduction in claiming that this exercise gives a normative-like or at least quantitative account of mental disorders.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for highlighting some of the strengths of our paper as well as pointing out important limitations of Akiti et al’s original study which we’ve inherited as well as some limitations of our own method.

The use of terms like &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;brave&quot;, etc in this context is tricky because the task does not allow the original authors (Akiti et al) to quantify these &quot;internal states&quot; or &quot;traits&quot; with the appropriate level of quantitative detail to say whether this model is correct or not in capturing the internal states that result in the rodent behavior. That said, the original behavioral setup is so simple that one could imagine capturing the behavioral variability in multiple ways (potentially without evoking complex computations that the original authors never showed the mouse brain performs). I would recommend reframing the paper as a new model that proposes a set of internal states that could give rise to the behavioral heterogeneity observed in Akiti et al, but nonetheless is at this time only a hypothesis. Furthermore, an explanation of what would be really required to test this would be appreciated to make the point clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We thought very hard about using terms that might be considered to be anthropomorphic such as ‘timid’ and ‘brave’. We are, of course, aware, of the concerns articulated by investigators such as LeDoux about this. However, we think that, provided that we are clear on the first appearance (using ‘scare’ quotes) that we are using them as indeed labels for latent characteristics that capture correlations in various aspects of behaviour, they are more helpful than harmful in making our descriptions understandable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript presents computational modelling of the behaviour of mice during encounters with novel and familiar objects, originally reported by Akiti et al. (Neuron 110, 2022) . Mice typically perform short bouts of approach followed by a retreat to a safe distance, presumably to balance exploration to discover possible rewards with the potential risk of predation. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in this exploratory behaviour, both across time as an individual subject becomes more confident in approaching the object, and across subjects; with some mice rapidly becoming confident to closely explore the object, while other timid mice never become fully confident that the object is safe. The current work aims to explain both the dynamics of adaptation of individual animals over time, and the quantitative and qualitative differences in behaviour between subjects, by modelling their behaviour as arising from model-based planning in a Bayes adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP) framework, in which the subjects maintain and update probabilistic estimates of the uncertain hazard presented by the object, and rationally balance the potential reward from exploring the object with the potential risk of predation it presents.</p><p>In order to fit these complex models to the behaviour the authors necessarily make substantial simplifying assumptions, including coarse-graining the exploratory behaviour into phases quantified by a set of summary statistics related to the approach bouts of the animal. Inter-individual variation between subjects is modelled both by differences in their prior beliefs about the possible hazard presented by the object and by differences in their risk preference, modelled using a conditional value at risk (CVaR) objective, which focuses the subject's evaluation on different quantiles of the expected distribution of outcomes. Interestingly these two conceptually different possible sources of inter-subject variation in brave vs timid exploratory behaviour turn out not to be dissociable in the current dataset as they can largely compensate for each other in their effects on the measured behaviour. Nonetheless, the modelling captures a wide range of quantitative and qualitative differences between subjects in the dynamics of how they explore the object, essentially through differences in how subject's beliefs about the potential risk and reward presented by the object evolve over the course of exploration, and are combined to drive behaviour.</p><p>Exploration in the face of risk is a ubiquitous feature of the decision-making problem faced by organisms, with strong clinical relevance, yet remains poorly understood and under-studied, making this work a timely and welcome addition to the literature.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Individual differences in exploratory behaviour are an interesting, important, and under-studied topic.</p><p>(2) Application of cutting-edge modelling methods to a rich behavioural dataset, successfully accounting for diverse qualitative and qualitative features of the data in a normative framework.</p><p>(3) Thoughtful discussion of the results in the context of prior literature.</p><p>Limitations:</p><p>(1) The model-fitting approach used of coarse-graining the behaviour into phases and fitting to their summary statistics may not be applicable to exploratory behaviours in more complex environments where coarse-graining is less straightforward.</p><p>(2) Some aspects of the work could be more usefully clarified within the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #3 for their positive feedback and helping us to improve the clarity of our paper. We have added discussion they thought was missing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Line 25-28</p><p>This part of the Abstract might give an impression that timidity (but not braveness) is potentially associated with psychiatric illness and even that timidity is thus inferior to braveness. However, even though extreme timidity might indeed be associated with anxiety or depression, extreme braveness could also be associated with other psychiatric or behavioral problems. Moreover, as a population, the existence of both timid and brave individuals could be advantageous, and it could be a reason why both types of individuals evolutionarily survived in the case of wild animals (although Akiti et al. used mice, which may have no or very limited genetic varieties, and so things may be different). So I would like to encourage the authors to elaborate on the expression of this part of the Abstract and/or enrich the related discussion in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. We note on line 38 that excessive novelty seeking (potentially caused by excessive braveness) could also be maladaptive.</p><p>Additionally, we have added a paragraph to the discussion discussing heterogeneity in risk sensitivity within a population.</p><p>“Our data show that there is substantial variation in the degrees of risk sensitivity across the mice. Previous works have reported substantial interpopulation and intrapopulation differences in risk-sensitivity in humans which depend on gender, age, socioeconomic status, personality characteristics, wealth and culture (Rieger et al., 2015; Frey et al., 2017). Despite the normative appeal of 𝛼 = 1, it is possible that a population may benefit from including individuals with $\alpha$ different from 1.0 or highly negative priors. For example, more cautious individuals could learn from merely observing the risky behavior of less cautious individuals. Furthermore, we have only considered risk-sensitivity under epistemic uncertainty in our work. Risk averse individuals, for instance with 𝛼 &lt; 1 may be more successful than risk-neutral agents in environments where there are unexpected dangers (unknown unknowns). Risk-aversion is thus a temperament of ecological and evolutionary significance (Réale et al., 2007).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 149</p><p>Section 2.2 consists of eight subsections. I think this organization may not be very appealing, because there are a bit too many subsections, and their relations are not immediately clear to readers. So I would like to encourage the authors to make an elaboration. For example, since 2.2.1 - 2.2.5 describes a summary of model construction and model fitting whereas 2.2.6-2.2.8 shows the results, it could be good to divide these into separate sections (2.2.1 - 2.2.5 and 2.3.1 - 2.3.3).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We’ve renumbered the sections as you’ve suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 347-8</p><p>Theoretically, the effect of prior is diluted over experience whereas the effect of biased (risk-aversive) evaluation persists, as the authors mentioned in Lines 393-394. Then isn't it possible to consider environments/conditions in which the two effects can be separated?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. Indeed, our original thought in modeling this experiment was that this would be exactly the case here - with epistemic uncertainty reducing as the object became more familiar. However, proving to an animal that a single environment is completely stationary/fixed is hard - reflected in our conclusion here that the exploration bonus pool replenishes. Thus, we argued in the discussion that a series of environments would be necessary to separate risk sensitivity from priors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 407</p><p>It would be nice to add a brief phrase explaining how (in what sense) this model's assumption was consistent with the reported behavior. Also, should the assumption of having two discrete approach states (cautious and confident) itself be regarded as a limitation of the model? If the tail-behind and tail-exposure approaches were not merely operationally categorized but were indicated to be two qualitatively distinct behaviors in the experiment by Akiti et al., it is reasonable to model them as two discrete states, but otherwise, the assumption of two discrete states would need to be mentioned as a simplification/limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed line 407, and now have an additional paragraph in the discussion discussing the limitations of the tail-behind and tail-exposure state representation: “Motivated by tail-behind versus tail-exposed in Akiti et al. (2022), we model approach using a dichotomy between cautious and confident approach states. This is likely a crude approximation to the continuous and multifaceted nature of animal approach behavior. For example, during approach animals likely adjust their levels of vigilance continuously (or discretely; Lloyd and Dayan (2018)) to monitor threat, and choose different velocities for movement, and different attentional strategies for inspecting the novel object. We hope future works will model these additional behavioral complexities, perhaps with additional internal states, and corroborate these states with neurobiological data.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 418</p><p>The authors contrasted their model-based analyses with the model-free analyses of Akiti et al. Another aspect of differences between the authors' model and the model of Akiti et al. is whether it is normative or mechanistic: while how the model of Akiti et al. can be biologically implemented appears to be clear (TS dopamine represents threat TD error, and TS dopamine-dependent cortico-striatal plasticity implements TD error-based update of model-free threat prediction), biological implementation of the authors' model seems more elusive. Given this, it might be a fruitful direction to explore how these two models can be integrated in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>We enthusiastically agree that it would be most interesting in the future to explore the integration of the two models - and, in the discussion (Lines 537-548, 454-461) , point to some first steps that might be fruitful along these lines. There are two separate considerations here: one is that our account is mostly computational and algorithmic, whereas Akiti’s model is mostly algorithmic and implementational; the second is, as noted by the reviewer, that our account is model-based, whereas Akiti’s model is model-free (in the sense of reinforcement learning; RL). These are related - thanks in no small part to the work from the group including Akiti, we know a lot more about the implementation of model-free than model-based RL. However, our model-based account does reach additional features of behavior not captured in Akiti et al.’s model such as bout duration, frequency, and approach type. Thus, the temptation of unification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Line 426</p><p>Related to the previous point, it would be nice to more specifically describe what variable TS dopamine can represent in the authors' model if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>In the discussion (Lines 454-461) , we speculate that TS dopamine could still respond to the physical salience of the novel object and affect choices by determining the potential cost of the encountered threat or the prior on the hazard function. For example, perhaps ablating TS dopamine reduces the hazard priors which leads to faster transition from cautious to confident approach and longer bout durations, consistent with the optogenetics behavioral data reported in Akiti et al.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>My guess is simpler versions of the model would not fit the data well. But this does not mean for example that the mice have probability distortions (CvaR) or that even probabilistic reasoning and the internal models necessary to support them are acting in the behavioral context studied by Akiti. So related to the above, I would ask what other models would fit and would not fit the data? And what does this mean?</p></disp-quote><p>These are good points. Our model provides an approximately normative account of the animals’ behavior in terms of what it achieves relative to a utility function. In practice, the animals could deploy a precompiled model-free policy (which does not rely on probabilistic computations) that is exactly equivalent to our model-based policy. With the current experiment, we cannot conclude whether or not the animals are performing the prospective calculations in an online manner. Of course, the extent to which animals or humans are performing probabilistic computations online and have internal models are on-going questions of study.</p><p>Model comparison is difficult because currently we do not know of any other risk-sensitive exploration models. We cannot directly compare to the model in Akiti et al. since our model explains additional features of behavior: bout duration, frequency, and approach type. Indeed, our model is as simple as it can be in the sense with the exception of nCVaR, removing any of the other parameters makes it difficult to fit some animals in our dataset. In the future, our model could be used to fit other datasets of risk-sensitive exploration and, ideally, be compared to other models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Explaining why animals avoid the novel object in what the offers call benign environment is a very tricky issue. In Akiti et al, the readers are not yet convinced that the mice know that this environment is benign. Being placed in an arena with a novel object presents mice with a great uncertainty and we do not know whether they treat this as benign. Therefore, the alternative explanations in this study need to be carefully discussed in lieu of the limitations of the initial study.</p></disp-quote><p>It is certainly true that it is unclear if the arena is completely benign to the animals. However, the amount of time the animal spends in the center of the arena decreases significantly from habituation to novelty days. This suggests that the animals avoid the novel object largely because of the object itself, rather than the potential danger associated with the arena. Furthermore, the animals are not reported as exhibiting more extreme behaviours such as freezing. In any case, our account is relative in the sense that we are comparing the time the animal spends at the object versus elsewhere in the environment, driven by the relative novelty and relative risk of the environment versus the object. Trying to get more absolute measures of these quantities would require a richer experimental set-up, for instance with different degree of habituation or experience of the occurrence of (other) novel objects, in general.</p><p>We added a short note to the discussion to explain this:</p><p>“Fourth, we modeled the relative amount of time the animal spends at the object versus elsewhere in the environment which depends on the differential risk in the two states. However, it is likely the animals avoid the novel object largely because of the object itself, rather than the potential danger associated with the arena since they spend much less time at the center of the arena during novelty than habituation days.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 - how confident are the authors that each mouse differs from y=1? Related to this, the behavior in Akiti is very noisy and changes across time. I am not sure if the authors fully describe at what levels their model captures the behavior vs not in a detailed enough fashion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a random permutation test on the minute-to-minute data. We have updated Figure 2 so that brave animals that pass the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure y&gt;1 at level q=0.05 are represented with solid green dots and animals that don’t pass are represented with hollow dots. 8 out of 11 brave animals passed Benjamini–Hochberg.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) I could not find information in the preprint about code availability. Please consider making the code public to help others apply these modelling methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have released code and included the url in the paper in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Though the manuscript was generally clearly written, there were a number of places where some additional information or clarification would be useful:</p><p>a) Please define and explain the terms 'tail-behind' and 'tail-exposed' (used to describe approach bout types) when first used.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added definitions when we first mention these terms:</p><p>“[...] 'tail-behind' (bouts where the animal's nose was closer to the object than the tail for the entire bout) and 'tail-exposed' (bouts where the animal's tail is closer to the object than the nose at some point during the bout), associated respectively with cautious risk-assessment and engagement”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) At lines 57-58 when contrasting the 'model-free' account of Akiti et al with the 'model-based' account of the current work, it would be worth clarifying that these terms are being used in the RL sense rather than e.g. a model-based analysis of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the relevant lines to say “model-free/based reinforcement learning”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Line 61, the phrase 'the significant long-run approach of timid animals despite having reached the &quot;avoid&quot; state' is unclear as the 'avoid' state has not been defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated the terminology to “avoidance behavior” to be consistent with Akiti et al. Avoidance refers to the animal routinely avoiding the object and therefore being unable to learn whether it is safe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) It was not completely clear to me how the coarse-graining of the behaviour was implemented. Specifically, how were animals assigned to the brave, intermediate, or timid group, and how were the parameters of the resulting behavioural phases fit?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry that this was not clear. Section 2.1 explains how the minute-to-minute behavioral data was coarse-grained and how animal groups were assigned. We have added further explanation of Figure 2 to the main text:</p><p>“Fig 2 summarizes our categorization of the animals into the three groups: brave, intermediate, and timid based on the phases identified in the animal's exploratory trajectories. Timid animals spend no time in confident approach and are plotted in orange at the origin of Fig 2. Brave animals differ from intermediate animals in that their approach time during the first ten minutes of the confident phase is greater than the last ten minutes (steady-state phase). Brave animals are plotted in green above and intermediate animals are plotted in black below the y=1 line in Fig 2.”</p><p>We also added extra information to outline the goal, and methodology of coarse-graining and animal grouping:</p><p>“We sought to capture these qualitative differences (cautious versus confident) as well as aspects of the quantitative changes in bout durations and frequencies as the animal learns about their environment. To make this readily possible, we abstracted the data in two ways:</p><p>averaging bout statistics over time, and clustering the animals into three groups with operationally distinct behaviors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) What purpose does the 'retreat' state serve in the BAMDP model (as opposed to transitioning directly from 'object' to 'nest' states), and why do subjects not pass through it following 'detect' states?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have updated Figure 3 to note that the two “detected states” also point to the “retreat” state. The reviewer is correct that there could be alternative versions of the state diagram, and the ‘retreat’ state could indeed have been eliminated. However, we thought that it was helpful to structure the animal’s progress through state space.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) Why was the hazard function parameterised via the mean and SD at each time step rather than with a parametric form of the mean and SD as a function of time?</p></disp-quote><p>Since the agent can only spend 2, 3, or 4 turns at the object states, we didn’t see a need to parameterize the mean and SD as a function of time. Doing so is a good solution to scaling up the hazard function to more time-steps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) There were also a couple of points that could potentially be usefully touched on in the discussion:</p><p>a) What, if any, is the relationship between the CVaR objective and distributional RL? They seem potentially related due to both focussing on quantiles of the outcome distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph to the discussion discussing the connection between distributional RL and CVaR:</p><p>“CVaR is known to come in different flavors in the case of temporally-extended behavior. Gagne and Dayan (2021) introduces two alternative time-consistent formulations of CVaR: nested CVaR (nCVaR) and precommitted CVaR (pCVaR). nCVaR and pCVaR both enjoy Bellman equations which make it possible to compute approximately optimal policies without directly computing whole distributions of the outcomes. We use nCVaR in this study for its computational efficiency. There is, of course, great current interest in distributional reinforcement learning (Bellemare et al., 2023b) which does acquire such whole distributions, not the least because of prominent observations linking non-linearities in the response functions of dopamine neurons to methods for learning distributions of outcomes (Dabney et al., 2020; Masset et al., 2023; Sousa et al., 2023). One functional motivation for considering entire outcome distributions is the possibility of using them to determine risk-sensitive policies (Gagne and Dayan, 2021).</p><p>While it is possible to compute CVaR directly from return distributions, Gagne and Dayan (2021) showed that this can lead to temporally inconsistent policies where the agent deviates from its original plans (the authors called this the fixed CVaR or fCVaR measure).</p><p>Rather further removed from our model-based methods is work from Antonov and Dayan (2023), who consider a model-free exploration strategy which exploits full return distributions to compute the value of perfect information which is used as a heuristic for trying actions with uncertain consequences. Future works can examine risk-sensitive versions of Antonov and Dayan (2023)'s computationally efficient model-free algorithm as one solution to the burdensome computations in our model-based method.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Why normatively might subjects have non-neutral risk preference as captured by the CvaR?</p></disp-quote><p>We also added a paragraph to the discussion discussing the advantage of heterogeneity in risk sensitivity within a population:</p><p>(Reviewer #1 had the same question, see above) “Our data show that there is substantial variation in the degrees of risk sensitivity across the mice. Previous works have reported substantial interpopulation and intrapopulation differences in risk-sensitivity in humans which depend on gender, age, socioeconomic status, personality characteristics, wealth and culture [...]”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Relevance of the current modelling work to clinical conditions characterised by dysregulation of risk assesment (e.g. anxiety or PTSD).</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve added a paragraph to the discussion:</p><p>“Inter-individual differences in risk sensitivity are also of critical importance in psychiatry, reflected in a panoply of anxiety disorders (Butler and Mathews, 1983; Giorgetta et al., 2012; Maner et al., 2007; Charpentier et al., 2017), along with worry and rumination (Gagne and Dayan, 2022). Understanding the spectrum of extreme priors and extreme values of 𝛼 could have therapeutic implications, adding significance to the search for tasks that can more cleanly separate them.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Is it surprising to see differences in risk preference (nCVaR) between the familiar object and novel object condition, given that risk preference might be conceptualised as a trait rather than a state variable?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. You are right that we expected risk sensitivity (nCVaR alpha) to be the same between FONC and UONC animals on average. It is difficult to know if alpha is higher for FONC than UONC animals due to the non-identifiability between alpha and hazard priors. We have added this discussion to the paper:</p><p>“This is surprising if we interpret 𝛼 as a trait that is stable through time. Unfortunately, due to the non-identifiability between 𝛼 and hazard priors, we cannot verify whether 𝛼 is actually higher for FONC animals than UONC animals.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
