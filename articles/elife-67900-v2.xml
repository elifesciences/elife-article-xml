ciliogenesis. Previously, we showed that cholinergic interneurons of the dorsal striatum lose their cilia in R1441C LRRK2 mutant mice (Dhekne et al., 2018). Here, we show that cilia loss is seen as early as 10 weeks of age in these mice and also in two other mouse strains carrying the most common human G2019S LRRK2 mutation. Loss of the PPM1H phosphatase that is specific for LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab GTPases yields the same cilia loss phenotype seen in mice expressing pathogenic LRRK2 kinase, strongly supporting a connection between Rab GTPase phosphorylation and cilia loss. Moreover, astrocytes throughout the striatum show a ciliation defect in all LRRK2 and PPM1H mutant models examined. Hedgehog signaling requires cilia, and loss of cilia in LRRK2 mutant rodents correlates with dysregulation of Hedgehog signaling as monitored by in situ hybridization of <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Gdnf</italic> transcripts. Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra secrete a Hedgehog signal that is sensed in the striatum to trigger neuroprotection; our data support a model in which LRRK2 and PPM1H mutant mice show altered responses to critical Hedgehog signals in the nigrostriatal pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Rab GTPase</kwd><kwd>parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>LRRK2 kinase</kwd><kwd>primary cilia</kwd><kwd>nigro-striatal pathway</kwd><kwd>hedgehog signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000864</institution-id><institution>Michael J.

Reversal of LRRK2 phosphorylation is mediated at least in part by the PPM1H phosphatase that was recently discovered to specifically reverse LRRK2 action on multiple Rab GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berndsen et al., 2019</xref>). In cell culture, loss of PPM1H in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells phenocopies the loss of cilia seen upon expression of pathogenic LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berndsen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Rab GTPases are master regulators of protein trafficking and carry out their roles by binding to specific partner proteins when the Rabs are GTP-bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pfeffer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pfeffer, 2018</xref>). Phosphorylation of Rab proteins interferes with their abilities to be loaded with GTP by cognate guanine nucleotide exchange factors, a prerequisite for their binding to partner effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Steger et al., 2017</xref>). This alone would interfere with normal Rab GTPase function. Strikingly, once phosphorylated, Rab GTPases switch their preference and bind to new sets of phospho-specific protein effectors. For Rab8 and Rab10 these include RILPL1, RILPL2, JIP3, and JIP4 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Steger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhekne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waschbüsch et al., 2020</xref>) and Myosin Va (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhekne et al., 2021</xref>). The consequences of new phospho-Rab interactions include pathways by which LRRK2 blocks ciliogenesis in cell culture and mouse brain via a process that requires RILPL1 and Rab10 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Steger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhekne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sobu et al., 2021</xref>); centriolar cohesion is also altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Madero-Pérez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lara Ordónez et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although later stages of PD resemble those seen in Alzheimer’s disease, PD is first and foremost a movement disorder, and studies to understand it’s underlying causes must focus on understanding why PD is specifically characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra. LRRK2 is most highly expressed in immune cells, lung, kidney, and intestine, but it is also present in varying levels throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">West et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mandemakers et al., 2012</xref>). The striatum is comprised primarily of medium spiny neurons, interneurons and glial cells such as astrocytes. In an important study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 2012</xref> showed that dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra secrete Sonic Hedgehog (Hh) that is sensed by poorly abundant, cholinergic interneurons in the striatum. Hh is needed for the survival of both these cholinergic target cells and the Hh-producing dopaminergic neurons, despite the fact that only the cholinergic neurons express the PTCH1 Hh receptor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 2012</xref> showed further that Hh triggers secretion of glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) from the cholinergic neurons, which provides reciprocal neuroprotection for the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra.</p><p>We found previously that the rare, striatal, cholinergic interneurons that would normally sense Hh via their primary cilia are less ciliated in mice carrying the R1441C LRRK2 mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhekne et al., 2018</xref>). In that study, we proposed that cilia loss would decrease the ability of these cells to sense Hh signals. We show here that Hh signaling is indeed impacted by cilia loss in multiple LRRK2 mutant mouse models. Moreover, we show that striatal astrocytes share a broad ciliary deficit that likely impacts synaptic function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Primary cilia defects in striatal cholinergic interneurons of G2019S LRRK2 mice</title><p>We showed previously that cholinergic interneurons that represent about 5% of the neurons in the dorsal striatum of 7 month, R1441C LRRK2 knock-in (KI) mice have fewer primary cilia than their wild type littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhekne et al., 2018</xref>). G2019S LRRK2 is the most common PD-associated mutation in humans, thus it was also important to investigate ciliation in the brains of G2019S LRRK2 mice. G2019S LRRK2 is a hyperactive kinase but less active than R1441C LRRK2 when assayed in cell culture (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steger et al., 2016</xref>). The age of the mice was also important: mouse cilia lengthen with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arellano et al., 2012</xref>) and LRRK2 mutations are incompletely penetrant, making age an important variable in disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domingo and Klein, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Two different mouse lines were examined: 13 month C57BL/6 J mice carrying a genetic knock-in of human LRRK2 G2019S (hereafter referred to as G2019S LRRK2 KI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steger et al., 2016</xref>) and 10 month C57BL/6 J mice overexpressing a BAC transgene encoding human G2019S LRRK2 (hereafter referred to as G2019S LRRK2 BAC Tg; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to what we observed previously for 7 month R1441C LRRK2 mice, 13 month G2019S LRRK2 KI mice also displayed a significant loss of primary cilia in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) interneurons of the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). As before, primary cilia loss was cell-type specific as there was no difference in ciliation or cilia length in the surrounding cells (primarily medium spiny neurons) between mutant and wild-type groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For cholinergic neurons that retained cilia, we detected no significant difference in length between wild type and mutant groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Finally, GDNF represses Sonic Hedgehog production by dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 2012</xref>); this may explain the decrease in <italic>Gdnf</italic> transcripts in ciliated LRRK2 mutant cholinergic neurons relative to wild-type animals, in response to the increased GDNF production by neighboring, non-ciliated LRRK2 mutant cholinergic neurons. Similar analysis of the relative contribution of ciliated cells to <italic>Gli1</italic> transcription in R1441C striatum (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) was consistent with a similar trend of dysregulation in unciliated mutant neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Future experiments will seek to isolate these cells for single cell transcriptomic and/or proteomic analyses to determine the underlying basis for the differences observed for Hedgehog pathway components between ciliated and nonciliated mutant neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Phosphorylated Rab10 in astrocyte ciliogenesis</title><p>Our previous work in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and patient-derived iPS cells showed the importance of LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10 and its effector, RILPL1 in primary ciliogenesis blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhekne et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, the fact that PPM1H mutant animals phenocopy hyperactive LRRK2 kinase mutants strongly implicates Rab GTPase phosphorylation in the phenotypes observed. Unfortunately, it was not possible to detect pRab10 directly in mouse brain sections. To explore further the possible contribution of pRab10 to ciliogenesis blockade in astrocytes, we used immunopanning methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foo et al., 2011</xref>) to obtain primary, poorly dividing astrocytes from G2019S<sup>+/-</sup> LRRK2 rat brains.

In this study, we show that primary cilia loss is also seen in two distinct G2019S LRRK2 mouse models of the most common human LRRK2 mutation. Moreover, our study reveals that primary cilia loss in cholinergic interneurons can be detected as early as 10 weeks of age, the youngest age we examined. Thus, pathogenic LRRK2 activity causes interneuron primary cilia loss at a relatively early stage and loss is sustained throughout the animal’s lifespan for post-mitotic neurons. Consistent with this conclusion was our finding that mice deficient in the phospho-Rab-specific phosphatase, PPM1H, show the same ciliary defect as mice harboring a pathogenic LRRK2 mutation. This provides strong genetic evidence for the importance of LRRK2 activity in regulating cilia formation, in both LRRK2 wild-type/PPM1H-deficient and LRRK2 mutant animals.</p><p>Striatal cholinergic interneurons provide trophic support to dopaminergic neurons via Hh sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 2012</xref>), and primary cilia loss is predicted to perturb the ability of cholinergic neurons to sense Hh ligands as required for this role. Our FISH results support this model by showing that ciliated striatal ChAT<sup>+</sup> interneurons express <italic>Gli1</italic> transcripts under normal, physiologic conditions, and represent the cell type showing the greatest level of <italic>Gli1</italic> expression in the dorsal striatum. In the presence of the pathogenic R1441C LRRK2 mutation, we observed significant elevation of <italic>Gli1</italic> transcripts in the smaller number of remaining, ciliated, striatal cholinergic interneurons. One explanation for this increase in <italic>Gli1</italic> mRNA is that dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra upregulate Hh production due to stress or lack of GDNF signals from the striatum. Cortical neurons have been shown by others to require primary cilia to protect against stresses of ethanol- or ketamine-induced caspase activation and dendritic degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishii et al., 2021</xref>). Future experiments will seek to monitor changes in Hh production in the substantia nigra that may be associated with LRRK2 mutation.</p><p>It was previously reported that loss of Hedgehog production by dopaminergic neurons decreases <italic>Gdnf</italic> transcripts and protein levels in the striatum in an age-dependent manner, with a 10-fold mRNA decrease seen between 1 and 12 months and a 35% decrease in GDNF protein at 4 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 2012</xref>). These authors assayed the entire striatum; it is important to note that significant GDNF is produced in the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barroso-Chinea et al., 2005</xref>) and may account for some portion of the changes those authors observed. In our single-cell analyses of cells in the dorsal striatum, we did not detect a significant decrease in <italic>Gdnf</italic> transcripts at 5 months of age in LRRK2 G2019S striatal cholinergic neurons compared with age matched, wild-type controls. It will be important for us to analyze older mice as these showed a more significant change in the prior study, and to try to carry out GDNF protein analysis specifically in the dorsal striatum.</p><p>While transcription of the Hh target genes, <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Gdnf</italic> were entirely cilia-dependent in wild-type cholinergic neurons, this selectivity was lost in G2019S and R1441C animals, where unciliated cells showed a much higher contribution to total <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Gdnf</italic> transcript levels. Both of these genes are Gli3 repressor targets and one would have expected that the absence of a cilium would resemble a condition in which Gli3 repressor is high and target gene expression low. Future work will seek to clarify this unexpected dysregulation of the Hh signaling pathway.</p><p>L-dopa-induced dyskinesia is a debilitating side effect of dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson’s disease. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malave et al., 2021</xref> have shown that Smoothened activation in striatal cholinergic neurons protects mice from L-dopa-induced dyskinesia. These experiments highlight the importance of the Hedgehog signaling pathway for movement coordination regulated by the nigrostriatal circuit, and underscore the importance of studying the consequences of cilia loss associated with LRRK2 mutations since cilia are critical for Hedgehog signaling.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Loss of cilia in astrocytes</title><p>For the first time, we show that LRRK2 G2019S striatal astrocytes are also cilia-deficient at 5.5–13 months of age and Gli levels correlate with the presence of primary cilia. The data indicate that fewer striatal astrocytes in LRRK2 G2019S mice are capable of responding to Hh ligands and importantly, the remaining astrocytes that do respond do not compensate for general loss in ciliated cells. How might decreased Hh sensing by astrocytes impact the striatum? Striatal astrocytes functionally interact with distinct networks of medium spiny neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khakh and Deneen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martín et al., 2015</xref>), and loss of Hh sensing may perturb these interactions. This is relevant because imbalances in medium spiny neuron activity are known to contribute to the slowness and rigidity of movement that is symptomatic of Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhai et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref> recently reported altered organization of glutaminergic AMPA receptors in cultured striatal neurons from LRRK2 G2019S and R1441C mutant mice. This was accompanied by decreased frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents in brain slices. It is likely that LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation is in some way responsible for these changes; Rab phosphorylation could of course regulate the trafficking of AMPA receptors. It is also possible that in the brain, overall physiological changes are due to loss of cilia from the astrocytes that surround these neurons and support their overall physiology.</p><p>Decreased Hh signaling in astrocytes results in the reduction of Kir4.1 potassium channel expression in the cerebellum and neocortex and impairs turnover of dendritic spines, accompanied by an increase in neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farmer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill et al., 2019</xref>). Kir4.1 expression is markedly decreased in several neurological disorders (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scholl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inyushin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilliam et al., 2014</xref>), including in striatal cells of Huntington’s disease mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dvorzhak et al., 2016</xref>). Striatal astrocytes may use Kir4.1 channels to modulate medium spiny neuron synaptic transmission by local buffering of potassium ions, as was shown for other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Djukic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sibille et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, primary cilia loss from LRRK2 G2019S striatal astrocytes is likely to influence medium spinal neuron circuitry.</p><p>Two weeks of LRRK2 MLi-2 inhibitor administration failed to reverse cilia deficits in LRRK2 mutant animals. This may not be surprising as cilia are likely long-lived in post-mitotic neurons and non-reactive astrocytes. Very little is known about the dynamics of cilia in the adult brain; however, data from experiments in which a critical ciliary component, IFT88 was inducibly knocked out in adult brain indicated that 3 months was needed to see the consequences of loss of this ciliary factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowie and Goetz, 2020</xref>). Thus, it is possible that longer feeding regimens will reveal a recovery in striatal ciliation. Another puzzle is why pRab10 levels do not change as significantly as pRab12 and LRRK2 pS935 in immunoblots of whole brains of drug-treated animals. It is possible that in the brain, pRab10 is greatly stabilized by strong effector binding. It is important to remember that levels of pRab10 in the very small population of cholinergic neurons of the dorsal striatum may be of major consequence for Hedgehog signaling in the nigrostriatal circuit and MLi-2 sensitivity of pRab10 in these cells would be missed in whole brain immunoblots.</p><p>Altogether, these data demonstrate a profound effect of LRRK2 hyperactivation on primary ciliogenesis in a population of cholinergic interneurons that play a key role in motor function and in astrocytes that support medium spiny neuron function in the dorsal striatum. Dysregulation of Hedgehog signaling by cholinergic interneurons and astrocytes of the striatum may contribute to the loss of dopaminergic neurons associated with a disease of aging such as Parkinson’s disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter McPherson (Reviewer #2)</p><p>The manuscript has many strengths and the reviewers are generally quite positive but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. It would make the case a bit stronger if the authors could look at the transcript levels of GDNF from the same RNA samples they used to analyze Gli1.</p><p>2. The work is of immense importance and experiments were well performed. However, more clarification in the text would be required if not more experiments, on the possible effect(s) of elevated levels of Gli1 transcript in the striatum. Additional work would allow the authors to get a sense of whether/how the changes in Gli levels that they report for the ciliated vs non ciliated translate to changes at the population level for each of the cell types. The authors suggest how they think it works, but it would be nice to actually show it. For example do the cholinergic neurons overall have reduced Hh output despite the fact that the cells that remain ciliated increase their response? This seems important in terms of understanding what is happening at the tissue level.</p><p>3. Clarify the timing of the LRRK2 inhibitor experiments and why there was, and especially why there is not much of a change in Rab10 phosphorylation. Try to strengthen the link between Rab10 phosphorylation and reduced cilia.</p><p>In order to facilitate the revision, we have included all of the comments from the reviewers for a perspective but you should focus on the list above. We look forward to seeing your revised paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting follow-up to a paper recently published in <italic>eLife</italic> reporting the discovery of a phosphatase (PPM1H) that can remove phosphate from sites of modification in Rabs that are phosphorylated by LRRK2. This new work demonstrates that LRRK2 mutants are incapable of building cilia in cholinergic interneurons of the dorsal striatum. Interestingly, this phenotype is recapitulated in the PPM1H mouse mutant, clearly implicating LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of specific Rabs as critical for the formation/maintenance of cilia. As expected, this cilia phenotype correlates with a defect in hedgehog signaling in vivo. Because LRRK2 mutants have increased levels of Rab phosphorylation, as do PPM1H mutants, this data fits nicely with the idea that the status of Rab phosphorylation is having input on cilia.</p><p>The primary phenotypes observed reflect a reduction (generally ~50%) in cilia number for the various LRRK2 and PPM1H mutants examined in both interneurons and astrocytes. In cells that maintained cilia, the length of the cilia were largely unchanged. This raises the question about what is different among the cells that did and did not generate a cilia. But addressing this question is likely beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>Overall, the data as far as it goes is well presented and controlled. Replicate experiments are included at every stage, indicating the robustness of the results.</p><p>So in my view, this paper fits well into the Research Advances category in that it provides a strong indication that PPM1H functions biologically in the same pathway as LRRK2 mutation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This work builds on Dhekne et al., 2018, demonstrating decreased ciliation of cholinergic neurons in the striatum of LRRK2 R1441C mice. The findings cause the authors to speculate that such decreased ciliation phenotype might lead to a decrease in sonic hedgehog (Hh) response, which might further impact a neuro-protective circuit that supports dopaminergic neurons.</p><p>In this study, the authors provide evidence to support the idea of reduced Hh response and report the following important findings:</p><p>1) G2019S LRRK2 mice also show loss of cilia in striatal cholinergic interneurons. This finding was also supported by the data showing loss of primary cilia in the phospho-Rab-specific phosphatase, PPM1H deficient mice. As PPM1H specifically dephosphorylates LRRK2 substrates, collectively it strengthens the fact that the phenotype is caused by LRRK2 mutations (both R1441C and G2019S).</p><p>2) Although the number of cholinergic cells showing cilia are less, Gli1 transcripts were found to be elevated in those smaller number of cells. A similar pattern was noted in astrocytes. The authors suggest that the overall loss of ciliation due to the LRRK2 mutation will lead to an overall decrease in striatal astrocytic Hh response.</p><p>3) In addition, striatal astrocytes were cilia-deficient, leading to new hypotheses to be tested in future in terms of the current knowledge of how astrocytes support neurons with respect to Parkinson's model.</p><p>While this study tests an important idea of how defect in ciliogenesis could lead to dopaminergic neuron loss based on the current knowledge of circuits between dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and cholinergic interneurons in the striatum (Gonzalez-Reyes et al., (2012)), it has a missing component that should be addressed in order to establish this model:</p><p>It would be important to measure GDNF expression in the striatum. As the authors speculate that there is an overall decrease in Hh response due to less cilia, this statement will carry more weight if the authors show that there is an inhibition of GDNF expression. Ideally this would be done by measuring secreted GDNF. However, this may be technically very demanding. Alternatively, the authors could examine GDNF transcripts. Altered GDNF transcript/expression/release is more likely to cause damage to the dopaminergic neurons. As there is an elevated level of Gli1 transcripts in a smaller number of ciliated cells (cholinergic) in R1441C mice, it raises concerns about how much of DA loss might happen when there is an elevated level of Gli1. Addressing the question on GDNF could solve the issue.</p><p>It would really build the study if you could examine GDNF expression, as is done in figure 6B of the Gonzalez-Reyes et al., (2012) manuscript. I do understand if this is too technically demanding. Alternatively, one could examine GDNF transcripts.</p><p>Are there humans with PPM1H variants? NCBI's Clinvar database is a very good site to explore this.</p><p>&quot;Rab12 S105 phosphorylation also decreased in wild type (Figure 4C) and mutant (Figure 4A, B) brain (Figure 4). However, levels of pRab10 seemed unchanged (Figure 4A, B)&quot;. I don't really understand this seeming discrepancy. I just wonder if there is anything new that could be added.</p><p>Technical problems:</p><p>1) Line 65, Dhekne et al., 2021 should be 2018?</p><p>2) Figure 6 D, statistical significance is required. Or, the authors mean that there is an increasing trend but not statistically significant.</p><p>3) Figure 8 C, representative images would help if possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Khan et al., is a Research Advance to a publication from the group in 2018. The work provides confirmation that a more common variant associated with PD in humans also results in a similar reduction in cilia frequency in cholinergic interneurons in the striatum. This was noted in one figure of the 2018 paper for a mouse knockin of the R1441C variant of LRRK2. In the current work they use both a knockin and a BAC overexpression of another LRRK2 variant, G2019S, to assess further the impact of the LRRK2 mutations on cilia in the striatum. They examine the frequency of cilia in ChAT+ striatal interneurons and astrocytes in mice with two different PD-associated mutations, and they also investigate SHH signaling in these cells. While the paper is an interesting advance over the prior work, I think some additional experiments and clarifications are needed to improve the work prior to publication.</p><p>A strength of the paper is that it further builds upon the prior work of this group on the mechanisms by which LRRK2 activating mutations suppress cilia by extending their findings to specific neurons within the brain. They show that cilia and ciliary signaling in cholinergic interneurons and astrocytes are affected by activating mutations in LRRK2. This is an important step in building the connection between the activation of the kinase, ciliary defects, and the actual neurodegenerative outcomes in patients.</p><p>However, a weakness of the paper is that the conclusions with regard to both phosphorylation of Rab10 in this in vivo context and SHH signaling extend a bit beyond the data and these gaps should be addressed.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>The LRRK2 inhibitor experiment in the PPM1H<sup>+</sup>/- mice in Figure 5 is confusing- why is this done such a short time beforehand here when in other experiments in Figure 4 the animals were fed the inhibitor for 2 weeks. It's also confusing that the text says &quot;they strongly validate a link between LRRK2-Rab phosphorylation and ciliogenesis in specific brain cell types&quot;, however the inhibitor experiment doesn't show much change in RAB10 phosphorylation in the PPM1H mice +/- the inhibitor or even the PPM1H mice relative to WT. Some quantification here is necessary to better investigate these changes. And some work could also be done to better clarify the point the authors are trying to make here. More generally, the connection between Rab10 phosphorylation in vivo and the reduction in cilia frequency seems unclear. Is phosphorylation of RAB10 increased in the brain of the R1441C mice compared with WT? Only the knockin mice are shown, and I don't see this in the previous paper.</p><p>The Hh signaling data also needs some development and clarification. For the cholinergic neurons- are the overall levels of Gli1 affected?

It would make the case a bit stronger if the authors could look at the transcript levels of GDNF from the same RNA samples they used to analyze Gli1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. As requested, we have now used RNAscope fluorescence in situ hybridization to measure GDNF transcripts in cholinergic neurons from dorsal striatal tissue of 5-month old wild type and G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice (New Figure 8). Our results show that GDNF transcripts are restricted primarily to cholinergic neurons of the dorsal striatum. Moreover, we find that in wild type animals, most GDNF transcripts are detected in ciliated cells. At first glance this would indicate that cilia-deficient LRRK2 mutant neurons would produce fewer GDNF transcripts. Surprisingly, however, in G2019S mutant mice, we detect a much greater proportion of GDNF transcripts in <italic>unciliated</italic> striatal cholinergic neurons compared with wild type neurons consistent with Hedgehog signaling dysregulation. We fail to detect a decrease in total GDNF transcripts, but Hedgehog dysregulation is very clear and seen in the cholinergic neurons and not in adjacent astrocytes.</p><p>The GDNF gene is a target of the Gli3 repressor (at least in the limb bud). Our data indicate that in the absence of cilia, cells lose <italic>cilia-dependent</italic> Gli3-repression of GDNF expression in G2019S striatal CIN. In previous work, Kottmann and colleagues (Gonzalez-Reyes et al., (2012)) noted a strong age dependence of GDNF loss, with the biggest effect at 12 months. Also, in that study, both dorsal and ventral striatal tissue was analyzed--here we have carried out single cell analyses of dorsal striatum only. Future experiments will determine whether older LRRK2 mutant mice show a further decrease in GDNF expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The work is of immense importance and experiments were well performed. However, more clarification in the text would be required if not more experiments, on the possible effect(s) of elevated levels of Gli1 transcript in the striatum. Additional work would allow the authors to get a sense of whether/how the changes in Gli levels that they report for the ciliated vs non ciliated translate to changes at the population level for each of the cell types. The authors suggest how they think it works, but it would be nice to actually show it. For example do the cholinergic neurons overall have reduced Hh output despite the fact that the cells that remain ciliated increase their response? This seems important in terms of understanding what is happening at the tissue level.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers ask us to clarify the consequences of changes in ciliary Hh signaling, and we agree this is important. In our new analyses, we quantify the contribution of ciliated and non ciliated cells to both total Gli1 and GDNF transcript production. Re-analysis of our data indicates that similar to what we see for GDNF, Gli1 response is strongly cilia dependent in wild type neurons but less cilia-dependent overall in mutant neurons. This is likely due to the same loss of cilia-dependent Gli3 repression seen for GDNF (point #1 above).</p><p>Interestingly we see a neuron-specific dysregulation that is not seen in adjacent astrocytes that retain cilia-dependent Gli1 responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Clarify the timing of the LRRK2 inhibitor experiments and why there was, and especially why there is not much of a change in Rab10 phosphorylation. Try to strengthen the link between Rab10 phosphorylation and reduced cilia.</p></disp-quote><p>Part of the reason it is hard to see decreases in Rab10 phosphorylation in brain is that there is very little unless one looks in PPM1H homozygous knock out brains (now shown in this revision). Four other reports have seen the same effect of apparent insensitivity of brain pRab10 to MLi treatment. The whole brain was analyzed by western blot and remember that the cholinergic interneurons that we study in the striatum represent only ~5% of the total cells present in that region; pRab10 changes or sensitivity to MLi-2 in that region cannot yet be monitored. Thus, current methods make it impossible to provide a direct connection between Rab phosphorylation and ciliation in cholinergic interneurons of the dorsal striatum. HOWEVER, this is why analysis of Rab-specific PPM1H phosphatase knockouts is so important--these animals phenocopy activating LRRK2 mutations, strongly supporting the idea that Rab phosphorylation is playing a critical role. In primary cultured astrocytes we see a clear correlation and this is also true for every other cell type analyzed. Future work will try to carry out mass spec determinations of pRab10 in small numbers of isolated, cholinergic striatal neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In order to facilitate the revision, we have included all of the comments from the reviewers for a perspective but you should focus on the list above. We look forward to seeing your revised paper.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>While this study tests an important idea of how defect in ciliogenesis could lead to dopaminergic neuron loss based on the current knowledge of circuits between dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and cholinergic interneurons in the striatum (Gonzalez-Reyes et al., (2012)), it has a missing component that should be addressed in order to establish this model:</p><p>It would be important to measure GDNF expression in the striatum. As the authors speculate that there is an overall decrease in Hh response due to less cilia, this statement will carry more weight if the authors show that there is an inhibition of GDNF expression. Ideally this would be done by measuring secreted GDNF. However, this may be technically very demanding. Alternatively, the authors could examine GDNF transcripts. Altered GDNF transcript/expression/release is more likely to cause damage to the dopaminergic neurons. As there is an elevated level of Gli1 transcripts in a smaller number of ciliated cells (cholinergic) in R1441C mice, it raises concerns about how much of DA loss might happen when there is an elevated level of Gli1. Addressing the question on GDNF could solve the issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We fail to detect loss of total GDNF transcripts in 5 month G2019S striatal cholinergic neurons but we see a shift in GDNF expression to non-ciliated cells, likely due to loss of cilia-dependent Gli3 repression of GDNF transcription (see above). Future experiments will explore this further in older animals that we do not currently have access to.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would really build the study if you could examine GDNF expression, as is done in figure 6B of the Gonzalez-Reyes et al., (2012) manuscript. I do understand if this is too technically demanding. Alternatively, one could examine GDNF transcripts.</p></disp-quote><p>Note that the Gonzalez-Reyes study measured TOTAL striatal GDNF and the ventral striatum contributes significantly to this. We did try transcript detection and only see dysregulation in the mice available to us for this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there humans with PPM1H variants? NCBI's Clinvar database is a very good site to explore this.</p></disp-quote><p>At present we are not aware of any PD patients with PPM1H mutations. There are patients with PPM1M mutations, and we are exploring this further. Lack of mutation could be due to functional redundancy or embryonic lethality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Rab12 S105 phosphorylation also decreased in wild type (Figure 4C) and mutant (Figure 4A,B) brain (Figure 4). However, levels of pRab10 seemed unchanged (Figure 4A,B)&quot;. I don't really understand this seeming discrepancy. I just wonder if there is anything new that could be added.</p></disp-quote><p>Several other groups have also reported this (cited above). Remember that cilia are completely normal in many brain regions and changes in pRab10 in the rare cholinergic neurons of the dorsal striatum would not be detected in a whole brain western blot. Sadly we cannot yet stain the cells directly as the phosphoRab10 antibody doesn’t work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Technical problems:</p><p>1) Line 65, Dhekne et al., 2021 should be 2018?</p></disp-quote><p>2021 is the correct reference that we forgot to include in the ref. List. Thanks for catching this!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 6 D, statistical significance is required. Or, the authors mean that there is an increasing trend but not statistically significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We mean there is an increasing trend--Gli1 signal is only 1 or 2 dots and the animal to animal variability adds to our challenge at reaching significance. We have corrected the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 8 C, representative images would help if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>Representative images were presented in (old) Figure 8A but we added many more as requested (New Figure 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Major points:</p><p>The LRRK2 inhibitor experiment in the PPM1H<sup>+</sup>/- mice in Figure 5 is confusing- why is this done such a short time beforehand here when in other experiments in Figure 4 the animals were fed the inhibitor for 2 weeks.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion. We do not have large numbers of mutant animals. We were not able to feed the PPM1H mutant mice for two weeks with inhibitor; the two hour feeding was used to validate the pRab10 staining and the blots serve to document the genotypes. PPM1H<sup>-/-</sup> mutant animals (now added here) have higher levels of pRab10 than LRRK2 mutant tissues and in this case we do see MLi-2 sensitivity at 2 hours in whole brain. This is now a supplemental figure and we have clarified the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's also confusing that the text says &quot;they strongly validate a link between LRRK2-Rab phosphorylation and ciliogenesis in specific brain cell types&quot;, however the inhibitor experiment doesn't show much change in RAB10 phosphorylation in the PPM1H mice +/- the inhibitor or even the PPM1H mice relative to WT.</p></disp-quote><p>The text refers to the single cell phenotype analysis that is not captured in a whole brain western blot. The statement is based on PPM1H specificity for Rab GTPases changing ciliation in a rare neuronal subpopulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some quantification here is necessary to better investigate these changes. And some work could also be done to better clarify the point the authors are trying to make here. More generally, the connection between Rab10 phosphorylation in vivo and the reduction in cilia frequency seems unclear. Is phosphorylation of RAB10 increased in the brain of the R1441C mice compared with WT? Only the knockin mice are shown, and I don't see this in the previous paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see discussion above. Whole brain was analyzed by western blot and remember that the cholinergic interneurons that we study in the striatum represent only ~5% of the total cells present in that region; pRab10 changes specifically in those cells cannot yet be monitored. Thus, current reagents make it impossible to provide a direct connection between Rab phosphorylation and ciliation in the cholinergic neurons of the striatum. However, in primary cultured astrocytes we see a clear correlation and this is also true for every other cultured cell type analyzed including patient derived G2019S IPs cells. Future work will try to carry out mass spec determinations of pRab10 in small numbers of cholinergic striatal neurons. That a Rab-specific phosphatase mutant has the same cilia loss phenotype as the hyperactive kinase supports the involvement of a phosphoRab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Hh signaling data also needs some development and clarification.
