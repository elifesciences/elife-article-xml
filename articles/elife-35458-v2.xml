activities in live cells. Investigating the interaction between signaling networks has become increasingly important to understanding complex cellular phenomena, necessitating an update of the biosensor toolkit to allow monitoring and perturbing multiple activities simultaneously in the same cell. We therefore developed a new class of fluorescent biosensors based on homo-FRET, deemed FLuorescence Anisotropy REporters (FLAREs), which combine the multiplexing ability of single-color sensors with a quantitative, ratiometric readout. Using an array of color variants, we were able to demonstrate multiplexed imaging of three activity reporters simultaneously in the same cell. We further demonstrate the compatibility of FLAREs for use with optogenetic tools as well as intravital two-photon imaging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>polarization</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>fluorescent proteins</kwd><kwd>anisotropy</kwd><kwd>kinases</kwd><kwd>second messengers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 CA197622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK073368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH111516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK077140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizzo</surname><given-names>Megan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL122827</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizzo</surname><given-names>Megan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH111527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizzo</surname><given-names>Megan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel panel of homoFRET biosensors that detect kinase and second messenger activity, called FLAREs, enables multiparameter imaging of signaling activities within a single live cell with a quantitative and ratiometric readout.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetically encoded biosensors have revolutionized the study of cell signaling by allowing the real-time monitoring of signaling activities, such as enzymatic activity or the release of second messengers, in live cells. They are therefore critical tools for uncovering the precise spatial and temporal regulation of signal transduction cascades. These biosensors can be divided into two broad classes: single-color and ratiometric. Single-color sensors, with an intensiometric activity readout, only occupy a single-color channel, allowing for more flexibility in multiplexed imaging experiments. However, they are sensitive to variations in probe concentration caused by changing expression levels or cell shape, as well as differences in imaging conditions, such as illumination intensity and focus. On the other hand, sensors with a ratiometric readout, such as those based on FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), cancel out many of these variations, enabling quantitative measurements of second messenger concentrations and better comparisons between experiments. However, the requirement for two distinct color channels limits their application in multiplexed imaging.</p><p>We therefore aimed to develop sensors that only occupy a single channel while still cancelling out the effects of varying imaging conditions and probe concentrations. Hence, rather than using the emission ratio between the FRET and donor channels, we instead used the loss of polarization of emitted light as a readout for FRET between two fluorescent proteins (FPs). Because this approach does not require the donor and acceptor to have distinct emission wavelengths, it can be used for either hetero-FRET (e.g. between different chromophores) or homo-FRET (e.g. between identical chromophores). Homo-FRET measurements have been useful for detecting protein clustering and protein oligomerization in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bader et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gautier et al., 2001</xref>), but only recently has the possibility of using homo-FRET in biosensor designs been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Warren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cameron et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we describe the development of a panel of single-color, genetically encodable biosensors based on homo-FRET for detecting kinase activity and second messenger dynamics. We call these sensors FLuorescence Anisotropy REporters, or FLAREs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To create our FLARE probes, we adapted existing FRET-based biosensors for homo-FRET measurements by replacing the traditional FRET pair with two FPs of the same color. The resulting biosensors include a molecular switch, which changes conformation in the presence of a particular biochemical activity, flanked by two spectrally similar FPs at the N- and C-termini. Changes in the conformation of the molecular switch, and thus the biochemical activities under study, are then monitored by observing the fluorescence anisotropy of the sensor using fluorescence polarization microscopy, with increased anisotropy corresponding to a lower-FRET state of the sensor, similar to the effect of increasing the intramolecular distance between the FRET pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To develop a Protein Kinase A (PKA) activity FLARE, the molecular switch from A Kinase Activity Reporter 4 (AKAR4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Depry et al., 2011</xref>), composed of an FHA1 domain and PKA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), was flanked between two FPs of the same color. The FHA1 domain binds to the PKA substrate when the latter is phosphorylated, altering the conformation of the molecular switch and leading to a change in FRET between the flanking homo-FRET pair. To test the effect of FP circular permutation on these biosensors, we developed two FLARE-AKAR variants based on the yellow FP mVenus: one in which the C-terminal FP was circularly permuted at position 172 (cp172Venus), consistent with the hetero-FRET AKAR4 sensor, and one without circular permutation. We expressed mVenus-cp172Venus FLARE-AKAR in HEK293T cells and captured a time-course using fluorescence polarization microscopy. Following PKA activation using a cocktail of 50 Î¼M forskolin (Fsk), an adenylyl cyclase activator, and 100 Î¼M 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a general phosphodiesterase inhibitor, the anisotropy decreased from 0.29Â Â±Â 0.003 to 0.26Â Â±Â 0.003, a decrease of 0.028Â Â±Â 0.001 (NÂ =Â 44, biological replicates, unpaired, two-tailed t-test, p&lt;0.0001), with the kinetics of the decrease matching those observed with AKAR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2a</xref>).

We observed a slight positive correlation between intensity and anisotropy change for Venus-cp172Venus FLARE AKAR; however, the expression level does not significantly impact the reporting ability of these sensors in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3a</xref>). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of Venus-cp172Venus FLARE-AKAR was calculated to be 32 by dividing the magnitude of the anisotropy change upon maximal PKA stimulation by the standard deviation of the baseline before stimulation.</p><p>Subsequent control experiments confirmed that this change in anisotropy is caused by a change in the FRET state due to the conformational change of the sensor upon stimulation of PKA activity. PKA inhibition using 20 Î¼M H-89 led to an immediate slope change and increase in anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). On the other hand, a mutant version of the biosensor with a threonine-to-alanine (T-to-A) mutation at the phosphorylation site showed no change in anisotropy upon PKA stimulation with Fsk/IBMX or inhibition with H-89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2b</xref>), suggesting that the observed changes in anisotropy were due to phosphorylation of the PKA substrate. Furthermore, isoproterenol, a Î²-adrenergic agonist, induced FLARE-AKAR responses in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). To further demonstrate that the change in anisotropy upon PKA stimulation was due to a change in FRET, we mutated the chromophore of the C-terminal cp172Venus in Venus-cp172Venus FLARE AKAR from GYG to GGG. We observed that the magnitude of the response to Fsk/IBMX decreased to approximately one-third of that of the wild-type sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). The remaining response was likely due to intermolecular FRET that occurs when the FHA1 domain of one molecule binds to the phosphorylated PKA substrate in an adjacent molecule.</p><p>In addition to the yellow sensors, we developed a panel of color variants of FLARE-AKAR, including EGFP-EGFP, mCherry-mCherry, mCerulean3-mCerulean3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Markwardt et al., 2011</xref>), and mCerulean3-cp173Cerulean3 versions. All these variants exhibited a decrease in anisotropy in cells treated with Fsk/IBMX; however, the magnitude of the anisotropy decrease depended on the choice of FP, with the mVenus-cp172Venus variant having the largest response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). As with the Venus variants, the Cerulean3-based FLARE-AKAR showed an increased dynamic range with a circularlyÂ permutated fluorescent protein at the C-terminal position. mCherry-mCherry FLARE-AKAR, being spectrally shifted from the AKAR4 heteroFRET sensor allowed for direct comparison of FLARE and heteroFRET sensors within the same cell. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref>, changes in anisotropy in mCherry-mCherry FLARE-AKAR corresponded with the changes in normalized emission ratio in AKAR4, with similar kinetics.</p><p>We furthermore demonstrated the ability of FLARE-AKAR sensors to monitor kinase activity at particular subcellular compartments. By fusing Venus-cp172Venus FLARE-AKAR to targeting motifs from Lyn kinase and DAKAP1, we were able to detect PKA activity at the plasma membrane and outer mitochondrial membrane, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>). Moreover, we used untargeted FLARE sensors to detect differential PKA activity dynamics in different compartments; diffusable Venus-cp172Venus FLARE AKAR in HeLa showed that PKA activity has slower kinetics and a lower magnitude in the nucleus than the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1âfigure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>To demonstrate the generalizability of FLAREs, we developed a family of single-color kinase activity or activation reporters in various colors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To construct a single-color Erk activity biosensor, we replaced the PKA sensor domain from Venus-cp172Venus FLARE-AKAR with the sensor domain from EKAR-EV, composed of a WW domain (PAABD), a flexible EV linker, and an Erk substrate peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harvey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vandame et al., 2014</xref>). When expressed in HEK293T cells, Venus-cp172Venus FLARE-EKAR-EV exhibited a decrease in anisotropy of 0.02Â Â±Â 0.001 (NÂ =Â 13) after treatment with 100 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) to activate the MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This response was reversed upon MEK inhibition using 20 Î¼M U0126, and no change in anisotropy was observed with a T-to-A mutant sensor. Likewise, we developed a panel of PKC activity reporters, called FLARE-CKARs, by flanking a PKC sensor domain composed of an FHA1 domain and a PKC substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herbst et al., 2011</xref>) from a CKAR2 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>) with mVenus-cp172Venus. We observed an anisotropy decrease of 0.02Â Â±Â 0.001 (NÂ =Â 26) upon activation of PKC with 100 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). For both FLARE-EKAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and FLARE CKAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>), we likewise repeated this process for various color variants, and like the FLARE-AKARs, the sensors based on mVenus exhibited the largest responses. Furthermore, a myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) sensor was converted to a FLARE by exchanging the cyan FP for mVenus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Isotani et al., 2004</xref>). Calmodulin (CaM) association with the MLCK-CaM binding domain in between the FPs decreases FRET, leading to an increase in fluorescence anisotropy upon forced calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) entry with 30 mM KCl (NÂ =Â 13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35458.012</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A panel of kinase activity and activation biosensors.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>)Â Domain structure of FLARE-EKAR-EV (above).

We further demonstrated the ability of Venus-cp172Venus FLARE Cameleon to detect submaximal responses by monitoring calcium transients in histamine-stimulated HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). In order to determine the dissociation constant and Hill coefficients, we purified Venus-cp172Venus Cameleon and measured the fluorescence anisotropy in solutions of known free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at different temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The resulting parameters are in good agreement with other Cameleon sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nagai et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, we developed another calcium FLARE sensor, based on D1-ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Palmer et al., 2004</xref>), with a sensitivity appropriate for calcium monitoring in the ER. The anisotropy decreases upon increasing calcium concentration and increases when calcium is depleted from the ER upon treatment with thapsigargin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). In addition to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we developed a FLARE to detect intracellular cAMP based on the ICUE family of sensors, in which a conformational change in a truncated form ofÂ the cAMP effector Epac leads to a decrease in FRET efficiency in the presence of cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DiPilato and Zhang, 2009b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

For example, mCer3-mCer3 FLARE Cameleon, co-imaged with other FLARE sensors in HeLa cells, can detect calcium responses to physiologically relevant stimulation conditions, such as histamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, when mCer3-mCer3 FLARE AKAR was co-imaged with Venus-cp172Venus cameleon in HEK293T cells, activation of the Î²-adrenergic with isoproterenol led to a transient decrease in anisotropy in the cyan-channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, we used FLAREs to study the cAMP-Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillatory circuit in pancreatic Î²-cells. MIN6 Î²-cells were transiently transfected with Venus-cp172Venus FLARE-ICUE and mCerulean3-mCerulean3 FLARE-Cameleon to simultaneously monitor cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ï»¿dynamics, respectively (NÂ =Â 19). We observed clear fluorescence anisotropy oscillations in both channels following stimulation with 20 mM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

These data demonstrate that even the lowerÂ signal mCerulean3-based FLARE sensors can be used under sub-maximal and physiologically relevant stimulation conditions in multiplexed imaging experiments.</p><p>In addition to multiplexed biosensor imaging, the fact that FLARE sensors occupy only a single color channel also permits simultaneously perturbing and monitoring biochemical activities using optogenetics and FLAREs, respectively.

Exclusive excitation of mVenus (855 nm) or mCherry (1200 nm) was verified by imaging capillary tubes filled with recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Plasmids encoding Venus-cp172Venus FLARE-Cameleon and mCherry FLARE-AKAR sensors were electroporated into the flexor digitorum brevis muscle of a live mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DiFranco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kerr et al., 2015</xref>). Administration of an electrical current stimulated a rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, as indicated by a decrease in FLARE-Cameleon anisotropy, independent of changes in FLARE-AKAR anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Activation of AKAR was then induced by intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol (0.5 mg/kg). Thus, FLAREs enable in vivo multiparametric biosensor measurements.</p><p>We have demonstrated that FLAREs are a highly generalizable, accessible platform for creating single-color sensors to detect biochemical activities in individual cells in real time. Their ratiometric readout allows for fluctuations in light intensity and probe concentration to be cancelled out, permitting quantitative measurements of intracellular concentrations. We showed that these sensors have an SNR of 3â32 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and a dynamic range comparable with first-generation FRET sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Newman and Zhang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Future development and optimization should further enhance their performance. We demonstrated that current FLAREs are already useful for multiplexed imaging applications. They can also be used in conjunction with optogenetic tools to enable all-optical interrogation of cellular regulation, and for intravital two-photon imaging to facilitate studies in tissues and living animals. FLAREs, by allowing researchers to monitor multiple activities within the same cell, as well as to both monitor and optogenetically perturb activities in the same cell, could be used to study the how the spatiotemporal regulation of biochemical activities in highly integrated pathways allows a small number of signals to produce diverse cellular behaviors.</p><table-wrap id="table1"

performed using the pRSET-B vector using typical molecular cloning methods using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs), restriction enzyme digestion, and ligation with T4 DNA ligase. To clone Venus-cp172Venus FLARE, AKAR4 was sub-cloned from a modified pCDNA3 to pRSET-B between the BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites. mVenus was then PCR amplified with primers encoding a BamHI site at the 5â end and an SphI site at the 3â end, and the resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and SphI and ligated to pRSET-B AKAR4 digested with BamHI and SphI, with the mCerulean gene removed. Venus-cp172Venus FLARE AKAR was then sub-cloned back into a modified pCDNA3 vector using the BamHI and EcoRI sites. Other color variants were created by replacing the genes for the fluorescent proteins in other FLARE AKAR variants in pRSET-B, either between the BamHI and SphI sites for the N-terminal fluorescent protein, or SacI and EcoRI for C-terminal fluorescent proteins. Finalized constructs intended for mammalian expression were then sub-cloned into a modified pcDNA3 expression vector between the BamHI and EcoRI sites. FLARE variants of other sensors were created by amplifying the molecular switch from EKAR-EV, CKAR2, Cameleon and ICUE3 with primers encoding the SphI and SacI sites, digesting the PCR product with SphI and SacI enzymes, and ligating them to the relevant pRSET-B FLARE AKAR plasmid digested with SphI and SacI to remove the domains involved in the molecular switch for FLARE AKAR. The final constructs were then subcloned into a modified pCDNA3 expression vector between the BamHI and EcoRI sites. Targeted versions of the sensors were created either by PCR amplifying the sensor with primers containing the targeting sequence and ligating it to the pCDNA3 expression vector between BamHI and EcoRI, or by subcloning the construct into a plasmid already containing the targeting sequence. N-terminal targeting sequences were placed between HindIII and EcoRI, and C-terminal targeting sequences between EcoRI and XbaI. All cloning steps were performed using DH5Î± strain of <italic>E. coli.</italic></p><p>The threonine to alanine mutants for Venus-cp172Venus FLARE AKAR and FLARE EKAR were created by performing site-directed mutagenesis using a standard single-primer PCR-based protocol. The threonine to alanine mutant for Venus-cp172Venus FLARE CKAR, as well as the chromophore-dead variant of Venus-cp172Venus FLARE AKAR, was created using Gibson assembly, amplifying the appropriate fragment with a primer containing the desired mutation.</p><p>The YFP MLCK FLARE sensor was created by replacing the CFP portion of an existing two color sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Isotani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geguchadze et al., 2004</xref>) with a PCR amplified mVenus fragment flanked by XhoI and AgeI restriction sites. Moreover, the coding sequence for the CFP D1 ER sequence was manufactured by Genewiz. The sensor consists of two oxmCer3 proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26158227">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26158227</ext-link>) flanking the D1 ER calcium sensing domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Palmer et al., 2004</xref>) and a C-terminal KDEL ER retention sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HEK293T and HeLa cells cells were maintained using Dulbeccoâs Modified Eagleâs Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were seeded onto a 35-mm glass-bottom imaging dish and incubated at 37Â°C with 5% ambient carbon dioxide. HEK293T, HeLa, MIN6, and REF-52 cell lines were maintained separately from other cells and were screened regularly to confirm the absence of mycoplasma contamination using Hoechst staining. As the origin of the cells was not central to the nature of these experiments, we did not further validate the identity of the cell lines. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), Polyjet (SignaGen), or calcium phosphate and incubated for 12â48 hr before imaging. The growth media was removed immediately before imaging, and the cells were washed two or more times with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) buffer with glucose at room temperature. The cells were imaged in HBSS buffer with glucose at either room temperature or 37Â°C.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Fluorescence polarization microscopy</title><p>Widefield images were collected using an Zeiss AxioObserver equipped for fluorescence polarization microscopy, using one of two setups. In the first setup, a wire grid polarizer (Meadowlark Optics) was placed in the excitation pathway between the LED illuminators and reflector turret containing filter cubes specific for CFP (Zeiss), YFP (Zeiss), and mCherry (Semrock). Images were generally collected using a 20Â ÃÂ 0.75 NA objective lens. Polarizations parallel and perpendicular to the excitation polarizations were separated using Optical Insights Dual-View using their polarization splitting module. Both images were simultaneously collected in a single image collected by a water-cooled Orca-R2 (Hamamatsu). In the second setup, a polarizer (Chroma) was placed in the excitation pathway between the xenon arclamp and the excitation filters. Images were collected using a 20Â ÃÂ 0.45 NA objective lens. Polarizations were separated using an Opto-Split II LS image splitter, with two wire grid polarizers (Meadowlark) oriented parallel and perpendicular to the excitation polarizer. Images of both polarizations were collected using a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 sCMOS camera. Two-photon imaging was performed using a Zeiss 7 MP with GaAsP non-descanned detectors housed at the University of Maryland School of Medicine confocal facility. Coherent Chameleon and OPO lasers were used for excitation. Fluorescence was filtered using an ET680 short pass filter for two-photon microscopy (Chroma) prior to separating polarizations with a one inch broadband polarizing beamsplitter cube (Thorlabs) mounted using a custom 3D printed cube. Images were collected using a 10Ã, 0.3 NA Plan-apochromat objective lens. In vivo imaging was performed on C57Bl/6 mice under isoflurane anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Image analysis was performed using Fiji (ImageJ) open-source image processing software. Polarization images were cropped and aligned using either the Zeiss Axiovision software or Fijiâs built-in StackReg registration plugin. In Fiji, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around each cell, as well as one in the background. ROI intensities were background subtracted in each channel to estimate fluorescence emission intensity, and anisotropy was calculated as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lakowicz (2010</xref>). Anisotropies were calculated using the conventional equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geguchadze et al., 2004</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>g</italic> is the correction factor that accounts for differences in polarization transmission efficiencies within the instrument. The g-factor was calculated using an isotropic fluorescein solution as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Piston and Rizzo (2008</xref>). Anisotropy was calculated by subtracting the anisotropy at each time point by the anisotropy at the time point right before drug addition. The magnitude of the anisotropy changes were calculated by taking the difference between the average anisotropy when the signal peaked or plateaued and the average anisotropy of the baseline time points before drug was added.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Protein purification</title><p>Purification of the FLARE-Cameleon sensors was done using the BL21-RIL Codon Plus strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>, which were transformed with the construct cloned in the pRSET-B vector, with a Poly-His tag in the header sequence to allow for metal ion binding. The cells were grown to an OD of 0.2, when expression was induced with IPTG and allowed to grow overnight. The cells were then pelleted, frozen, resuspended, and lysed by sonication. Protein purification was performed using column chromatography with Ni-NTA resin. Fractions were collected and analyzed using SDS-PAGE; fractions showing sufficiently pure protein product were pooled.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>In vitro calcium calibration</title><p>In vitro calibration of the FLARE-Cameleon sensor was performed using fluorescence anisotropy spectroscopy in solutions with varying concentrations of free calcium in a temperature-controlled environment. These solutions were made by titrating known concentrations of free EGTA and calcium-saturated EGTA at pH 7.1 (Calcium Concentration Kit #1--Thermo Scientific). The fluorescence anisotropy was measured using a Photon Technology International QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer equipped with a Xenon flash lamp, fluorescence polarizers, and a Peltier cuvette holder for temperature control. Anisotropies were calculated using integrated intensities of S- and P-polarized emission spectra. The correction factor G was measured by measuring the P- and S-polarized emission spectra of fluorescein, which is assumed to be isotropic, and taking the ratio of their measured integrated fluorescence intensities. To determine the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) and Hill coefficient (n), the anisotropy vs. calcium concentration data were fit to the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge Sohum Mehta for his help in creation of graphics as well as critical reading of the manuscript.

If a new manuscript is submitted that addresses the point in the future, we will be happy to consult the same reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors re-engineer a number of classic FRET-based biosensors (PKA, ERK, PKC, MLCK, calcium, cAMP) biosensors using single color FPs that perform homo FRET, and that can be measured using fluorescence anisotropy measurements. Since each biosensor is based on only one color, this allows for multiplexed biosensor measurements in single living cells. It also allows to perform biosensor measurements in response to optogenetic activation. Finally, the authors perform some in vivo fluorescence anisotropy measurements using 2-photon microscopy.</p><p>The data somehow implies that a combination of mVenus and a cp mutant of Venus cp172-mVenus is the best pair for performing such anisoptropy measurements. It looks like that other pairs involving other color FPs perform much poorly. The authors propose that this can be a generalizable method to perform multiplexed imaging of multiple signaling activities in single living cells. While I like the concept, I think that the method might not be so easy to implement than as proposed. Multiplexed imaging has been performed using experiments that induce very robust signaling states. The poorest performing FP combination has been grafted on a calcium sensor that is known to be one of the most robust signaling modules available. The question is therefore if the approach has the full potential that the authors propose. This detracts my enthusiasm for the manuscript, and I do not think it is publishable in the present form.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1) Throughout the paper, the authors analyse multiple cells for each respective experiment. Could the authors please show a representation of all of these curves with median, stdev, and accompanying statistics. That would really help the reader to get a sense of the robustness of the biosensor responses.</p><p>2) It would be helpful if the authors would calculate the SNR for all the biosensors, as they have performed for their AKAR-FLARE sensor. With 1. This would again give an idea about the robustness of the sensor.</p><p>3) The FLARE-EKAR EV sensor in Figure 2A displays sustained ERK activity in response to EGF stimulation, and is then switched off using a MEK inhibitor. This is contrary to another EKAR variant, EKAR2G, that displays a very transient ERK activity in the same HEK293T cells (PMID:23882122). Importantly, this is backed up with a phosphoERK western blot in this paper. What happens with this FLARE EKAR-EV version. Do the new FPs somehow influence the biosensor response, or is this due to the specific HEK293T cells/ experimental conditions used by the authors?</p><p>4) Figure 4A: from 9 cells, the authors imply that there are two dynamic signaling states in that experiment. I think that if they want to make a statement about something like this, they need to acquire much more cells, and avoid showing anecdotal data.</p><p>5) I think that one of the weaknesses of the paper is that they remain elusive about the microscopy setup, and the image analysis of the datasets. Obviously, all this information is published elsewhere. But this being a technology resource paper, I think that it would really make sense to discuss this in detail both of these aspects to make the reader more familiar with this imaging technology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study of molecular dynamics in single cells has revealed unexpected complexity, only tractable by multiplexing molecular biosensors. Ross, et al. explore the use of fluorescence anisotropy to measure conformational changes in genetically encoded biosensors using a single color per sensor. The authors successfully use ratiometric measurements of polarized fluorescence to enable quantification of previously described FRET reporters. This is a very exciting idea as it could substantially increase multiplexing capabilities in single cells. The authors validate the use of FLAREs in a variety of individual sensors, multiplexed with optogenetic tools and in vivo. Although I find the concept and validation of great interest, the characterization of intramolecular fluorescence anisotropy and comparison to current methods is limited.</p><p>1) The authors should explore the use of fluorescence anisotropy to measure subcellular changes in activity. One of the advantages of FRET sensors is the ability to measure spatially restricted changes in protein activity (within cell compartments), however, the paper does not address whether local activities can be monitored also by fluorescence anisotropy. In fact, given the single color nature of FLAREs, single cell comparisons of FRET vs FLARE should be possible and helpful to define how these technologies compare quantitatively.</p><p>2) The novelty of this study relies on the use of intramolecular fluorescence anisotropy to measure conformational changes. However, the relationship between intramolecular distance (or orientation) and anisotropy is not explored. These experiments could be done by using linkers of different lengths or known proteins with different structures. In my opinion, a more thorough characterization of the parameters that affect intramolecular anisotropy is needed to understand the full spectrum of limitations and possibilities of this method.</p><p>3) The authors find that a circularly permutated Venus together with wt Venus is better at changing anisotropy, but then, the comparison to other FPs is done without any circular permutation. It is not clear, from the manuscript, what are the reasons for such comparison. If circular permutation affects anisotropy, other FPs should also be permuted.</p><p>4) Most experiments to test the reporting abilities of the sensor are done under chemical perturbation with chemicals that create non physiological states (i.e. Fsk, Ionomycin, PMA). To determine whether the reporting range of the sensor is appropriate for &quot;real&quot; conditions, a dose-response under physiological stimulation compared to other sensors should be done.</p><p>5) The choice of fluorescent proteins in the dual sensor experiment provided in Figure 4B is unfortunate. Venus and Cerulean3 are a FRET pair. This could be confusing the interpretation of the results. Using the Cherry version in one of the two sensors would be a more appropriate choice.</p><p>Overall, this study offers a novel strategy to enhance multiplexing capabilities when measuring single cell dynamics. Although the authors show multiple proof-of-principle experiments, the quantitative description of the parameters that affect intramolecular anisotropy and how it compares to FRET is poorly explored. Thus, I would encourage resubmission when these issues are addressed.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;FLAREs: Single-color, ratiometric biosensors for detecting signaling activities&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors re-engineered a number of classic FRET-based biosensors (PKA,ERK, PKC, MLCK, calcium, cAMP) using single color FP pairs that can perform homo FRET, which can be measured using fluorescence anisotropy measurements. Since each biosensor is based on only one color, this allows for multiplexed biosensor measurements in single living cells. It also allows them to perform biosensor measurements in combination with optogenetic activation systems. Finally, the authors perform some duo-color in vivo fluorescence anisotropy measurements using 2-photon microscopy. The data convincingly shows that (cp)mVenus and mCherry anistropy sensors can be multiplexed in complex cell types and in vivo measurements. The data also shows that the (cp) mCer-sensors performs a lot worse in comparison. Overall, the concept and experimental validation reported here are of great interest for the research community and the revision improved the quality of the work significantly. However, there are still significant concerns some of which may require some additional experiments to address.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors stress that their method provides a generalizable method for (triple) multiplex imaging, and state that &quot;The fact that FLAREs only occupy a single color channel and are highly generalizable for different biosensors, as well as color variants, highlights their utility for multiplexed imaging applications&quot;.</p><p>With such a strong statement:</p><p>The authors should really show that the mCer3 based anisotropy measurements are usable in multiplex experiments beyond highly sensitive calcium sensor modules and / or under physiological conditions (e.g. histamine-induced response on FLARE-mCer3 probe).</p><p>2) The authors added (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1) a convincing comparison of different linkers in mVenus-mVenus anisotropy measurements. Is this a general principle that can be applied to optimize anisotropy based biosensors? E.g. is this similar for mCherry/mCerulean based anisotropy sensors? This should at least be discussed (or better shown) to provide the readers with a basis to start utilising this technique. Similarly, it would greatly help the reader audience if the authors can discuss/speculate on the reason for different performance of the mVenus-pair over the other fluorescent protein pairs in anisotropy measurements.</p><p>3) One of the advantages of FRET sensors is the ability to measure spatially restricted changes in protein activity (within cell compartments), however, the paper does not address whether local activities can be resolved also by fluorescence anisotropy. In Figure 1âfigure supplement 5 authors target the reporters to subcellular compartments and show changes in anisotropy, however, I think the authors should determine whether a local activity can be resolved using a non localized sensor.

Monitoring multiple signaling events in parallel is important. Currently, existing co-imaging approaches remain largely confined to monitoring two activities in parallel. Monitoring three or more activities in the same cell is neither routine nor generalizable, and current examples have to be highly tailored to specific applications or highly specialized optical setups.<sup>1,2</sup> For example, a three-parameter co-imaging study utilized a biosensor for cGMP based on blue fluorescent protein and a nonfluorescent-YFP quenching acceptor, a CY-FRET cAMP biosensor and Fura red, for cGMP, cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> co-imaging.<sup>3</sup> We believe that FLAREs offers a generalizable way to monitor multiple activities simultaneously in the same cell, while preserving many of the advantages of ratiometric fluorescent sensors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Testing was only done under signal optimal conditions.

Since each biosensor is based on only one color, this allows for multiplexed biosensor measurements in single living cells. It also allows to perform biosensor measurements in response to optogenetic activation. Finally, the authors perform some in vivo fluorescence anisotropy measurements using 2-photon microscopy.</p><p>The data somehow implies that a combination of mVenus and a cp mutant of Venus cp172-mVenus is the best pair for performing such anisoptropy measurements. It looks like that other pairs involving other color FPs perform much poorly. The authors propose that this can be a generalizable method to perform multiplexed imaging of multiple signaling activities in single living cells. While I like the concept, I think that the method might not be so easy to implement than as proposed. Multiplexed imaging has been performed using experiments that induce very robust signaling states. The poorest performing FP combination has been grafted on a calcium sensor that is known to be one of the most robust signaling modules available. The question is therefore if the approach has the full potential that the authors propose. This detracts my enthusiasm for the manuscript, and I do not think it is publishable in the present form.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments.</p><p>The SNRs for the FLARE biosensors were determined to be 32 for Venus-cpVenus FLARE AKAR, 10 for Cherry-Cherry FLARE AKAR, and 3 for Cerulean-Cerulean FLARE AKAR. In fact, all of the current FLARE probes show an SNR â¥3, with many above 15 (Table 1). While there is definitely room for improvement, we believe that this performance is comparable with first generation FRET sensors. We have now added a brief discussion about this point.</p><p>In terms of non-optimal conditions, several examples of suboptimal conditions were used. For example, cAMP and calcium oscillations in MIN6 cells are sub-maximal conditions where small oscillatory changes in second messenger levels can be consistently detected using the FLARE probes (Figure 4B, Figure 4âfigure supplement 2). Furthermore, we demonstrated multiplexed in vivo imaging using skeletal muscle of the foot of a live mouse (Figure 4D, E). It is well known that in vivo imaging presents the most challenging test of biosensor performance as reduced dynamic range is often observed in these settings. We have shown that FLARE biosensors can provide a multiplexed readout of signaling activities in vivo. In the revised version of the manuscript, we also include an isoproterenol dose response curve for a FLARE AKAR (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3), as well as a supplementary figure showing histamine-induced responses of a FLARE calcium probe (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C). Together, these data demonstrate that FLARE probes can detect responses under physiological stimulation conditions.</p><p>For these co-imaging experiments, we have used different color/biosensor combinations:</p><p>mCherry-mCherry FLARE-AKAR, Venus-cp172Venus FLARE-EKAR, and mCerulean3-mCerulean3 FLARE-cameleon in HEK293 cells; Cerulean3-Cerulean3 FLARE-cameleon and Venus-cp172Venus FLARE-ICUE in MIN6 cells; and Venus-cp172Venus FLARE-cameleon and mCherry-mCherry FLARE-AKAR for in vivo imaging.</p><p>The different biosensor combinations used in these co-imaging experiments, the different stimulation conditions and the successful demonstration of multiplexed in vivo imaging together suggest that the FLARE probes are useful for co-imaging in different contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1) Throughout the paper, the authors analyse multiple cells for each respective experiment.

This is contrary to another EKAR variant, EKAR2G, that displays a very transient ERK activity in the same HEK293T cells (PMID:23882122). Importantly, this is backed up with a phosphoERK western blot in this paper. What happens with this FLARE EKAR-EV version. Do the new FPs somehow influence the biosensor response, or is this due to the specific HEK293T cells/ experimental conditions used by the authors?</p></disp-quote><p>There are cell-to-cell variations in terms of the dynamics of the ERK response to EGF.

Ross, et al. explore the use of fluorescence anisotropy to measure conformational changes in genetically encoded biosensors using a single color per sensor. The authors successfully use ratiometric measurements of polarized fluorescence to enable quantification of previously described FRET reporters. This is a very exciting idea as it could substantially increase multiplexing capabilities in single cells. The authors validate the use of FLAREs in a variety of individual sensors, multiplexed with optogenetic tools and in vivo. Although I find the concept and validation of great interest, the characterization of intramolecular fluorescence anisotropy and comparison to current methods is limited.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments. We have now added the characterization of intramolecular fluorescence anisotropy and comparison to current methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors should explore the use of fluorescence anisotropy to measure subcellular changes in activity. One of the advantages of FRET sensors is the ability to measure spatially restricted changes in protein activity (within cell compartments), however, the paper does not address whether local activities can be monitored also by fluorescence anisotropy. In fact, given the single color nature of FLAREs, single cell comparisons of FRET vs FLARE should be possible and helpful to define how these technologies compare quantitatively.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised submission, we have now included examples of FLARE sensors targeted to different subcellular compartments. Specifically we have demonstrated the ability to monitor local kinase activities at the plasma membrane and the outer mitochondrial membrane (Figure 1âfigure supplement 5).</p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have also added an experiment to directly compare a FLARE biosensor with a FRET biosensor. Specifically, we co-expressed AKAR4, the current-generation FRET-based PKA activity biosensor, and mCh-mCh FLARE AKAR in the same cell and co-imaged the two probes (Figure 1âfigure supplement 4). The data show that FLARE AKAR captures all the basic characteristics of the response of FRET-based AKAR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The novelty of this study relies on the use of intramolecular fluorescence anisotropy to measure conformational changes. However, the relationship between intramolecular distance (or orientation) and anisotropy is not explored. These experiments could be done by using linkers of different lengths or known proteins with different structures. In my opinion, a more thorough characterization of the parameters that affect intramolecular anisotropy is needed to understand the full spectrum of limitations and possibilities of this method.</p></disp-quote><p>The anisotropy measurement in these experiments is a way of quantifying homoFRET. The relationship between intramolecular distance and anisotropy can therefore be predicted based on the theory of FRET. To validate this, we have now included the requested experiment (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1) that shows the relationship between linker length and fluorescence depolarization using mVenus. A single mVenus emits light with the highest measured anisotropy, whereas two tandem mVenus:mVenus fusion constructs both displayed reduced anisotropy due to FRET. The shorter linker construct exhibited a greater reduction compared with the longer linker version due to the higher homo-FRET efficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors find that a circularly permutated Venus together with wt Venus is better at changing anisotropy, but then, the comparison to other FPs is done without any circular permutation. It is not clear, from the manuscript, what are the reasons for such comparison. If circular permutation affects anisotropy, other FPs should also be permuted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included data on cp173-mCerulean in the acceptor position for the FLARE AKAR (Figure 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Most experiments to test the reporting abilities of the sensor are done under chemical perturbation with chemicals that create non physiological states (i.e. Fsk, Ionomycin, PMA). To determine whether the reporting range of the sensor is appropriate for &quot;real&quot; conditions, a dose-response under physiological stimulation compared to other sensors should be done.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown that EGF-induced ERK activity can be detected by FLARE-EKAR. In the revised draft, we have now included a dose-response curve of FLARE AKAR using the Î²-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3). Furthermore, we have also included calcium measurements from stimulation of Gq-coupled receptors with histamine (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C). These experiments demonstrate the capability of the FLARE sensors to report physiologically relevant responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The choice of fluorescent proteins in the dual sensor experiment provided in Figure 4B is unfortunate. Venus and Cerulean3 are a FRET pair. This could be confusing the interpretation of the results. Using the Cherry version in one of the two sensors would be a more appropriate choice.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that the broad spectral properties of FPs allow for many potential FRET combinations, including mCerulean3:Venus, mVenus:mCherry, and even EGFP:mCherry, each of these combinations has been widely used for non-FRET two-color experiments.<sup>4,5</sup> The imaging conditions we use prevent bleedthrough of fluorescence into non-specific channels, permitting clear and complete separation of mCerulean3 and mVenus fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35458.035</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p> a).

The calcium responses are submaximal in this context. In addition, in this revision we included two additional multiplexed co-imaging experiments to demonstrate that the mCer3 FLARE sensors could detect physiologically relevant responses. First, we performed a co-imaging experiment of mCer3-mCer3 FLARE Cameleon, mCh-mCh FLARE AKAR, and Venus-cp172Venus FLARE EKAR in HeLa cells, with Fsk/IBMX, EGF, and histamine stimulation (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2). In the HeLa cells, calcium transients were observed both after EGF stimulation and after histamine stimulation. Furthermore, we also co-imaged mCer3-cp173Cer3 FLARE AKAR and Venus-cp172 Venus cameleon with 100nM isoproterenol, a physiological stimulant, and thapsigargin (Figure 4âfigure supplement 3). Changes in anisotropy were observed in both channels upon the appropriate stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors added (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1) a convincing comparison of different linkers in mVenus-mVenus anisotropy measurements. Is this a general principle that can be applied to optimize anisotropy based biosensors? E.g. is this similar for mCherry/mCerulean based anisotropy sensors? This should at least be discussed (or better shown) to provide the readers with a basis to start utilising this technique. Similarly, it would greatly help the reader audience if the authors can discuss/speculate on the reason for different performance of the mVenus-pair over the other fluorescent protein pairs in anisotropy measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the experiment comparing the anisotropy of monomeric FP, and dimers separated by linkers of two different lengths for mCherry and mCerulean3, in addition to mVenus (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). A similar trend was observed. Monomeric FPs had the highest anisotropy, followed by dimers separated by a long linker, with dimers separated by a short linker having the lowest measured anisotropy. This observation is consistent with our understanding of homo-FRET, with increased FRET efficiency corresponding to a decrease in anisotropy of the emitted light.</p><p>For FLARE sensors, like FRET sensors, it is difficult to know a priori which FPs or FP combinations will yield the greatest dynamic range. However, we have observed for a number of different sensors that the mVenus based ones tend to perform better. We speculate that this is because mVenus is both a good FRET donor and a FRET acceptor because of its excellent quantum yield and extinction coefficient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One of the advantages of FRET sensors is the ability to measure spatially restricted changes in protein activity (within cell compartments), however, the paper does not address whether local activities can be resolved also by fluorescence anisotropy. In Figure 1âfigure supplement 5 authors target the reporters to subcellular compartments and show changes in anisotropy, however, I think the authors should determine whether a local activity can be resolved using a non localized sensor. For instance Matsuda et al. (PMCID: PMC3226481) show that PKC in response to TPA is activated at the membrane edge. The authors should test the spatial resolution power of anisotropic probes using their FLARE CKAR.</p></disp-quote><p>The PKC sensor in Matsudaet al. contains the C1 domain of PKCÎ² at N-terminus and translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane upon activation, which is conveniently used to enhance the detection of the membrane activation event.</p><p>To demonstrate the ability to monitor localized activity using an untargeted FLARE sensor, we used mVenus-cp172Venus FLARE AKAR in HeLa cells and stimulated the cells with Fsk/IBMX. We observed clear differences, both in terms of the kinetics and the magnitude of the signals (Figure 1âfigure supplement 8), demonstrating that localized signals can be distinguished using non-localized probes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All the experiments shown in this study have been done using transfection or electroporation which results in major overexpression of the biosensor. The authors should determine whether expression level determines the reporting ability of these sensors.</p></disp-quote><p>A scatterplot of anisotropy change vs. intensity (expression level) has been added for the Venus-cp172Venus FLARE AKAR and mCherry-mCherry FLARE AKAR as examples (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3). In general, the expression level does not significantly impact the reporting ability of these sensors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Although it may seem obvious I think the authors should determine whether the anisotropy change depends on the fluorescent proteins being in close proximity or just the conformational change itself. Mutating one chromophore could easily address this question.</p></disp-quote><p>We mutated the chromophore of the C-terminal cp172Venus in Venus-cp172Venus FLARE AKAR from GYG to GGG, and performed anisotropy imaging of this sensor in HEK cells with Fsk/IBMX stimulation of PKA (Figure 1âfigure supplement 5). This mutation did not completely abolish the response but instead reduced the response amplitude to about one-third of the wildtype biosensor. The anisotropy change was not completely abolished, presumably, because of intermolecular FRET occurring between biosensor molecules. After stimulation of PKA activity, it is possible for a proportion of the FHA1-PKA substrate interactions to occur between two adjacent sensor molecules, resulting in FRET and subsequently a slight change in measured anisotropy.</p><p>We think it is unlikely that the anisotropy changes observed in the FLARE sensors are due to a change in the rotational mobility of the molecules. It has been shown that the rotational mobility of FPs occurs on a timescale much longer than the lifetime of the fluorescence. Thus the contribution to a change in rotational mobility due to a change in the shape of the sensor to the dynamic range should be negligible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Statistical methods and data reporting:</p><p>- Generally: Why are the average curves (including the variance measurements) in the supplemental figures?
