Here, we conducted an unbiased phosphoproteomics analysis in order to determine the role of altered protein phosphorylation in the adaptive heart performance and protection profile of adult TGAC8 left ventricle (LV) at 3–4 months of age, and integrated the phosphoproteome with transcriptome and proteome. Based on differentially regulated phosphoproteins by genotype, numerous stress-response pathways within reprogrammed TGAC8 LV, including PKA, PI3K, and AMPK signaling pathways, predicted upstream regulators (e.g. PDPK1, PAK1, and PTK2B), and downstream functions (e.g. cell viability, protein quality control), and metabolism were enriched. In addition to PKA, numerous other kinases and phosphatases were hyper-phosphorylated in TGAC8 vs. WT. Hyper-phosphorylated transcriptional factors in TGAC8 were associated with increased mRNA transcription, immune responses, and metabolic pathways. Combination of the phosphoproteome with its proteome and with the previously published TGAC8 transcriptome enabled the elucidation of cardiac performance and adaptive protection profiles coordinately regulated at post-translational modification (PTM) (phosphorylation), translational, and transcriptional levels. Many stress-response signaling pathways, i.e., PI3K/AKT, ERK/MAPK, and ubiquitin labeling, were consistently enriched and activated in the TGAC8 LV at transcriptional, translational, and PTM levels. Thus, reprogramming of the cardiac phosphoproteome, proteome, and transcriptome confers resilience to chronic adenylyl cyclase-driven stress. We identified numerous pathways/function predictions via gene sets, phosphopeptides, and phosphoproteins, which may point to potential novel therapeutic targets to enhance heart adaptivity, maintaining heart performance while avoiding cardiac dysfunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>left ventricle</kwd><kwd>adenylyl cyclase 8</kwd><kwd>phosphoproteome</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>proteome</kwd><kwd>AC-cAMP-PKA-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling</kwd><kwd>PI3K/AKT signaling pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lakatta</surname><given-names>Edward G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Numerous pathways/function predictions were identified via gene sets, phosphopeptides, and phosphoproteins, which may point to potential novel therapeutic targets to enhance heart adaptivity, maintaining heart performance while avoiding cardiac dysfunction.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>TGAC8 markedly increases the heart rate and ejection fraction, similar to acute exercise but chronic and in the absence of corporal exertion, which persists on a 24 hr per day and 7 days per week basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lipskaia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georget et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Esposito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moen et al., 2019</xref>). Despite this constant high-level of heart performance driven by markedly elevated level of AC8-cAMP-PKA-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which typically proceeds to near-term cardiac dysfunction, the TGAC8 survives for an extended period of time, up to about one year of age without excessive mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>). Adaptive mechanisms that emerge in the TGAC8 heart confer resilience to this marked chronic stress of increased AC8-cAMP-PKA-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and include the enrichment and activation of a large number of proteins involved in multiple signaling pathways related to nutrient sensing, energy production, growth factor signaling, and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>).</p><p>As the body is a complex system, multiple levels of coordinated regulatory mechanisms are requisite to defend against stimuli and maintain health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pei et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2022</xref>). Phosphorylation is one of the most important and has been the most extensively studied PTM of proteins. Various kinases and phosphatases within cells phosphorylate and dephosphorylate, respectively, a myriad of proteins to regulate their activities and affect multiple signaling pathways. Because the PKA signaling pathway was highly enriched in TGAC8 vs. WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>), we reasoned that protein phosphorylation differed between TGAC8 and WT, and protein phosphorylation modification plays a crucial role in the remarkable adaptative capacity of the TGAC8 heart in response to markedly increased AC8-cAMP-PKA-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p><p>By the utilization of TMT-labeling mass spectrometry (MS), we identified 12963 phosphopeptides and 3646 phosphoproteins, and observed a general upregulation of phosphorylation. By comparing genotypic differences in the proteome and phosphoproteome of the present study with genotypic differences in the transcriptome published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>), we sought to determine whether some adaptive mechanisms that emerge in the TGAC8 LV are regulated at transcriptional, translational, and PTM (phosphorylation) levels. We observed enrichments of phosphorylation, upregulation of kinase expression, and predicted activation of upstream kinases to expand our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms the TGAC8 utilizes to adapt to the chronic stress of activated AC8-cAMP-PKA-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. We integrated the genotypic difference between the TGAC8 and WT of the phosphoproteome with the transcriptome and proteome, which broadened our understanding of how changes in the transcription, translation, and PTM of proteins in the TGAC8 LV may singly or coordinately enable the TGAC8 to endure the chronic AC8-induced stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The TGAC8 mouse, generated by inserting a cDNA coding for human AC8 after the murine α-myosin heavy chain promoter, was a gift from Nicole Defer/Jacques Hanoune, Unite de Recherches, INSERM U-99, Hôpital Henri Mondor, F-94010 Créteil, France. The 3-month-old male TGAC mice were used as study cases, and age-matched WT littermates, in the C57/BL6 background, were used as controls. All studies were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication no. 85–23, revised 1996).

Mass spectrometry manipulation referred to our recently published paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Proteins from each group of samples are being quantified using the Bradford Assay Kit. Two-hundred micrograms of protein from each group will be labeled with Amine-Reactive Tandem Mass Tag Reagents (TMT Label Reagents; Thermo Scientific) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, protein will be denatured followed by reduction (TCEP) and alkylation (iodoacetamide), and then the alkylated proteins (200 ug) for each sample were precipitated in six volumes of ice-cold acetone at –20 °C overnight and later reconstituted in Triethylammonium bicarbonate. Each sample was digested overnight using Trypsin enzyme (enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:12.5) to get the peptide solution. Trypsin will cleave proteins at lysine and arginine amino acid residues yielding tryptic peptides.</p><p>The 10-plex TMT labeling was carried out according to Thermo Fisher Scientific’s TMT Mass Tagging kits protocol. Each of the TMT 10-plex label reagents was reconstituted in Acetonitrile (ACN) and digested peptides from each sample were incubated with specific tags (126, 127 N, 127 C, 128 N, 128 C, 129 N, 129 C, 130 N, 130C, and 131, respectively) for about 1 hr at room temperature. The TMT labeled samples are then combined and fractionated using Off-Line high pH Basic Reverse Phase Fractionation to decrease the complexity of the sample and to increase the number of peptides being identified into a total of 24 fractions which will be later analyzed using LC-MS/MS. About 5% of the labeled tryptic peptides from each of the 24-fractions were used for global proteomics analysis by nanoLC-MS/MS analysis while the remaining 95% of samples in the 24-fractions were subjected to subsequent TiO2-enrichment for quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis.</p><p>TiO2 enrichment was conducted using a Titansphere Phos-kit (GL biosciences Inc). The TMT 10-plex tagged tryptic peptides were reconstituted in Buffer B (25% lactic acid in 1% TFA, 80% Acetonitrile). The TiO2 SpinTip (1 mg resin/10 ul tip) was incubated with the sample, washed using the wash buffer following the manufacturers protocol, and the phosphopeptides were eluted in elution buffer sequentially using 5% ammonium hydroxide solution and 5% pyrrolidine solution. The eluted fraction was dried and reconstituted in 0.1% FA for subsequent clean-up using the ZipTip C18-tips (Millipore). The sample from the elution fraction of C18-tips was dried and reconstituted in 0.1% FA for LC-MS/MS analysis.</p><p>The flow-through fraction and the wash fraction from the TiO2 spinTip were collected, pooled into a total of six fractions, and speedvac dried which will be later used for Fe-IMAC phosphoenrichment protocol. The peptide sample from six-pooled flow-through fractions from TiO2 enrichment underwent a second round of phosphoenrichment using a High-Select Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (Thermo Scientific). The eluted fraction was dried and reconstituted in 0.1% FA for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis.</p><p>Protein identification by LC-MS/MS analysis of peptides was performed using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) interfaced with an Ultimate 3000 Nano-HPLC apparatus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Peptides were fractionated by EASY-Spray PepMAP RPLC C18 column (2 μm, 100 A, 75 μm × 50 cm) using a 120 min linear gradient of 5–35% ACN in 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The instrument was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode (DDA) using an FT mass analyzer for one survey MS scan on selecting precursor ions followed by top 3 s data-dependent HCD-MS/MS scans for precursor peptides with 2–7 charged ions above a threshold ion count of 10,000 with normalized collision energy of 37%. Survey scans of peptide precursors from 300 to 2000 m/z were performed at 120 k resolution and MS/MS scans were acquired at 50,000 resolution with a mass range m/z 100–2000.</p><p>All MS and MS/MS raw spectra of TMT experiments from each set were processed and searched using the Sequest HT algorithm within the Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (PD2.2 software, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The settings for precursor mass tolerance were set at 12 ppm, fragment ion mass tolerance to 0.05 Da, trypsin enzyme with 2 mis cleavages with carbamidomethylation of cysteine, TMT6-plex (lysine), TMT6-plex (peptide N-term) as fixed modification and deamidation of glutamine and asparagine, oxidation of methionine as variable modifications. The mouse sequence database from Swiss Sprot was used for the database search. Identified peptides were filtered for a maximum 1% FDR using the Percolator algorithm in PD 2.2 along with additional peptide confidence set to high. Only peptide spectra containing all reporter ions were designated as ‘quantifiable spectra’ and used for peptide/protein quantitation. The final lists of protein identification/quantitation were grouped and further filtered by PD 2.2 with at least two unique peptides per protein identified with high confidence. The quantitative protein ratios were weighted and normalized by the median ratio for all quantifiable spectra of the peptides pertaining to the total protein identified.</p><p>For quantitative phosphopeptides analysis, an additional phosphorylation on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues was specified as variable modifications. To confidently localize phosphorylation sites, the phosphoRS 3.0 node integrated in PD 2.2 workflow was used. The algorithm of phosphoRS 3.0 software enables automated and confident localization of phosphosites by determining individual probability values for each putatively phosphorylated site within the validated peptide sequences. For each relative ratio group of phosphopeptides/sites, no normalization was applied.</p><p>To remove low-quality signals, we remained peptides tagged with the medium and high confidence. We divided the expressions of phosphoproteins to those of total proteins to obtain the normalized phosphoproteome. As the expressions appeared to be near normal distribution, we calculated the fold change by dividing the average value of TGAC8 samples by the average value of WT samples, and calculated the p-value using two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test. Data were deposited in MassIVE (ID: MSV000089850).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Analyses of the TGAC8 LV transcriptome</title><p>The processed transcriptomic data were obtained from our recently published work (GEO: GSE205234) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>).

In IPA, the upstream kinases were predicted based on the unnormalized phosphoproteom, and the regulatory pathways from the predicted upstream kinases to downstream effective signaling pathways were generated. Molecular and cellular functions were also enriched in IPA. The similar analyses to those conducted in the TGAC8 LV transcriptome were also done in the TGAC8 LV total proteome to observe the GO term enrichment, predicted activities of upstream kinases and phosphatases, and expression of kinases and phosphatases at the protein level.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Analyses of phosphopeptides</title><p>The upregulated phosphopeptides (TGAC8 vs.WT, p-value &lt;0.05 and log2(fold change)&gt;0) were processed in R.

However, we have demonstrated that at 3-month of age, the mouse age in the present study, the LV mass is not elevated in TGAC8 vs. WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>). Of note, transcriptomic, proteomic, and WB analyses indicated that pathologic hypertrophic markers were not increased in TGAC8 vs. WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>). In this regard, the activation of key stress response signaling pathways, e.g., protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, PI3K signaling, and AMPK signaling, may protect against pathological changes, that result in an increase in cardiac mass in TGAC8 despite its chronic increase in performance. For example, activated PKA signaling can restrict the activity of AC8, acting as a feedback to fine-tune the downstream signaling networks inside the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Willoughby et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, nitric oxide (NO) signaling may coordinate cardiac protection in the increase in cardiac mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

By using WebLogo, we profiled the phosphorylation motif sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Of note, most of the identified kinases were upregulated in TGAC8 vs. WT at transcription, translation, and PTM (phosphorylation) levels. Within the phosphoproteome, eight kinases were predicted to be differentially activated by genotype, and the phosphorylation level of four of these (PDPK1, PAK1, PTK2B, and GSK3B) was increased in TGAC8 vs. WT. These four kinases each phosphorylates various proteins to regulate cellular functions. For example, a previous study observed that in human glioblastoma cell lines, T98G and U87MG cells, the interference of human PDPK1 mRNA by siRNA decreased the phosphorylation level of human BAD protein (S112, S136, and S155) and activated cell death to suppress tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Desai et al., 2011</xref>). Another study reported that in mouse myoblast cell line, C2C12 cells, PDPK1 protein phosphorylated the mouse ULK1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Increased phosphorylation states of BAD (upregulated at S112, S136, and S155) and ULK1 (upregulated at S450, S521, and S637/638) in TGAC8 may be linked to activated PDPK1.</p><p>Different kinases can coordinate to reprogram the complex regulation network in the organism. Consistent with the IPA canonical pathway analysis, the phosphorylation level of 27 proteins (including the three kinases (PDPK1, PAK1, and PTK2B) auto-phosphorylating themselves) were elevated by the three kinases to regulate cardiac stress signaling pathways, including PKA signaling, ERK/MAPK signaling, cardiac hypertrophy signaling (enhanced), and renin-angiotensin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), to cope with the cardiac stress in the TGAC8.

To confirm the hypothesis that the TGAC8 might exert transcriptional control by TFs phosphorylation, we retrieved all TFs identified in our previous transcriptome and proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>) and mapped them to the current phosphoproteome in order to determine their genotypic differences in phosphorylation status. Of the 191 TFs also identified in this phosphoproteome, 92 TFs differed significantly by genotype in phosphorylation status (p-value &lt;0.05). In agreement with the general upregulated transcription in TGAC8 LV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>), nearly all of the TFs that differed by genotype had increased phosphorylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and File 3).

In addition to PKA, numerous other kinases and phosphatases were hyper-phosphorylated in TGAC8 vs. WT. Hyper-phosphorylated transcriptional factors in TGAC8 were associated with increased mRNA transcription, immune responses, and metabolic pathways. Integration of the phosphoproteome with its proteome and with the previously published TGAC8 transcriptome enabled the elucidation of cardiac performance and adaptive protection profiles that were coordinately regulated at PTM (phosphorylation), translational, and transcriptional levels. Many stress-response signaling pathways, i.e., PI3K/AKT, ERK/MAPK, and ubiquitin labeling, were consistently enriched and activated in the TGAC8 LV at transcriptional, translational, and PTM levels.</p><p>Most previous studies of PKA-dependent phosphorylation via the AC8-cAMP-PKA axis (typical substrate motif of PKA-dependent phosphorylation) focused on PKA phosphorylated targets as downstream effects of activated AC8. For example, AC8-induced cAMP activates PKA to increase the phosphorylation of many key proteins in the cardiovascular system, e.g., ryanodine-receptor-type 2 (RyR2), L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LTCC), phospholamban (PLN or PLB), etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>). Our study identified 29 phosphosites on RyR2, 15 phosphosites on LTCC alpha 1 and beta 2, and two phosphosites (S16 and T17) on PLN, and, most interestingly, seven phosphosites on SERCA2 (Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2), with the majority of these increased in phosphorylation statuses in the TGAC8 LV (File 1: Sheet 1). It is worth noting that PLN is phosphorylated on S16 by PKA whereas on T17 by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wegener et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>Following phosphorylation, many cytoplasmic proteins, including TFs, are transported into the nucleus. TFs recognize and bind to the promoters to activate transcription, and many TFs were hyper-phosphorylated in TGAC8 vs.WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). The phosphorylation of STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pilz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wen et al., 1995</xref>), STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wen et al., 1995</xref>), HTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>), and CREB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) is associated with the activation of their transcriptional activities. Elevated TFs phosphorylation and possibly activated transcription were consistent with the general increase in transcriptome in TGAC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>). The hyper-phosphorylated TFs might contribute to the improved immunity, metabolism, and cell viability in TGAC8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>). For example, STAT family proteins are transcription activators, and their phosphorylation is involved in inflammation and immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Seif et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Decker and Kovarik, 2000</xref>). The present study identified increased phosphorylation levels in S727 on STAT1 and S726/S727 on STAT3 (File 1: Sheet 1), in line with our previous report which identified hyper-phosphorylation of components within inflammation and immune response signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT and JNK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tarasov, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Upon activation of RNA transcription, expression of numerous molecules, including TFs, kinases, and phosphatases was increased in TGAC8 vs WT, thereby, leading to activation of other kinase-controlled phosphorylation cascades in addition to PKA. For example, among the others, IPA predicted activation of PDPK1, PAK1, and PTK2B directed signaling in TGAC8 vs WT. In the context of the overexpression of AC8, these three kinases could be activated to phosphorylate multiple proteins to activate the PKA pathway (positive feedback) and the MAPK/ERK pathway (also known as Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) to maintain heart health (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In the present study, S233 and S621/S641 on Isoform 2 of RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase were hyper-phosphorylated in TGAC8 (File 1: Sheet 1). Importantly, the multifunctional molecule, GSK3B, was downstream of PDPK1 and PTK2B in the integrated regulation network.

Interestingly, AC8 is required for glucose homeostasis and hypothalamic adaptation to a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raoux et al., 2015</xref>).

Navigating this figure ‘by the numbers:’ marked, chronic, cardiac-specific overexpression of AC8 (1) chronically increases cAMP (2) and PKA-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (3), resulting, not only in an incessantly increased cardiac performance, due to elevated heart rate and LV contractility (4), but also activation of growth factor signaling pathways (5), leading to increase in energy demand due to increased transcription and increased amino acid, nucleotide, protein, lipid and lipoprotein synthesis, increased protein quality control, including proteosome activity, autophagy, mitophagy, cytokine signaling and inflammation (6). Chronic high level of AC8 activation elicits numerous stress responses (8) including increased nutrient sensing with increased AMPK signaling (10 A), increased ROS scavenging, protection against cell death, and also induction of signaling to minimize the impact of AC-PKA signaling (10B). Shifts in energy production and utilization to deal with the marked energy demands of the TGAC8 heart (10, 12) include: enhancement of glucose metabolism is pronounced (11, 13), whilst utilization of fatty acids to produce energy is reduced (11) but an increase in glucose catabolism (10, 11) is accompanied by an increased anabolism (12), supported by increased aerobic glycolysis (11,13); increased utilization of the pentose phosphate shunt (5, 13) supports increased amino acid, nucleotide, protein and lipoprotein synthesis induced by growth factor signaling (5), resulting in an increase in LV biomass (14). This adaptive profile balances energy requirements necessary for an incessant marked increase in cardiac performance (4), for increased RNA transcription, protein translation, and quality control required for cardiac growth (14), and for other biological processes within the LV myocardium (6). This pattern of consilient adaptations (6-15) sustains an incessant increase in cardiac performance while conferring cardio-protection to the TGAC8 heart.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Reprogrammed concentric performance and protection circuitry in response to the constitutive challenge of marked cardiac-specific overexpression of adenylyl cyclase type 8 (TGAC8).</title><p>Based on the present phosphoproteome, we optimized our previously deduced mechanism graph and labeled findings from the phosphoproteome using red stars.

The bioinformatic analysis strategy here revealed a larger kinase-substrate network important in the remodeling of the TGAC8 heart. We plan to validate these kinase-substrate reactions in additional follow-up studies and provide the reliable mechanism in cardiovascular research.</p><p>The present study focuses on a comprehensive in silico analysis of functionally coherent and data-driven transcription, translation, and post-translation patterns that were well translated in the contribution to AC8-overexpression cardiac outcomes, while further investigation is warranted to see whether the hub pathway/function predictions via gene sets, phosphopeptides, and phosphoproteins could be used as biomarkers or impact the diagnostic specificity for transgenic AC8 cardiac health and pathology, and even be used as therapeutic targets to enhance heart adaptivity, maintaining heart performance while avoiding cardiac dysfunction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All studies were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication no. 85-23, revised 1996).

Your comment that we have not focused on a question with clear relevance to human disease is “right on point!”</p><p>During chronic pathophysiologic states e.g., chronic heart failure (CHF) in humans, AC/cAMP/PKA/Ca2+ signaling increases progressively the degree of heart failure progresses, leading to cardiac inflammation, mediated in part, by cyclic-AMP- induced up- regulation of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) signaling. Standard therapies for CHF include β-adrenoreceptor blockers and RAS inhibitors, which although effective, are suboptimal in amelioration of heart failure progression. One strategy to devise novel and better therapies for heart failure, would be to uncover the full spectrum of concentric cardio- protective adaptations that becomes activated in response to severe, chronic AC/cAMP/PKA/Ca2+ -induced cardiac stress.</p><p>We employed unbiased omics analyses, in our prior study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/80949v1">https://elifesciences.org/articles/80949v1</ext-link>) of the mouse harboring cardiac specific overexpression of adenylyl cyclase type 8 (TGAC8), and identified more than 2,000 transcripts and proteins, comprising a broad array of biological processes across multiple cellular compartments, that differed in TGAC8 left ventricle compared to WT. These bioinformatic analyses revealed that marked overexpression of AC8 engages complex, concentric adaptation &quot;circuity&quot; that has evolved in mammalian cells to confer resilience to stressors that threaten health or life. The main human disease category identified in these analyses was Organismal Injury and Abnormalities, suggesting that defenses against stress were activated as would be expected, in response to cardiac stress. Specific concentric signaling pathways that were enriched and activated within the TGAC8 protection circuitry included cell survival initiation, protection from apoptosis, proliferation, prevention of cardiac-myocyte hypertrophy, increased protein synthesis and quality control, increased inflammatory and immune responses, facilitation of tissue damage repair and regeneration and increased aerobic energetics. These TGAC8 stress response circuits resemble many adaptive mechanisms that occur in response to the stress of disease states and may be of biological significance to allow for proper healing in disease states such as myocardial infarction or failure of the heart. The main human cardiac diseases identified in bioinformatic analyses were multiple types cardiomyopathies, again suggesting that mechanisms that confer resilience to the stress of chronic increased AC-PKA-Ca2+ signaling are activated in the absence of heart failure in the super-performing TGAC8 heart at 3-months of age.</p><p>In the present study, we performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of transcription, translation, and post-translational patterns, seeking to discover whether the coordinated transcriptome and proteome regulation of the adaptive protective circuitry within the AC8 heart that is common to many types of cardiac disease states identified in our previous study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/80949v1">https://elifesciences.org/articles/80949v1</ext-link>) extends to the phosphoproteome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, the investigators describe an unbiased phosphoproteomic analysis of cardiac-specific overexpression of adenylyl cyclase type 8 (TGAC8) mice that was then integrated with transcriptomic and proteomic data.

Are the authors trying to highlight pathways related to cardiac resilience? Resilience might be a clearer word than &quot;performance and protection circuitry&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important comment. We have revised the title accordingly: Reprogramming of cardiac phosphoproteome, proteome and transcriptome confers resilience to chronic adenylyl cyclase-driven stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps the text can be reviewed in detail by a copy-editor, as there are many grammatically 'awkward' elements (for example, line 56: &quot;mammalians&quot; instead of mammals), inappropriate colloquialisms (for example, line 73: &quot;port-of-call&quot;), and stylistic unevenness that make it difficult to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reviewed the text in detail, with the assistance of a copy editor, in order to identify and correct awkward elements and to search for other colloquialisms. Finally, although “stylistic unevenness” to which you refer may be difficult for us to identify during our re-edits, we have tried our best to identify and revise them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The best-written sections are the first few paragraphs of the discussion section, which finally clarify why the TGAC8 mouse is important in understanding cardiac resilience to stress and how the present study leverages this model to disentangle the biological processes underlying the resilience. I wish this had been presented in this manner earlier in the paper, (in the abstract and introduction) so I could have had a clearer context in which to interpret the data. It would also be helpful to point out whether the TGAC8 mouse has any correlates with human disease.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this very important comment. Well put! In addition to recasting the title to include the concept of resilience, we have revised both the abstract and introduction to feature what you consider to be important to the understanding of cardiac resilience to stress, and how the present study leverages this model to disentangle the biological processes underlying the resilience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. How were the cutoffs determined to distinguish between upregulated/downregulated phosphoproteins and phosphopeptides?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important question. We used the same criteria to distinguish differences between TGAC8 and WT for unnormalized and normalized phosphoproteins, -log10(p-value) &gt; 1.3, and log2FoldChange &lt;= -0.4 (down) or log2FoldChange &gt;= 0.4 (up), as stated in the methods section, main text and figure legend. The results were consistent across all analyses and selectively verified by experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Were other models assessed for correlation between transcriptome and phosphoproteome other than a linear relationship of log2 fold change?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. In addition to a linear relationship of log2 fold change of molecule expression, we also compared protein activities, e.g., Fig 4F, and pathways enriched from different omics, e.g., Fig 3D, 5J, 6B and 6F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figures 1A and 5G seem to show outliers. How many biological and technical replicates would be needed to minimize error?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the question. Figures 1A and 5G were PCA plots which, as expected, manifested some genetic variability among the same genotypes. The PCA plots, however, are useful in determining how the identified items separated, both within and among genotypes. For bioinformatics analysis such as ours, 4-5 samples are sufficient to accomplish this, as demonstrated by separation, by genotype, of samples in PCA. Thus, in addition to discovery of true heterogeneity among the samples, our results are still able to robustly discover the true differences between the genotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Were the up/downregulated genes more likely to be lowly expressed (which would lead to larger log2 changes identified)?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to your query, we calculated the average expression of phosphorylation levels across all samples to observe whether they were expressed in low abundance in all samples.We also generated the MA plots, an application of a Bland–Altman plot, to create a visual representation of omics data. The MA plots in Author response image 1 illustrate that the target molecules with significantly changed phosphorylation levels did not aggregate within the very low abundance. To confirm this conclusion, we adopted two sets of cutoffs: (1) change: -log10(p-value) &gt; 1.3, and log2FoldChange &lt; 0 (down) or log2FoldChange &gt; 0 (up); and (2) change_2: -log10(p-value) &gt; 1.3, and log2FoldChange &lt;= -0.4 (down) or log2FoldChange &gt;= 0.4 (up).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88732-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. &quot;We verified some results through wet lab experiments&quot; in the abstract is vague.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the good suggestion. What we meant to indicate here was that identified genotypic differences in selected proteins, phosphoproteins and RNAs discovered in omics were verified by western blots, protein synthesis detection, proteosome activity detection, and protein soluble and insoluble fractions detection.
