determined by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and NMR relaxation dispersion measurements. These can be described by a global exchange between two conformational states of the active kinase, named ‘L’ and ‘R,’ where R is associated with a catalytically productive ATP-binding mode. An ATP-competitive ERK1/2 inhibitor, Vertex-11e, has properties of conformation selection for the R-state, revealing movements of the activation loop that are allosterically coupled to the kinase active site. However, the features of inhibitors important for R-state selection are unknown. Here, we survey a panel of ATP-competitive ERK inhibitors using HDX-MS and NMR and identify 14 new molecules with properties of R-state selection. They reveal effects propagated to distal regions in the <italic>P</italic>+1 and helix αF segments surrounding the activation loop, as well as helix αL16. Crystal structures of inhibitor complexes with ERK2 reveal systematic shifts in the Gly loop and helix αC, mediated by a Tyr-Tyr ring stacking interaction and the conserved Lys-Glu salt bridge. The findings suggest a model for the R-state involving small movements in the N-lobe that promote compactness within the kinase active site and alter mobility surrounding the activation loop. Such properties of conformation selection might be exploited to modulate the protein docking interface used by ERK substrates and effectors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MAP kinase</kwd><kwd>inhibitor</kwd><kwd>conformation selection</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>hydrogen exchange</kwd><kwd>cancer therapeutics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM136392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>Natalie G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM114594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>Natalie G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10RR026641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>Natalie G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD025267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>Natalie G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD025020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>David N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA046934</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>David N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New ATP-competitive inhibitors show properties of conformation selection when complexed with the MAP kinase, ERK2, altering movements around the activation loop.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases, ERK1/2, are key components of the MAP kinase signaling pathway controlling cell proliferation, survival, morphology, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lavoie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roskoski, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plotnikov et al., 2011</xref>). Due to the prevalence of oncogenic mutations in Ras, RAF, and MEK, components of this pathway have been targeted for the development of successful anti-cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Halle and Johnson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tangella et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ryan et al., 2020</xref>). Although inhibitors targeting ERK1/2 have not advanced to clinical use, clinical trials are ongoing for several, including ulixertinib/BVD523 (Biomed Valley Diagnostics), ravoxertinib/GDC0994 (Genentech), and tizakertib/ATG017/AZD0364 (Antengene), for the treatment of cancers with activating mutations in KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grierson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goodwin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Varga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, reversible ATP-competitive inhibitors targeting ERK1/2 have been shown to be effective in cancer cells and tumors with acquired resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roskoski, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pan et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, future anticancer drug development would benefit from a more complete understanding of the properties of ERK inhibitors.</p><p>Many protein kinases undergo relatively large conformational changes when they switch from inactive to active states. Such changes lead to the repositioning of conserved active site residues, including a Lys-Glu salt bridge in the N-terminal lobe between strand β3 and helix αC that hydrogen bonds with nucleotide phosphate, an Asp residue in the DFG motif that coordinates Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and an Asp in the HRD motif that catalyzes base-assisted phosphoryl transfer to the substrate hydroxyl acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amatya et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, ERK2 is unusual in that only small conformational changes occur within the active site between the inactive, unphosphorylated (0P) and the active, dual phosphorylated (2P) forms of the kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). X-ray structures show that dual phosphorylation of ERK2 at T183 and Y185 remodels the activation loop by forming phosphate salt bridges with several Arg residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canagarajah et al., 1997</xref>). This accommodates the S/T-P recognition motif common to ERK substrates and exposes a pocket for binding a hydrophobic docking motif found in substrates, scaffolds, and other effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). But within the ATP binding site, the conserved residues that form the K52-E69 salt bridge, the DFG metal binding site (D165), and the HRD catalytic base (D147) are largely overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, the changes in the active site that accompany ERK2 activation are small and difficult to discern crystallographically.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structural features of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 (ERK2).</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) X-ray structures of (<bold>A</bold>) 0P-ERK2 (PDBID:5UMO) and (<bold>B</bold>) 2P-ERK2 (PDBID:2ERK) apoenzymes.

NMR Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion measurements showed that dual phosphorylation results in a global exchange behavior that can be modeled by two conformational states, named ‘R’ and ‘L,’ which exchange on a millisecond timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iverson et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, 2P-ERK2 can be characterized by the interconversion of at least two conformers. Whereas the L-state resembles that seen with 0P-ERK2, the R-state appears only in 2P-ERK2, where it exchanges with an R:L population ratio of 80:20 at 25 °C. Crystal structures of nucleotide-bound kinase show significant differences between 0P- and 2P-ERK2. In 2P-ERK2, the ATP analog, AMP-PNP, is positioned close to the catalytic base and in-line for nucleophilic attack on the Pγ phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pegram et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lechtenberg et al., 2017</xref>). By contrast, ATP bound to 0P-ERK2 is markedly distorted, moving Pγ away from the base by more than 6 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smorodinsky-Atias et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, despite the structural similarity between the apoenzyme forms, 2P-ERK2 promotes ATP binding interactions that are more productive for catalytic function. The unique appearance of the R-state in 2P-ERK2 has been proposed to confer the ability to form a Michaelis complex poised for phosphoryl transfer, while L may represent a state that promotes ADP product release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pegram et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, ATP competitive inhibitors of ERK show properties of conformation selection, where ligand binding traps conformational states in 2P-ERK2 that normally undergo reversible exchange in the apoenzyme. Binding of the inhibitor, Vertex-11e (VTX11e), to 2P-ERK2 shifts the L↔R equilibrium completely to the R-state, while the inhibitor SCH772984 shifts the equilibrium completely to the L-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rudolph et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pegram et al., 2019</xref>). Conformation selection is absent in the inhibitor, GDC0994, where R and L retain a population ratio similar to that seen in the apoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pegram et al., 2019</xref>). This selective recognition could explain why the binding of VTX11e is stronger to 2P-ERK2 than 0P-ERK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rudolph et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, GDC0994 and SCH772984 bind both active and inactive kinase forms with equal affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pegram et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ward et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>HDX-MS also reveals differences between VTX11e, GDC0994, and SCH772984 in their ability to induce perturbations at the <italic>P</italic>+1 segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pegram et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>P</italic>+1 is distal to the kinase active site, and together with the activation loop forms part of the interface for substrate and effector binding. This suggests that R↔L conformational shifts within the active site can propagate out to the activation loop and surrounding regions. NMR-CPMG measurements confirm this, by showing that residues in the activation loop participate in the same global exchange motion as residues surrounding the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iverson et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, solution measurements of conformation selective inhibitors reveal allosteric coupling between the active site and distal regions around the activation loop.</p><p>A consequence of this behavior is that conformation-selective inhibitors can alter the interactions of ERK2 with other proteins. For example, the binding of VTX11e partially inhibits the rate of dephosphorylation at the activation loop by the MAP kinase phosphatase, MKP3/DUSP6, while SCH772984 enhances this rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pegram et al., 2019</xref>). The features of VTX11e controlling its property of R-state selection are unknown. An attempt to address this compared crystal structures of complexes formed between 2P-ERK2 and VTX11e (100% R), GDC0994 (80% R), or SCHCPD336, a close analog of SCH772984 (0% R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pegram et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaikuad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blake et al., 2016</xref>). But the results were inconclusive. Binding of SCHCPD336 disrupted Gly loop and helix αC interactions leading to a disordered activation loop, suggesting that the L-state might communicate N-lobe conformational changes to the activation loop dynamics. In contrast, VTX11e and GDC0994 formed similar close contacts with active site residues with no major distortions in the ATP pocket. Given the limited set of compounds with small structural differences, it was difficult to identify features of binding that could explain why VTX11e is selective for the R-state but GDC0994 is not.</p><p>Here, we survey a panel of small molecules with varying chemistries, using HDX-MS and NMR to classify their properties of conformation selection. Of the 19 inhibitors examined, 14 behave in a similar manner to VTX11e, with conformational selection for the R-state. These include 13 novel inhibitors and ulixertinib/BVD523, a promising ERK inhibitor with blood-brain barrier permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sullivan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sigaud et al., 2023</xref>). Four inhibitors resemble GDC0994 in allowing R↔L exchange with populations comparable to apoenzyme, and one allows exchange but partially shifts the equilibrium toward the R-state. NMR chemical shifts reveal perturbations unique to R-state inhibitors located in the <italic>P</italic>+1 segment and helix αL16, and remote from the inner-sphere region of ligand contact. Co-crystal structures of R-state selective inhibitors complexed with ERK2 show small but systematic conformational shifts in the Gly loop, helix αC, and helix αL16, in which the Gly loop moves closer to the DFG segment, while helicesαC and αL16 shift outwards. This movement rotates the N- and C-lobes into a more closed configuration and moves the K52-E69 salt bridge closer to the conserved DFG motif.

In turn, π−π stacking interactions between Y34 and Y62 couples movements of the Gly loop to helix αC. <italic>Right panel:</italic> Side view showing left-side hydrogen bond contacts with main chain atoms of hinge residue M106, as typical of ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors.

The position of the hydrogen bond of the triazole nitrogen with K52 relative to the pyridone oxygen moves the K52-E69 salt bridge in an outward direction in inhibitors #8 and #10 relative to GDC0994.

In the co-crystal structure with VTX11e, these elements shifted outwards (away from the ligand and towards the activation loop) relative to GDC0994 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This difference could be attributed to a residue contact unique to VTX11e, whose right-side 3-chlorobenzyl substituent forms a Cl-π contact with Y34 on the Gly loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> left panel, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Y34 in turn forms π-π ring-stacking interactions with Y62 on helix αC, suggesting cooperative ternary anion-π-π interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lucas et al., 2016</xref>). These contacts, together with the K52-E69 salt bridge, likely couple movements of the β1-β2-β3 sheet to helix αC, which in turn promotes movement of the adjoining helix αL16. This results in the repositioning of helix αC and αL16 to accommodate the bulky chlorobenzyl group on VTX11e and moves the Gly loop to a more closed conformation. In contrast, the corresponding 3-fluoro 4-chlorobenzyl substituent on GDC0994 is positioned higher in the binding site and tilted upwards into the Gly loop relative to VTX11e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, right panel). This holds the Gly loop in a more open conformation and shifts the position of helix αC and αL16 inwards (towards the ligand). Thus, the variations between right-side substituents and their interactions with the Y34-Y62 stack underlie small conformational shifts in the N-lobe that affect domain opening and closure.</p><p>Like VTX11e, complexes of 2P-ERK2 with inhibitors #8 and #16 (PDBID: 8U8K, 8U8J) showed outward shifts of the Y34-Y62 stack, the Gly loop, and helices αC and αL16, relative to GDC0994 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and D</xref>, left panel). Unlike VTX11e, the 2-chloropyridine and isopentane substituents on inhibitors #8 and #16 respectively were located more than 6 Å from Y34. Both contacted the backbone of strand β1 at angles that allowed but were unlikely to force Gly loop closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and D</xref>, right panels). Inspection of their triazolopyridine central scaffold showed interactions that were distinct from the pyridone scaffold in GDC0994. In GDC0994, the pyridone carbonyl oxygen formed hydrogen bonds with both K52 and a bound water (W1) coordinated to the gatekeeper side chain (Q103) and the DFG main chain amide (D165) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). In contrast, the two nitrogens in the triazole ring of inhibitors #8 and #16 formed separate hydrogen bonds to K52 and W1, respectively. This separation had the effect of shifting the K52-E69 salt bridge position relative to GDC0994. As a result, the Gly loop shifts to a more closed state, allowing the pocket below the Gly loop to accommodate two water molecules that form OH-π interactions with Y34, and favoring outward movement of helicesαC and αL16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and D</xref>). In this way, the R-state inhibitors VTX11e, #8, and #16 share small but systematic movements that lead to Gly loop closure and movements of helixαC and αL16 in the direction of the activation loop. Differences were also seen in the hydrogen bond network around the conserved DFG region. Here, a second bound water (W2) formed a bridge between the catalytic residues K52 and D165 in complexes with VTX11e, #8, and #10, but was absent in GDC0994 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and D</xref>). This revealed a relayed network of hydrogen bond interactions linking the DFG motif to the K52-E69 salt bridge that appeared common to the three R-state inhibitors. Conceivably, this might reflect new bonding interactions that favor greater compactness of the active site.</p><p>Taken together, the crystal structures showed only small conformational variations among these closely related ATP-competitive inhibitors. Nevertheless, certain features were common to each of the R-state inhibitors, involving Gly loop closure and outward movements of helix αC and αL16. These appeared to be favored either by differential contacts between the inhibitor and Y34, or different hydrogen bond configurations between the central scaffold and K52. In each case, coupling to helix αC was enabled by Y34-Y62 and K52-E69 residue interactions. In contrast, the bulky right-side substituent on GDC0994 that prevented Gly loop closure and movements of helix αC/αL16 correlated with retention of conformational exchange.</p><p>The results so far revealed correspondence in R-state selection between the amido-linked pyrrole scaffold of VTX11e and BVD523 and the triazolopyridine scaffold of the new inhibitors. We asked what might happen, if the central scaffold were chosen to more closely resemble VTX11e, while choosing a right-side substituent similar to GDC0994. Tizakertib/ATG017/AZD0364 is an ATP-competitive ERK inhibitor with a tetrahydropyrrolodiazepenone core that resembles the amidopyrrole group in VTX11e and BVD523, and a right-side 3,4-fluorobenzyl group that resembles the 3-fluoro 4-chlorobenzyl group in GDC0994 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flemington et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ward et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the X-ray structure of ATG017 complexed with 0P-ERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, green; PDBID:6SLG, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ward et al., 2019</xref>) showed an open Gly loop, relative to complexes of BVD523 and VTX11e with 0P-ERK2 (shown for 0P-ERK2:BVD523, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, light blue; PDBID:6GDQ, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heightman et al., 2018</xref>). This was due to the rotation of the 3,4-fluorobenzyl ring in ATG017 away from Y34 to form closer interactions with backbone atoms in the β1 and β2 strands. Unlike inhibitors #8 and #16, bound waters between the 3,4-fluorobenzyl ring and Y34 were absent, due to the open Gly loop conformation. As a result, Y34 shifts inwards along with helices αC and αL16, and the side chain of Y64 appears disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).

Thus, ATG017 showed properties of conformational exchange and inward shifts of helices αC and αL16 that were shared with GDC0994 and inhibitors #4 and #15. This could be attributed to its right-side difluorobenzyl substituent that held the Gly loop in an open state. Interestingly, a bound water (W2) bridging K52 and D165 was present in the ATG017 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), and stronger HDX protection around the DFG segment and β9 strand was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). This implies that the HDX protection pattern around the DFG motif is functionally linked to the water bridge (W2) linking K52 and D165. The results show that while changes around the DFG region may contribute to R-state selection, the movements of the Gly loop and helices αC and αL16 appear more essential for conformation selection and allosteric communication.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>ERK inhibitors are promising therapeutic targets for cancers harboring oncogenic BRAF or RAS with acquired resistance to RAF and MEK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roskoski, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pan et al., 2022</xref>). A feature of ERK2 activation that is somewhat unique among protein kinases is its global exchange behavior, involving millisecond interconversion between at least two states in its active, dual phosphorylated form. In this study, we present new ATP-competitive inhibitors of ERK1/2 that, despite their chemical divergence from VTX11e and BVD523, nevertheless share properties of R-state selection. They display sensitivity to the conformational differences between the R and L-states and the ability to induce long-distance perturbations at the <italic>P</italic>+1 segment and helix αL16. Crystallographic structures show correlations between the property of R-state selection and small but systematic shifts in the N-lobe that move helices αC and αL16 in the direction of the activation loop. This appears to be facilitated by movements of strands β1-β2-β3 coupled to helix αC. The findings reveal the importance of contacts between strand β3 and helix αC <italic>via</italic> the positioning of the K52-E69 salt bridge in ERK2, as well as the unique π−π contacts between Tyr residues in the Gly loop and helix αC, in guiding conformation selection for the R-state. By contrast, the binding of SCH772984 disrupts β3-αC contacts in ERK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaikuad et al., 2014</xref>), which may explain why this inhibitor favors the L-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pegram et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Unlike many other kinases, activation of ERK leads to relatively small structural changes within the active site. In 0P-ERK2, the N and C lobes are held apart by the backbone atoms of G167 in the DFG motif, which interdigitates with R65 and Q64 in helix αC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>). This domain separation has been proposed to account for the low activity of unphosphorylated ERK2. Following phosphorylation, residue R65 rotates along with helix αC in the direction of the activation loop and pT183, partially relieving the barrier formed by G167. The resulting domain rotation between N- and C-lobes is only 5 degrees, but it brings K52 closer to D165 by 1.5 Å. The small magnitude of these changes are in part due to structural constraints unique to ERK2. Here, residues in the C-terminal L16 segment extending from the C-lobe to the N-lobe (e.g. Y316, D319, E320, F327, and M331) form close contacts with residues in helices αC and αE and the activation loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). They culminate in helix αL16, where residues I345 and F346 fill a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues in helix αC and the β4-β5 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). This placement of helix αL16 aligns structurally with hydrophobic motif (HM) sequences at the C-termini of PKA and members of the AGC kinase subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taylor et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kannan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baffi and Newton, 2022</xref>), as well as cyclins complexed with CDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tatum and Endicott, 2020</xref>).

Thus, the side chain of I345 fills a deep hydrophobic pocket formed by T66, L67, and I70 in helix αC, F57 in the β3-αC loop, V99 in strand β5, and M96 in loop β4-β5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). This network also includes contacts formed by αL16 residue F346 with R89, I93, and M96 in the β4-β5 loop, and F352 with L74, I84, and I87 in αC and β4. Furthermore, side chains from F327 and M331 in L16 fill a hydrophobic pocket formed by I72, R75, and F76 in helix αC, V143 in the αE-β6 loop, and V171 in the activation loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). In turn, I72 and F76 form hydrophobic contacts with L73 in helix αC, I138 in helix αE, and F166 in the DFG motif. Thus, αL16 and L16 contact the N-lobe <italic>via</italic> a hydrophobic network that merges with the R-spine (L73, I84, F166). Such extensive packing interactions may help to constrain ERK2, preventing the backbone rotational movements needed to allow a DFG-out configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vijayan et al., 2015</xref>), which is never observed in the wild-type kinase. Conceivably, the conformations involved in R↔L global exchange could reflect systematic movements within this network, which propagate to produce the chemical shift perturbations observed in I345. Although such conformational shifts are small, the coupling between movements of the Gly loop and helices αC and αL16 are complementary to the N-lobe movements seen upon ERK2 phosphorylation. It is remarkable that inhibitors that share similar binding interactions and active site contacts are sensitive to such small conformational differences.</p><p>This study shows how HDX-MS and NMR are sensitive to slight perturbations within the active site that lead to significant long-distance responses at the activation loop and <italic>P</italic>+1 segment. Large structural rearrangements around the activation loop were not obvious in the X-ray structures of 2P-ERK2 complexed with GDC0994, VTX11e, or inhibitors #8 and #16. However, evidence that these measurements truly report conformational changes around pT183 and pY185 was supported by the ability of VTX11e to inhibit their rate of dephosphorylation by MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP3/DUSP6, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pegram et al., 2019</xref>). This demonstrates the protection of the activation loop by VTX11e binding. Conceivably, the conformation of the activation loop in solution may be more variable than in crystal structures of 2P-ERK2, in part due to lattice restraints. This is suggested by the extensive lattice contacts with the activation loop and <italic>P</italic>+1 segment in complexes formed by VTX11e, GDC0994, and inhibitors #8 and #16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). In fact, crystal contacts are positioned in a manner that might influence the activation loop in most X-ray structures of ERK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pegram et al., 2023</xref>). This highlights the need for solution measurements to more fully understand allosteric regulation in ERK2.</p><p>Recently, we conducted extended molecular dynamics simulations (225 μs) starting from the X-ray structure of 2P-ERK2 (PDBID: 2ERK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pegram et al., 2023</xref>). The results showed unexpected flexibility of the activation loop, which deviated from the X-ray fold in all trajectories and was able to adopt multiple long-lived conformational states with RMSF ≤1.2 Å and lasting for more than 5 μs. Each state appeared only after 1–5 μs, perhaps due to biases introduced by lattice contacts in the starting model. Importantly, the states varied significantly in the contacts formed between the activation loop, L16, and the <italic>P</italic>+1 segment. These variable activation loop conformations were associated with differential dynamics within the active site, supporting allosteric coupling between these regions. Interestingly, in one of the novel states, the Arg salt bridges formed between pY185 and the <italic>P</italic>+1 segment were broken, allowing the phosphorylated side chain to move away and form a new salt bridge with helix αC. This reorganization resembled that observed in a co-crystal structure of 2P-ERK2 and the adaptor protein, PEA15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mace et al., 2013</xref>). The results suggest that distinct conformational states of the activation loop appear thermally accessible and likely to exist in solution. We speculate that they may function to accommodate variable binding modes for substrates and effectors. To the extent this is true, the coupling between the active site and activation loop in ERK2 might allow conformation selective inhibitors to control the binding of substrates and regulatory effectors. Similarly, allosteric properties in PKA allow different ATP-competitive inhibitors to vary the cooperativity of substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olivieri et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, remote conformational changes induced by conformation selective inhibitors have been shown to alter noncatalytic scaffolding functions of protein kinases <italic>via</italic> interactions with regulatory enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agudo-Ibáñez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leroux and Biondi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sonti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joseph et al., 2022</xref>). In fact, an intriguing recent study demonstrates that ubiquitination and degradation of 2P-ERK2 can be enhanced by BVD523, suggesting that conformation selective inhibitors may act as ‘kinase degraders’ that preferentially target the activated kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balmanno et al., 2023</xref>). Other noncatalytic functions of ERK2 include the activation of topoisomerase IIα and poly-ADP ribose polymerase <italic>via</italic> direct binding of the phosphorylated kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shapiro et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen-Armon et al., 2007</xref>). Preferential binding of DNA to 2P-ERK2 has also been shown to function in ERK1/2 binding to chromatin DNA, with a proposed regulation of transcription through phosphorylation-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lawrence et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McReynolds et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tee et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the ability of R-state inhibitors to control solution conformations of the activation loop may influence emerging noncatalytic functions of ERK.</p><p>In summary, the case of ERK2 illustrates how very small conformational changes in protein kinases can lead to considerable effects on activity and inhibition. Correspondingly, small variations between inhibitors which otherwise share similar binding interactions and active site contacts, differentially control long-distance allosteric effects that induce conformational changes at the activation loop. Such differences may be important for cellular responses, by altering the conformation of ERK at a key interface for substate and effector recognition. This highlights the importance of understanding the properties of conformation selection in ERK, and how these unique features of ERK regulation impact inhibitor design. The elements of protein architecture that enable small active site movements to yield large effects in distal regions remain an important and exciting feature of MAP kinases to explore in future investigations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and purified proteins</title><p>VTX11e, GDC0994, and ATG017 were obtained from Selleck Chemicals (Cat# S7709, S7554, S8708; Houston, TX).

Peptides were accepted after filtering for high confidence, which required a maximum MH<sup>+</sup> error of 15 ppm, minimum sequence length 3, maximum sequence length 25, minimum product ions 3, and identification in at least 2 of 4 replicate runs.

Therefore, it is one of the most important drug targets for cancer therapy. The catalytic subunit of Erk2 has a bilobal architecture, with the small lobe harboring the nucleotide-binding pocket and the large lobe harboring the substrate-binding cleft. Several studies by the Ahn group revealed that the catalytic domain hops between (at least) two conformational states: active (R) and inactive (L), which exchange in the millisecond time scale based on the chemical shift mapping. The R state is a signature of the double phosphorylated Erk2 (2P-Erk2), while the L state has been associated with the unphosphorylated kinase (0P-Erk2). Interestingly, the X-ray structures reveal only minimal differences between these two states, a feature that led to the conclusion that active and inactive states are structurally similar but dynamically very different. The Ahn group also found that ATP-competitive inhibitors can steer the populations of Erk2 either toward the R or the L state, depending on their chemical nature. The latter opens up the possibility of modulating the activity of this kinase by changing the chemistry of the ATP-competitive inhibitor. To prove this point, the authors present a set of nineteen compounds with diverse chemical substituents. From their combined NMR and HDX-Mass Spec analyses, fourteen inhibitors drive the kinase toward the R state, while four compounds keep the kinase hopping between the R and L states. Based on these data, the authors rationalize the effects of these inhibitors and the importance of the nature of the substituents on the central scaffold to steer the kinase activity. While all these inhibitors target the ATP binding pocket, they display diverse structural and dynamic effects on the kinase, selecting a specific structural state. Although the inhibited kinase is no longer able to phosphorylate substrates, it can initiate signaling events functioning as scaffolds for other proteins. Therefore, by changing the chemistry of the inhibitors it may be possible to affect the MAP cascade in a predictable manner. This concept, recently introduced as proof of principle, finds here its significance and practical implications. The design of the next-generation inhibitors must be taken into account for these design principles.</p><p>The research is well executed, and the data support the author's conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91507.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Anderson at al utilize an array of orthogonal techniques to highlight the important of protein dynamics for the function and inhibition of the kinase ERK2.

Estimated rates of dissociation were ~0.0003-0.007 s-1 and rates of binding were 20-100 s-1 for the inhibitors tested. Because the binding rates are faster than the intrinsic H-D exchange rate at pD 7 (~1 s-1), we expect ligands to rebind and form the enzyme:ligand complex faster than the free enzyme undergoes exchange.

Interestingly, the X-ray structures reveal only minimal differences between these two states, a feature that led to the conclusion that active and inactive states are structurally similar but dynamically very different. The Ahn group also found that ATP-competitive inhibitors can steer the populations of Erk2 either toward the R or the L state, depending on their chemical nature. The latter opens up the possibility of modulating the activity of this kinase by changing the chemistry of the ATP-competitive inhibitor. To prove this point, the authors present a set of nineteen compounds with diverse chemical substituents. From their combined NMR and HDX-Mass Spec analyses, fourteen inhibitors drive the kinase toward the R state, while four compounds keep the kinase hopping between the R and L states. Based on these data, the authors rationalize the effects of these inhibitors and the importance of the nature of the substituents on the central scaffold to steer the kinase activity. While all these inhibitors target the ATP binding pocket, they display diverse structural and dynamic effects on the kinase, selecting a specific structural state. Although the inhibited kinase is no longer able to phosphorylate substrates, it can initiate signaling events functioning as scaffolds for other proteins. Therefore, by changing the chemistry of the inhibitors it may be possible to affect the MAP cascade in a predictable manner. This concept, recently introduced as proof of principle, finds here its significance and practical implications. The design of the next-generation inhibitors must be taken into account for these design principles. The research is well executed, and the data support the author's conclusions.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary: Anderson et al utilize an array of orthogonal techniques to highlight the importance of protein dynamics for the function and inhibition of the kinase ERK2. ERK2 is important for a large variety of biological functions.</p><p>Strengths: This is a thorough and detailed study that uses a variety of techniques to identify critical molecular/chemical parameters that drive ERK2 in specific states.</p><p>Weaknesses: No details rules were identified so that novel inhibitors could be designed. Nevertheless, the mode of action of these existing inhibitors is much better defined.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As recommended we added a sentence to the Discussion suggesting that inhibitors that perturb the β1-β2-β3 sheet in such a way that moves helix αC and αL16 away from the binding site might confer R-state selection. We view this as a preliminary model for predicting conformation selection in ERK2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Maybe the authors can comment on how the HDX timescale and the NMR timescale relate to each other and how such different timescales can report on the same event. In particular, the HDX timescale appears to be on the scale on minutes to tens hours (e.g. 2P state). How would inhibitor dissociation and rebinding affect the observed HDX signal? Is it worth considering compound residence time for the different compounds/kinase states?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The HDX-MS and NMR experiments report different processes therefore their timescales do not necessarily match. For native state proteins at neutral pH, HDX-MS reports fluctuations that allow solvent exposure of backbone amide N-H, reflecting conformational mobility of the main chain. This is often modeled as a two-state interconversion between “closed” (HDX protected) and “open” (HDX accessible) states. Because the µs-ms timescale of main chain fluctuations is faster than the intrinsic rate of HDX (kexch, ~1 s-1), the observed HDX rate (kobs) can be approximated by the ratio of kopen/kclosed x kexch = Kop x kexch. Therefore, kobs can be considered a thermodynamic measurement that reflects Kop.</p><p>The [methyl 13C,1H] NMR CPMG experiment that we used to identify global exchange behavior in Xiao et al (PNAS, 2014) modeled the 2P-ERK2 apoenzyme by a two-state equilibrium (L↔R) between methyl-ILV conformers, yielding rate constants kL→R 240 s-1 and kR→L 60 s-1. Some methyls had large enough chemical shifts between L and R that they appeared as separate peaks in HMQC spectra that matched the L and R populations estimated by CPMG. In this study, the HMQC peaks shown in Figures 1, 6, and 9 are those that report shifts in L vs R populations and conformation selection for the R-state by VTX11e, BVD523 and triazolopyridine inhibitors.</p><p>Where HDX and NMR agree is in their ability to report changes in populations of L and R in 2P-ERK2. This was first shown when both HDX and NMR measurements reported perturbations at the activation loop induced by inhibitors with differential selection for the R- vs L-states (Pegram et al. PNAS, 2019). CPMG measurements then confirmed that methyl probes in the activation loop are included in the global exchange process (Iverson et al., Biochemistry, 2020). Therefore, the HDX and NMR experiments reflect shifts in the equilibrium between L and R conformers, rather than motions with specific timescales.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I believe the paper is suitable for the special issue of Elife dedicated to protein kinases after the authors address minor concerns/comments.</p><p>a) Introduction, page 3: &quot;[..] But within the ATP binding site, the conserved residues ...are largely overlapping.&quot; Do the authors mean that the residues are overlapping in the X-ray structures? If so, what is the rmsd among the X-ray structures?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The overlap between conserved residues K52, E69, D147, N152 and D165 in 2P- and 0P-ERK2 is presented in Fig. S1C, which shows an overlay between their apoenzyme crystal structures (PDBID: 2ERK, 5UMO). The RMSD of atoms in each residue are: K52 0.63 Å (9 atoms); E69 0.15 Å (9 atoms); D147 0.055 Å (8 atoms); D165 0.88 Å (8 atoms). As recommended, this information was added to the legend to Suppl.

Are there frustrated conformations?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We used the term “deformities” to mean conformational differences, which may be but are not necessarily due to frustration. To avoid confusion, we removed the term “deformities” and replaced it with “conformational changes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Supplementary Information. The authors report the chemical shift perturbations for several inhibitors. Does the extent of the chemical shift perturbation reflect the strength of the binding for each inhibitor? In other words, do the largest chemical shift perturbations correspond to the highest binding affinity?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The concentrations used in the NMR ligand binding experiments (150 µM ERK2, 180 µM inhibitor) allow 99.9+% complex formation over the 0.03 - 3 nM range of Ki for all inhibitors. Therefore, the chemical shifts report changes in electronic environment between bound and free enzyme. These can be ascribed to first or second sphere contacts with ligand or distal allosteric effects. But they are not likely to reflect differences in binding affinity.</p><p>New Suppl. Fig. S3 now adds HMQC titrations of VTX11e and GDC0994 into 2P-ERK2, which confirm binding saturation based on the disappearance of free enzyme peaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Do the authors have any evidence for the dynamic effects of the different inhibitors? Of course, a systematic analysis of the protein dynamics by NMR will require a significant amount of time and effort beyond this work. However, did the authors measure the effects of the inhibitors on the linewidths of the methyl groups distal from the binding site?</p><p>Response: As recommended, we examined linewidths of selected peaks in the presence and absence of inhibitors. The results show no significant systematic differences between bound and free ERK2. Therefore dynamic effects of different inhibitors are not indicated by the available data.</p><p>f) The authors identified the b3-aC loop as a critical element for the internal network of interactions. Can this structural element be targeted by small molecules as well?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Yes, in fact the X-ray structures of 0P-ERK2 bound to the inhibitor, SCH772984, and 2P-ERK2 bound to the related compound, SCHCPD336, both show inhibitor occupying a pocket between between strand β3 and helix αC, leading to disruption of β3-αC contacts (Chaikaud et al., NSMB 2014; Pegram et al., PNAS 2019). To the extent that β3-αC contacts are important for conformation selection to the R-state, this may explain why SCH772984 favors the L-state.
