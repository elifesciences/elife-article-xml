While infections in humans are relatively rare, mortality rates range from 1 to 40% depending on the hantavirus species. There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for hantaviruses, and the only treatment for infection is supportive care for respiratory or kidney failure. Additionally, the human humoral immune response to hantavirus infection is incompletely understood, especially the location of major antigenic sites on the viral glycoproteins and conserved neutralizing epitopes. Here, we report antigenic mapping and functional characterization for four neutralizing hantavirus antibodies. The broadly neutralizing antibody SNV-53 targets an interface between Gn/Gc, neutralizes through fusion inhibition and cross-protects against the Old World hantavirus species Hantaan virus when administered pre- or post-exposure. Another broad antibody, SNV-24, also neutralizes through fusion inhibition but targets domain I of Gc and demonstrates weak neutralizing activity to authentic hantaviruses. ANDV-specific, neutralizing antibodies (ANDV-5 and ANDV-34) neutralize through attachment blocking and protect against hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in animals but target two different antigenic faces on the head domain of Gn. Determining the antigenic sites for neutralizing antibodies will contribute to further therapeutic development for hantavirus-related diseases and inform the design of new broadly protective hantavirus vaccines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hantavirus</kwd><kwd>bunyavirus</kwd><kwd>Sin Nombre virus</kwd><kwd>Andes virus</kwd><kwd>Hantaan virus</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32GM008320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engdahl</surname><given-names>Taylor B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Military Infectious Diseases Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MI210048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hooper</surname><given-names>Jay W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 OD030292</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crowe</surname><given-names>James E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human antibodies that neutralize New World hantaviruses are promising for prevention or treatment of these high-priority emerging pathogens carried by rodents and transmitted to humans by aerosolized excreta or, in rare cases, person-to-person contact.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hantaviruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens that are endemic worldwide and classified into two categories based on the geographic distribution of their reservoir hosts and pathogenesis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jonsson et al., 2010</xref>). Almost 60 virus species have been identified in rodents or shrews, and over 20 species cause disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laenen et al., 2019</xref>). Old World hantaviruses, including Hantaan virus (HTNV), Puumala virus (PUUV), Dobrava -Belgrade virus (DOBV), and Seoul virus (SEOV), mainly occur in Eastern Europe and China and cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). New World hantaviruses (NWHs), including Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and Andes virus (ANDV), are endemic in North and South America and cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). Person-to-person transmission of ANDV has been reported, including in a recent outbreak in Argentina resulting in 34 confirmed cases and 11 fatalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martinez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martínez et al., 2020</xref>). There are no current FDA-approved medical countermeasures to prevent or treat hantavirus-related disease.</p><p>The viral glycoproteins, designated Gn and Gc, form a hetero-tetrameric spike on the surface of the hantavirus virion and facilitate attachment and entry. Previous studies have reported crystal structures for the Gn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rissanen et al., 2017</xref>) and Gc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guardado-Calvo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Willensky et al., 2016</xref>) ectodomains of PUUV and HTNV, and recent work has described the molecular organization of Gn/Gc on the virion surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serris et al., 2020</xref>). Gc is a class II fusion protein and undergoes conformational changes triggered by low pH to mediate the fusion of the viral and host endosomal membranes. Gn is proposed to play a role in receptor attachment and stabilize and prevent the premature fusogenic triggering of Gc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mittler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bignon et al., 2019</xref>). Structural studies have identified a capping loop on Gn that shields the fusion loop on Gc, and the glycoprotein complex is thought to undergo dynamic rearrangements between a closed (or capped) and open (or uncapped) form of the spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bignon et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Recent efforts have identified features of the molecular basis of neutralization by some antibodies targeting HTNV Gn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rissanen et al., 2021</xref>) or PUUV Gc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rissanen et al., 2020</xref>). A rabbit-derived antibody, HTN-Gn1, targets domain A on Gn and overlaps with the putative binding sites for other murine-derived HTNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arikawa et al., 1992</xref>) and ANDV mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duehr et al., 2020</xref>). An antibody isolated from a bank vole, P-4G2, targets a site spanning domain I and II on Gc that is occluded in the post-fusion trimeric form, suggesting that the antibody may neutralize through blocking conformational changes required for fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Willensky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rissanen et al., 2020</xref>). Although mAb P-4G2 neutralizes PUUV and ANDV, this activity has only been tested in pseudovirus neutralization assays, and it is unknown if the antigenic site on Gc is occluded on the surface of the authentic virus. Also, these antibodies were not derived from human B cells and were not induced by natural infection, but rather were elicited following inoculation of animals immunization with recombinant protein, recombinant VSV constructs, or virus-infected tissues. It is unclear what sites are accessible to antibodies during a natural infection, and if human antibodies target antigenic sites that differ from those recognized by rodents. The first clues toward the sites of vulnerability on the Gn/Gc spike for the human antibody response were recently described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mittler et al., 2022</xref>. A panel of 135 antibodies were isolated from convalescent PUUV donors, and two distinct neutralizing sites were determined by negative stain electron microscopy (nsEM); one at the Gn/Gc interface and one on prefusion exposed surface of Gc domain I. ADI-42898, a quaternary-site mAb, demonstrated cross-clade neutralizing activity and protected in both PUUV bank vole and ANDV hamster post-exposure challenge models. However, mAbs targeting Gn were not described, and, due to its level of surface exposure, the N-terminal domain of Gn likely represents a major site of the neutralizing human antibody response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engdahl and Crowe, 2020</xref>). Gn exhibits a higher degree of sequence variability than Gc, likely indicating that Gn is under more immune pressure than Gc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we characterized a panel of human mAbs isolated against Gn/Gc from survivors of SNV or ANDV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engdahl et al., 2021</xref>). We demonstrated that NWHs antibodies target at least eight distinct sites on the ANDV Gn/Gc complex, four of which contained potently neutralizing antibody clones, but the location of those sites on the Gn/Gc spike was not known. Here, we define four distinct neutralizing antigenic sites on the Gn/Gc complex. Two potently neutralizing species-specific antibodies, ANDV-5 and ANDV-34, map to two non-overlapping epitopes in the Gn ectodomain and neutralize the virus by blocking attachment. We also show that these antibodies are similar to two human antibody clones previously isolated, MIB22 and JL16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garrido et al., 2018</xref>). Broadly neutralizing antibodies, ANDV-44 and SNV-53, map to the interface of Gn/Gc, while a less potently neutralizing but broadly reactive antibody, SNV-24, targets domain I of Gc. Both classes of broad antibodies function by inhibiting the triggering of fusion. These data shed light on the basis for both ANDV-specific and broad hantavirus recognition by these antibody clones and suggest that hantavirus vaccine designs should focus on effectively eliciting antibodies to these sites of vulnerability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neutralizing antibodies target at least four sites on ANDV Gn<sup>H</sup>/Gc spike</title><p>The hantavirus glycoprotein spike forms a complex hetero-tetrameric structure on the surface of the virus and is composed of two proteins, Gn and Gc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guardado-Calvo and Rey, 2021a</xref>). Gn is separated into two main domains: an N-terminal, membrane-distal Gn head domain (Gn<sup>H</sup>), and a C-terminal Gn base domain (Gn<sup>B</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serris et al., 2020</xref>). Gn<sup>H</sup> likely functions in viral attachment, but also has a ‘capping loop’ region that interfaces with the Gc fusion loop to prevent premature exposure of the hydrophobic loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bignon et al., 2019</xref>). Due to the surface exposure and sequence variability of Gn<sup>H</sup>, it is likely immunodominant compared to Gc and Gn<sup>B17</sup>. Gn<sup>B</sup> promotes the tetramerization of the complex and is shielded from immune recognition in the Gn/Gc complex. We previously isolated a panel of 36 mAbs from human survivors who were naturally infected with SNV or ANDV, and we demonstrated that the mAbs target eight sites on Gn/Gc, several of which are sites of vulnerability for neutralization. We selected five representative mAbs from this panel for further study to determine the features of the neutralizing antigenic sites.

Most of the mAbs, apart from ANDV-34 and rMIB22, demonstrated reactivity to Maporal (MAPV) Gn<sup>H</sup>/Gc, a closely related species to ANDV. ANDV nAbs (ANDV-34, ANDV-5, rMIB22, and rJL16) all displayed binding reactivity to Gn<sup>H</sup>, with EC<sub>50</sub> values less than 100 ng/mL except for rMIB22 (EC<sub>50</sub> value 5.6 µg/mL). SNV-24 was the only antibody that displayed reactivity to Gc, and we did not detect binding reactivity to Gn<sup>B</sup> for any mAbs tested. Notably, bnAbs ANDV-44 and SNV-53 did not have detectable binding to Gn<sup>H</sup>, Gn<sup>B</sup>, or Gc alone, and only bound to the linked Gn<sup>H</sup>/Gc antigen, suggesting these antibodies bind a quaternary site only present on the Gn/Gc heterodimer.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hantavirus neutralizing antibodies target four distinct regions on the glycoprotein spike.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Binding potency of mAbs to recombinant hantavirus antigens, ANDV Gn<sup>H</sup>/Gc, ANDV Gn<sup>H</sup>/Gc_H953F, MAPV Gn<sup>H</sup>/Gc, ANDV Gn<sup>H</sup>, ANDV Gn<sup>B</sup>, ANDV Gc, expressed in S2 cells.

We next sought to identify neutralization-resistant viral variants for each of the seven nAbs described in this study. To do this, we employed two different methods: (1) a high-throughput escape mutant generation assay using real-time cellular analysis based on similar assays previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilchuk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greaney et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Suryadevara et al., 2022</xref>) and (2) serial passaging of virus in increasing concentrations of neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Previously, we demonstrated that our mAbs showed similar neutralization potencies for VSV-pseudotyped viruses and authentic viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engdahl et al., 2021</xref>). The one class of mAbs that demonstrated a notable discrepancy was that of Gc-targeting mAbs, such as SNV-24, which showed an ~1000 fold lower neutralization potency for authentic viruses compared to VSV-pseudotyped viruses. Based on the general similarities between the two systems, we considered the VSV surrogate system appropriate to study escape mutation generation of escape mutant glycoprotein sequences. Thus, for all neutralization assays, we employed pseudotyped VSVs bearing the glycoproteins Gn/Gc from either the SNV or ANDV species. For RTCA-based escape mutant generation, we tested each antibody at saturating neutralization conditions and evaluated escape based on delayed cytopathic effect (CPE) in each individual replicate well. Thus, if a replicate well demonstrated a delayed drop in cellular impedance, this finding indicated the presence of an escape mutant virus and was noted out of the total number of replicate wells to give a percentage of escape. Notably, we did not detect escape mutants using this method for most neutralizing antibodies (e.g. SNV-53, ANDV-44, SNV-24, ANDV-34, or ANDV-5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). For example, we could not detect any escape mutants through this method for SNV-53, even though we attempted 368 replicates with the VSV/SNV virus and 184 replicates with the VSV/ANDV virus for selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Escape mutant generation and mutagenesis mapping indicate critical binding residues for hantavirus mAbs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Results from viral escape selection for indicated antibodies.

All sequenced rMIB22-selected viruses bore the mutation K76T. Due to the high number of replicates demonstrating a neutralization escape phenotype and the fact that all the escape viruses isolated had the K76T mutation, it is likely that this escape mutation was present at a high proportion in the viral preparation’s original stock. Five rJL16-selected virus sequences had an L224R mutation, and one had an L224P mutation. Overall, these results indicate that identifying viral escape from hantavirus neutralizing antibodies using this method is possible but suggests a low likelihood of in vitro escape for most of the potently neutralizing hantavirus nAbs targeting multiple distinct antigenic regions we selected for study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mapping mutations in antibody escape variant viruses selected with ANDV-specific nAbs or bnAbs</title><p>Although we could not select escape mutants in a high-throughput, single passage approach for five of the mAbs, we still wanted to map the critical binding residues and identify escape mutations for the neutralizing antibodies of interest.

ANDV-34-selected viruses contained mutations S309Y and D336Y, two residues on the surface exposed face of Gn domain B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). rMIB22-resistant variant viruses contained a single mutation, K76T, located in domain A of Gn in close spatial proximity to S336, corresponding with binning analysis for these mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

For SNV-24, we selected escape mutants D822E and K833N in the variant VSV/ANDV viruses and a single homologous mutation, K834N, in the escape-resistant VSV/SNV. Residues K86, Y760, D822, and K833 are highly conserved among members of the <italic>Orthohantavirus</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mapping of ANDV-specific nAb and bnAb epitopes by mutagenesis</title><p>Since most of the neutralization-resistant viruses contained multiple mutations, we next sought to identify which mutant residues impacted antibody binding. We generated a panel of single- or double-point mutants in the SNV or ANDV M-segment genes based on escape mutants that we selected with mAbs and previously published VSV/ANDV escape mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duehr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garrido et al., 2018</xref>). We expressed each mutant M segment gene on the surface of Expi293F cells and used a flow cytometric binding assay to assess how each variant impacted mAb binding. The % wild-type (WT) values were generated by dividing the binding of the mutant by that of the WT construct, and values were normalized based on a positive control oligoclonal mix of mAbs.</p><p>The expression levels of SNV and ANDV M-segment variants were comparable to that of the WT constructs, except for three single-point mutants: A270D, C1129F, and K759E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). All three mutations were identified in infectious VSVs, so it is not clear why we could not detect the expression of the mutated proteins. Notably, these residues all co-occurred with additional mutations, indicating that these residues may be found in functionally constrained sites.</p><p>Most single-point mutants we identified partially impacted the corresponding mAb binding reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). However, the loss-of-binding phenotype was most evident for the double-mutant M-segment genes, suggesting that multiple mutations are required to generate neutralization-resistant variants. We identified a few single mutations that impacted the binding of multiple broadly-neutralizing mAbs. For example, Y760F (a residue near the fusion loop) ablates the binding of ANDV-44/SNV-53 (Gn/Gc interface) and SNV-24 (Gc domain I). Another single point-mutant, D822E (located in Gc domain I), also reduced the binding of all bnAbs. This finding may indicate that this altered residue promotes rearrangements of Gn/Gc that have allosteric effects on interface mAb binding. Additionally, one double mutant, S309Y/D336Y, exhibited a moderate reduction of the binding of the bnAbs and lost binding of ANDV-specific nAbs tested. Both residues are located on Gn domain B and could represent a critical evolutionary strategy to escape species-specific immunity. If amino acid changes in highly immunogenic epitopes on Gn domain B do not impact viral fitness, then genetic changes in these sites may occur over time or in the case of a large outbreak.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>BnAbs recognize two antigenic sites on Gn/Gc</title><p>Next, we sought to determine the location of the antigenic sites targeted by bnAbs, SNV-53 and SNV-24, using negative-stain electron microscopy of MAPV Gn<sup>H</sup>/Gc in complex with antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). To identify and dock the right Fabs to the maps, we used the information from the binding groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and escape mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The 3D reconstructions (EMD-26735) of SNV-53 and SNV-24 in complex with the MAPV Gn<sup>H</sup>/Gc heterodimer showed that the Fabs localize to two distinct regions in proximity to the corresponding viral escape mutations selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). SNV-24 bound to Gc domain I, an epitope that is only accessible in the pre-fusion state of Gc and is near the interface between inter-spike Gc heterodimers. P-4G2 (a bank vole-derived mAb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rissanen et al., 2021</xref>) and group II human PUUV mAbs described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mittler et al., 2022</xref>) also map to a similar site on Gc. This site has limited accessibility in the full virus lattice structure due to neighboring interspike contacts and may results in the incomplete neutralizing activity to authentic virus we demonstrated by these mAbs previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engdahl et al., 2021</xref>). Based on escape mutants generated and nsEM reconstructions, SNV-53 may interact with the capping loop region on Gn, which interfaces with the <italic>cd</italic> and <italic>bc</italic> loops on domain II of Gc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serris et al., 2020</xref>). This 3D reconstruction supports our previous finding that bnAbs SNV-53 and ANDV-44 target a quaternary epitope only accessible on the Gn/Gc heterodimer and is consistent with the broadly protective site targeted by ADI-42898 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mittler et al., 2022</xref>).

SNV-24 binding maps to the fusogenic protein Gc, while SNV-53 also had critical binding residues located in the capping loop on Gn and the fusion loop on Gc.

The selection of optimal lead candidate antibodies for monotherapy or rational composition of an antibody combination requires detailed information on the antigenic sites of vulnerability to inhibition. Here, we defined four major antigenic sites on the hantavirus Gn/Gc complex recognized by neutralizing and protective antibodies. The antibodies are promising for development as biologics, and the landscape analysis of protective sites that emerges from the mapping studies provides a blueprint for virus species-specific or broadly protective vaccine design.</p><p>Two classes of broad antibodies we describe exhibit breadth and likely neutralize through viral fusion inhibition. These antibodies are strikingly similar to group I and group II bnAbs isolated from PUUV convalescent donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mittler et al., 2022</xref>), demonstrating the immunodominance of these antigenic sites recognized by the human humoral repertoire. Apart from flaviviruses, canonical class II fusions proteins are hidden in the three-dimensional structure of the glycoprotein spike by an accompanying protein to prevent premature fusion during viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guardado-Calvo and Rey, 2021b</xref>). Once viral attachment occurs, the virion is taken up in the endosome, where low-pH triggers the dissociation of the complex and exposes the hydrophobic fusion loop initiating viral-host cell fusion and entry into the cytoplasm. We propose that one class of hantavirus bnAbs we have studied here (i.e. SNV-53 and ANDV-44) stabilize the association of Gn (the accompanying protein) to Gc (the fusion protein) by binding to and cross-linking the two subunits – preventing the heterodimer from undergoing conformational changes necessary for fusion.</p><p>BnAbs that span the heterodimeric interface also have been described for other enveloped viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colbert et al., 2019</xref>), Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapman et al., 2021</xref>), and chikungunya virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). One antibody, RVFV-140, isolated from a Rift Valley Fever virus survivor, potently neutralizes RVFV through a fusion inhibition mechanism and targets an epitope only present on the Gn/Gc hetero-hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapman et al., 2021</xref>). Interface targeting antibodies can aid in the structural determination of heterodimers; the structure of the hepatitis C virus E1E2 heterodimer was determined by co-expressing the complex with a bnAb, AR4A, which targets an epitope proximal to the E1E2 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de la Peña et al., 2021</xref>). Altogether, the data indicate that there exists an essential class of bnAbs that target quaternary epitopes at the interface regions on heterodimers for many viruses. These antibodies appear to be induced by viruses in diverse families that use heterodimeric surface glycoproteins, and the shared mechanism appears to be fusion inhibition by preventing the complex conformational changes required for viral fusion. The structures of the antigenic sites recognized by these rare antibodies could provide a blueprint for structure-based reverse vaccinology efforts to design stabilized viral immunogens to elicit a broad, protective antibody response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byrne and McLellan, 2022</xref>).</p><p>SNV-53 did cross-protect both in prophylactic and therapeutic small animal models of HTNV and ANDV infection, suggesting that SNV-53 is a promising candidate for treating both HCPS and HFRS. Based on studies using germline revertant forms of these antibodies, SNV-53 and ANDV-44 have developed their breadth and neutralization potency across multiple species through the accumulation of somatic mutations. It may be possible to continue to affinity mature SNV-53-like antibodies to increase the potency and breadth across species. Combined with the recent description of Gn/Gc interface mAbs from PUUV convalescent donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mittler et al., 2022</xref>), our findings indicate that these types of antibodies can be readily elicited during natural infection and are likely critical to pan-hantavirus therapeutic and vaccine development.</p><p>The second class of bnAbs, exemplified by SNV-24, targets the domain I region on Gc. This region is highly conserved, which likely explains why SNV-24 demonstrates broad reactivity. The putative epitope for SNV-24 is near the epitope identified for bank vole-derived antibodies 1C9 and 4G2, and a putative mechanism for this antibody class is the inhibition of viral fusion through blocking the formation of a post-fusion trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rissanen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lundkvist and Niklasson, 1992</xref>). However, this site contacts neighboring Gc protomers, therefore, it may not be fully accessible on the lattice virion surface. These accessibility considerations may contribute to the observed incomplete neutralization of authentic hantaviruses by SNV-24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mittler et al., 2022</xref>). SNV-24 does potently neutralize hantavirus glycoprotein pseudotyped VSVs, but this finding might be due to an alternative arrangement of the glycoprotein spikes on the VSV virion that does not correctly mimic the glycoprotein array on authentic viruses.</p><p>Although understanding bnAbs is important, ANDV-specific nAbs will still be critical to deploying medical countermeasures. ANDV represents the only hantavirus shown to transmit person-to-person and causes notable outbreaks yearly in South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martínez et al., 2020</xref>). Potently neutralizing ANDV antibodies – represented by ANDV-5 and ANDV-34 – target two distinct faces of the globular, membrane distal Gn head domain. The epitope for ANDV-5 maps to the α–3 and α–4 helices, while ANDV-34 targets domain B. Both sites of vulnerability do not overlap with the epitopes determined for previously described Gn-targeting mAbs, HTN-Gn1 and nnHTN-Gn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rissanen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rissanen et al., 2021</xref>). A canonical neutralization mechanism used by potent antibodies is to block the attachment of viruses to host cells. Here, we demonstrate that selected ANDV-neutralizing human mAbs block virus binding to the receptor for hantavirus entry protocadherin-1 (PCDH-1), specifically to the first extracellular (EC-1) domain amino-acid (residues 61–172) or EC-2 domain (residues 173–284) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jangra et al., 2018</xref>). The finding that ANDV-specific, potently neutralizing mAbs function through PCDH-1 blockade is consistent with the finding that PCDH-1 is used by NWHs but not Old World hantaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jangra et al., 2018</xref>). Although the RBS on hantavirus glycoproteins is currently unknown, we propose that the site likely overlaps with the epitope of ANDV-5 since the Fab form of ANDV-5 also competes with sEC1-EC2 indicating that steric clashes are the not the primary driver of receptor blocking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mittler et al., 2019</xref>). However, it also possible that the RBS spans two Gn:Gn protomers, as we demonstrated that ANDV-5 Fab may contact neighboring, intraspike Gn subunits. Both antibodies protect against HCPS-like disease in Syrian hamsters, indicating that both epitopes on the Gn can elicit a protective neutralizing antibody response.</p><p>We also show that JL16 can be categorized in a similar antibody class as ANDV-5, while MIB22 can be classified into a similar class as ANDV-34.

V<sub>H</sub>1-69 gene usage is overrepresented in antiviral antibodies due to the genetic characteristics of the germline-encoded CDRH2 loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Rational vaccine design should promote the formation of V<sub>H</sub>1-69 antibodies since they have a low somatic hypermutation barrier to high-affinity binding and can be readily elicited in most individuals. Hydrophobic interactions facilitated by the templated amino acids in the CDHR2 loop may contribute to recognizing ANDV Gn by naïve B cells during acute infection.</p><p>RNA viruses are particularly prone to mutations and rapid viral evolution, therefore, prospective identification of escape mutations and defining the likelihood of escape is an essential step in developing antibody combinations. Strikingly, five of the nAbs tested here were particularly resistant to escape, and most escape mutants eventually selected through serial passaging had multiple mutations. This finding could indicate that a single mutation is insufficient to confer antibody escape while maintaining the functionality required for viral fitness. Although it was challenging to generate neutralization-resistant variants, we did show that some single mutations could completely ablate the binding of multiple antibodies, even if the mutation was located distant from the putative binding site in the three-dimensional structure. It has been previously demonstrated in other viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, that single mutations can have functional consequences on the 3D structure of antigenic proteins, thereby altering antibody activity. For example, S371L confers resistance to numerous SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from multiple classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), while E406W causes allosteric remodeling of the receptor-binding domain that significantly impacts the binding of the REGEN-CoV therapeutic monoclonal antibody cocktail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Addetia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Starr et al., 2021</xref>). Using antibody combinations that resist escape from single-point mutations is an important objective.

It is not clear the benefit of combining these two mAbs, since they partially compete for binding, have a similar mechanism of action, and are vulnerable to escape from similar amino acid changes (S309Y/D336Y).</p><p>There is still much to learn about the humoral immune response to the hantavirus Gn and Gc proteins, including where major functional epitopes are.

To measure pH-independent plasma membrane fusion of viral particles, control wells were incubated with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.2% BSA and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) for 2 min at 37 °C. The medium was aspirated, and cells were incubated at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, and 20 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (pH 7.4). After 16 hr, the medium was removed, the cells were imaged on an CTL ImmunoSpot S6 Analyzer (CTL), and GFP-positive cells were counted in each well.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>HTNV hamster challenge and passive transfer</title><p>Female Syrian hamsters (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>) 6–8 weeks of age (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) were anesthetized by inhalation of vaporized isoflurane using an IMPAC6 veterinary anesthesia machine. Once anesthetized, hamsters were injected with the indicated concentration of HTNV diluted in 0.2 mL PBS by the i.m. (caudal thigh) route using a 25-gauge, 1-inch needle at a single injection site. Antibodies were administered at the indicated concentrations and days to anesthetized hamsters by i.p. injection using a 23-gauge, 1-inch needle. Vena cava blood draws occurred on anesthetized hamsters within approved blood collection limitations. Terminal blood collection occurred under KAX (ketamine-acepromazine-xylazine) anesthesia and prior to pentobarbital sodium for euthanasia. All animal procedures were conducted in an animal biosafety level (ABSL-3) laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>HTNV pseudovirion neutralization assay (PsVNA)</title><p>The PsVNA using a non-replicating VSVΔG-luciferase pseudovirion system was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwilas et al., 2014</xref>).

Animals (n=6 per group) were treated with 10 mg/kg of rANDV-34, rANDV-5, or rDENV 2D22 (a negative control dengue virus-specific antibody) by the i.p. route on days 2 and 5 after virus inoculation. Body weight and body temperature were measured each day, starting at day 0. On day 28 post-challenge, all animals were euthanized with an overdose of anesthetic (isoflurane or ketamine/xylazine) followed by bilateral thoracotomy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis for each experiment is described in Materials and methods and/or in the Figure legends.

The results teach us about the viral structures that are targets for neutralization and the results are relevant for vaccine development and antibody therapeutic design. The evidence provided is convincing and the results are important and should be of interest to immunologists, virologists, and those working on antibody engineering and therapeutic antibodies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81743.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Casadevall</surname><given-names>Arturo</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.19.500579">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.19.500579v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arturo Casadevall as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers were impressed by the quality and importance of your work and felt the paper merited eventual publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after a revision that would require additional experimental data.</p><p>1. Additional experimental efforts are requested for the section detailing the mapping of escape variants as well as clarification of methods employed and corrections of inconsistencies in written text.</p><p>2. Note the criticisms about the glycosylation data. Reviewers felt that some of the missing data must be included. The data regarding the Gn/Gc epitope needs to be clear since that affects the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>3. Additional experimental or written justifications may be required for animal studies given the differences used in the treatment regimens and limited measurements of outcomes (i.e., requested information of viremia, plaque assay, such as titration of the RNA levels in ANDV challenge model in hamsters (Figure 7)).</p><p>4. The reviewers were divided on the need to validate your findings with live virus experiments. On one hand, such data would greatly strengthen the findings and your own prior work (ref 18) has shown that significant IC50 titer difference can occur for some mAbs. On the other, we recognize that this would require considerable additional work and that prior data exists that supports the correspondence between systems. If you have such data and can provide it, at least for some of the viruses that would strengthen the paper. One possible compromise is to better highlight the prior results with the authentic virus at the beginning of the Results section so that the reader is aware of what has correlated and not correlated in this system.</p><p>I look forward to a revised paper. Please know that I will send it to the reviewers again so I urge you to do all you can to address their comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Comments on data processing and figures: The above indicated figures lack the original data from which they have been obtained.</p><p>Figure 1b: please indicate the % value obtained from competition and the Pearson correlation used to establish the clusters as indicated in the methods.</p><p>Please note that the bar indicated below the figure seems to be inverted in colors (0% competition black, 100% competition white).</p><p>Figure 2a: Is there any original data that could be shown to support the data indicated in the table? Definitively, the data shown in the last row of the table should be provided. Please note that the text (lines 193-194) describing escape mutants of ANDV-44 and SNDV-53 (total of 7 mutations) does not coincide with the mutations shown in the table (for each antibody only two mutations are shown).</p><p>Also, it is hard for the reader to differentiate between the two methods used to generate the escape mutants. It would important to include the method of the single passage replicates in the methods section. For a better comparison of both methods, the total time used to allow for viral replication in each method may be helpful.</p><p>Also, the authors should clarify lines 166-168 &quot;mutations was present … in the viral original preparation´s stock&quot;.</p><p>Figure 2c: Please provide the original flow cytometry binding data of the antibodies to the different mutant constructs as represented in the table.</p><p>Ext. Data Figure 4: Please indicate the peptide coverage achieved in presence and absence of the antibodies and HDX exchange in the linear sequence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The manuscript requires extensive editing and editing of jargon. Highlights of the issues are as follows:</p><p>a. &quot;Orthohantaviruses&quot; is not a word. Proper use of this is when refereeing to the genus Orthohantavirus (in italics) Hence it is not plural. The term &quot;hantaviruses&quot; is the common name and may be used instead. Or one may state, hantaviruses, a member of the Orthohantavirus genus, family Hantaviridae ….. please correct throughout.</p><p>b. Sin nombre orthohantavirus – in italics_(SNV) is the species not Sin Nombre. Sin nombre virus is the common name.</p><p>c. Andes orthohantavirus (ANDV) is the species not Andes. Andes virus is the common name.</p><p>d. Correct for all names that are referred to as species.</p><p>e. Spell out new or Old World hantaviruses; there is no need for the acronym as it is used only a few times.</p><p>f. Ribavirin is approved.</p><p>g. Line 49- not hantavirus species- use Orthohantaviruses. There is the family Hantaviridae and the authors are only focused on this genus.</p><p>h. S2- please help the reader- what are S2 cells?</p><p>i. PSVNA- please spell out- see sentence 367 for example. Perhaps restate as neutralizing antibodies were measured using an ANDV/VSV pseudovirus. This needs to be explicitly stated so the reader can follow what is being done. See figure legends also and add information.</p><p>j. Figure 1a. State what antigen is being used.</p><p>k. Figure legends do not stand alone and hence they need to walk the reader through the figure. It is very hard to interpret based on the information given.</p><p>l. Figure 5 a and b legend are missing in my version.</p><p>m. Figure 5 c legend – what is real-time analysis?</p><p>n. See figure legends and edit so the reader can follow what has been done. The descriptions are too brief and informative.</p><p>o. Remove jargon in methods- RTCA for example. These are just standard assays and do not need new acronyms; see also FFWO- that is also not needed.</p><p>p. Line 320- add publication being referred to in this sentence.</p><p>q. The manuscript focuses on SNV and ANDV yet the majority of cases in South America are in Brazil. Brazil is not mentioned. The reader may not appreciate the extensive number of cases in Brazil. Do these antibodies cross-react with viruses from this region. The authors should edit the manuscript accordingly to provide readers a balanced perspective. When one includes cases in Brazil, they may be the same as in Europe each year.</p><p>r. This list is not comprehensive- please review manuscript and correct throughout.</p><p>2. Experimental weaknesses</p><p>a. In the section on mapping escape variants, it is unclear why the focus would be on the VSV pseudotyped viruses. The proof of escape variants should be done with the live virus to avoid artifacts with the hanta/vsv. The VSV is a different shape, has a different replication kinetic, and the glycoproteins on the hantaviruses are not packed on the surface. Hence this approach is not acceptable alone. It must be confirmed with the actual virus.</p><p>b. The animal studies are key to evaluation of the therapeutic potential of the antibodies. Why did the authors use real-time qPCR and not evaluate the level of live virus by plaque assay. Please include limit of detection on the graphs or in the figure legends.</p><p>c. In the animal studies, the time of treatment differs for each but the explanation of why the treatment times or doses are not provided. This needs to be stated for each study and clarified.</p><p>3. Weaknesses in Premise and Conclusions</p><p>a. The abstract states that the humoral response to hantaviruses is incomplete understood. As there is an extensive body of work on the Old World hantaviruses, what is being suggested here? Do the authors refer to people or animal models or both?</p><p>b. The authors have identified and mapped novel monoclonal antibodies that bind to the glycoproteins of hantaviruses, however the in vitro neutralization conclusions are based on pseudotyped viruses which do not reflect the native virion. The authors need to show the same level of activity using live virus.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The data that show inhibition of viral attachment or fusion is based on VSV pseudostyles. However, as the authors note, there are differences in antibody potency in VSV pseudotypes versus the authentic virus. Therefore, authentic virus assays need to be conducted for Figure 5.</p><p>2. The hantavirus Gn/Gc antigens were produced in insect (S2) cells. The glycosylation patterns are very likely to be quite different from the physiologic protein produced in mammalian cells. This needs to be acknowledged and addressed.</p><p>3. In the Results section, it is not clear where the mAbs characterized in this paper were originally isolated. Please clarify.</p><p>4. The data from Figure 2a are not clearly described in the text.</p><p>5. The structural data from Figure 3 for broadly neutralizing SNV mAbs uses Maporal virus glycoproteins, which is not a human pathogenic hantavirus. The rest of the structure data uses Andes virus glycoproteins. It is not mentioned why this was done. Are similar sites bound by the mAbs in pathogenic New World hantaviruses?</p><p>6. It would be useful to show whether there is a correlation between the day 0 neutralizing titer and control of viral replication in the in vivo studies (Figure 6b and 6c, and Figure 6f, g, h).</p><p>7. Viremia for the Andes virus in vivo study in Figure 7b should be included.</p><p>8. There are some statements that are unclear or potentially inaccurate that should be addressed:</p><p>– Line 39 needs to be rephrased to clarify that hantavirus infections in Europe and Asia do not typically have up to 40% lethality rates.</p><p>– Lines 226-227 states &quot;Both residues are located on Gn domain B and could represent a critical evolutionary strategy to escape species-specific immunity.&quot; This is not well-explained.</p><p>– Lines 216-217 and 219-220 appear to be contradictory.</p><p>– Lines 400-401 state there are not significant reductions in RNA levels in Figure 6g, but the figure itself show statistical significance.</p><p>– Line 97, the PUUV studies were conducted in bank voles, not hamsters, in reference 16.</p><p>– Line 90-91 states &quot;Also, these antibodies are not human, and it is unclear what sites are accessible to antibodies during a natural human infection.&quot; Please clarify why binding sites on Gn/Gc would be accessible in vitro but not in vivo.</p><p>– Lines 123-125, what is the evidence that sequence variability of Gn causes it to be immunodominant?</p><p>– Lines 166-168, what is the evidence that escape mutations were already present in the VSV-Gn/Gc stock? Was the stock deep-sequenced?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81743.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers were impressed by the quality and importance of your work and felt the paper merited eventual publication in eLife after a revision that would require additional experimental data.</p><p>1.

The data regarding the Gn/Gc epitope needs to be clear since that affects the conclusions of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this comment from reviewer 3 below. Although glycosylation is important and does vary based on the expression system, there are very few known glycosylation sites on the hantavirus Gn/Gc proteins, and it is unlikely that any known glycan sites impact antibody binding. We did not observe any notable differences between the binding of our antibodies to Gn/Gc proteins expressed on the surface of mammalian cells (Expi293F) or to the recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells. We also did not identify any known glycosylation sites as critical residues for binding, either through escape mutant mapping or through structural studies. Thus, for these specific neutralizing sites, we do not observe that glycosylation plays a significant role in antibody binding. Two glycans, N138 and N350, that may impact antibodies that bind at the Gn/Gc interface (ANDV-44 and SNV-53) exist in the capping loop region, but we did not have high enough resolution EM data to identify the molecular interactions of SNV-53 or ANDV-44 with Gn. Future work should tease this point out further, but such investigations are beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Additional experimental or written justifications may be required for animal studies given the differences used in the treatment regimens and limited measurements of outcomes (i.e., requested information of viremia, plaque assay, such as titration of the RNA levels in ANDV challenge model in hamsters (Figure 7)).</p></disp-quote><p>As was shown by others and in our earlier experiments (DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109086), viremia is not typical for ANDV infection, whereas detection of virus in organs (particularly in liver) is more indicative of systemic infection. In this experiment, we isolated ANDV from livers of all succumbed animals but from none of the survivors. Thus, we cannot make comparisons between treatment groups to determine if viremia was reduced in antibody treatment groups. Based on the survival curves and the neutralizing function of the mAbs tested, it is likely that the antibodies reduced virus in relevant organs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

If you have such data and can provide it, at least for some of the viruses that would strengthen the paper. One possible compromise is to better highlight the prior results with the authentic virus at the beginning of the Results section so that the reader is aware of what has correlated and not correlated in this system.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that VSV systems may have some limitations for studying hantavirus virology and repeating all in vitro neutralization-type assays with authentic virus could be used to confirm the findings. However, given the logistical difficulties of time delays in repeating all of the assays like the ones described in this study in BSL-3 space that are currently under pressure for COVID-19 Omicron virus and monkeypox virus studies, we do not consider the authentic virus assay repeats critical. The VSV system pseudotyped with Gn/Gc proteins does appear by all measures appropriate for studying antibodies that target the Gn/Gc complex. We and others (DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.abl5399) note the largest discrepancies between neutralization potency with Gc-targeting mAbs (such as SNV-24). Gn-targeting mAbs (such as ANDV-5, ANDV34, MIB22, JL16) and quaternary mAbs (such as SNV-53 and ANDV-44) seem to present highly correlated findings in both systems.</p><p>Therefore, to clarify this matter, we have added the following text in the beginning of the Results section under the header “Low likelihood of viral escape for neutralizing hantavirus antibodies”.</p><p>“Previously, we demonstrated that our mAbs show similar neutralization potencies between VSV pseudotyped viruses and authentic viruses<sup>18</sup>. The one class of mAbs that demonstrated a notable discrepancy were Gc-targeting mAbs, such as SNV-24, which has an ~1,000-fold loss in neutralization potency to authentic viruses.

Experimental weaknesses</p><p>a. In the section on mapping escape variants, it is unclear why the focus would be on the VSV pseudotyped viruses. The proof of escape variants should be done with the live virus to avoid artifacts with the hanta/vsv. The VSV is a different shape, has a different replication kinetic, and the glycoproteins on the hantaviruses are not packed on the surface. Hence this approach is not acceptable alone. It must be confirmed with the actual virus.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the gold standard would be to use authentic hantaviruses, however, we have previously demonstrated in Engdahl <italic>et al.</italic> (DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109086) that for the mAbs included in this study, the neutralization potencies are similar between the surrogate system and authentic viruses. Due to the practical considerations of working under BSL-3/4 conditions with live virus and restricted access currently due to Omicron and monkeypoxviruses, we find that using the VSV system is appropriate to investigate the mechanistic basis of antibody neutralization for this study. Future work could confirm the data we generated here with pseudotyped viruses as correlating with authentic viruses, but all prior evidence suggests they will correspond.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The animal studies are key to evaluation of the therapeutic potential of the antibodies. Why did the authors use real-time qPCR and not evaluate the level of live virus by plaque assay. Please include limit of detection on the graphs or in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated Figure 6 to include the limit of detection for the qPCR data. Unlike the Andes model, the nonlethal HTNV model does not have survival as an endpoint. Interestingly, the virus appears to cause viremia and seed endothelial cells throughout the animal, and this virus is not cleared from tissues even in the presence of a robust antibody response to infection, including neutralizing antibodies. To quantify the level of virus in the tissues we used qPCR. We also used ISH to get a more qualitative readout on the level of virus remaining in tissues on Day 28. A plaque assay could be used to determine the level of INFECTIOUS virus in those tissues; however, that information is not critical to support the findings of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. In the animal studies, the time of treatment differs for each but the explanation of why the treatment times or doses are not provided. This needs to be stated for each study and clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The hamster model of ANDV is extremely robust with minimal variation in disease progression and fast lethal outcome associated with infection. The incubation periods are short with the onset of clinical signs on days 9 to 10 and lethal outcome (or euthanasia for high clinical scores) during the following 1 to 2 days. It is important to provide the treatment and keep a high level of antibodies before the clinical onset of disease. In contrast, infection of hamsters with Hantaan virus (HTNV) results in an asymptomatic, disseminated infection. Nevertheless, in both models it generally understood that treatment with antibodies needs to occur before the viremic phase of the infection.</p><p>For the ANDV IM, model viremia is first detected on Day 6, so antibody treatment was started on Day 5 in time to prevent lethal disease (DOI: 10.1128/JVI.00238-07). The HTNV IM model is an infection model, not a lethal disease model. Thus, the treatment must have an impact on endpoints other than survival. One of the endpoints is seroconversion to the infection as measured by an&amp;-N ELISA. Previously we (DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00832) extended postexposure treatment with the positive control antibody used in this experiment, but the latest timepoint with “clean” protection data was Day 3 post-exposure, so that timepoint was chosen for this initial look at the SNV-53 monoclonal antibody in the HTNV infection model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Weaknesses in Premise and Conclusions</p><p>a. The abstract states that the humoral response to hantaviruses is incomplete understood. As there is an extensive body of work on the Old World hantaviruses, what is being suggested here? Do the authors refer to people or animal models or both?</p></disp-quote><p>The statement was specifically in reference to the human humoral response. We acknowledge and cite the body of literature related to murine, rabbit, and bank vole studies with Old World hantaviruses, but there are currently only three published studies characterizing antibodies isolated from human survivors of natural infection, and very little information of epitopes and mechanism of action—the gap we intended to fill with this work. We have revised the sentence with the qualifier “<italic>human</italic> humoral immune response”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The authors have identified and mapped novel monoclonal antibodies that bind to the glycoproteins of hantaviruses, however the in vitro neutralization conclusions are based on pseudotyped viruses which do not reflect the native virion. The authors need to show the same level of activity using live virus.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to essential revisions #4 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The data that show inhibition of viral attachment or fusion is based on VSV pseudostyles. However, as the authors note, there are differences in antibody potency in VSV pseudotypes versus the authentic virus. Therefore, authentic virus assays need to be conducted for Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in vitro assays with authentic viruses would be a relevant system, however, for practical reasons we used recombinant VSVs bearing the hantavirus glycoproteins. We acknowledge that there may be differences in the organization of the spikes on the virion surface, replication of the virus, and so on, that may impact our results. However, based on previous experiments in Engdahl <italic>et al.</italic> (DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109086) comparing neutralization IC<sub>50</sub> values between VSVs and authentic viruses, Gc-targeting antibodies were the only mAbs that demonstrated a discrepancy between the two systems (~1,000-fold less potent against authentic viruses). The only Gc targeting mAb we include is SNV-24 and we note this discrepancy several times in the text. Although one could repeat all of this work in the future, and we agree that it is desirable confirmatory data to have, it is also not feasible for us at this moment to repeat all work with authentic virus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The hantavirus Gn/Gc antigens were produced in insect (S2) cells. The glycosylation patterns are very likely to be quite different from the physiologic protein produced in mammalian cells. This needs to be acknowledged and addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the reviewer raises an important point since glycans on virions might vary widely depending on the cells infected, but these studies are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the Results section, it is not clear where the mAbs characterized in this paper were originally isolated. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text to the results to clarify where the mAbs came from:</p><p>“We previously isolated a panel of 36 mAbs from human survivors that were previously infected with SNV or ANDV, and demonstrated that the mAbs target eight sites on Gn/Gc, multiple of which were neutralizing. Thus, we picked five mAbs from our previously published panel to represent each site to further determine where neutralizing epitopes exist. We also produced recombinant IgG1 forms of two other previously published human mAbs, MIB22 or JL16 (hereafter, rMIB22 or rJL16), based on each antibody’s published heavy or light chain variable genes and cloned them into a human IgG1<sup>19</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The data from Figure 2a are not clearly described in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the text to help clarify:</p><p>“To do this, we employed two different methods: (1) a high throughput escape mutant generation assay using real-time cellular analysis based on similar assays previously described 21-23 and (2) serial passaging of virus in increasing concentrations of neutralizing antibodies (Figure 2a). Previously, we demonstrated that our mAbs show similar neutralization potencies between VSV pseudotyped viruses and authentic viruses18. The one class of mAbs that demonstrated a notable discrepancy were Gctargeting mAbs, such as SNV-24, which has ~1,000 fold loss in neutralization potency to authentic viruses. Based on the general similarities between the two systems, we thought the surrogate system was appropriate to study escape mutation generation. Thus, for all neutralization assays, we employed pseudotyped VSVs bearing the glycoproteins Gn/Gc from either SNV or ANDV species. For the RTCA escape mutant generation, we tested each antibody at saturating neutralization conditions and evaluated escape based on delayed cytopathic effect (CPE) in each individual replicate well. Thus, if a replicate well demonstrated a delayed drop in cellular impedance, this indicated the presence of an escape mutant virus and was noted out of the total number of replicate wells to give a percentage.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The structural data from Figure 3 for broadly neutralizing SNV mAbs uses Maporal virus glycoproteins, which is not a human pathogenic hantavirus. The rest of the structure data uses Andes virus glycoproteins. It is not mentioned why this was done. Are similar sites bound by the mAbs in pathogenic New World hantaviruses?</p></disp-quote><p>We did nsEM with Maporal virus due to practical considerations. When we prepared grids and examined them under the microscope, the MAPV GnH/Gc purified protein was more heterogenous compared to the ANDV GnH/Gc sample and we thought that this occurrence would give us higher quality data. MAPV and ANDV are highly similar, and the general sites targeted by SNV-53 and SNV-24 should not differ substantially between the two species. We do not have high resolution data to determine what the critical contract residues are or if they are conserved for SNV-24 and SNV-53 between the MAPV and ANDV Gn/Gc protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

We have edited the sentence to clarify that point:</p><p>“However, mAbs targeting Gn were not described, and, due to its level of surface exposure, the N-terminal domain of Gn likely represents a major site of the neutralizing human antibody response<sup>9,17</sup>.

The RTCA escape mutant generation does not require multiple passaging, and since escape was seen in most of the replicate wells it is likely – but not sequence confirmed – that these mutations were present in the original stock at some proportion and did not occur due to replication errors under repeated passaging and antibody selection.</p></body></sub-article></article>
