It operates via an 'alternating-access' mechanism, making iterative transitions between inward-facing (E<sub>1</sub>) and outward-facing (E<sub>2</sub>) conformations. Although the general features of the transport cycle are known, the detailed physicochemical factors governing the binding site selectivity remain mysterious. Free energy molecular dynamics simulations show that the ion binding sites switch their binding specificity in E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub>. This is accompanied by small structural arrangements and changes in protonation states of the coordinating residues. Additional computations on structural models of the intermediate states along the conformational transition pathway reveal that the free energy barrier toward the occlusion step is considerably increased when the wrong type of ion is loaded into the binding pocket, prohibiting the pump cycle from proceeding forward. This self-correcting mechanism strengthens the overall transport selectivity and protects the stoichiometry of the pump cycle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16616.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16616.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16616.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A protein called the sodium-potassium pump resides in the membrane that surrounds living cells. The role of this protein is to 'pump' sodium and potassium ions across the membrane to help restore their concentration inside and outside of the cell. About 25% of the body's energy is used to keep the pump going, rising to nearly 70% in the brain. Problems that affect the pump have been linked to several disorders, including heart, kidney and metabolic diseases, as well as severe neurological conditions.</p><p>The sodium-potassium pump must be able to effectively pick out the correct ions to transport from a mixture of many different types of ions. However, it was not clear how the pump succeeds in doing this efficiently. Rui et al. have now used a computational method called molecular dynamics simulations to model how the sodium-potassium pump transports the desired ions across the cell membrane.</p><p>The pump works via a so-called 'alternating-access' mechanism, repeatedly transitioning between inward-facing and outward-facing conformations. In each cycle, it binds three sodium ions from the cell’s interior and exports them to the outside. Then, the pump binds to two potassium ions from outside the cell and imports them inside. Although the bound sodium and potassium ions interact with similar binding sites in the pump, the pump sometimes preferentially binds sodium, and sometimes potassium. The study performed by Rui et al. shows that this preference is driven by how protons (hydrogen ions) bind to the amino acids that make up the binding site.</p><p>The simulations also suggest that the pump uses a ‘self-correcting’ mechanism to prevent the pump from transporting the wrong types of ions. When incorrect ions are present at the binding sites, the pump cycle pauses temporarily until the ions detach from the pump. Only when the correct ions are bound will the pump cycle continue again.</p><p>In the future, Rui et al. hope to use long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations to show the conformational transition in action. In addition, the 'self-correcting' mechanism will be directly tested by letting the wrong and correct ions compete for the binding sites to see whether the pump will transport only the correct ions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16616.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16616.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>free energy</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>simulations</kwd><kwd>conformational transitions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103712-S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rui</surname><given-names>Huan</given-names></name><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Benoît</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1515434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Artigas</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Benoît</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15, NS081570-01A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Artigas</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-GM087519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Benoît</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computations based on detailed atomic models explain how the ATP-driven sodium-potassium pump avoids transporting the wrong type of ions in order to maintain the physiological concentration of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump is a primary active membrane transporter present in nearly all animal cells. It belongs to the P-type ATPase family, which utilizes the energy released from ATP hydrolysis to move ions against their concentration gradients across a membrane barrier. The ion species transported by the pump under physiological conditions are Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. Like many other membrane transporters, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump works according to an 'alternating-access' ion transport mechanism, with the bound ions accessible from only one side of the membrane at a time. The consensus scheme of the pump cycle is known as the 'Albers-Post' cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albers, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Post et al., 1969</xref>). It involves two major conformations, E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub>, with inward- and outward-facing ion binding sites, respectively. In each cycle, the E<sub>1</sub> conformation binds three Na<sup>+</sup> from the cytosol and exports them using the energy from ATP hydrolysis. After external release of Na<sup>+</sup>, binding of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> promotes the structural transition to the occluded E<sub>2</sub> state, which finally imports two K<sup>+</sup> as binding of ATP returns the pump to the E<sub>1</sub> conformation. E<sub>1</sub>/E<sub>2</sub> conformational change and the accompanied electrogenic active transport are facilitated by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of an aspartate residue in the cytoplasmic domain, which is a hallmark of the P-type ATPase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axelsen et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The presence of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump is essential for excitability and secondary active transport. More than 40% of the energy produced in mammals is consumed by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Milligan et al., 1985</xref>). Although it is a machine designed for such a precise and important function, it has been shown that many cations, including congeners of K<sup>+</sup> and some organic cations, can bind to the same sites used by the pump to bind and transport K<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mahmmoud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ratheal et al., 2010</xref>). Competitive binding between Na<sup>+</sup> and other cations at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schneeberger et al., 2001</xref>). An unsolved puzzle, therefore, is how the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump is able to recognize and accept two K<sup>+</sup> from the extracellular matrix, where Na<sup>+</sup> concentration is much higher, and how it selectively binds Na<sup>+</sup> from the cytoplasm to keep the pump cycle running forward.</p><p>Structural studies have provided tremendous insights into the function of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump, which consists of two obligatory subunits, α (catalytic) and β (auxiliary), and sometimes a tissue specific regulatory subunit from the FXYD protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geering, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mercer et al., 1993</xref>). The transmembrane region of the α-subunit contains the ion binding sites within its 10 helices (called M1-M10). Recent crystal structures of the pump in its E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> states reveal the locations of the three Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites in E<sub>1</sub> and the two K<sup>+</sup> binding sites in E<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laursen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinoda et al., 2009</xref>). From structural alignments based on the heavy atom positions in the binding sites, it becomes clear that the binding pocket harboring sites I and II in E<sub>1</sub> overlaps with those in E<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Site III is only formed in E<sub>1</sub>. It is located between the transmembrane helices M5, M6, and M8 and is thought to exclusively bind Na<sup>+</sup> but appears to catalyze H<sup>+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poulsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ratheal et al., 2010</xref>) in a manner that presents a complex dependence on the concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mitchell et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that protonation at the ion binding pocket may play a role in the selectivity of these sites for K<sup>+</sup> when the pump is in its E<sub>2</sub> state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). Biochemical assays on the mutant D926N, which is often used as a surrogate for protonated D926, also show that it induces distinct effects on Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Einholm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jewell-Motz et al., 1993</xref>), suggesting a potential change in its protonation state upon the E<sub>1</sub>/E<sub>2</sub> transition. Taken together, the evidence, although indirect, suggests the possibility of an E<sub>1</sub> specific protonation state that favors Na<sup>+</sup> binding to the pump. The nature of this protonation state is, however, unclear.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16616.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The ion binding sites in (<bold>A</bold>) Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>·(ADP·Pi) (PDBID 3WGV) and (<bold>B</bold>) E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) (PDBID 2ZXE) states.</title><p>Only the transmembrane helices M4, M5, M6, M8, and M9 from the α subunit are shown.

The binding sites in Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>(ADP·Pi) were tested one by one by 'alchemically transforming' the bound Na<sup>+</sup> into a K<sup>+</sup> while keeping the other two sites occupied by Na<sup>+</sup>. A similar approach was previously used to study the selectivity in other conformational states of the pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2011</xref>) (see also Materials and methods section). The results show that the Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity at all three sites is realized only when a specific set of binding pocket residues are protonated. This set of residues is, by comparison, different from that in the K<sup>+</sup> selective E<sub>2</sub> state. The implication is that the protonation state and the selectivity of the pump are tightly coupled; when the pump undergoes a transition between E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub>, a protonation state switch occurs. The present findings also show that the effective selectivity of the pump is reinforced by a self-correcting mechanism, which prevents the occlusion step on either side of the membrane if the wrong type of ions were loaded into the binding sites. This mechanism ensures that counterproductive transport cycles do not occur.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>pKa of the binding pocket protonatable residues</title><p>The crystal structures of the pump in its E<sub>1</sub> (PDBID 3WGV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanai et al., 2013</xref>]) and E<sub>2</sub> (PDBID 2ZXE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinoda et al., 2009</xref>]) conformations show that there is a large structural overlap between the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> binding pockets. The sites I and II are in the main binding chamber formed by helices M4, M5, and M6, while site III, located in between M5, M6, and M8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), is Na<sup>+</sup> exclusive and appears in E<sub>1</sub> only.

Even when the structures assume the identical conformational state and are taken from the same asymmetric unit from a crystal, the pKa values of the same residue can differ by more than one pH unit. For example, the pKa of E779 is 9.9 in chain A of the crystal structure 3WGV but the value is 8.4 in chain C, yet, the structural difference between the two chains is minimal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Because of this, only the structures with the highest resolution for the E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> states of the pump, 3WGV and 2ZXE, were used to guide the protonation state assignments in order to avoid false assignments of protonation state originated from structural uncertainty in lower resolution crystal structures. Interestingly, the protonation states of E327 and D804 assigned based on the 3WGV and 4HQJ structures are reversed. According to the PROPKA results, E327 appears to be deprotonated and D804 protonated in 3WGV, and vice versa in 4HQJ. While this inconsistency could be due to the lower resolution in the crystal structure of 4HQJ, it is worth noting that these two residues are in close proximity from one another suggesting that a proton could be passed back and forth between them in the E<sub>1</sub> state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Protonation states and E<sub>1</sub> binding pocket stability</title><p>Previous calculations have indicated that a specific set of residues has to be protonated for the E<sub>2</sub> binding sites to be K<sup>+</sup> selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). Although the protonation states of D926 and E954 were not considered in the previous study because they lie outside of the two K<sup>+</sup> binding sites, they are likely to be protonated in E<sub>2</sub> according to the predicted pKa (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The binding pocket protonation derived from the crystal structure of the pump in its partially occluded Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>(ADP·Pi) state differs from that in E<sub>2</sub>. According to their pKa values, D804, D808, and D926 should be deprotonated and the glutamates, E327, E786, and E954, should be protonated. Arguments based on pKa values predicted by PROPKA, however, have to be taken with caution, because the empirical method is highly sensitive to the local structural variation. For example, a deprotonated acidic side chain could have a PROPKA predicted pKa value at slightly higher than 7 because of the structural snapshot used to make the prediction. To seek a more robust assessment of these factors, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to examine the structural stability of the binding pocket for different protonation configurations. One goal is to determine the protonation states of D804 and D926, both of which have a predicted pKa value within 1.5 pH unit to 7. The protonation state of D808 was also investigated since it affects the K<sup>+</sup> selectivity of the binding sites in the E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) state. A total of eight MD simulations were carried out (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), starting from all possible protonation state configurations accessible by these three residues.

The protonation state at E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) binding pocket proposed in the earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2011</xref>) is confirmed by the present calculations, in which the reduced system includes a larger region of the protein and more residues at the outskirt of the main binding pocket, including D926 and E954. It is evident that a different set of residues is protonated in the Na<sup>+</sup> selective E<sub>1</sub> as compared to in the K<sup>+</sup> selective E<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). While the glutamates (i.e., E327, E779, and E954) remain protonated in both the Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>(ADP·Pi) and E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) states, the binding pocket aspartates take on opposite protonation states. In Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>(ADP·Pi) D804 is protonated and both D808 and D926 are deprotonated, and their protonation states are reversed in E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>). Free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations on the protonation/deprotonation of D804 estimated a pKa value of 9.2 (See Materials and methods), further supporting its protonated form under physiological conditions in E<sub>1</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Charge-neutralizing mutations and shift in selectivity</title><p>The impact of charge-neutralizing mutations of the key aspartate residues on the binding site selectivity was examined. D to N mutations have previously been used in experimental studies as a strategy to ascertain the possible charged state of these residues. The results of the free energy calculations, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, indicate that all the three sites remain Na<sup>+</sup> selective in the partly occluded Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>(ADP·Pi) in both D804N and D808N, whilst D926N causes the sites to lose most of the Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity. Using Na<sup>+</sup> dependent phosphorylation and ATP binding assays, it was shown that the cytoplasmic binding affinity for both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> is reduced in D804N and D808N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgensen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pedersen et al., 1997</xref>). The D804N mutation affects the cytoplasmic K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> binding differently. The mutation’s impact on cytoplasmic Na<sup>+</sup> binding is not as prominent as on K<sup>+</sup> binding and D804N would appear more Na<sup>+</sup> selective than the wildtype. This is reflected in the calculation results. The K<sub>D,K</sub>/K<sub>D,Na</sub> at sites I and III are reduced by a factor of ~50 from 476.6 and 2523.3 in the wildtype to 10.3 and 54.6 in the D804N mutant, but the sites are still Na<sup>+</sup> selective. The selectivity of site II is increased to a much larger extent, from 17.0 in the wildtype to 13359.7 in the mutant. This is an ~1000 fold increase in selectivity and it implies that D804N is likely more Na<sup>+</sup> selective than the wildtype pump. The D808N mutant also becomes more Na<sup>+</sup> selective compared to the wildtype pump. The most dramatic increase in Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity happens at site II as in the case of D804N. Interestingly, site I, which prefers to bind K<sup>+</sup> in the wildtype with the protonated D808 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), is now Na<sup>+</sup> selective in D808N. It could be that the spatial packing is the major contributing factor to the site I ion selectivity. In the calculations, both sites II and III lose their Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity in the D926N mutant. The shifting of selectivity towards K<sup>+</sup> at site III in this mutant is a bit surprising, and worth commenting on. There are two possible explanations. First, substituting a negatively charged carbonyl oxygen with a bulkier but neutral –NH<sub>2</sub> at the D926 sidechain could prevent entrance of an ion to this site. Thus, the simulated conformation with an ion at this site could be energetically inaccessible. In other words, this is a metastable state with the absolute free energy of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> binding to this conformation equally prohibitive. An alternative explanation is that the D926N mutation alters the available conformational space accessible by helix M5 and this allows K<sup>+</sup> to go into site III as suggested in reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanai et al., 2013</xref>). The binding of this K<sup>+</sup>, however, prevents the further binding of Na<sup>+</sup>, and results in the compromised Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity in this mutant. Even though the calculations show D926N with decreased Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity, they do not explain why experimentally the D926N mutant has compromised Na<sup>+</sup> binding ability in the absence of K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Einholm et al., 2010</xref>). The loss in selectivity seen in this D926N mutant, however, could account for the strong inhibition by high K<sup>+</sup> on Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Einholm et al., 2010</xref>]).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16616.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Charge-neutralizing mutations and their impact on binding site selectivity.</title><p>The wildtype protein is colored black and the mutations in E<sub>1</sub> (blue) and E<sub>2</sub> (red) are colored differently.

In a previous computational study, the D808N mutation was also shown to minimally affect the K<sup>+</sup> selectivity in E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>). Discrepancies between the calculations and the selectivity inferred from biochemical experiments have been noted previously, though the reason was not clear. A plausible explanation could be that the experimentally measured selectivity is an outcome from the relevant states including both P-E<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>). However, any contribution from the P-E<sub>2</sub> state to the observed selectivity was not taken into account by the calculations because of the missing crystal structure of the outward-facing state. To test this idea, we generated a model structure of the P-E<sub>2</sub> state based on the homolog structures from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> SERCA pump (see below). This model was then used to calculate the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> in the wildtype and the mutant pumps.

Initially, the two K<sup>+</sup> binding sites in the outward-facing model P-E<sub>2</sub>·K<sub>2</sub> (state ① in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) appear to be non-selective or only weakly K<sup>+</sup> selective. However, the selectivity for K<sup>+</sup> over Na<sup>+</sup> increases as the pump occludes to form the K<sup>+</sup>–bound occluded state E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) (state ③). After the dephosphorylation of P-E<sub>2</sub>, the binding pocket opens up to the cytoplasmic side. Accompanying this structural transition is the selectivity reversal at site I, switching the site from K<sup>+</sup> to Na<sup>+</sup> selective (③ to ④ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The protonation state change further shifts the ion selectivity at the sites in E<sub>1</sub> towards Na<sup>+</sup>. Changing the protonation state in K<sub>2</sub>E<sub>1</sub> (④ to ⑤ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) to the protonation state dominant in Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>(ADP·Pi), i.e., state ⑥ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> with protonated D804 and deprotonated D808 and D926, further reduces the K<sup>+</sup> selectivity at both sites I and II. When the pump is in this state, site I is Na<sup>+</sup> selective and site II is only weakly K<sup>+</sup> selective. Together, the E<sub>2</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> structural transition and the protonation state change promote the release of K<sup>+</sup> to the cytoplasmic side. Transient changes in the binding pocket protonation state upon occlusion/deocclusion are possible and could lead to variations in the magnitude of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for the intermediate states.

Initially, site I in the inward-facing Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>(ADP·Pi) structure (state ⑦) is weakly Na<sup>+</sup> selective when the other two sites are filled with Na<sup>+</sup>. However, the intermediate state ⑧ during the occlusion process shows that its site I is highly discriminating against K<sup>+</sup> with a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> of 2.9 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Therefore, if a K<sup>+</sup> is bound in this site, the free energy barrier toward occlusion would be much higher than when a Na<sup>+</sup> ion was bound and the subsequent occlusion is not likely. In the case when a K<sup>+</sup> ion replaces a Na<sup>+</sup> at site II or III, although the energy barrier of occlusion is not as prominent, such a binding pocket ion configuration is energetically less favorable than the native configuration and its appearance is unlikely in the first place.</p><p>Unlike the K<sup>+</sup> branch, the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> calculations along the Na<sup>+</sup> branch offers limited insights on the sequence of Na<sup>+</sup> binding from the cytoplasmic side. The results are indicative of the selectivity at the sites, but not the absolute binding affinity. Based on the calculations alone, it is not possible to determine which site is the first to bind cytoplasmic Na<sup>+</sup>. It could be site III, as suggested by Kanai et al., and this prepares the other two sites for the following Na<sup>+</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanai et al., 2013</xref>). Or, alternatively, the first two Na<sup>+</sup> bind at sites I and II in the main binding pocket and the last Na<sup>+</sup> enters, takes over site II, and pushes the two previously bound ions further, so that the ions in sites II and I now move to sites I and III, in a process reminiscent of the “knock-on” mechanism occurring in potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hodgkin et al., 1955</xref>). A direct assessment of these proposed binding sequences will require further experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results from the MD simulations support the notion that the protonation state of the binding pocket and its selectivity are closely related. Because the binding pocket in the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump displays considerable flexibility, it is worth pausing to reflect on the possible mechanism that underlies this relation. While the selectivity of a very rigid binding site is first and foremost predetermined by its atomic geometry, the selectivity of a flexible binding site is strongly affected by local ion-ligand and ligand-ligand interactions. In such flexible systems, selectivity is controlled by the both number and the physicochemical properties of ion-coordinating ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). For example, high-field ligands, such as deprotonated acidic side chains tend to favor Na<sup>+</sup> binding and protonation revert those to low-field ligands, which tend to favor K<sup>+</sup>. Hence, in the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump protonation is exploited to modulate selectivity by altering the electrostatic properties of several of residues in the binding pocket. This is also consistent with the results from our previous study on the ion selectivity in E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>), which concluded that changes in the electrostatic properties of the protonatable residues was the likely mechanism responsible for the K<sup>+</sup> selectivity in the E<sub>2</sub> state of the pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). Even though the local structural rearrangements at the binding sites are small upon the change in protonation state, it is enough to change the physical properties of the coordinating ligand, thus giving rise to discernable differences in the ion selectivity. The crystal structures of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump in its Na<sub>3</sub>.E<sub>1</sub>·(ADP·Pi) and E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) states show similarity in their binding pocket configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), including the coordination patterns of the bound ions at sites I and II (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The heavy atom RMSD between the binding pocket residues is 2.5 Å and the structural difference remains after hundreds of ns of simulations. Empirical pKa and FEP calculations based on the MD simulation equilibrated structures indicate that the binding pocket glutamates (i.e., E327, E779, and E954) are likely protonated in both Na<sub>3</sub>.E<sub>1</sub>·(ADP·Pi) and E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>), although previous mutagenesis experiments showed that charge-neutralizing mutation E327Q affects pump function, possibly by altering ion-pump interactions and the kinetics of the occlusion/deocclusion reactions along the pump cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgensen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuntzweiler et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nielsen et al., 1998</xref>). The calculations also suggest that the protonation states of D804, D808, and D926 are different in Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>·(ADP·Pi) and E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>). Among the three aspartates only D804 is protonated in order for all three sites to stay Na<sup>+</sup> selective in Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>·(ADP·Pi). The E<sub>1</sub> binding pocket devoid of ions carries a net charge of -2, consistent with that deduced from previous fluorescence studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schneeberger et al., 1999</xref>). Mutagenesis experiments are also consistent with the unlikely protonation of D808 and D926 when the pump is in E<sub>1</sub> trying to bind cytoplasmic Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jewell-Motz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pedersen et al., 1997</xref>). The protonation states of these three residues are reversed in E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) with D804 deprotonated and the other two protonated, a result that is supported by a previous computational study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). The different protonation states for E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> also agree well with the 'four-site' model proposed by Skou and Esmann more than 30 years ago with the K<sup>+</sup>-bound E<sub>2</sub> state carrying two sidechain protons (H<sub>2</sub>EK<sub>2</sub>) and the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound E<sub>1</sub> state carrying only one (HENa<sub>3</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Skou et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>It is worth pointing out that the second proton (i.e., the proton on D926) in the K<sup>+</sup> bound E<sub>2</sub> state must come from and return to the same side of the membrane during the pump cycle so that the net charge moved per cycle by the pump is one. It seems unlikely that this proton could come from the extracellular side because altering extracellular pH would then protonate or deprotonate D926, causing major changes in Na<sup>+</sup> binding affinity and the maximum pumping turnover rate. This is not observed over an external pH range 9.6 to 5.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mitchell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vasilyev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is more likely that the D926 proton comes from the cytoplasmic side. This is supported by MD simulations of the P-E<sub>2</sub>·Na<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>·(ADP·Pi) revealing the existence of aqueous pathways connecting the cytoplasm and D926 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). One of the water pathways is located between the helices M5, M7, and M8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), similar to the C-terminal proton pathway previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poulsen et al., 2010</xref>). A proton could enter through this pathway to protonate D926 and then leave through the same pathway during the E<sub>2</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> transition, or through an alternative path passing the main binding pocket along with the dissociating ions as seen in the Na<sub>2</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>·(ADP·Pi) simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16616.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Water pathways from the cytoplasm to D926 in (<bold>A</bold>) Na<sub>2</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>·(ADP·Pi) and (<bold>B</bold>) P-E<sub>2</sub>·Na<sub>2</sub>.</title><p>The top (top) and side (bottom) views are shown.

Even when the binding affinity of the ion species being transported is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of the other ion (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 1 to 3 kcal/mol), the advantage in binding is undermined by the higher concentration of the competing ion. The pump overcomes this problem by raising the free energy barrier for the occlusion step in the presence of incorrect ions in the binding pocket, thus preventing the faulty transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). This self-correcting mechanism makes sure that the intracellular and the extracellular gates do not close (i.e., occlude), which is required for the pump cycle to go forward, unless the correct ion configuration is present at the binding pocket. Therefore, this is an inherent part of the ping-pong mechanism the pump uses to transport ions with high selectivity. Although other energetic barriers, like pathways the ions use to travel to the binding site, could contribute to the ion binding specificity, it is not likely the case here as both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> can access the binding pocket in the simulations of the E<sub>1</sub> and P-E<sub>2</sub> states without ions bound.</p><p>The concept of a self-correcting pumping mechanism sheds new light on a number of puzzling functional observations. For instance, it explains why E<sub>1</sub> displays a strong apparent affinity for K<sup>+</sup> in competitive binding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schneeberger et al., 2001</xref>), even though the pump still binds and occludes Na<sup>+</sup> from the cytoplasmic side. The calculations show that all the sites in the Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>·(ADP·Pi) state are selective for Na<sup>+</sup>, likely because this is a partially occluded state. A wrong combination of binding site ions would not have been occluded and reached such a state. In a fully inward-open conformation, the selectivity of the sites ought to be fairly weak. The high affinity for K<sup>+</sup> observed in E<sub>1</sub> in these experiments is due to the backward occlusion leading to the K<sup>+</sup>-bound state E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>). The proposed self-correcting mechanism parallels the suggestion based on experiments that the phosphorylation and occlusion of E<sub>1</sub> requires 3 Na<sup>+</sup> bound, and this increases the apparent affinity for Na<sup>+</sup> in the normal pump cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schneeberger et al., 2001</xref>). The self-correcting mechanism can also account for the different effects of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> congeners on the release rate of the occluded <sup>86</sup>Rb<sup>+</sup> (a K<sup>+</sup> congener) to the extracellular side upon the “backdoor” phosphorylation in the presence of Pi reported by Forbush (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forbush, 1987</xref>). This backward deocclusion is accelerated in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, and it follows a single phase, while a much slower deocclusion process with a second slow phase is observed in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> or Rb<sup>+</sup>. According to the self-correcting mechanism, it is likely that upon the replacement of one of the two occluded <sup>42</sup>K<sup>+</sup> or <sup>86</sup>Rb<sup>+</sup> by cold K<sup>+</sup> at one site, the pump succeeded to occlude again, resulting in the second slow phase. These explanations are sensible, in turn lending support to the proposed self-correcting mechanism. Given that the selectivity in the outward/inward facing states is after all not as strong as previously thought, such a mechanism must be in place.</p><p>This analysis suggests that an important component of the overall selectivity emerges from the increased free energy barrier associated with the occlusion process while the wrong type of ion is bound to a site. Although the pump would be kinetically more efficient by preventing the wrong ions from reaching the binding sites to begin with, the free energy calculations do not support the notion of highly selective binding sites for the open-access states. While such mechanism may seem inefficient because the pump must try to figure out that there is an issue with selectivity only after binding of several ions of the wrong type, it is important to realize that the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump is not a particular fast molecular machine. The estimated turnover rate is less than 100 per second and decreases even further as the transmembrane voltage becomes more negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heyse et al., 1994</xref>). The implication is that the system has plenty of time, at the molecular level, to function near thermodynamic equilibrium. In other words, the pump has not been evolutionarily optimized to be a particularly fast molecular machine, but an energetically efficient one. Thus, even though the idea of a self-correcting ion selectivity mechanism seems counterintuitive and inefficient, it is consistent with the physical conditions under which the pump has to operate.</p><p>In summary, the present study highlights the tight coupling between the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity of the binding sites, the protonation state of the coordinating residues, and the conformational state of the pump. The important functional consequence of such tight coupling is the necessity to have the correct type and number of ions in the binding pocket for the pumping cycle to proceed forward toward the occlusion step. Because the ion binding selectivity is strongly dependent upon the protein conformation, a self-correcting mechanism counteracting the effect of the ion concentration in the environment ensures an efficient function of the pump.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparing the all-atom membrane-Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump simulation systems</title><p>The crystal structures, 3WGV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanai et al., 2013</xref>) and 2ZXE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinoda et al., 2009</xref>), representing the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump in its Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>(ADP·Pi) and E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) states were used to build the simulation systems.

The inner region was defined as residues and water molecules within 15 Å to the center of mass of the bound ions. Everything within this region was treated explicitly. An extended inner region was specified by a 3-Å thick shell continuing from the inner region outwards to create a smooth spherical dielectric cavity. Water molecules in this region were removed and their impact on the binding site was included implicitly. The coordinates of atoms in these extended region and those linked to them within three atomic bonds in the inner region were held fixed during the simulations. The rest of the system was considered the outer region, in which the atoms were removed and their impact on the inner region atoms was represented by the General Solvent Boundary Potential (GSBP) in the form of a solvent-shielded static field and a solvent-induced reaction field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Im et al., 2001</xref>). The reaction field arising from changes in charge distribution in the inner region was expressed in terms of a generalized multipole expansion using 11 spherical harmonic functions. Both the solvent-shielded static field and the reaction field matrix were independent of the inner region configuration, and therefore were calculated only once before further simulations using the finite-difference Poisson−Boltzmann (PB) method with the PBEQ module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Im et al., 1998</xref>) in CHARMM. In these calculations a dielectric constant of 1 was used for the inside of the protein within the inner and outer regions, whereas the rest of the system had a dielectric constant of 80. The atomic Born radii used in the PB calculations were determined by free energy calculations in explicit solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nina et al., 1997</xref>). All these reduced systems were further equilibrated for 200 ps using Langevin dynamics at 303.15 K with a friction coefficient of 5 ps<sup>−1</sup> assigned to all non-hydrogen atoms. All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were fixed with the SHAKE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryckaert et al., 1977</xref>). Nonbonded interactions within 14.5 Å were accounted for explicitly, while everything else beyond this distance was treated with an extended electrostatics method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stote et al., 1991</xref>). The simulation program CHARMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks et al., 2009</xref>) was used for the equilibration. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> lists all the reduced systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Free energy perturbation simulations with boosting potential</title><p>It is known that the binding free energy calculated from FEP/MD simulations suffers from convergence issues because the residue sidechains at the binding site only sample a few of the several accessible rotameric states.

site residue. First, the entire transmembrane helix containing the residue of interest was taken from the crystal structure with its orientation kept the same as in the OPM database. This was to provide a proper secondary structure environment. Next, we replaced the sidechains of all the other residues on the helix to hydrogen atoms to remove their steric effects. An implicit planar membrane model, EEF1/IMM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lazaridis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schneeberger et al., 1999</xref>) was used in place of a membrane bilayer to solvate the helix. 72 umbrella windows along χ were set up with a window spacing of of 5°. A harmonic bias potential was applied in each window with a force constant of 100 kcal/mol/rad<sup>2</sup>. After the windows were generated, each of them was simulated for 50 ns at 303.15 K using Langevin dynamics with a 2 fs time-step. All bond lengths involving hydrogen were fixed with the SHAKE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryckaert et al., 1977</xref>). The cutoff distance for nonbonded interactions was set to 11 Å. The simulation program CHARMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks et al., 2009</xref>) was used to conduct the simulations. The resulting distributions of χ were unbiased using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">𝒲</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and the fitted curves.

The water sphere was made form pre-equilibrated water boxes with TIP3P water molecules. A Na<sup>+</sup> ion was placed at the center of the sphere. Any water molecules overlapping with the ion were deleted.

One of such pathways connects states E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) and P-E<sub>2</sub>·K<sub>2</sub>. The second connects states E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) and K<sub>2</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>, and the third describes the transition between states Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>-P and P-E<sub>2</sub>·Na<sub>3</sub>. First, A Cα-atom-only transition pathway for each of these was generated using the ANMPathway online server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://anmpathway.lcrc.anl.gov/anmpathway.cgi">http://anmpathway.lcrc.anl.gov/anmpathway.cgi</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Das et al., 2014</xref>) based on the SERCA pump crystal structures including 3B9B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Olesen et al., 2007</xref>), 1WPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Toyoshima et al., 2004</xref>), and 1VFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Toyoshima et al., 2004</xref>). Since both the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> SERCA pump are P-type ATPases, it is reasonable to assume that they have similar pumping mechanisms and they share the same set of states along the pump cycle. Although crystal structures of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump are scarce, multiple high-resolution structures of the SERCA pump in different states are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karlsen et al., 2016</xref>). Among them, 3B9B represents the outward facing P-E<sub>2</sub> state. All the other SERCA pump structures were aligned based on their transmembrane region Cα positions to the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump and the Cα RMSD were computed to find those that resemble the structural states captured by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump crystal structures 3WGV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanai et al., 2013</xref>) and 2ZXE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinoda et al., 2009</xref>). The two SERCA pump structures representing states Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>ATP (3WGV) and E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) (2ZXE) are 1VFP and 1WPG, respectively. Each generated coarse-grained pathway is made of a sequence of structural snapshots containing Cα atoms only. These snapshots are called images and are distributed at equal RMSD intervals. The images from the coarse-grained pathways were then used in the all-atom targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) simulations to guide each transition. The starting system in the first and second pathway TMD simulations was taken from the well-equilibrated MD simulation system E2_S1 starting from the crystal structure 2ZXE. The third pathway was realized using the MD simulation system E1_S1 built from the crystal structure 3WGV, with the catalytic D369 phosphorylated. The protocol of the TMD simulations followed those published before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castillo et al., 2015</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Selectivity calculations along the pump cycle</title><p>Binding site ion selectivity was evaluated for nine systems representing different stages along the pump cycle.

The structures used for them are ① the generated P-E<sub>2</sub>·K<sub>2</sub> model, ③ the equilibrated crystal structure 2ZXE, the equilibrated crystal structure 3WGV with ⑦ bound Na<sup>+</sup> and with ⑤ bound Na<sup>+</sup> replaced by K<sup>+</sup> at sites I and II, and ⑨ the generated P-E<sub>2</sub>·Na<sub>3</sub> model. Several intermediate states were also included. Intermediate state ② is between states ① P-E<sub>2</sub>·K<sub>2</sub> and ③ E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>), taken from the TMD simulations of the first path after image 35. State ④ was taken at image 33 along the transition from state ③ E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) to ⑤ K<sub>2</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>. Along the same vein, state ⑧ represented the intermediate at image 29 between states ⑦ Na<sub>3</sub>·E<sub>1</sub>(ADP.Pi) and ⑨ P-E<sub>2</sub>·Na<sub>3</sub>. The intermediates were taken near the midpoints of the transitions.

In the first simulation, the parameters of the ion were unaltered. A linear interpolation of the LJ and the NBFIX parameters between Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> was made. In the second simulation, the LJ and NBFIX parameters of the ion were replaced by those of a Na/K hybrid at the middle point of the interpolation.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Erik Lindahl (Reviewer #3) and Nir Ben-Tal (Reviewer #1), who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study examines the physicochemical determinants of binding site selectivity in the Na+/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase using molecular dynamics simulations. Various conformation of the ATPase, corresponding to different states along the pump cycle are examined, including the crystal structures of its two main conformations, as well as several models of intermediate states based on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> SERCA pump, and models derived from interpolating between well-defined states. Various protonation states of titratable residues in the pump's binding sites are energetically examined using molecular dynamic simulations as different resolutions. The results suggest that the protonation states of three aspartate residues in the binding sites (D804, D808 and D926) alter upon switching between conformations. The results indicate that the different selectivity of the binding sites emerges from the change in the protonation states. Using reduced structural models of the binding sites, this hypothesis is supported by calculating the difference in free energy between the pump bound to Na<sup>+</sup> vs. K<sup>+</sup> ions along the transport cycle. The authors conclude that initially the binding sites are only weakly selective for either Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>, and selectivity emerges as collective effect due to the (indirect) interaction of new ions with the ones that are already bound (a knock-on effect); the pump shifts towards K<sup>+</sup> selectivity in the outward open state, and towards Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity in the inward open state. Binding of the wrong type of ion increases the free energy barrier towards occlusion, preventing the transport cycle to proceed, thereby preventing the pump from operating in the opposite (wrong) direction.</p><p>The manuscript addresses an interesting and important question. It proposes a simple mechanism that dictates the shift in the selective properties of the Na+/K<sup>+</sup>-pump binding sites. However, based on the current draft of the manuscript it is difficult to decide whether the work is novel and solid enough to justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The summary reflects a long discussion among the reviewers in an effort to resolve this. The author should submit a revised draft only if they are certain that they can address all the issues raised.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is difficult to figure out which structures the various steps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are based on.

The authors explicitly claim that selectivity emerges from the increased free energy barrier associate with binding of the wrong ion to a site. However, from a biological point of view to argue that selectivity is governed solely by such mechanism is puzzling, for it is inefficient. The mechanism proposed here beautifully explains the different selective properties of the pump's binding sites in its two conformations, and it is possibly a &quot;last resort mechanism&quot;, designed, as the authors claim, to prevent the transport of the wrong kind of ion if it reaches the binding site. However one would expect that for the most part, under physiological conditions, the pump will prevent the wrong ions from reaching the binding site to begin with. The anticipation is that a fast machine, such as this pump, should follow a particularly efficient mechanism, rather than the one proposed here, which figures out that there is issue with selectivity only after binding of several ions of the wrong type. The manuscript does not account for the ions transition into the binding sites and other possible energetic barriers they might encounter on the way. This issue should, at the very least, be discussed.</p><p>6) In view of item 5, the authors should revise the title to reflect the fact that selectivity is presumably determined primarily by other mechanisms, and the suggested mechanism here is only a 'safe guard'.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16616.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) It is difficult to figure out which structures the various steps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are based on.

At least the authors could show an overlay of the ion binding sites from 4HYT and their model.</italic> </p><p>First of all, we apologize for the confusion. Detailed descriptions on how the transition pathways are generated based on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> SERCA pump structures are not included. We felt that it was not necessary because the complete protocol was described in our previous publication (Castillo et al., 2015). We hope that adding the sentences below in the manuscript could clarify some of the reviewers’ concerns:</p><p>“Since both the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> SERCA pump are P-type ATPases, it is reasonable to assume that they have similar pumping mechanisms and they share the same set of states along the pump cycle. […] The two SERCA pump structures representing states Na<sub>3</sub>.E<sub>1</sub>ATP (3WGV) and E<sub>2</sub>(K<sub>2</sub>) (2ZXE) are 1VFP and 1WPG, respectively.”</p><p>We are aware of the 4HYT structure, but did not use it in the free energy calculations because it is in a P-E<sub>2</sub>-like state with ouabain bound blocking the extracellular access rather than a true outward open state. The generated P-E<sub>2</sub> models and the crystal structure 4HYT show similarity, especially in the transmembrane region, where the backbone RMSD is 2.7 Å (see the Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in our previous publication on the pump (Castillo et al., 2015)). This is mentioned in the main text of the manuscript in the Result section titled “<italic>Ion selectivity along the pump cycle</italic>”.</p><p>“The models appear sensible as they are structurally comparable to the recently published P-E<sub>2</sub> like structures of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump (Gregersen et al., 2016; Laursen et al., 2013) and the vanadate-Inhibited, P-E<sub>2</sub> mimic of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> SERCA pump (Clausen et al., 2016).”</p><p>The K<sup>+</sup>-loaded P-E<sub>2</sub> model also reproduces the experimentally measured gating charge. Therefore, we think the current P-E<sub>2</sub> models are reasonable and can be used compute the free energy difference of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> binding.</p><p><italic>3) Standard errors estimates should be added to the energy values, and conclusions that have been based on energy values with too large 'error bars' should be reconsidered (see comment 1 by Reviewer 3).</italic> </p><p>We updated the relevant figures and tables.</p><p><italic>4) If the calculations correctly describe the binding free energy of the pump cycle, they would also need to explain the ion release on the opposite side. Can they show this?</italic> </p><p>Yes. The free energy values can be used to explain cytoplasmic release of the K<sup>+</sup> as well. Once the pump opens to the cytoplasmic side, protonation states of the binding site aspartates change and the binding sites go from highly K<sup>+</sup> selective in the occluded state to relatively non-discriminating. Even though rebinding of the two K<sup>+</sup> is possible given the much higher K<sup>+</sup> concentration in the cytoplasm, the rate of the backward transition to the occluded state is slow. At the same time, the binding of K<sup>+</sup> to the site III is unlikely. Because occupancy of this site is the prerequisite of phosphorylation and occlusion of E<sub>1</sub>, the pump cycle cannot go forward. All the factors favor the cytoplasmic release of K<sup>+</sup> and binding of Na<sup>+</sup>, which keep pump cycle forward. To emphasize the point, we add the following sentences in the main text:</p><p>“When the pump is in this state, site I is Na<sup>+</sup> selective and site II is only weakly K<sup>+</sup> selective. Together, the E<sub>2</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> structural transition and the protonation state change promote the release of K<sup>+</sup> to the cytoplasmic side.”</p><p><italic>5) The simulations and free energy calculations assume a starting point in which all the pump's binding sites are occupied by a certain set of ions. The authors explicitly claim that selectivity emerges from the increased free energy barrier associate with binding of the wrong ion to a site. However, from a biological point of view to argue that selectivity is governed solely by such mechanism is puzzling, for it is inefficient. The mechanism proposed here beautifully explains the different selective properties of the pump's binding sites in its two conformations, and it is possibly a &quot;last resort mechanism&quot;, designed, as the authors claim, to prevent the transport of the wrong kind of ion if it reaches the binding site. However one would expect that for the most part, under physiological conditions, the pump will prevent the wrong ions from reaching the binding site to begin with. The anticipation is that a fast machine, such as this pump, should follow a particularly efficient mechanism, rather than the one proposed here, which figures out that there is issue with selectivity only after binding of several ions of the wrong type. The manuscript does not account for the ions transition into the binding sites and other possible energetic barriers they might encounter on the way. This issue should, at the very least, be discussed.</italic> </p><p>First, we need to clarify that the selectivity of the pump is not solely governed by the “self-correcting” mechanism. The occluded states are indeed highly selective while the states that are open to the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides are less so. The “self-correcting” mechanism is one way for the pump to achieve this selectivity difference between the states.</p><p>The pump is prone to error when it tries to bind ions from the extracellular and cytoplasmic solutions. Take the extracellular ion binding for example – in order for K<sup>+</sup> to have an advantage at binding in the presence of a Na<sup>+</sup> concentration that is <italic>N</italic> times higher <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf67"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, there needs to be at least <italic>N</italic> fold difference in <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> to guarantee a 1:1 ratio between [ENa] and [EK]:<disp-formula id="equ6"><mml:math id="m6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>If the pump were to only pick out K<sup>+</sup> from the extracellular media, the K<sub>D,K</sub> binding should be much smaller than K<sub>D,Na</sub>. Experimentally measured K<sub>D,K</sub> at the extracellular side is on the order of 1 mM in mammalian cell Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, while that of K<sub>D,Na</sub> is on the order of 100 mM (Nakao and Gadsby, 1989; De Weer et al. 2001). Given that the extracellular [Na<sup>+</sup>] is about 25 times that of [K<sup>+</sup>], for every 5 ion-loaded pumps, 1 would have the wrong configuration at the binding pocket. The “self-correcting” mechanism is a strategy evolved in the pump to cope with the problem that comes with the not-quite-specific external and cytoplasmic binding.</p><p>From an evolution point of view, it is not surprising that the outward and inward open states of the pump are less selective than the occluded states. When the pump is in an inward or outward open state, the binding pocket is more voluminous and hydrated than it is in the occluded state. Because of the spatial restriction in the occluded state-binding site, the bound ions would feel the impact from mutations more strongly than when they are bound in a larger pocket. During the evolution process, it would be easier to create a tightly packed, ion specific pocket than to make a large aqueous compartment selective towards ions of similar size and charge.</p><p>The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump is not a fast molecular machine. The estimated turnover rate is less than 100 per second and decreases even further as the transmembrane voltage becomes more negative. This is perhaps because the pump spends time wait for the correct ion configuration to be achieved at the binding site, even though the idea of a self-correcting ion selectivity mechanism seems counterintuitive and it is more natural to think of a pump that follows a particularly efficient mechanism where it prevents the wrong ions from reaching the binding site under physiological conditions. The truth could be that the pump has not been evolutionarily optimized to be a fast machine, but an energetically efficient one.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that other possible energy barriers encountered by the ions when they move in and out of the binding should be discussed. Although not shown in the manuscript, we observed ions, both K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>, can access the binding pocket within tens of ns in MD simulations of the pump in its inward and outward open states. As a result, this is not likely to contribute to the observed binding affinity difference substantially. This is added to the updated Discussion session:</p><p>“Other energetic barriers, like pathways the ions use to travel to the binding site, could contribute to the ion binding specificity, it is not likely the case here as both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> can access the binding pocket in the simulations of the E<sub>1</sub> and P-E<sub>2</sub> states without ions bound.”</p><p><italic>6) In view of item 5, the authors should revise the title to reflect the fact that selectivity is presumably determined primarily by other mechanisms, and the suggested mechanism here is only a 'safe guard'.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned above, we do think that the “self-correcting” mechanism is an essential element of the primary mechanism the pump uses to transport ions. To highlight this point, we changed the title to “The selectivity of the Na+/K<sup>+</sup>-pump is controlled by binding site protonation and self-correcting occlusion”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
