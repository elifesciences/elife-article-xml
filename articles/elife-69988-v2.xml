one of the most widely used model organisms in neuroscience. Their appeal arises from the marriage of low cost, early life transparency, and ease of genetic manipulation with a behavioral repertoire that becomes more sophisticated as animals transition from larvae to adults. To further enhance the use of adult zebrafish, we created the first fully segmented three-dimensional digital adult zebrafish brain atlas (AZBA). AZBA was built by combining tissue clearing, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, and three-dimensional image registration of nuclear and antibody stains. These images were used to guide segmentation of the atlas into over 200 neuroanatomical regions comprising the entirety of the adult zebrafish brain. As an open source, online (azba.wayne.edu), updatable digital resource, AZBA will significantly enhance the use of adult zebrafish in furthering our understanding of vertebrate brain function in both health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain atlas</kwd><kwd>light-sheet microscopy</kwd><kwd>adult zebrafish</kwd><kwd>image registration</kwd><kwd>tissue clearing</kwd><kwd>iDISCO</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000759/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kenney</surname><given-names>Justin W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM142566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kenney</surname><given-names>Justin W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN143227</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frankland</surname><given-names>Paul W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM113109</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mueller</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0016/2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mueller</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new tool for three-dimensional exploration of adult zebrafish neuroanatomy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Uncovering general principles of neuroanatomical function and brain-behavior relationships requires the integration of findings across model organisms that range in complexity, organization, and accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenowitz and Zakon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marder, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yartsev, 2017</xref>). Amongst vertebrate model organisms in neuroscience, zebrafish are relative newcomers that have grown in popularity in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kenney, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orger and de Polavieja, 2017</xref>). Originally established as a model organism for developmental biology due to ease of domestication, high fecundity, and early life transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parichy, 2015</xref>), the increased popularity of zebrafish is driven by recent advancements in brain imaging, molecular genetic manipulation, and behavior. To further enhance the use of zebrafish as an animal model in neuroscience, we created a digital three-dimensional (3D) brain atlas (adult zebrafish brain atlas [AZBA]). Although several digital atlases exist for larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kunst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Randlett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ronneberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tabor et al., 2019</xref>), no atlas of equivalent detail has been created for adult zebrafish. Adult zebrafish provide several important advantages over larval zebrafish such as a mature and histologically differentiated neuroanatomy and a rich behavioral repertoire that includes long-term associative memory, complex social interactions, and goal-driven behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerlai, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalueff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kenney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakajo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>3D digital brain atlases are essential tools for modern neuroscience because they facilitate lines of inquiry that are not possible with two-dimensional book-based atlases. For example, visualization of the 3D structure of the brain and incorporation of new data or discoveries are difficult, if not impossible, with a print atlas. In contrast, digital atlases enable exploration of brain structures in any arbitrary 3D perspective and can be readily updated to incorporate new information such as patterns of gene expression and anatomical connectivity, as has been done for the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Such features are important for fields like neurodevelopment and comparative neuroanatomy that rely on 3D topologies to understand how specific brain regions develop and relate across species. A digital atlas would also enhance the use of adult zebrafish in disease modeling by enabling a more comprehensive understanding of how the brain changes in response to insults that occur in neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakai et al., 2018</xref>), traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCutcheon et al., 2017</xref>), neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xi et al., 2011</xref>), and the formation and spreading of gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Idilli et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, digital atlases enable automated segmentation of new images, which is essential for whole brain mapping approaches that can lead to unexpected discoveries of regional function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bahl and Engert, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pantoja et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Randlett et al., 2019</xref>). Whole brain activity mapping also facilitates powerful network approaches to understanding brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassett and Sporns, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coelho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vetere et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wheeler et al., 2013</xref>), yielding insight into how coordinated brain-wide activity gives rise to behavior.</p><p>The generation of a brain atlas for adult zebrafish presents several challenges in comparison to the larval brain because the mature brain is opaque and an order of magnitude larger; this makes traditional whole-mount approaches impossible and confocal or wide-field microscopy infeasible. We overcome these roadblocks by exploiting recent developments in histology and microscopy. To enable whole-mount imaging, we rendered adult brains transparent using a tissue clearing approach (iDISCO+) that is compatible with different stains such as small molecules, antibodies, and in situ probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kramer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Renier et al., 2016</xref>). High-resolution imaging of samples as large as intact adult brains is not amenable to conventional microscopic techniques, so we turned to light-sheet fluorescence microscopy for rapid large volume imaging with minimal photobleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pitrone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reynaud et al., 2014</xref>). To generate an atlas that minimizes individual variations in neuroanatomy, we registered 3D volumes from multiple animals into the same anatomical space prior to averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lerch et al., 2011</xref>). To help guide segmentation and generate insight into the neurochemical organization of the brain, images from 10 different antibody stains were also registered into the same anatomical space. Finally, we performed manual segmentation, delineating the atlas into over 200 neuroanatomical regions, including nuclei and white matter tracts.</p><p>Taken together, AZBA is the most comprehensive, detailed, and up-to-date atlas of the adult zebrafish brain. We have made all averaged images freely available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dfn2z351g">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dfn2z351g</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://azba.wayne.edu/">azba.wayne.edu</ext-link>) to enable their use in exploring the organization of the zebrafish brain and automated segmentation for activity mapping. By generating this resource using readily available techniques, AZBA can be continuously updated to reflect the latest findings in zebrafish neuroanatomy. We anticipate this becoming an indispensable resource as adult zebrafish continue to gain traction as a model organism in understanding the intricacies of the vertebrate brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall strategy</title><p>To create an averaged 3D atlas, we developed a sample preparation and analysis pipeline for whole-mount 3D image acquisition and registration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We used a whole-mount preparation to avoid issues with slice-based techniques such as tissue loss, tearing, and distortion. To circumvent the challenge of tissue opacity, we used a rapid organic solvent-based tissue clearing technique, iDISCO+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Renier et al., 2016</xref>), that renders brains optically transparent. Because conventional microscopic techniques are not suitable for large volume imaging, we used light-sheet microscopy. Image stacks from individual fish brains were converted to 3D volumes and registered into the same anatomical space prior to averaging. Finally, average 3D images were manually segmented into their constituent brain regions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the strategy for generating the adult zebrafish brain atlas (AZBA).</title><p>Dissected brain samples were first subject to staining and tissue clearing.

Cleared and stained brains were imaged in the horizontal plane with an in-plane resolution of 3.25 μm and an axial step size of 4 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) yielding near-isotropic signals at sufficient resolution to clearly distinguish regional boundaries. From this collection of images, we generated 3D volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) that enabled viewing at any arbitrary angle including the coronal and sagittal planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Images were subject to quality control so that those damaged during dissection were discarded. We retained 17 sets of nuclear-stained and associated autofluorescence images from both male and female fish (eight females), each of which were transformed into 3D volumes for registration.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Imaging of nuclear-stained tissue-cleared samples.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Image of adult zebrafish brain samples before (top) and after (bottom) clearing using iDISCO+.

We used the contrast from the TO-PRO signal and an image registration pipeline toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedel et al., 2014</xref>) to perform iterative registration to generate a consensus image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This method begins with a 6-parameter linear registration to rotate and translate the initial image dataset followed by a 12-parameter affine registration to scale, translate, rotate, and shear the dataset with a pairwise approach to avoid bias by outlier images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Lastly, an iterative nonlinear registration with six iterations at subsequently higher resolutions was performed using minctracc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins and Evans, 2011</xref>). This resulted in a set of linear and nonlinear transformations for each TO-PRO image in our dataset from native space to a consensus space and orientation. These transformations were then applied to corresponding autofluorescence images, thereby creating an atlas with averaged images containing TO-PRO and autofluorescence signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Image registration pipeline.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Raw TO-PRO images from 17 fish were first aligned using linear transformations (LSQ6 and LSQ12) followed by a final nonlinear transformation (right).

To achieve this, during imaging of antibody stains, we also acquired autofluorescence images, thereby providing a bridge between the antibody images and the TO-PRO images. Autofluorescence images from antibody stains were registered with the autofluorescence channel of the TO-PRO images, yielding a set of transformations that were used to bring antibody stains into the same anatomical space as the TO-PRO stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To generate a representative image for each antibody, we averaged together at least five independent brains. Our approach resulted in strong correspondence between antibody images and the TO-PRO stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The utility of this approach is apparent from examining structures known to express high levels of specific enzymes, like TH in the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; green arrows).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Registration precision</title><p>To compare registration precision using TO-PRO and autofluorescence signals, we labeled six different landmarks in the atlas images and corresponding points in acquired images.

Using a mixed-model ANOVA (2 × 15; signal [between subject] × landmark [within subject]), we found a main effect of signal (F(1,13) = 1084, p=6.6 × 10<sup>–14</sup>) with the TO-PRO signal having greater mean precision (15 ± 10 µm vs. 99 ± 53 µm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, there was also a significant effect of landmark (F(5,65) = 98, p&lt;2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>), and an interaction between signal and landmark (F(5, 65) = 120, p&lt;2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>). A closer examination of the data revealed that in the autofluorescence images the average precision of each landmark covers a much wider range (17–180 µm) than TO-PRO (9–23 µm). In the autofluorescence image, the landmark with the highest precision (point 5; 17 ± 4 µm) has precision on par with the TO-PRO average. This suggests that the larger error measured using autofluorescence images is likely due to experimenter error in selecting points, reflecting the paucity of well-defined landmarks in this signal compared to the richer, high-contrast TO-PRO images.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Segmentation</title><p>Registered images were used to segment the brain into its constituent parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for anatomical abbreviations and colors). Segmentation was primarily guided by the seminal atlas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wullimann et al., 1996</xref>. Regional boundaries and terminology were updated for parts of the brain that have been subject to more recent analysis such as the telencephalon, hypothalamic regions, and motor nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mueller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Porter and Mueller, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rink and Wullimann, 2001</xref>). Segmenting large, clearly delineated regions, such as the optic tectum and the cerebellum, was straightforward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Small nuclei that only appear in one or two slices in the atlas or in images from only one axis proved more challenging. For such regions, we primarily made use of the coronal axis due to it being the most extensively represented in both the atlas and the literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom). The horizontal and sagittal planes enabled us to identify the anterior-posterior boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, top and middle). To ensure we captured as many neuronal structures as possible, we also made extensive use of a neuronal marker (HuC/D) in conjunction with the nuclear stain, which allowed us to safely identify many boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Other challenges included the fact that the original brain atlas contains a significant amount of unsegmented space. We labeled these regions as ‘unknown’ and according to their lowest anatomical level (e.g., unknown ventral telencephalon [UnkVT], unknown diencephalon [UnkD], etc.). Explicitly labeling these regions distinguishes them from the ‘clear’ label that is used for areas outside the brain to facilitate computational analysis using the atlas. Identification of tracts was largely based on a combination of autofluorescence and lack of nuclear and neuronal staining since we were unsuccessful in finding a white matter stain compatible with iDISCO+ (e.g., the MLF: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, pink arrowheads). We anticipate that future work will aid in filling these unsegmented regions with the potential to discover new neuronal circuits and anatomical structures.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Segmentation of the adult zebrafish brain atlas (AZBA).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Averaged and registered TO-PRO images alongside the atlas segmentation.

This resource will facilitate a wide variety of neurobiological studies using adult zebrafish aimed at dissecting neural circuits of behavior, understanding brain pathology, and discovering novel and conserved neuroanatomy. We created AZBA by leveraging advances in tissue clearing, light-sheet fluorescent microscopy, and image registration, resulting in the most detailed atlas for adult zebrafish to date. Tissue clearing allowed us to take a whole-mount approach, overcoming the natural opacity of the adult brain and issues associated with slice-based techniques such as tissue loss, tearing, and distortion. Laser fluorescence light-sheet microscopy was used to image the large volume of the zebrafish brain with high resolution and minimal photobleaching. Finally, we used 3D image registration to create images derived from multiple animals and inclusion of 10 antibody stains into the same anatomical space. These were then used to guide segmentation of the atlas into over 200 different neuroanatomical regions.</p><p>AZBA represents a significant departure from two prior brain atlases for adult zebrafish. The seminal book atlas from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wullimann et al., 1996</xref> is exceptionally detailed and has guided zebrafish neuroscience research for over two decades. However, being in print, it has not been updated with the latest findings and its two-dimensional visual presentation and lack of chemoarchitectural markers makes identifying regional boundaries across anatomical planes problematic. More recently, Ullmann and colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to create a 3D atlas for adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ullmann et al., 2010</xref>). Using a 16.4 Tesla magnet, they imaged a single brain at approximately 10 µm resolution and segmented it into 53 regions. Although an important achievement, MRI is limited in its ability to detect neurochemical markers and does not integrate easily with genetic labeling techniques. Furthermore, such strong magnets are not readily available to most researchers. In contrast, by combining recent advances in widely available tissue clearing techniques, light-sheet microscopy, and image registration, AZBA is highly versatile, detailed, and accessible.</p><p>Antibody stains were central to developing AZBA because they validated our approach and improved segmentation through comparison to prior work. Indeed, patterns of our neurotransmitter related stains largely agree with previous reports probing TH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castro et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaslin and Panula, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamamoto et al., 2010</xref>), 5-HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaslin and Panula, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Norton et al., 2008</xref>), and ChAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castro et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clemente et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mueller et al., 2004</xref>). PCNA also overlaps with earlier findings using both PCNA antibodies and bromodeoxyuridine labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ampatzis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrd and Brunjes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grandel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makantasi and Dermon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">von Krogh et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, stains against the calcium binding proteins like calretinin, calbindin, and PV largely overlap with prior work with only minor exceptions. Consistent with previous studies, we find calretinin expressed in the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kress et al., 2015</xref>), telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Porter and Mueller, 2020</xref>), and posterior parts of the brain, with the only notable exceptions being our lack of staining in the torus semicircularis and perilemniscal nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castro et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castro et al., 2006b</xref>). For calbindin, despite using the same antibody, we find that our staining in the telencephalon looks different than previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">von Trotha et al., 2014</xref>) where we find little staining in the subpallium, and instead see staining in the medial zone of the dorsal telencephalon limited to its posterior extent. For PV, we also note significant overlap with prior work where we see labeling in cell bodies of the cerebellum and olfactory bulbs, but less consistency in the more diffuse staining in the telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ampatzis and Dermon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mueller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Porter and Mueller, 2020</xref>). Some of these minor discrepancies may be due to changes in antigenicity arising from the use of different methodologies for fixation, loss of sparse signal due to the averaging of multiple images, tissue distortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Renier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>), or because prior work reported images from single animals and may be more susceptible to individual variation in expression patterns compared to the present work where images are averaged across several subjects. Nonetheless, our high correspondence with the previous literature suggests that the present work accurately represents the adult zebrafish brain.</p><p>Of the antibody stains that had not been subject to extensive prior work, the findings of greatest interest are from Prox1, a homeobox protein critical to the development of an array of organs and cell types including neurons during embryonic and adult stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elsir et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaltezioti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karalay et al., 2011</xref>). We found Prox1 staining in the telencephalon, consistent with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganz et al., 2012</xref>), as well as the habenula, parts of the hypothalamus, and the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Hypothalamic <italic>Prox1</italic> expression in larval zebrafish has been found to be important for the development of catecholaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pistocchi et al., 2008</xref>). However, we do not see overlap between TH and Prox1 in the hypothalamus, suggesting that Prox1 may be important for the development, but not the maintenance, of hypothalamic catecholaminergic neurons. In adult mice, Prox1 is present in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and GFAP-positive cells localized to white matter tracts in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karalay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lavado and Oliver, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, we find overlap between Prox1 and GFAP in the olfactory bulb and the edges of the telencephalon, but not the cerebellum, where Prox1 has greater overlap with PCNA, a marker for proliferating cells. The dentate gyrus in mice is notable for being one of the few areas where adult neurogenesis has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ming and Song, 2011</xref>). Thus, the broader expression of Prox1 in our study may reflect the presence of more widespread neurogenesis in adult zebrafish compared to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kizil et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We view the current segmentation and image collection that comprises AZBA as a first version that will be continually updated. To facilitate updating, and encourage input from the scientific community, we have created a website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://azba.wayne.edu/">azba.wayne.edu</ext-link>) where we invite comments and suggestions for updates. In addition, we expect future work will incorporate more antibody images and in situ hybridization probes for understanding how patterns of protein and gene expression vary across the brain. Through collaboration with the zebrafish community, we plan to incorporate the wealth of Gal4 and Cre/loxP lines that have been generated to characterize expression patterns in the adult brain. We envision a process where scientists send fixed brain samples to a central lab for tissue clearing, imaging, and registration to the atlas for incorporation into our online resource. A similar approach has been taken with larval fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawakami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kunst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Randlett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ronneberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tabor et al., 2019</xref>). However, images from adult animals are important because transgene expression patterns can change as animals mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lal et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>AZBA also enables new insight into the functional organization of the zebrafish brain by facilitating whole-brain activity mapping as has been achieved with larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Randlett et al., 2015</xref>). New images can be automatically segmented into individual brain regions by registration to our averaged autofluorescence or nuclear-stained images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Because adult zebrafish have a mature neuroanatomy and a larger behavioral repertoire than larval fish, this will provide an important new avenue for exploiting the power of the zebrafish model system to yield insight into the functional organization of the vertebrate brain and how it relates to behavior.</p><p>AZBA provides an unprecedented view of the adult zebrafish brain, consisting of averaged 3D nuclear-stained and antibody images registered into the same space. All files associated with the atlas are available to the community (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dfn2z351g">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dfn2z351g</ext-link>) and can be viewed online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://azba.wayne.edu/">azba.wayne.edu</ext-link>) or with ITK-SNAP, a freely available software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yushkevich et al., 2019</xref>). With AZBA, adult zebrafish join the ranks of other vertebrate model organisms in neuroscience that have highly detailed digital atlases such as larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kunst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Randlett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ronneberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tabor et al., 2019</xref>), mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lein et al., 2007</xref>), and rhesus macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reveley et al., 2017</xref>).

Samples were further washed in 100% methanol, chilled on ice, and then incubated in 5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol overnight at 4°C. The next day samples were rehydrated in a methanol/water series at room temperature (80, 60, 40, and 20% methanol) followed by a PBS wash and two 1 hr washes in PTx.2 (PBS with 0.2% TritonX-100).

Samples were mounted using an ultraviolet curing resin (adhesive 61 from Norland Optical, Cranbury, NJ) that had a refractive index (1.56) that matched the imaging solution, dibenzyl ether. Images were acquired in the horizontal plane at 4× magnification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image processing</title><p>Datasets from light-sheet imaging were stitched using Fiji’s (NIH) extension for Grid Stitching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Preibisch et al., 2009</xref>) and converted to a single stack, corresponding to the z-axis. All image processing steps were run on a Linux workstation with 64 GB of RAM and 12-core Intel processor.</p><p>Each stack was converted to a 4 µm isotropic image as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vousden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) with separate files for the autofluorescence channel and a second for the antibody or TO-PRO channels. These images were resampled to 8 µm isotropic due to system constraints during the image registration stages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Registration</title><p>The TO-PRO and autofluorescence signals were acquired on an initial dataset of 17 fish. To create the initial average, we used image registration to align in a parallel groupwise fashion the TO-PRO images. The variability was expected to be less in the TO-PRO because these images contained more contrast than the autofluorescence images.</p><p>The creation of an initial average of the adult zebrafish brain was accomplished using 17 samples with the TO-PRO channel. The process was completed using a three-step registration process, similar to prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lerch et al., 2011</xref>) using the pydpiper pipeline framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedel et al., 2014</xref>) and the minctracc registration tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins and Evans, 2011</xref>). This involved taking a single sample at random and registering the 17 samples to it using a six-parameter linear alignment process (LSQ6). This yielded 17 samples in similar orientation to allow a 12-parameter linear registration (LSQ12) to be performed in a pairwise fashion (each sample is paired with all the other samples to avoid sample bias), and the final output of these 12-parameter registration was a group average. This represents a linearly registered average adult zebrafish brain. This was then used as the target for nonlinear registration with each of the linearly registered 17 TO-PRO samples. This nonlinear alignment was repeated successively with smaller step sizes and blurring kernels to allow for an average with minimal bias from any one sample brain. We then took this average and mirrored itself along the long axis of the brain and repeated the registration process described above, but instead of using a random brain as the six-parameter target, we used this mirrored brain. The result of this second pipeline was an average brain where each plane of the brain (coronal, sagittal, horizontal) is parallel with the imaging planes (x, y, z). This final average brain represented the starting point of the atlas. The linear and nonlinear transformations created in the registration pipeline were used to resample the 4 µm isotropic TO-PRO and autofluorescence images to the atlas space, yielding an average signal for each channel. The autofluorescence signal was used to register other sample datasets with the atlas because it is common across all datasets.</p><p>To combine the additional cellular markers to better delineate structures and examine their distribution across the brain, we converted all images and their channels to 4 µm isotropic images as described above. We then converted them to 8 µm isotropic and used the autofluorescence channel for each set to run the above registration pipeline (LSQ6, LSQ12, and nonlinear). The initial target was the autofluorescence average created with the TO-PRO dataset described above. Following each registration pipeline, the transformations were used to resample each autofluorescence and cellular marker channel to the atlas with a resolution of 4 µm isotropic.</p><p>To assess registration precision using TO-PRO or autofluorescence images, for each signal we identified six landmarks in the atlas and their corresponding location on 7-8 different image sets. These points were then brought into atlas space using the transformations from the registration process. We then computed the Euclidean distance between the points in the atlas image and the transformed images for the TO-PRO and autofluorescence signals. Precision data are presented as mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Segmentation</title><p>Segmentation was performed using ITK-SNAP, a freely available software package for working with multimodal medical images that enables side-by-side viewing of 3D images registered into the same anatomical space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yushkevich et al., 2019</xref>). Segmentation was primarily guided by comparing TO-PRO nuclear-stained images to the cresyl violet stain of the original atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wullimann et al., 1996</xref>). Boundaries of nuclei were often determined using the TO-PRO stain in conjunction with a neuronal marker (HuC/D) and other antibody stains as needed.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Stephen C Ekker as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Harold Burgess (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following issues need to be addressed, and should not cause much of a delay:</p><p>1) Non-annotated areas should not be &quot;0&quot; like areas outside (use of black in both cases).</p><p>2) There should be one table containing colors, abbreviations and full names of anatomical structures (which will make the data much more and easier accessible). Assigning all anatomical entities to larger brain structures (telencephalon etc) may not be possible for all structures due to anatomical disputes, but also very helpful where possible.</p><p>3) Think they should do an analysis to at least show the differences are not so huge that mixing the sexes is reasonable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper uses cutting-edge imaging to develop a new 3D map of the zebrafish brain. The use of fixed imaging plus antibody staining with Lightsheet microscopy has developed an excellent high-resolution dataset. The regional imaging data is convincing. The data is well-presented, and the text easy to read. This is an ideal manuscript within the broad scope of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>A few questions remain to better understand the outcomes they describe:</p><p>1) For smaller brain regions, how do they validate their annotation? This was not clear.</p><p>2) What is the true estimate of error of their imaging approach? 8 microns is pretty large, and might lead to errors in tagging individual cells. How do they sort this out?

At present, these areas are indexed as 0 (zero), which is the same as the area outside the brain. I would strongly encourage the authors to distinguish unannotated voxels from space outside of the brain, as this will be essential to facilitate computational analyses of brain imaging data.</p><p>I suspect that the annotation file &quot;2021-05-02_AZBA_Label_descriptions.txt&quot; is formatted for ITK-SNAP. However, it could be more useful for other computational studies:</p><p>(1) At present, the file contains only region abbreviations, making it necessary to constantly consult Table S2 of the manuscript. I would like this file to additionally include the full name of the region.</p><p>(2) Each region should be associated with a major brain division (telencephalon, diencephalon etc) and where possible, given any other useful annotations (ventricle, tract, nucleus). These labels provide valuable grist for computational methods.</p><p>(3) For people not using ITK-SNAP it would be helpful to provide the coordinates of a voxel within each region. For example I tried in vain to hunt for the voxels corresponding to MAC.</p><p>(4) I understand the first column (index) and last column (abbreviation). What are the other columns?</p><p>After light-sheet imaging, what actually happens during the step referred to as &quot;3D volume generation&quot;, or &quot;Three-dimensional volumes were created from individual image sets&quot;, or &quot;Image stacks from individual fish brains were converted to 3D volumes”? Does this simply refer to the stitching plus resampling procedure?</p><p>If I understand correctly, the ultimate step in generating a template brain was to mirror the first average, then register the previously linearly aligned TOPRO samples to to it. Although I appreciate from the data I retrieved from Dryad that the result is a symmetric brain, I can't quite understand why this procedure yielded a symmetric template, rather than just a more precise template with left/right reversal, so please describe what happened in this step more clearly.</p><p>More importantly, while in general a symmetric template is desirable (especially for computational approaches), this procedure obscures important biological asymmetries present in the habenula, a major focus of neurobiological studies in zebrafish. Could you somehow exclude the habenula from the symmetrization step?</p><p>No information is provided on the precision of the registration procedure. It would be helpful to assess precision so that subsequent users can evaluate whether their own procedures provide sufficiently close alignments.</p><p>I expect that autofluorescence is more variable than TOPRO and carries less information. However there is no information provided for evaluating the quality of the registration achieved using autofluorescence as a bridging channel. Figure 4D (which is small and hard to see) purports to illustrate the accuracy of autofluorescence bridging registration using the example of the Locus Coeruleus. However, because one can not reliably ascertain the LC in either the HuC or TOPRO stain, there is nothing to usefully compare the TH stain to. Precise registration is important because the IHC channels used for segmentation were registered using autofluorescence. Please provide a measurement of registration accuracy using autofluorescence. Why was TOPRO not used with IHC for this step, to provide the strongest alignment?</p><p>The Methods are generally appropriately detailed, and specify the age of the fish. However, 3-4 month old fish can vary widely in size, and therefore presumably in brain volume. It may be helpful to add details on the size of the fish, and how sensitive the accuracy of the registration procedure is to size.</p><p>Much of the segmentation was performed on coronal sections, for which region boundaries are generally smooth. However, when viewed in other planes, boundaries are jagged resulting in artificial discontinuities within regions. It would be desirable to implement at least a simple procedure to smooth region boundaries in 3D space.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the intro page 4 the authors claim the adult zebrafish brain would be &quot;several orders of magnitude larger&quot; than the larval brain. &quot;Several&quot; to me means more than two, but I would think that the adult zebrafish brain is just one order of magnitude larger (larva 500 micrometer, adult 5-15 mm).</p><p>Some images, e.g. in Figure 4, especially 4d, but also parts of Figure 7, are provided with too low resolution in the PDF to judge detail.</p><p>Figure 7B middle panels &quot;0,10&quot;</p><p>Prox1 appears to be an example that a major expression domain maps to a non-annotated anatomical domain – or the prethalamus is so dark here that it cannot be distinguished from black.

This was not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We used several approaches to determine the boundaries of smaller regions. Our primary source of information was the original Wullimann (1996) atlas; notably, our nuclear stain (TO-PRO) yields similar images to the Nissil stain of the Wullimann atlas (lines 143-144). We combined a close examination of this atlas in all axes with recent literature and the fact that we could visualize multiple stains in the same anatomical space at once using ITK-SNAP. By way of example, we show the locus coeruleus (Figure 4D), where we used the TO-PRO, TH, and HuC/D stains to determine the boundary. Another example would be the superior raphe where we used TO-PRO, HuC/D, and 5HT stains to identify the boundaries. The boundaries for many other regions lacking more specific stains were done by combining the TO-PRO and HuC/D stains; we have added sentences to clarify this last point (lines 223-225). However, there was no one combination of stains and approaches that would work for every small region, so we would explore various stains/views/literature to identify boundaries while trying to maintain a smooth segmentation. We also worked with Thomas Mueller, a world renowned expert in zebrafish neuroanatomy, and an author on the manuscript, on segmentation. Nonetheless, we recognize that there may be disagreement with some of our choices for boundaries, and thus we anticipate updating and continually improving the atlas as we incorporate more stains and obtain feedback from the scientific community. To facilitate this, we have now included a website (azba.wayne.edu) that includes contact information for the lead π for any comments users may have on the atlas (lines 397-399).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What is the true estimate of error of their imaging approach? 8 microns is pretty large, and might lead to errors in tagging individual cells. How do they sort this out? This is not well presented in this current version of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>When creating the atlas our goal was not to identify individual cells but to be able to delineate the boundaries of different brain regions (we have clarified this point by altering lines 146-147 to make clear that our goal was to identify regional boundaries not individual cells). For registration, we downsampled images to 8 micron isotropic resolution because higher resolution required more computational resources than we had at our disposal on the high performance cluster at Sickkids Hospital. By way of comparison, registration for the Allen Brain Atlas for mice is often done at 20 micron isotropic. However, it should be noted that the downsampling of the images for registration is distinct from steps that would be used for cell counting/identification. We would expect users to acquire images at the resolution needed to detect individual cells and only downsample as needed during the registration process. The downsampling would have no effect on the ability to assign individual cells to specific anatomical structures given that the volume of the brain regions in the atlas are well above 8 µm<sup>3</sup> (e.g, the smallest region is 26,496 µm<sup>3</sup>; for all volumes; Supplementary file 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How many different fish did they image? We now know there are a LOT of differences even between siblings of wild-type lines. This would provide another form of error they would need to address, if nothing else for users to explore their resource.</p></disp-quote><p>All fish were from the AB strain. For the TO-PRO stain, we averaged together images from 17 fish (line 532). For antibody stains we used images from at least five animals (lines 187-188). Because our goal was to generate a representative brain that did not reflect potential idiosyncrasies of individual animals, we averaged images from multiple fish together. However, the inclusion of individual data points in our analysis of sex and brain volume will allow readers to explore the variability of different brain region sizes across animals (Figure 5 —figure supplements 2 and 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My comments below should be interpreted only as efforts to make this atlas as user-friendly as possible.</p><p>Understandably, due to the incomplete knowledge of the zebrafish brain, some parts of the brain have not been segmented.

Thus, the average brain for the TOPRO signal is not tilted across axes but instead parallel to the axes and the images. This was used to create the initial TOPRO and autofluorescence signal average image. Once this average image is parallel with the image axes then this step is no longer used. No image in the final atlas space has been made symmetric. We have made edits to our text to clarify this by removing the word symmetric to describe the average brain from the second pipeline (lines 550-552).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>No information is provided on the precision of the registration procedure. It would be helpful to assess precision so that subsequent users can evaluate whether their own procedures provide sufficiently close alignments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now assessed the precision of our registration using both the TO-PRO signal and the autofluorescence signals (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1). Although we found the TO-PRO image to give greater precision (15 vs 99 µm), there are some caveats to this comparison. Namely, because the autofluorescence images lack cells, it is more difficult to identify common landmarks in the autofluorescence images than the TOPRO images. This is supported by the greater amount of variability in our registration precision for the autofluorescence versus TO-PRO images (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1). We have now included our findings and a discussion of this caveat in the manuscript (results: lines 193-209; methods: lines 565-570; Figure 4 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>The Methods are generally appropriately detailed, and specify the age of the fish.

Nonetheless, we have now assessed the brain volumes of all the fish used in the TO-PRO registration (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 and 2) which also provides an estimate of the variability in brain size in our samples (~2 to 3.5 mm<sup>3</sup>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I expect that autofluorescence is more variable than TOPRO and carries less information. However there is no information provided for evaluating the quality of the registration achieved using autofluorescence as a bridging channel. Figure 4D (which is small and hard to see) purports to illustrate the accuracy of autofluorescence bridging registration using the example of the Locus Coeruleus. However, because one can not reliably ascertain the LC in either the HuC or TOPRO stain, there is nothing to usefully compare the TH stain to. Precise registration is important because the IHC channels used for segmentation were registered using autofluorescence. Please provide a measurement of registration accuracy using autofluorescence. Why was TOPRO not used with IHC for this step, to provide the strongest alignment?</p><p>The Methods are generally appropriately detailed, and specify the age of the fish.

However, when viewed in other planes, boundaries are jagged resulting in artificial discontinuities within regions. It would be desirable to implement at least a simple procedure to smooth region boundaries in 3D space.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate the reviewer pointing this out as it pushed us to figure out a way to make segmentation smooth in all three planes. This has significantly improved the quality of the segmentation across the three axes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the intro page 4 the authors claim the adult zebrafish brain would be &quot;several orders of magnitude larger&quot; than the larval brain. &quot;Several&quot; to me means more than two, but I would think that the adult zebrafish brain is just one order of magnitude larger (larva 500 micrometer, adult 5-15 mm).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. As the reviewer notes, the size of a larval brain is estimated to be ~0.3 mm<sup>3</sup>. We find our adult zebrafish to have a brain volume of approximately 3 mm<sup>3</sup>.

To facilitate exploration of the atlas in greater detail, we have now created a website that is broadly accessible and straightforward to navigate (azba.wayne.edu). We now mention the existence of this website in the abstract (line 45) and the body of the manuscript (line 327). Even greater detail can be explored using the free, user friendly, open-source software, ITK-SNAP. To facilitate the use of ITK-SNAP, we have created a YouTube video tutorial with how to load and explore the atlas after downloading the files from Dryad (https://youtu.be/uVLqFJd4LDk).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7B middle panels &quot;0,10&quot;</p><p>Prox1 appears to be an example that a major expression domain maps to a non-annotated anatomical domain – or the prethalamus is so dark here that it cannot be distinguished from black.
