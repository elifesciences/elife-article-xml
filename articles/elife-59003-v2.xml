extensively connected with both local amygdalar nuclei as well as long-range circuits, is involved in a diverse array of functional roles. Understanding the mechanisms of such functional diversity will be greatly informed by understanding the cell-type-specific landscape of the BLA. Here, beginning with single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified both discrete and graded continuous gene-expression differences within the mouse BLA. Via in situ hybridization, we next mapped this discrete transcriptomic heterogeneity onto a sharp spatial border between the basal and lateral amygdala nuclei, and identified continuous spatial gene-expression gradients within each of these regions. These discrete and continuous spatial transformations of transcriptomic cell-type identity were recapitulated by local morphology as well as long-range connectivity. Thus, BLA excitatory neurons are a highly heterogenous collection of neurons that spatially covary in molecular, cellular, and circuit properties. This heterogeneity likely drives pronounced spatial variation in BLA computation and function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>cell type</kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2019-04507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cembrowski</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-419798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cembrowski</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000196</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>John R.

Classically, the amygdala has been studied for the role it plays in acquisition and expression of conditioned fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fanselow and LeDoux, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maren and Quirk, 2004</xref>), with more recent evidence also implicating this brain region to be involved in other aversive states like anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daviu et al., 2019</xref>). Complementing this work examining the role of the amygdala in negative valence settings, it is also becoming increasingly apparent that the amygdala participates in appetitive and reward-based behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxter and Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wassum and Izquierdo, 2015</xref>). The mechanisms by which this single brain region mediates such a variety of functions is unclear.</p><p>One reductionist approach to understanding amygdala computation lies in identifying functional contributions of specific amygdalar regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyeler and Dabrowska, 2020</xref>). The basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) is one region that has received particular attention, in large part due to its high degree of reciprocal long-range connectivity with other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Little and Carter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGarry and Carter, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Senn et al., 2014</xref>). This anatomical arrangement suggests a powerful role for the BLA in orchestrating a variety of long-range computations, and moreover, enables circuit-specific experimental access for mapping circuits onto function and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). Harnessing this experimental tractability, a body of work has emerged demonstrating that BLA projections to different downstream regions control of a range of diverse, and sometimes bidirectional, functional and behavioral phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyeler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgos-Robles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Felix-Ortiz and Tye, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tye et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>One central consideration for interpreting circuit-based manipulations is understanding the extent to which BLA neurons can be considered to be an intrinsically homogeneous population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zirlinger et al., 2001</xref>). In principle, differential behavioral effects following circuit-specific BLA manipulations may simply reflect different downstream readouts of otherwise identical BLA inputs. Conversely, and not mutually exclusively, such differential behavior could also reflect variable intrinsic BLA neuron identity that conveys different long-range information independent of downstream readout. Indeed, as different BLA projections can emanate from different gross geographic locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyeler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGarry and Carter, 2017</xref>), there exists a potential organizational substrate wherein projection target and intrinsic identity of BLA neurons might spatially covary.</p><p>One perspective that can provide comprehensive insight into BLA neuronal identity is from transcriptomic ‘cell typing’, wherein cells with similar gene-expression properties can be identified and mapped onto higher order structural and functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cembrowski, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lein et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</xref>). This approach has proven useful for deciphering cell-type-specific organization and operation in a wide variety of other brain regions, especially in cases where spatial variation in gene expression can be mapped to spatial variation in higher order properties (e.g. morphology, connectivity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cembrowski et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cembrowski and Spruston, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Economo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lein et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mandelbaum et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, application of transcriptomic cell typing to the BLA has the potential to inform cell-type-specific identity rules and spatial organization, as well as to infer higher-order structural and functional correlates.</p><p>Here, we employed such a cell-typing approach to understand the extent and organization of heterogeneity within the excitatory neuronal population of the BLA. To initially assess variation within this population, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing, identifying both coarse discrete heterogeneity as well as fine-scale graded variation. To map this variation in space, we used single-gene and multiplexed in situ hybridization, mapping both discrete and graded transcriptomic variation onto spatial axes of the BLA. Finally, leveraging this spatial heterogeneity in gene expression, we identified similar spatial differences in BLA connectivity and morphology. Ultimately, our work demonstrates that excitatory neurons of the BLA are a highly heterogeneous collection of neurons that vary in space across molecular, cellular, and circuit properties. This prominent variation in intrinsic BLA identity likely contributes to pronounced circuit-specific and behavioural effects.

To capture BLA neurons, the BLA was microdissected, dissociated, and individual cells were manually obtained for scRNA-seq. After subsequent processing and sequencing (see Methods), high-depth scRNA-seq data was obtained for 1231 excitatory neurons (5.9 ± 1.2 thousand expressed genes/cell, mean ± SD). Broadly, these scRNA-seq profiles separated into two discretely separated groups via t-SNE visualization and principal component analysis, with this separation recapitulated by graph-based clustering (see Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Such discrete separation was robust, as random classifiers trained on 100 randomly selected cells (~8.1% of total dataset) was sufficient to predict near-perfect classification accuracy of the remaining dataset (91.8% +/- 3.7% accuracy of remaining 1131 cells, N = 1000 trials, mean ± SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Enriched genes within a given subpopulation exhibited a high degree of gene-to-gene variation, wherein the extent of expression of one marker gene was a poor predictor of the extent of expression in another marker gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>).

Markers for BA subpopulation 3 and 4 showed spatial variation, wherein subpopulation three was enriched medially and subpopulation four was enriched laterally. As with the LA, no sharp spatial delineations were seen between subpopulations, and marker genes associated with the same BA subpopulation spatially varied on a gene-to-gene basis.</p><p>Importantly, two features of this variable cell identity suggest that gene expression differences can be largely attributed to graded baseline differences in cell type, rather than cell-state differences driven by activity. First, most enriched genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–I</xref>) are not associated with activity dependence. Second, for the genes that have been associated with activity dependence (e.g. <italic>Bdnf, Nr4a2</italic>), they exhibit different patterns of expression across cells (<italic>Bdnf</italic> vs. <italic>Nr4a2:</italic> scRNA-seq: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, ISH: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> for within-sample mFISH comparison).

However, mapping single genes within individual sections means that gene-expression covariation within individual cells is lost. Additionally, chromogenic ISH is qualitative in nature, which precludes quantitative analyses of gene-expression. To circumvent these limitations, and simultaneously investigate both discrete and continuous heterogeneity with the BLA, we next employed multiplexed single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (mFISH). With this multiplexed approach, we mapped 12 gene-expression targets in the same tissue, providing a comprehensive assessment of cell-type identity and organization at single-cell resolution in space.

This aggregation is typically due to a lack of a clear cytoarchitectonic boundary between the two nuclei in most experimental settings (e.g. DAPI counterstain). As this LA-BA divide can be challenging to practically identify, this may also suggest that the LA and BA can be functionally aggregated. However, given that the amygdala is frequently referenced as a brain region that is relatively arbitrarily named in both structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Swanson and Petrovich, 1998</xref>), such a BLA gross aggregation may conceal important underlying heterogeneity.</p><p>Indeed, a collection of disparate evidence illustrates specific features that divide the LA and BA. Classically, the LA and BA have been partitioned with respect to histochemical stains (e.g. acetylcholinesterase) and the orientation of fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">LeDoux, 2007</xref>). There is a variety of work that shows LA and BA also exhibit differences in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zirlinger et al., 2001</xref>), morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McDonald, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sah et al., 2003</xref>), and behavioral recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyeler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herry et al., 2008</xref>). Although these results argue for differences between the LA and BA, their disparate and multimodal nature make it challenging to assess the overall degree of separability between the LA and BA. It is also challenging to assess whether such heterogeneity emerges from continuous or discrete differences across the two nuclei.</p><p>An advantage of our transcriptomics-based analyses is that it allows complete quantification of a given feature; that is, quantified expression of every gene in the genome. Leveraging this complete approach, our work revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes between the LA and BA, producing discrete separation between the two nuclei in both gene-expression space and geographical space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). In addition to this degree of differential expression being numerically large, many of these genes were also central to neuronal structure and function, thus suggesting that higher order structural and functional differences should be apparent within the BLA. This prediction was embodied by both differences in projection targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and cell-body size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

Such a spatial arrangement is not necessarily expected a priori; indeed, there is evidence in many other brain regions wherein prominent graded transcriptomic heterogeneity does not have a spatial correlate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stanley et al., 2020</xref>). The finding of a spatial covariate of this gene-expression heterogeneity is important, as it facilitates histological cross-validation of scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Moreover, it provides a ‘Rosetta stone’ for registering and comparing our work to previous spatially resolved structural and function characterizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cembrowski and Spruston, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In atlas parcellations of the BLA, both the BA and LA are frequently partitioned into subnuclei, with the LA divided into the dorsolateral, ventrolateral, and ventromedial domains, and the BA divided into anterior and posterior domains. Although such discrete parcellations are provided to emphasize differences between these geographic regions, a body of evidence suggests that the heterogeneity underlying these subnuclei divisions may be spatially graded rather than discrete. For example, dendritic morphologies change gradually across subnuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McDonald, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sah et al., 2003</xref>), both the BA and LA have continua in firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sah et al., 2003</xref>), and topographical gradients of connectivity are present across the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyeler et al., 2018</xref>). Similar functional correlates, although typically sampled at a relatively coarser resolution in space, are also present within the BA along the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergstrom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goosens and Maren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>What are the potential functional advantages of such graded heterogeneity? One such answer may be found when considering this organization with respect to the computational demands required of the BLA. In particular, this brain region subserves neuronal and behavioural responses to fear, anxiety, and reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxter and Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maren and Quirk, 2004</xref>). In all these settings, graded neural representations are likely important for ensuring graded behavioral responses, and having a continuum in BA and LA cell-type identity could facilitate population-level coding of graded neural representations and responses. Indeed, such an organizational scheme is consistent with postulated graded representations within the BLA populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kyriazi et al., 2018</xref>), and thus such graded identity may allow cell-type variability to help match the space of necessary computations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cell-type classification: transcriptomics vs other methodologies</title><p>As our findings here leverage transcriptomics for cell-type classification, it is important to make the distinction between transcriptomically defined cell types relative to cell types defined by other criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</xref>). Of particular note to the graded transcriptomic identity found here, cells that have a continuous gene-expression identity may nonetheless be functionally distinct in ways that are not predicted solely by transcriptomic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). One such example of this is a gene-expression threshold needed for associated protein products and function, which can effectively impose a higher-order discrete phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cembrowski and Menon, 2018</xref>).

In principle, such heterogeneity may make manipulation efficacy inherently variable between projections, especially for methodologies that rely on intrinsic properties of neurons to exert effects (e.g. DREADDs: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roth, 2016</xref>). A means of circumventing such limitations, and complementing existing circuit-specific manipulations, lies in examining intrinsic activity of the BLA across space agnostic to projection target. Such an approach leverages the spatial heterogeneity identified in our study, and will help to identify how spatial gene-expression differences map onto functional variability. In combination within circuit-specific manipulations, this work will provide an important understanding of how intrinsic- and circuit-level operations interact to evoke the wide array of BLA-associated phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Informing and interpreting future experiments</title><p>Our work here has revealed the spatial transcriptomic organization of excitatory neurons in the BLA.

For all datasets, library preparation, sequencing, and initial count-based quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>) was performed according to previous methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cembrowski et al., 2018a</xref>). No blinding or randomization was used for the construction or analysis of this dataset. No a priori sample size was determined for the number of animals or cells to use; note that previous methods have indicated that several hundred cells from a single animal is sufficient to resolve heterogeneity within excitatory neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cembrowski et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cembrowski et al., 2018b</xref>).

Cells with &lt;10,000 total counts were excluded from analysis (n = 69 of 1370 initial cells). For all remaining cells, counts were converted to Counts Per Million (CPM) for subsequent analysis. Putative non-neuronal cells (n = 19) were eliminated from the dataset by rejecting cells that exhibited CPM &lt; 250 for <italic>Snap25</italic>, a pan-neuronal marker. For examining excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), interneurons (n = 51) were eliminated from the dataset by rejecting cells that exhibited CPM &gt; 100 for <italic>Gad1</italic>, an interneuron marker.

For examining interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), 51 interneurons were retained (via CPM &gt; 100 for <italic>Gad1</italic>), and variable genes and clusters were obtained via <italic>x.low.cutoff = 0.0125</italic>, <italic>x.high.cutoff = 3, y.cutoff = 3</italic>, <italic>resolution = 1</italic>, and <italic>dims. use = 1:2</italic> parameters. In all cases, subpopulation-specific enriched genes obeying <italic>p<sub>ADJ</sub> &lt;</italic> 0.05 were obtained with Seurat via <italic>FindMarkers()</italic>, where is the <italic>p<sub>ADJ</sub></italic> is the adjusted p-value from Seurat based on Bonferroni correction. Functionally relevant differentially expressed genes were obtained using <italic>FindMarkers()</italic>, allowing for both cluster-specific enriched and depleted genes obeying <italic>p<sub>ADJ</sub> &lt;</italic> 0.05. t-SNE visualization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref> used perplexity = 30 (interneuron analysis: 20), with 1000 iterations (sufficient for convergence) on the default seed. Qualitatively similar results were obtained for other seed values. UMAP visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becht et al., 2019</xref>) was obtained via the R UMAP package, using default parameters, performed on the scaled Seurat dataset with highly variable genes. In total, this approach and associated parameters provided discrete clusters that were consistent with dimensionally reduced visualizations and robust to downsampling, and predicted organizations that were validated by complementary histological methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cembrowski and Spruston, 2017</xref>).</p><p>When plotting gene expression using t-SNE, color ranges from white (zero expression) to red (maximal expression), plotted logarithmically, with the maximum CPM value across all cells provided as an inset. For random forest classification (<italic>ClassifyCells()</italic> in Seurat), random subsets of graph-based clustered cells were taken (n = 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 cells; n = 100 random subsets for each number of cells), and used to predict the cluster identities of the remaining cells in the dataset.</p><p>To compare our work to a recently published scRNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>), we downloaded the ‘TEGLU22 (Excitatory neurons, amygdala)’ dataset from this publication (14,897 total cells). A minimum of 500 total counts was required to initially retain 13,826 total cells from this dataset (1.2 ± 0.7 thousand genes expressed/cell). Interneurons and non-neuronal cells were excluded via the same thresholds used in our scRNA-seq data, and excitatory neurons were further selected for by requiring CPM &gt; 100 for the excitatory neuronal marker <italic>Slc17a7</italic> for these remaining cells, resulting in 1975 total cells used for analysis. Subsequent analysis and visualization, including extraction of variable genes and clusters, was performed identically to our in-house dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Chromogenic in situ hybridization</title><p>All chromogenic ISH images were obtained from the publicly available Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (AMBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lein et al., 2007</xref>). At least one coronal section was selected for analysis within each of the anterior (−0.82 to −0.94 from bregma), intermediate (−1.34 to −1.70 from bregma) and posterior (−1.82 to −2.06 from bregma) regions of the BLA. To facilitate segmentation of expressing cells, images were processed with a gaussian blur filter, binarized with a manually determined intensity threshold, and adjacent cells separated with a watershed function. The locations of segmented cells between 100–400 µm<sup>2</sup> were then measured within the BLA.</p><p>To spatially register cells to a common orientation, the BLA within each image was traced using six points, and then rotated and translated onto a BLA template using a procrustes transformation in R without scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyeler et al., 2018</xref>). The transformation was then applied to the location of segmented cells for the respective image, and then segmented cells were plotted relative to the dorsal-most point of the template. In a minority of cases, a small translation of segmented cells (typically &lt;200 µm) was subsequently performed manually if the procrustes translation misaligned BLA borders. The number of cells within different sub-regions of the BLA were obtained after transformation of segmented cells. Sub-regional boundaries were created for each of the anterior, intermediate or posterior BLA templates, and analyses of all images within a respective BLA anterior-to-posterior region used the same sub-regional boundaries.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Fluorescent in situ hybridization</title><p>Two-color fluorescent ISH was performed according to previous protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>), with extensions for multiplexed approaches (described below). All probes were purchased from Advanced Cell Diagnostics (Hayward, CA) and were as follows: <italic>Cplx1</italic> (482531-C3) and <italic>Gad1</italic> (400951-C2) for two-color FISH, and <italic>Nr4a2</italic> (423351-T1)<italic>, Otof</italic> (485671-T2)<italic>, Cdh13</italic> (443251-T3)<italic>, Rorb</italic> (444271-T4)<italic>, Adamts2</italic> (806371-T5)<italic>, Prss23</italic> (447921-T6), <italic>Bdnf</italic> (424821-T7)<italic>, Slc5a5</italic> (487721-T8)<italic>, Slc17a7</italic> (416631-T9)<italic>, Nnat</italic> (432631-T10)<italic>, Negr1</italic> (806361-T11), and <italic>Cplx1</italic> (482531-T12) for 12-channel multiplexed FISH.</p><p>For multiplexed FISH, 12 probes with unique detection tails were hybridized to tissue and subsequently amplified. Cleavable fluorophores specifically targeting probes 1–4 were then added, the tissue stained for DAPI, and coverslipped with ProLong Gold antifade mounting medium. Within 1–2 days, tissue was imaged with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with a 63x objective. After this first round of imaging, the coverslip was removed by soaking slides in 20x SSC, and the fluorophores cleaved via two consecutive incubations in a 10% TCEP cleaving solution. Cleavable fluorophores specific to probes 5–8 were then added, and the tissue was coverslipped and imaged. This same procedure was then repeated for probes 9–12. Each round of imaging visualized DAPI in the 405 channel, and the subsequent four probes in either Alexa 488, ATTO 550, ATTO 647N, or Alexa 750.</p><p>After the three rounds of imaging to visualize probes 1–4 (round 1), 5–8 (round 2), and 9–12 (round 3), respectively, the images were computationally analyzed via registration, segmentation and quantification from in-house code in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>). The registration code aligned the three rounds of imaging in X, Y, and Z coordinates by taking the maximum projections of the DAPI signal from each round, and via a fast Fourier transform (FFT), identified offsets and translated the DAPI and probe signals from the second round in X and Y. To align in the Z-axis, a slice through the original DAPI stacks was taken and coordinates for translation in Z were once again identified via FFT offset. These steps were repeated to align the third round to the first. Segmentation involved taking the maximum projection of the DAPI signal for the first round and manually thresholding to select nuclei from background. Fiji’s <italic>Watershed</italic> algorithm was run to separate any overlapping cells and then ROIs were selected using the <italic>Analyze Particles</italic> Fiji function. ROIs with an area less than 40 µm (typically reflecting partial cells) or greater than 200 µm (typically reflecting multiple abutting cells) were discarded, and the remaining ROIs dilated by a value of 5 µm to encompass the entire soma. Finally, quantification involved thresholding each of the 12 probe images to separate signal from background. Signals in the 750 channel (<italic>Rorb, Slc5a5, Cplx1</italic>) were quantified after applying a smoothing filter to reduce background. Using the ROIs selected from segmentation, the number of expressing pixels for each probe were summed and normalized by the total pixel area of the cell, producing values of counts per area (CPA).</p><p>The final dataset constituted three sections (anterior, intermediate, and posterior) from one WT mouse, with analysis of segmented, quantified cells proceeding as follows. First, non-excitatory neurons were removed by requiring <italic>Slc17a7</italic> expression (threshold = 0.004 CPA). Cell-to-cell correlations were calculated as Pearson coefficients. For binary <italic>Cplx1</italic> vs. <italic>Negr1</italic> phenotyping, based upon the strongly bimodal structure of <italic>Cplx1</italic> vs. <italic>Negr1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), a winner-take-all strategy was used to assign each excitatory neuron to either <italic>Cplx1</italic> or <italic>Negr1</italic> phenotypes by identifying the gene with greater expression. Excitatory neurons that expressed neither gene were excluded from any phenotype-associated analysis (n = 364 cells). For computing cell area, maximum projection images of <italic>Slc17a7</italic> from anterior, intermediate, and posterior sections were segmented in Fiji, similarly to DAPI. However, prior to thresholding a Gaussian blur filter was applied, but no watershed algorithm was used to prevent incorrect segmentation of cells due to the punctate in situ signal. ROIs with an area less than 75 μm<sup>2</sup> or greater than 450 μm<sup>2</sup> were discarded, and both <italic>Negr1</italic> and <italic>Cplx1</italic> signals then underwent quantification via the same approach mentioned previously. Clustering analysis pooled data from the anterior, intermediate, and posterior BLA sections. This aggregate data set was normalized such that CPA values for each cell added to equal 1. Hierarchical clustering of normalized data was performed in R, with a Euclidean distance metric and Ward’s D2 clustering method. t-SNE (perplexity = 35) was used to visualize the data in dimensionally reduced space, with resultant plots colored according to section position or cluster identity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Viral tracing experiments and analysis</title><p>Mice underwent stereotaxic surgery, wherein either AAV-SL1-CAG-GFP or AAV-SL1-CAG-tdT was injected into a given region with known afferent input from the BLA; namely, the prefrontal cortex (A/P 1.7, M/L 0.60, D/V −2.3), nucleus accumbens (1.34, 1.0,–5.2), ventral hippocampus (−3.55, 3.25,–4.00), auditory cortex (−2.5, 4.5,–2.0), medial entorhinal cortex (−4.6, 3.3,–2.6) or retrosplenial cortex (−1.5, 0.5,–0.5). Dorsal/ventral coordinates were measured from the skull at site of injection (PFC, NAC, VHC), or from the pial surface (MEC, RSC). At each site, 100 nL of virus was injected over 2 min, and the needle remained at the injection site for 3 min post-injection. During surgery, mice were placed under isoflurane anesthesia, and received a local injection of bupivicane along the incision site. The day of surgery, and 2 days following surgery, mice received daily injections of Metacam for post-operative care. Mice were perfused (10 mL of PBS, followed by 50 mL of 4% PFA) and brains extracted 5–9 days following surgery to permit sufficient expression of GFP or tdT.</p><p>Brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS for at least 48 hr, and sectioned at either 20 µm or 100 µm using a cryostat. Sections were mounted onto glass slides and either stored at −80°C until use (20 µm sections), or were processed the following day (100 µm sections). Sections were counterstained with DAPI (1:1000) for 10 min, and coverslipped with PVA-Dabco mounting medium. The location and size of viral-labeled cell bodies was determined manually. As with chromogenic in situ hybridization, locations of labeled cells were translated onto a common BLA template. For the PFC, MEC, ACX and VHC, the location of 28–168 cells were measured per animal. For the NAC, the location of 260–469 cells were measured per animal, given a higher density of virally labelled cells compared to the other injection sites. For the RSC, 12–32 cells were measured per animal, given a lower number of virally labeled cells compared to other injection sites.</p><p>To establish a null model to compute statistically enriched projections from LA or BA, we used <italic>Slc17a7</italic> (excitatory) neurons from LA and BA to establish chance estimates.

This random selection was repeated 1000 times, and the mean and 95% confidence intervals were calculated across iterations. Projections were denoted as statistically enriched if the empirically observed number fell outside of the 95% confidence interval.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fluorescence imaging</title><p>All mFISH histological images were acquired with a 63x objective on a SP8 white light laser confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Concord, Ontario, Canada), with z-stacks with step size of 0.35 µm were acquired for each round of imaging.

the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Extensive and spatially variable within-cell-type heterogeneity across the basolateral amygdala&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Benjamin W Okaty (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The BLA is known to participate in a wide range of behaviors and neurons of the BLA are already known through tracing to connect to different regions. Here the authors ask whether there is heterogeneity in gene expression within different neurons of the BLA and conclude that these differences in gene expression may define neurons that participate in different BLA functions. Using scRNA-seq with in situ validation, the authors find transcriptomic separation of lateral from basal amygdala neurons as well as identifying less distinctly spatially segregated subpopulations of neurons in each of the two subdivisions. Overall this dataset will be helpful to researchers studying amygdala function.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers concurred on three points that they felt should be strengthened through text revision or data analysis to fully support the conclusions of the manuscript. I have included the full text of the reviewers' comments on these points including suggestions for further data or analyses because they offer insight into the nature of the concerns. These are just suggestions, however, and we invite the authors to decide how to respond.</p><p>1) The authors need to further justify the clustering parameters used.</p><p>One review said, &quot;While I recognize it is not a trivial problem to identify clustering parameters to fully capture cell type diversity, I am concerned that the number of cells is in the dataset may be too low, which is limiting cluster resolution. Alternatively, the clustering parameters used for Figure 2 and beyond may not be optimized to capture more granular transcriptionally distinct cell types. Methods such as IKAP (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/596817v1) have been developed to identify clustering parameters based on the particular dataset. Did the authors use this or some other method to arrive at their clustering parameters? Can they scientifically justify the parameters they chose?&quot;</p><p>A second suggested, &quot;Did the authors make any attempt to cluster cells based on mFISH CPA values of all 12 genes? If so, what did that look like; i.e. how well does this particular set of 12 genes serve to classify all six clusters identified by scRNAseq? Might it be possible to use this mFISH data to further characterize anterior/posterior or dorsal/ventral bias of finer-scale subclusters, rather than based solely on single marker genes? While the correlation analysis does a nice job of showing graded spatial heterogeneity, it would still be informative to see some sort of quantification of spatial bias of all the scRNA-seq subclusters, as inferred by mFISH.&quot;</p><p>2) A central and critical theme of the manuscript is the idea of continuous gradients of gene expression. However this concept raised two different sets of questions – one about the definition of cell types and one about the concept of continuous distributions in space.</p><p>a) While transcriptomic cell-typing is a powerful tool for neuron classification, cells that exist along a continuum in gene expression space may nonetheless constitute functionally distinct subtypes in ways that are not fully &quot;reducible&quot; to well-separated transcriptomic boundaries alone. Moreover, continuous expression gradients may become discretized at higher levels of regulation (e.g. a critical mRNA expression threshold may be required for protein expression, or gene/protein expression level may have some nonlinear relationship with higher-order cell phenotypes etc.). Could the authors perhaps give a more nuanced discussion of these possibilities? Specifically, I think it's important to explicitly make the distinction between transcriptomically defined neuron subtypes and subtypes defined by other criteria.</p><p>Certainly a desirable goal is to have a comprehensive measure of cell identity that subsumes multiple levels of description, and in ideal circumstances cellular transcriptome and other phenotypes may overlap in a clear-cut way. However, that may not always be the case. For example – when describing the results of Kim et al., 2016 with respect to there being functionally distinct subtypes of BLA neurons marked by expression of <italic>Ppp1r1b</italic> or <italic>Rspo2</italic>, the authors state: &quot;In the context of our results here, we interpret these previous results as analyzing opposite extremes of a continuum; indeed, in our scRNA-seq data <italic>Ppp1r1b</italic> and <italic>Rspo2</italic> are enriched in opposite ends of the BA transcriptomic spectrum and do not conform to distinct subtypes. Thus, results predicated on analyzing these two populations may reflect relatively arbitrary divisions of a continuum, rather than examination of well-separated subtypes.&quot;</p><p><italic>Ppp1r1b</italic> and <italic>Rspo2</italic> appear to be expressed at the highest levels in clusters BA1 and BA4, respectively. While the boundary between BA1 and BA4 in tSNE-space is more graded than discrete, these clusters are nonetheless separable by Louvain clustering, and random forest classification of subsampled data appears to fail mostly at the interface of these clusters, not at the &quot;opposite extremes&quot;. Thus, if these two genes are enriched in &quot;opposite ends of the BA transcriptomic spectrum&quot;, is it truly &quot;arbitrary&quot; to use these genes to parse BLA neurons into different subtypes? Moreover, Kim et al., 2016 found that neurons marked by one or the other gene exhibited different spatial biases, responded to different stimuli, and regulated different behaviors, all of which suggests that these indeed represent functionally distinct neuron subtypes.</p><p>b) My only concern relates to the way the authors discuss the concept of spatial gradients. I find the wording confusing both with respect to gene expression and with respect to the projections. One example is where the authors refer to a &quot;continuous spectrum&quot; of cell types defined by gene expression across the LA. This emerges again where it says &quot;both the BA and LA exhibit variable cell-type identity that transformed continuously in space&quot;. However, especially since the authors are looking at one gene at a time, it is not clear it is quite continuous – which along with the word &quot;graded&quot; sounds to me like it goes from high to low so quantification would be required. With respect to the gene expression data that are analyzed by the multi-color in situ (which is a powerful experiment) it was unclear when the authors refer to &quot;graded&quot; versus &quot;discrete&quot; do they take into account levels of expression or is this just a +/- call above threshold? This is certainly a quantitative method but it is not clear in Figure 6 that the quantitative data were used. This would be nice to see and would likely make this concept more clear.</p><p>3) Two of the reviewers raised questions about BLA interneurons. The reviewers agreed that exploring interneuron transcriptomes was not essential in this paper but suggested that the authors clarify the following points:</p><p>a) The authors say they use a manual approach &quot;that facilitates capture of excitatory neurons&quot; but the methods offer no description of how that selectivity would be achieved other than via a careful dissection of a brain region primarily composed of those neurons. This should be clarified.</p><p>b) The paper largely ignores interneuron populations in and around the BLA. Including pericapsular GABAergic clusters. This is despite these cells being an integral component of BLA circuitry. To make the paper more comprehensive, the authors could include data from the 51 interneurons they collected, and provide some description of the cell types. If the authors cannot provide these data, it should be made explicitly clear in the text that these data are not included.</p><p>c) Subsection “Discrete separation in gene expression maps onto the lateral vs. basal amygdala nuclei” and Figure 3—figure supplement 1: If the authors want to make the strong statement that the &quot;spill-over&quot; is interneurons, they need to show that with double labeled in situ, not just argue that the pattern of expression is similar in number and general spatial distribution.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59003.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers concurred on three points that they felt should be strengthened through text revision or data analysis to fully support the conclusions of the manuscript. I have included the full text of the reviewers' comments on these points including suggestions for further data or analyses because they offer insight into the nature of the concerns. These are just suggestions, however, and we invite the authors to decide how to respond.</p><p>1) The authors need to further justify the clustering parameters used.</p><p>One review said, &quot;While I recognize it is not a trivial problem to identify clustering parameters to fully capture cell type diversity, I am concerned that the number of cells is in the dataset may be too low, which is limiting cluster resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>Generally, our plate-based manual capture approach is designed to produce high-read-depth transcriptomes, and thus is well-powered to detect gene-expression differences within profiled cells. Complementary approaches that are designed to survey a larger number of cells (e.g., droplet-based 10X Genomics Chromium) are more efficient at capturing rare cell types, but due to dropout effects and low depth, perform relatively poorly at detecting heterogeneity and subclusters within common cell types (see, e.g., “Direct Comparative Analysis of 10X Genomics Chromium and Smart-seq2”, Wang et al., bioRxiv, 2019). Thus, in principle, our approach is relatively well-positioned to reveal heterogeneity within classical types of the BLA.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we now show this advantage is born out in practice. First, in examining transcriptomes of interneurons, we are able to identify and validate distinct interneuron subtypes despite only having tens of cells in each cluster (see new Figure 6—figure supplement 3; see also our response to comment 3). Requiring only tens of cells to resolve and validate separable clusters is also consistent with our previously published work (e.g., Cembrowski et al., 2018a; Cembrowski et al., 2018b). From these results, it seems unlikely that the &gt;1,200 cells profiled from the BLA excitatory neuron population significantly limits cluster resolution.</p><p>To reinforce this, we also now perform a direct comparison to an existing, larger 10X</p><p>Genomics Chromium droplet-based dataset (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Despite this droplet-based dataset having a great number of cells (n = 1,975 cells in this dataset; cf. 1,231 cells in our dataset), the relatively low-read-depth nature of this droplet-based dataset does not recover the clusters we discover in our work here.</p><p>Thus, multiple new lines of evidence suggest that our approach is well-suited to resolve transcriptomic heterogeneity of BLA excitatory neurons. Nonetheless, as with any transcriptomics study, there always exists the principle that acquiring more cells may illustrate further heterogeneity. We now mention this possibility, in conjunction with our above points, in our revised manuscript (see revised Discussion on “Graded spatial heterogeneity and functional implications”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, the clustering parameters used for Figure 2 and beyond may not be optimized to capture more granular transcriptionally distinct cell types. Methods such as IKAP (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/596817v1) have been developed to identify clustering parameters based on the particular dataset. Did the authors use this or some other method to arrive at their clustering parameters? Can they scientifically justify the parameters they chose?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Our approach for justifying our obtained scRNA-seq clusters is two-fold. First, we ensure agreement between clustering methods and other computational analyses. In our manuscript here, this took the form of ensuring clusters are in agreement with cluster-free visualizations of data in dimensionally-reduced space (e.g., Figure 2A, B; Figure 2—figure supplement 1), and that clusters are robust to down-sampling (e.g., Figure 2C). The parameters we chose in our manuscript here captured robust clusters across these complementary computational approaches.</p><p>Second, we next ensure that cell-type predictions from single-cell RNA-seq can be cross-validated by other experimental data. In our manuscript here, this took the form of cross-validation by the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and mFISH (e.g., Figures 3, 5, 6). This approach, relying on different animals and methodologies (as well as laboratories, in the case of the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas), provides much stronger validation than can be provided by different analytical approaches applied to a fixed RNA-seq dataset.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we now summarize this approach to cluster selection in our Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second suggested, &quot;Did the authors make any attempt to cluster cells based on mFISH CPA values of all 12 genes? If so, what did that look like; i.e. how well does this particular set of 12 genes serve to classify all six clusters identified by scRNAseq?”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and in our revised manuscript, we now have performed clustering of mFISH data (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2). This analysis recapitulates the general organizational patterns we previously identified using scRNAseq and chromogenic ISH: two clusters recapitulate a BA vs. LA divide, and six clusters produces further graded heterogeneity within these discrete clusters. Thus, interestingly, this relatively small set of 12 genes is sufficient to reproduce the general organizational patterns of BLA heterogeneity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Might it be possible to use this mFISH data to further characterize anterior/posterior or dorsal/ventral bias of finer-scale subclusters, rather than based solely on single marker genes? While the correlation analysis does a nice job of showing graded spatial heterogeneity, it would still be informative to see some sort of quantification of spatial bias of all the scRNA-seq subclusters, as inferred by mFISH.</p></disp-quote><p>In principle, we can use our mFISH data to infer fine-scale organization based on these 12 genes. However, we are wary to do this formally in the manuscript, as all of our analyses suggest within-BA and within-LA subclusters reflect elements of a continuum. Thus, emphasizing spatial domains of subclusters may lead the reader to incorrectly infer that subclusters reflect well-separated, distinct subtypes of cells. To avoid this potential confusion, we would prefer to avoid such a characterization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A central and critical theme of the manuscript is the idea of continuous gradients of gene expression.
