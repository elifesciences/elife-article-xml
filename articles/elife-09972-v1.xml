The extent to which the cucullaris muscle is a cranial muscle allied with the gill levators of anamniotes or is instead a trunk muscle is an ongoing debate. Novel computed tomography datasets reveal broad conservation of the cucullaris in gnathostomes, including coelacanth and caecilian, two sarcopterygians previously thought to lack it. In chicken, lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) adjacent to occipital somites is a recently identified embryonic source of cervical musculature. We fate-map this mesoderm in the axolotl (<italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>), which retains external gills, and demonstrate its contribution to posterior gill-levator muscles and the cucullaris. Accordingly, LPM adjacent to the occipital somites should be regarded as posterior cranial mesoderm. The axial position of the head-trunk border in axolotl is congruent between LPM and somitic mesoderm, unlike in chicken and possibly other amniotes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09972.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09972.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09972.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscles in the head and trunk (main body) form from different parts of the embryo, and their development uses different genes. Trunk muscles are derived from somites – paired blocks of cells arranged in segments on either side of the midline (which divides the body into left and right halves). By contrast, cells that give rise to head muscles are arranged in a continuous mass.</p><p>But what about neck muscles? Some studies claim they develop like head muscles; others suggest they are trunk muscles. These studies commonly examine mice or chickens. By examining species that have a more primitive complement of head and neck muscles, Sefton et al. now show that a neck muscle should be considered a kind of head muscle.</p><p>Gill muscles are definitive head muscles. Sefton et al. found that the cucullaris, a prominent neck muscle in fishes and amphibians, forms from the same mass of cells that gives rise to gill muscles. Moreover, studying muscle development in Mexican axolotls showed that cells that contribute to gill muscles extend into the trunk, which is further back in the embryo than was previously known.</p><p>Previous studies reported the cucullaris muscle is absent in a “lobe-finned” fish called the coelacanth, which is closely related to four-limbed animals. However, by using a technique called micro-computed tomography to visualize the neck muscles of this fish, Sefton et al. show that the cucullaris muscle is present and connects the rear-most gill to the shoulder.</p><p>The finding that neck muscles form like head muscles in the axolotl confirms a previous claim that was based on studies of bird embryos. A future challenge is to understand the molecular and genetic mechanisms that establish the boundary between head and trunk muscles, and work out how those mechanisms might have influenced how the neck evolved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09972.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09972.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Axolotl</kwd><kwd>Coelacanth</kwd><kwd>Caecilian</kwd><kwd>muscle development</kwd><kwd>neck evolution</kwd><kwd>fate mapping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005231</institution-id><institution>Sigma Delta Epsilon-Graduate Women in Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sefton</surname><given-names>Elizabeth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Both gill musculature and the evolutionarily conserved cucullaris muscle are derived from unsegmented mesoderm adjacent to the first 3 somites, extending the posterior limit of cranial mesoderm.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolution of a mobile neck was a key innovation at the origin of tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daeschler et al., 2006</xref>). It involved expansion of muscles, some derived from the head (cranial muscles) and some from the trunk, to support the skull apart from the pectoral girdle and permit a greater range of movement of the head relative to the rest of the body. Cranial muscles support a variety of functions, including feeding, respiration, vision, facial expression and vocalization. They are distinct from trunk muscles in genetic regulation and susceptibility to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noden, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Noden et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sambasivan et al., 2009</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bismuth and Relaix, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diogo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noden and Francis-West, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tzahor, 2009</xref>). Developmentally, they are non-somitic, arising instead from cranial paraxial and splanchnic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couly et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noden, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans and Noden, 2006</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Noden and Trainor, 2005</xref>). Cranial muscle regulatory factors include <italic>Isl1, Tbx1, MyoR, Capsulin</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic>, which operate in specific muscle groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hacker and Guthrie, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sambasivan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mootoosamy and Dietrich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harel et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Pitx2</italic>, for example, specifies mandibular arch mesoderm but not hyoid arch mesoderm in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shih et al., 2007a</xref>). In contrast to cranial muscle, formation of trunk muscle is <italic>Pax3-</italic>dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tajbakhsh et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>The domain of the vertebrate neck contains two muscle groups: the hypobranchial muscles ventrally and the cucullaris dorsally. Hypobranchial muscles are derived from occipital somites, which form the hypoglossal cord and migrate towards the tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noden, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Rahilly and Müller, 1984</xref>). The number of occipital somites contributing to cranial structures varies among species, however. For example, somites 2 and 3 form both hypobranchial musculature and the occipital arch in the axolotl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piekarski and Olsson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2014</xref>), whereas in chicken somites 2–5 form both the occipital region of the skull and tongue musculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couly et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2000</xref>).</p><p>The cucullaris muscle, a feature of gnathostomes, connects the head to the pectoral girdle, thus spanning the transition zone between cranial and trunk myogenic signaling regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuratani, 1997</xref>). It is the putative homologue of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid in amniotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lubosch et al., 1938</xref>). In sharks and the Queensland lungfish, the cucullaris elevates the gill arches and protracts the pectoral girdle. It originates near the skull and continues caudally and ventrally to insert on the scapular region of the pectoral girdle; a ventral fascicle extends to the posteriormost branchial bar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edgeworth, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allis, 1917</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vetter, 1874</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greenwood and Lauder, 1981</xref>). The cucullaris is a thin muscle, and it can be difficult to visualize its three-dimensional position vis-à-vis adjacent skeleton and musculature. Hence, it is poorly described in many taxa with regard to both its shape and its relation to other cranial and trunk musculature. It is innervated by the accessory ramus of the vagus (X) nerve in anamniotes, but primarily by the accessory (XI) nerve in amniotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edgeworth, 1935</xref>). While in chicken the connective-tissue component of hypobranchial muscles and the ventrolateral neck region is derived from neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Le Lièvre and Le Douarin, 1975</xref>), the cucullaris is reported to have somite-derived connective tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noden, 1983</xref>). The derivation of connective-tissue components of the mouse trapezius is not fully resolved; both lateral plate mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durland et al., 2008</xref>) and neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsuoka et al., 2005</xref>) are reported sources.</p><p>While a somitic derivation of the hypobranchial muscles is widely accepted, the embryonic origin of the cucullaris is controversial (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tada and Kuratani, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ericsson et al., 2013</xref>). Historically, the cucullaris was considered a branchiomeric cranial muscle based in part on its anatomical relation to the gill levators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vetter, 1874</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edgeworth, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Piatt, 1938</xref>). Subsequent fate mapping of anterior somites in chicken and axolotl, though, demonstrated a somitic (trunk) contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noden, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couly et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piekarski and Olsson, 2007</xref>). More recent fate mapping in chicken and genetic analysis in mouse reveal that the trapezius is primarily a lateral plate mesoderm-derived structure that employs a cranial, rather than trunk, myogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Theis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lescroart et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>These data leave unresolved whether the lateral plate origin of the cucullaris is the result of a posterior shift of the head myogenic program or if instead head mesoderm extends caudally into the region adjacent to the anterior somites. To distinguish between these hypotheses, it is important to define the posterior limit of myogenic cranial mesoderm in an organism with a relatively conservative cervical and branchial region. Amniote branchial-arch musculature is reduced in comparison to that of piscine sarcopterygians and aquatic salamanders such as the axolotl, which has a relatively plesiomorphic arrangement of cranial muscle. Moreover, axolotls possess bushy external gills and their associated musculature, which likely were present in the larvae of Paleozoic tetrapods, as well as a robust gill skeleton, which was present in the earliest limbed stem tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoch and Witzmann, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we address this problem from a combined morphological, genetic and developmental perspective. In the axolotl, we locate the head-trunk boundary within unsegmented cranial mesoderm. In addition, we use micro-computed tomography (CT) to describe the morphology of the cucullaris and gill levators in a phylogenetically diverse series of gnathostome taxa, including limbless caecilians and the coelacanth, the sister taxon to all other extant lobe-finned fishes. In previous studies, the cucullaris was investigated largely by gross dissection. In many species, however, the cucullaris is a thin, superficial muscle embedded in several layers of fat and connective tissue. It can be difficult to expose without damaging its in situ context with respect to the trunk and the pectoral girdle. Our CT-based reconstructions reveal such three-dimensional relationships without tissue disruption.</p><p>In those taxa that have both branchial levators and a cucullaris, the cucullaris consistently appears to be in series with the levators. This suggests that the cucullaris is a serial homolog of the levators, thus supporting a cranial muscle identity of the cucullaris. Likewise, in the axolotl, although the cucullaris in adults assumes a large, triangular 'trapezius-like' morphology, the larval cucullaris is clearly in series with the levators. The ubiquity of the cucullaris further supports the hypothesis that it is a critical component of the head-trunk connection in gnathostomes. To study the development of tissues in the transitional region spanned by the levators and cucullaris, we extend modern fate-mapping techniques and gene-expression analysis of cranial mesoderm to the axolotl. We show that unsegmented mesoderm adjacent to the anterior three somites contributes to the cucullaris as well as to the gill-levator muscles in a manner consistent with their apparent serial homology, which supports categorization of the cucullaris as a branchiomeric muscle. Cranial mesoderm markers, including <italic>isl1</italic> and <italic>tbx1,</italic> also are expressed in the developing cucullaris region. We find molecular regionalization of the cranial muscles at stage 40, with distinct expression patterns in the mandibular and hyoid arch musculature. Adductor muscles within the mandibular arch have distinct gene expression patterns as well. We argue that the posterior limit of cranial mesoderm in the axolotl extends caudally to the axial level of somite 3 and that the head-trunk boundary is consistent between the somites and lateral plate mesoderm. We discuss the importance of posterior cranial mesoderm in the evolution of the vertebrate neck.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Morphology and conservation of cranial muscle</title><p>New soft-tissue-contrast staining methods for high-resolution CT afforded us the opportunity to examine the volumetric anatomy of muscles in a sample of vertebrates spanning Gnathostomata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>). In Chondrichthyes, such as the chimaera, the cucullaris is a massive muscle that may incorporate anterior gill levators; in this respect, it may not be strictly homologous, in its entirety, with the cucullaris of osteichthyans. In piscine osteichthyans, such as bichir and lungfish, the cucullaris is a thin, strap-like muscle, sometimes called the 'protractor pectoralis' (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greenwood and Lauder, 1981</xref>). It diverges from the anterior gill levators, but otherwise it is in series with them, is located in the same connective tissue sheath, and shares muscle fibers with the immediately anterior levators. It originates from the posterior region of the head and inserts on the pectoral girdle and, when present, the fifth gill arch. In some amphibians and in amniotes, the cucullaris is a large wedge-shaped muscle, sometimes termed the trapezius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owen, 1866</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edgeworth, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gegenbaur et al., 1878</xref>).

Based on novel dissections, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greenwood and Lauder (1981)</xref> reported the cucullaris absent from the coelacanth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Millot and Anthony (1958)</xref>, however, had earlier briefly described in the coelacanth a fifth gill levator that originates on the anocleithrum of the pectoral girdle, unlike the first four gill levators, which originate in the otic region. We examined this muscle in both a CT scan of a contrast-stained coelacanth pup and an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of an adult. The muscle in these specimens is larger than previously described, with several heads originating on the pectoral girdle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). It is angled differently from the other levators, but its fibers remain in close association with them and extend from the anocleithrum to insert on the fifth ceratobranchial. In the adult, an anterior portion of this muscle extends dorsally to attach on the fascia of the epaxial musculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Based on its morphology and location, we regard the fifth gill levator as the homolog of the cucullaris. Accordingly, the coelacanth cucullaris retains the ancestral connection between the posteriormost branchial bar and the pectoral girdle, which is seen in at least some sharks and lungfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edgeworth, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allis, 1917</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vetter, 1874</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greenwood and Lauder, 1981</xref>). Even though actinopterygians lack an ossified fifth gill arch, the cucullaris in these taxa sometimes joins the fibers of the posteriormost gill levator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greenwood and Lauder, 1981</xref>). Although the cucullaris in the coelacanth does not attach to the head, it retains a division that extends rostrally, terminating upon the dorsal fascia posterior to the cranium; it also retains the ancestral connection between the pectoral girdle and the cranial skeleton by its attachment to the branchial skeleton.</p><p>In the caecilian <italic>Typhlonectes natans</italic> we examined the m. levator arcus branchiales complex, previously described in <italic>Dermophis mexicanus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bemis et al., 1983</xref>). The muscle is also termed the m. cephalodorsosubpharyngeus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wilkinson and Nussbaum, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lawson, 1965</xref>). Based on our examination, the m. levator arcus branchiales complex is a triangular structure that originates from the otic capsule and dorsal trunk muscle fascia and inserts ventrally on the the posteriormost ceratobranchial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,I</xref>). A posterior division of the muscle, the pars posterosuperficialis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wilkinson and Nussbaum, 1997</xref>), inserts on the fascia separating the rectus abdominus from the interhyoideus. Based on these topographic relationships, we homologize the posterior division of the m. levator arcus branchialis complex with the cucullaris. It is unclear if a portion of the anterior division should also be considered part of the cucullaris, connecting to the adult hyobranchial skeleton.</p><p>The cucullaris and its homologs comprise a highly conserved connection between head and trunk. In general, the cucullaris is intimately associated, and sometimes partially continuous, with the gill levators. In numerous taxa, it attaches to the skull and gill skeleton, both cranial elements.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mesoderm adjacent to anterior somites forms the cucullaris and gill levators</title><p>In amphibians, the cucullaris has also been termed the protractor pectoralis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ziermann and Diogo, 2013</xref>) and the trapezius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Piatt, 1938</xref>). In juvenile axolotls, the cucullaris resembles the condition in bichir; it is morphologically similar to and in series with the anterior gill levators, whereas in adults it expands into a broad, thin sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Given the conservative morphology of branchiomeric musculature in the axolotl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ericsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ericsson and Olsson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ziermann and Diogo, 2013</xref>), we began fate-mapping head mesoderm that contributes to the pharyngeal arches. In chicken and axolotl, mesoderm from somites 1 and 2 contributes to the cucullaris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piekarski and Olsson, 2007</xref>). In chicken, however, the majority of the cucullaris is derived from lateral plate mesoderm adjacent to the occipital somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Theis et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, we suspected that the axolotl cucullaris might also have a dual origin from both somitic and unsegmented mesoderm.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09972.013</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Development of the cucullaris muscle in the axolotl.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Morphology of the developing cucullaris, with the four gill-levator muscles (lab I–IV) shaded light green and the cucullaris (cuc) blue.

Accordingly, we propose the fifth gill levator of the coelacanth to be homologous to the cucullaris, which, as in some sharks, rays and lungfish, attaches the pectoral girdle to the posteriormost gill bar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edgeworth, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greenwood and Lauder, 1981</xref>). We regard this interpretation of data from coelacanth, viz., the cucullaris has reduced its dorsal attachment to the head/epaxial muscle fascia, more parsimonious than a previous interpretation that the cucullaris is absent and that a gill levator has entirely shifted its origin from the head to the pectoral girdle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greenwood and Lauder, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Millot and Anthony, 1958</xref>). In larval <italic>Ichthyophis kohtaoensis</italic>, a caecilian, the fourth gill levator is substantially larger than the anterior three levators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kleinteich and Haas, 2007</xref>). The cucullaris could potentially develop from the caudalmost gill levator, as has been suggested in urodeles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edgeworth, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ziermann and Diogo, 2013</xref>). The cucullaris of caecilians, lacking an insertion to the absent shoulder girdle, instead has evolved a patent connection between the otic capsule (as well as the dorsal trunk fascia) and fascia associated with ventral trunk musculature. It is uncertain if the anterior portion of the levator arcus branchiales complex, which inserts on the posteriormost gillbar, is also part of the cucullaris or instead represents only gill levators that did not degenerate following metamorphosis. In the former case, this unusual configuration might express an ancestral potential of the cucullaris to attach to the gill skeleton, and it evokes reports that the paired fin/limb apparatus has surprising developmental resemblance to the gill arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gillis et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The cucullaris has evolved to perform distinct functions in different lineages. In placoderms, for example, it may have depressed the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trinajstic et al., 2013</xref>). The morphology of the cucullaris in sharks and rays suggests the muscle in gnathostomes originates ancestrally from the pectoral girdle and inserts on two parts of the cranial skeleton: the posterior gill bar and the caudal region of the head. The connection to the gill arches was likely lost in early tetrapods (but possibly later reappeared in caecilians), while an alternate attachment to the clavicle evolved in some lineages. The cucullaris is purportedly absent in turtles and snakes, but recent work suggests that it may be present in both groups. In turtles, it has been proposed that the muscle originates on the shell (carapace), which incorporates parts of the pectoral girdle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lyson et al., 2013</xref>). In snakes, the pectoral girdle is absent and the origin of the cucullaris has concomitantly shifted to the body wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsuihiji et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cucullaris development in the axolotl</title><p>The cucullaris is located in a complex transition zone between head and trunk; in the axolotl, this complexity is reflected in the muscle’s dual embryonic derivation from both somitic and cranial mesoderm. An origin from both the caudal branchial levator and somites was suggested in the spotted salamander, <italic>Ambystoma maculatum</italic>, based on serial sections and dissection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Piatt, 1938</xref>). Our finding that unsegmented mesoderm adjacent to the anterior somites forms the posterior gill-levator muscles, a laryngeal muscle, the levatores et depressores branchiarum and the cucullaris indicates that the posterior limit of cranial mesoderm is at somite 3. The presence of labeled cranial mesoderm cells in a laryngeal muscle in axolotl betrays the deep phylogenetic conservation of a relationship between the cucullaris and laryngeal muscles, which was revealed in a recent analysis demonstrating that mouse laryngeal muscles are clonally related to the trapezius and absent following mutation of the gene <italic>Tbx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lescroart et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, expression of the genes <italic>isl1</italic> and <italic>tbx1</italic> in the gill-levator region suggests these muscles develop through the cranial muscle regulatory network, consistent with their classical anatomical classification as cranial muscles.</p><p>Our analysis of cranial mesoderm markers in axolotl provides additional evidence for genetic heterogeneity in cranial muscle development in anamniotes, which has been demonstrated in mouse and chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nathan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marcucio and Noden, 1999</xref>). Surprisingly, our data reveal that differentiation of mandibular adductor muscles is present in amphibians at the level of gene expression. At stage 40, <italic>isl1</italic> is expressed in the superficial anterior adductor, while <italic>lhx2</italic> is expressed in the external adductor. In mouse, the LIM homeodomain gene <italic>Isl1</italic> is required for normal second heart field (SHF) development and its expression in SHF progenitors is downregulated following differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2003</xref>).

In the axolotl at stage 40, <italic>pitx2</italic> is expressed in hyoid arch and tongue musculature but is not in the gill musculature. Taken together, these findings underscore the regionalization of developmental programs that underlies cranial muscle formation, both among pharyngeal arches and even within the mandibular adductor complex. Moreover, the broad phylogenetic diversity of the model species involved suggests that such regionalization may be an ancestral feature of tetrapod vertebrates that is retained in living taxa and may also exist in their piscine outgroups.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Evolution of the head-trunk boundary</title><p>In the axolotl embryo, somites and pharyngeal arches are located at the same post-otic axial level, which is a basic feature of morphologically conservative vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuratani, 1997</xref>).

Moreover, lengthening of the amniote neck is associated with the caudal shift of the heart into the thorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirasawa et al., 2016</xref>). The head-trunk interface at the paraxial level is marked by the path of circumpharyngeal neural crest cells as they migrate ventral to the occipital somites to form the circumpharyngeal ridge caudal to the pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuratani, 1997</xref>). Specialized muscles occur at this paraxial level, including the trapezius/cucullaris and, in axolotls, the gill levators.</p><p>Our finding that the posterior gill-levator muscles and the cucullaris originate from cranial mesoderm adjacent to the first three somites supports categorization of the cucullaris as a branchiomeric muscle. Moreover, it may help explain why lateral plate mesoderm in the embryonic ‘trunk’ in chicken has myogenic capacity. Our fate-mapping data suggest that this mesoderm, which gives rise to the cucullaris in amniotes, is not a novel source of musculature, but instead is cranial mesoderm associated with the most posterior pharyngeal arch (5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup>, depending on species). We propose that, in the axolotl, somite 3 is the posterior limit of mesodermal contribution to cranial structures in both paraxial and lateral mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In our heterotopic transplantations, cranial mesoderm that forms the cucullaris is able to follow the myogenic program of cranial muscles in the mandibular and hyoid arches.

It provides a review of classical ideas as well as recent developmental and molecular studies that impact this subject, most specifically the contrast in genetic regulation of cranial versus trunk muscles. The classical literature holds some controversy about the branchiomeric origin of the cucullaris muscle and its phylogenetic distribution. That muscle and its homologues are the major focus of this study. CT scans of numerous taxa are included to argue that the cucullaris is a universal feature of gnathostomes. The authors present orthotopic transplant experiments in axolotl to build a fate map confirming that the posterior gill levators and the cucullaris in this amphibian are derived from lateral plate mesoderm adjacent to somites 1-3. They also preform heterotopic transplants of LPM from different axial levels to test for myogenic properties in response to cranial versus trunk signaling environments. They demonstrate the ability of anterior LPM cells to respond to cranial signals and differentiate as muscle where as in contrast, LPM posterior to somite 3 does not respond in the same site, and fails to differentiate as muscle. The authors conclude that the true head/trunk boundary occurs in both somites and LPM behind somite 3 in axolotl.</p><p>The timing of this manuscript is good.

That data should be worked over to make a more fluid seam between the anatomy and embryology. The sentence “Based on these data, it is unknown whether the lateral plate origin of the cucullaris is the result of a posterior shift of the head myogenic program or instead represents head mesoderm that spread caudally into the region adjacent to the anterior somites”, asks a specific question, but this gets lost in subsequent discussion and CT scans- development and anatomy are not well integrated, giving the impression that there are two papers cobbled together.

Several other studies have requested this kind of data from an anamniote species to properly discuss the evolution of neck development. This is an important confirmation for an important idea. However, a number of points need to be addressed by the authors. 1) The manuscript is uneven, and the CT data seems crammed in. That data should be worked over to make a more fluid seam between the anatomy and embryology. The sentence “Based on these data, it is unknown whether the lateral plate origin of the cucullaris is the result of a posterior shift of the head myogenic program or instead represents head mesoderm that spread caudally into the region adjacent to the anterior somites”, asks a specific question, but this gets lost in subsequent discussion and CT scans- development and anatomy are not well integrated, giving the impression that there are two papers cobbled together. This requires revision.</italic> </p><p>We’ve modified the Introduction to clarify the relationship between our anatomical and developmental descriptions, viz., each represents a source of data that can be used to evaluate the branchiomeric identity of the cucullaris. We have enlarged individual panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to make them appear less crowded and to allow features on individual panels to be discerned more easily. In addition, CT data from the axolotl has been incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to create a more effective transition between CT and fate-mapping data. We added an optical projection tomography scan of a juvenile (stage 53) axolotl to the same figure to more readily contrast the morphology of the cucullaris between juveniles and adults. The question in the Introduction has been moved to a new paragraph to emphasize its importance, and it is now addressed more explicitly in the Results (beginning of the section, “Mesoderm adjacent to anterior somites forms the cucullaris and gill levators”).</p><p><italic>2) What are the criteria for identifying these muscles in the CT scans? These data are surprisingly underwhelming. If the technique is used in order to avoid destruction of rare specimens during dissection, maybe they would seem worthwhile. What is described in the text for the coelacanth is not clearly visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</italic> We added several sentences to the Introduction that explain the utility of CT/MRI scans for examining the cucullaris, e.g., they accurately depict the muscle’s three-dimensional morphology without damaging rare specimens (especially the adult and pup coelacanth). The criteria we use for muscle identification include the specific attachment points (origin and insertion) as well as overall morphology (e.g., shape) and fiber orientation. In the case of the coelacanth, we consider it more parsimonious to conclude that the cucullaris has reduced its dorsal attachment to the head (while maintaining the ancestral connection between the posteriormost branchial bar and pectoral girdle) than it is to propose that a gill levator has gained an entirely new origin from the pectoral girdle. We have made these points more explicit in the Results and Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) Neural crest origin of connective tissue in the spinotrapezius has not been confirmed. Other studies show a lateral plate lineage for this CT (Durland</italic> et al.</p><p><italic>2008)</italic> </p><p>We have added a sentence that notes the existence of conflicting claims regarding the source of connective-tissue components of the trapezius in mouse.</p><p> <italic>4) Schematics should be added to show surgeries in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> &amp; 3.</italic> </p><p>Schematics have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and 3. We also divided <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> into three separate panels so that each could fit on a single page (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). As such, there are now 6 primary figures total instead of 5.</p><p> <italic>5) The fate of somites 1, 2 &amp; 3 in axolotl needs to be mentioned early so the axial level coincidence of somites and LPM makes sense. For instance, the last two lines of the Abstract could appear to contradict each other without the fact that somites 1-2 are occipital.</italic> </p><p>We added three sentences to the second paragraph of the Introduction to more effectively introduce this topic. We also changed the second-to-last sentence of the Abstract to “Accordingly, LPM adjacent to the occipital somites should be regarded as posterior cranial mesoderm.”</p><p><italic>6) The last sentence of the subsection “Phylogenetic distribution of the cucullaris“, presumably refers to homology of nuchal bone of carapace with the cleithrum, this is controversial and should be qualified.</italic></p><p>We qualified this statement as follows: “In turtles, it has been proposed that the muscle originates on the shell (carapace), which incorporates parts of the pectoral girdle (Lyson et al. 2013).”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been greatly improved but there is one remaining issue, that was not emphasised in the previous reviews, that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: There is one part that now stands out which we did not draw your attention to earlier. The section on &quot;Molecular regionalization of mandibular and hyoid arch muscles&quot; presents very nice data but there is no reference to this section in the Introduction or the Discussion. We would ask you to better integrate it into the rest of the manuscript.</italic></p><p>We have addressed the above request by revising the Introduction and the Discussion in the following ways:</p><p>In the first paragraph of the Introduction, we added a sentence that indicates the importance of differential genetic control in cranial muscles based on previous research in mouse.</p><p>Later in the Introduction (last paragraph), we broadly summarize our results from this subsection.</p><p>In the Discussion (subsection “Cucullaris development in the axolotl“, last paragraph), we modified an existing paragraph to highlight and more clearly synthesize these results.</p><p>We also made a few minor edits to clarify points and correct awkward syntax (Introduction, Discussion). We updated a reference that was previously ‘In press’ (Hirasawa, Fujimoto and Kuratani, 2016).</p></body></sub-article></article>
