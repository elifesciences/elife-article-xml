needed due to lack of durable responses, therapy resistance, and side effects. Most inhibitory receptors signal via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and previous studies estimated that our genome contains over 1600 ITIM-bearing transmembrane proteins. However, testing and development of these candidates requires increased understanding of their expression patterns and likelihood to function as inhibitory receptor. Therefore, we designed a novel bioinformatics pipeline integrating machine learning-guided structural predictions and sequence-based likelihood models to identify putative inhibitory receptors. Using transcriptomics data of immune cells, we determined the expression of these novel inhibitory receptors, and classified them into previously proposed functional categories. Known and putative inhibitory receptors were expressed across different immune cell subsets with cell type-specific expression patterns. Furthermore, putative immune inhibitory receptors were differentially expressed in subsets of tumour infiltrating T cells. In conclusion, we present an inhibitory receptor pipeline that identifies 51 known and 390 novel human inhibitory receptors. This pipeline will support future drug target selection across diseases where therapeutic targeting of immune inhibitory receptors is warranted.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>pipeline</kwd><kwd>cancer immunology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021821</institution-id><institution>Oncode Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Akashdip</given-names></name><name><surname>von Richthofen</surname><given-names>Helen J</given-names></name><name><surname>Vijver</surname><given-names>Saskia V</given-names></name><name><surname>van der Vlist</surname><given-names>Michiel</given-names></name><name><surname>Pascoal Ramos</surname><given-names>M Ines</given-names></name><name><surname>Meyaard</surname><given-names>Linde</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>KWF Kankerbestrijding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-14339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyaard</surname><given-names>Linde</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A bioinformatics pipeline describes 390 putative, novel inhibitory receptors, to facilitate targeted therapeutic strategies for diverse immune cell types in cancer therapy.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the past decade, checkpoint blockade therapy has revolutionised the treatment of cancer by releasing immune cells from inhibition in the tumour microenvironment. Approval of blocking antibodies targeting immune inhibitory receptors, i.e., cytotoxic T cell lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) (ipilimumab), the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 axis (nivolumab, atezolizumab), and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chocarro et al., 2022</xref>), resulted in significantly increased responses in previously hard-to-treat cancers, such as metastatic melanoma or non-small-cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2019</xref>). Despite these successes, most cancer patients do not respond to checkpoint therapy, or do not have a durable treatment response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the central role for CTLA-4 and PD-1 in maintaining peripheral tolerance results in immune-related adverse events for many patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wolchok et al., 2013</xref>). Further understanding of tissue- or activation-specific expression of different inhibitory receptors can assist in limiting toxicities, in particular when receptors are also expressed on non-immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">von Richthofen and Meyaard, 2023</xref>). Additional benefit can be gained by targeting inhibitory receptors with more specialised functions or expression patterns, such as T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing receptor 3 (TIM-3) or T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domains (TIGIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schnell et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We previously proposed that inhibitory receptors can be classified into distinct functional categories based on the regulation of their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rumpret et al., 2020</xref>). Using mathematical modelling, we defined four categories: (1) Negative feedback receptor expression is induced by cellular activation to ensure a timely resolution of the response and limit excessive responses. (2) Threshold receptors are expressed on immune cells in the resting state and control the threshold for immune cell activation to provide context and prevent unnecessary or futile responses. (3) Threshold-disinhibition receptors are threshold receptors of which the expression is downregulated after activation. This allows for a more potent response after initial activation. (4) Threshold-negative feedback receptors are threshold receptors of which expression is further induced upon cellular activation.</p><p>It is reasonable to assume that therapeutic interference with inhibitory receptors of different functional categories would have different outcomes. In cancer, blocking threshold receptors will lower the activation threshold of immune cells with antitumour activities. Meanwhile, interference with negative feedback receptors will prolong the antitumour and cytolytic activities of immune cells.</p><p>The vast majority of currently characterised inhibitory receptors recruit phosphatases, such as SH2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP-1), SHP-2, or SHIP-1 to their intracellular immunoreceptor via tyrosine-based inhibitory and/or switch motifs (ITIM/ITSMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Long, 1999</xref>). This allows these receptors to dephosphorylate and inactivate other signalling molecules, such as those recruited to the T cell receptor complex, although some receptors are also capable of relaying activating signals through an ITSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dietrich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ostrakhovitch and Li, 2006</xref>). ITIM sequences consist of the consensus amino acid sequence (V|L|I|S)xYxx(I|L|V), where x can be any amino acid, in the intracellular domain of a protein. This domain can be extended to (V|L|I|S|T)xYxx(I|L|V) to also include ITSM sequences, as there are inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, that rely partly on the ITSM for their inhibitory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chemnitz et al., 2004</xref>). So far, around 50 ITIM/ITSM containing inhibitory receptors have been described, although it has previously been estimated that over 1600 ITIM-containing molecules can be found in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daëron et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>More specific selection of potential drug targets out of this large collection of predicted receptors is required for further development and subsequent targeting in disease. Here, we set out to predict potential targets by developing a computational framework to identify putative inhibitory receptors and integrate three-dimensional structure predictions of proteins to those with a high likelihood of encoding functional inhibitory receptors. Furthermore, as inhibitory receptor expression follows specific dynamics and can play different roles in orchestrating immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rumpret et al., 2020</xref>), we analysed changes in the expression of putative inhibitory receptors in different immune cells and activation states. Our analysis will aid in the selection of inhibitory receptors as therapeutic targets for specific diseases, to minimise toxicity and maximise efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Putative ITIM/ITSM-bearing immune inhibitory receptors can be found in the human genome</title><p>To identify putative novel inhibitory receptors, we first retrieved the protein sequences of all 96,457 protein-coding transcripts, corresponding to 19,353 individual human genes, annotated in the Ensembl database (release 105, December 2021) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunningham et al., 2022</xref>). We retrieved all deposited isoforms, as certain proteins might only contain an ITIM in a specific isoform. We then screened the entire protein sequence for the presence of an ITIM or ITSM, based on the consensus sequence (V|L|I|S|T)xYxx(I|L|V), resulting in 40,063 protein sequences from the initial 96,457. We next used the TOPCONS server, which is based on a consensus of several prediction tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsirigos et al., 2015</xref>), to determine the membrane topology of all proteins with an ITIM/ITSM motif. TOPCONS predicted 12,576 out of the 40,056 input proteins to be integral membrane proteins, of which 7445 contained multiple transmembrane domains and the remaining 5131 are single-pass membrane proteins.</p><p>We next filtered proteins for the presence of the ITIM or ITSM sequence in an intracellular domain of the protein based on the predicted topology. This yielded with 4613 protein sequences bearing one or more intracellular ITIMs or ITSMs, which correspond to 1562 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To assess how well our pipeline reflects previously documented inhibitory receptors, we confirmed that all the 52 proteins known for their ITIM-mediated immune inhibitory effects, such as PD-1 or leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR-1) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rumpret et al., 2020</xref>), were recalled successfully, with the exception of <italic>MPIG6B,</italic> encoding for the inhibitory receptor G6B on platelets and megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vet et al., 2001</xref>), due to an incorrect prediction of its transmembrane domain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A novel bioinformatics approach for the identification of predicted inhibitory receptors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the bioinformatics pipeline with the number of unique genes and corresponding proteins remaining at every step.

As a result of this, large proteins or proteins containing many tyrosines and hydrophobic residues are more likely to contain an ITIM/ITSM by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We therefore determined the likelihood of encountering an ITIM/ITSM by chance in the intracellular region of the putative targets. To this end, we randomly permutated the amino acid sequences of the intracellular domains by shuffling their order using the Fisher-Yates algorithm. We did this 10,000 times for each receptor and assessed how often the permutated sequence contained more or an equal amount of ITIM/ITSMs compared to the original sequence. For 41 out of 51 known receptors, these odds were low (&lt;5%). However, for 10 out of 51, we observed ITIM/ITSM sequences in the permutated sequence between 5% and ~25% of the time. Based on these findings, we decided to exclude novel targets when they were above this threshold of 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Due to the nature of permutation testing, there is some variation in the individual likelihood values for each protein sequence. However, as they were generally below 0.25 in any given iteration, we decided to define this value as a threshold for inclusion. After this statistical filtering, we were left with 837 inhibitory receptor genes. As expected, the average length of the intracellular domains of the excluded proteins was much higher than that of the remaining targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>AlphaFold structure predictions can assist in identifying likely functional ITIM/ITSMs</title><p>Protein interaction motifs are most commonly found in intrinsically disordered regions within proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tompa et al., 2014</xref>), as structured regions are less accessible to binding with interacting partners. We therefore hypothesised that ITIM/ITSM sequences locate in disordered regions to allow for interaction with phosphatases and kinases. We therefore leveraged AlphaFold to infer three-dimensional structure predictions of the remaining inhibitory receptor candidates to determine where the ITIM/ITSM sequences were located in three-dimensional space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>For 832 of the 837 remaining inhibitory receptor genes, we were able to retrieve the predicted structures using AlphaFold. For every residue in the three-dimensional model, AlphaFold defines a confidence score (pLDDT) between 0 and 100 pLDDT. Low scores indicate reduced confidence, and regions with a low score are more likely to be intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2021</xref>). We determined the average pLDDT of all six residues encompassing the ITIM/ITSM sequence, what resulted in an overall confidence score for each intracellular ITIM/ITSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) in all targets.</p><p>We found that 99 out of 101 ITIM/ITSMs of the 51 known receptors had low confidence scores, i.e., less than 80 pLDDT, with an average confidence score of 49.3 pLDDT. 64 of the ITIMs even had pLDDT values below 50, which means they are particularly likely to be intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

In 2004, Staub et al. performed a search limited to type I membrane receptors containing an annotated extracellular domain and a restricted ITIM sequence. They identified a total of 94 genes encoding inhibitory receptors, of which 32 had been previously described to rely on their ITIM to inhibit immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Staub et al., 2004</xref>). A later study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daëron et al., 2008</xref><italic>,</italic> performed a more extensive analysis of ITIM-bearing receptors across multiple species, including chickens and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daëron et al., 2008</xref>). In humans, they identified 613 predicted type I and type II single-spanners and 992 multi-spanning transmembrane proteins, corresponding to around 1500 genes. This number agrees with what we retrieved in the initial steps of our bioinformatics pipeline, where we identified 1562 genes. Our efforts to reduce this number to candidates with a high probability of functioning as inhibitory receptors resulted in 390 novel targets. Compared to the previous studies, our method has key advantages. Firstly, the TOPCONS algorithm we used is superior to TMHMM and Philius, which have been used previously, at predicting membrane topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsirigos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Möller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reynolds et al., 2008</xref>). Most importantly, we excluded many potential false positives by filtering out proteins that are likely to contain an ITIM by chance and used three-dimensional structure predictions to enrich the remaining targets for those containing ITIMs in unstructured regions. Furthermore, our expression analysis and functional categorisation of the putative inhibitory receptors can assist in gaining a better understanding of their relevance in different contexts.</p><p>An important component of our pipeline is the use of AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). Our approach was exceptionally good at filtering out many proteins in the olfactory receptor family, for which almost all ITIMs identified were found in highly structured regions. We determined a threshold of 80 pLDDT based on the calculated prediction scores of the ITIM/ITSMs in known inhibitory receptors, as this encompassed 99 out of 101 ITIM/ITSMs. However, this excluded ITIMs in <italic>CD5</italic> (Y402) and <italic>BTLA</italic> (Y282), with confidence scores of 85.2 and 81.5, respectively. Of note, studies have suggested that this particular ITIM in <italic>CD5</italic> might not be functional or essential for CD5 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Voisinne et al., 2018</xref>). It is important to highlight that the AlphaFold structure predictions are based on the proteins being in isolation. It is possible that ITIMs become available after conformational changes following ligand binding, or that ITIMs in disordered regions are not functional when the proteins are found in complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jakob et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiefhaber et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We acknowledge that our approach has limitations. We used known ITIM-bearing inhibitory receptors as validation for the various steps of the pipeline and retrieved all but one receptor, resulting in a retrieval of 98%. We did not retrieve <italic>MPIG6B</italic>, as we were not able to properly predict the transmembrane helix in the ITIM-containing isoforms of <italic>MPIG6B</italic>. With increasing computing power and further development of artificial intelligence, these prediction algorithms are likely to further improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rives et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsirigos et al., 2018</xref>). The identification of novel ITIM/ITSM-bearing inhibitory receptors also relies on our current knowledge of known inhibitory receptors and their motifs. This influences the thresholds in our analyses, and might be skewed by larger protein families, e.g., KIR- and LILRB-family receptors. Additional filtering of the candidates could be achieved by assessing subcellular localisation, as it is possible that the transmembrane proteins we identified are not localised on the outer membrane, but instead on intracellular membranes. Although they could still function as inhibitory receptors, this would complicate the ability to effectively target them with therapeutic antibodies, and might instead require other blocking agents, such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACS) or small molecule inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Békés et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We focused our search on receptors bearing ITIM or ITSM sequences, while inhibitory receptors have been described that function independent of these short sequences. We previously reported that CD200R has a unique signalling motif that is not shared with any other protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Timmerman et al., 2021</xref>). Also, TIM-3 contains multiple tyrosine residues that are not part of any known signalling motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wolf et al., 2020</xref>). A small number (26 genes) of putative inhibitory receptors contained an ITIM embedded in an ITAM sequence, i.e., Yxx(I|L)x<sub>6-12</sub>Yxx(I|L). Although some ITAM-bearing molecules are capable of mediating inhibitory signals in an ITIM-independent manner, these receptors may not all be inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrow and Trowsdale, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Until now, no known functional multimembrane spanning immune inhibitory receptors have been reported, although some ITIM-bearing multi-spanners, e.g., <italic>SSTR2</italic> and <italic>HCRTR1</italic>, were shown to recruit SHP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferjoux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Voisin et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that multi-spanning inhibitory receptors have not yet been fully characterised due to their size and limited targetability, making them difficult to study. Of interest, in our analysis multi-spanning receptors were often expressed by multiple immune cell subsets. This may suggest that multi-spanning inhibitory receptors would be capable of inhibiting a broad array of immune responses.</p><p>We previously argued how different functional categories of inhibitory receptors might serve distinct purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rumpret et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we grouped known and putative inhibitory receptors in different functional categories based on their expression in isolated immune cell subsets in resting and stimulated state and show that a large number of them is expressed and regulated in a cell type-specific manner. However, as we categorised these receptors based on in vitro activation with limited stimuli, expression must be further validated in in vivo settings. Nonetheless, we tried to characterise the functional categories expressed by tumour infiltrating lymphocytes by extrapolating the in vitro defined functional categorisation per gene. This showed that mainly threshold receptors and some (threshold-)negative feedback receptors are expressed by the different T cell subsets. This would open the possibility of targeting different functional categories for cancer immunotherapy, since targeting a threshold receptor to lower the threshold for activation and a negative feedback receptor to lengthen and strengthen the cellular response might therefore be more effective than targeting two receptors of a single functional category. However, we acknowledge that this will require further validation of expression patterns in vivo in different cancers and immune cell subsets.</p><p>We found that the highest number of target genes are expressed in neutrophils, which fits the need to control and precisely regulate their potentially damaging effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geerdink et al., 2018</xref>). However, inhibitory receptor gene expression on these cells did not change much after activation. This does not exclude regulation of receptor expression at the protein level, which would fit with the more short-lived nature of these cells. For instance, LAIR-1 protein is stored in intracellular granules which results in rapid membrane expression on activated granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geerdink et al., 2018</xref>). On monocytes, we found many negative feedback receptors. Considering that monocytes (especially macrophages) play a central role in orchestrating the overall immune response, timely resolution of their activation is key to successful resolution of inflammation, which could be achieved by these receptors.</p><p>For the functional categorisation of novel inhibitory receptor genes, we collected multiple publicly available datasets containing different isolated immune cell subsets in the resting state and after cell type-specific activation. For 115 genes, we predicted a non-canonical isoform, but not the canonical sequence, as a putative inhibitory receptor. This means that our expression analyses for these inhibitory receptor genes might not be fully reflective of the expression of individual isoforms of those genes, considering that isoform usage can vary widely between different cells and activation states, as has been well described for CEACAM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaur et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helfrich and Singer, 2019</xref>). In the present study, we also did not consider the ligand expression of these known and putative receptors. Regulation of inhibitory receptors does not only occur at the level of the receptor itself, but the presence or absence of ligands, decoy receptors, and other interactions all add additional layers of regulation of control to the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rumpret et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To further prioritise inhibitory receptors in immune cell subsets or diseases of interest, gene co-expression networks of putative inhibitory receptors could be assessed. On the one hand, the co-occurrence of putative inhibitory receptors with known inhibitory receptors within a module could be one approach, while on the other hand the presence of putative inhibitory receptors in a different module could suggest novel regulation of different biological functions than the known receptors. The location of the putative inhibitory receptors in the network could also change depending on the cell type and the activation status of the cell. Additionally, one could look at the co-expression of candidates with other genes within a gene module to look at potential biological function, and at co-expression with signalling molecules known to interact with inhibitory receptors, such as Csk, SHP-1, SHP-2, and SHIP1, although their regulation might be more post-translationally regulated rather than at the transcriptional level.</p><p>As proof-of-concept, we assessed expression of both known and novel targets in various tumour infiltrating T cell subsets. This helps understanding how these potential drug targets are differentially expressed in a disease context. As many receptors we identified were shared across immune cell subsets, it would be particularly interesting to block those that are enriched in, e.g., effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. While some T cell subsets, such as exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells, appear to not differ much in their expression of either single- or multi-spanning receptors, we do observe that, for example, effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells or EMRA CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express single-spanning inhibitory receptors to a higher extent than multi-spanning inhibitory receptors. It is possible that these differences and similarities reflect some of the roles multi-spanning inhibitory receptors could play in regulating immune cells, e.g. in response to chemokines, as many chemokine receptors are multi-spanning proteins. In contrast, receptors expressed in subsets that can have pro-tumourigenic properties, such as CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> or Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tay et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karpisheh et al., 2022</xref>), should not be activated; these targets could instead benefit from agonist therapy. Furthermore, these putative receptors might also be attractive in autoimmune diseases, where immune checkpoints are increasingly being explored as potential targets for therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grebinoski and Vignali, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhai et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we have designed a bioinformatic pipeline to identify a key list of 390 predicted inhibitory receptors to be used as a starting point for further research into novel targets for targeting in diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Identification of putative inhibitory receptors in the human genome</title><p>To identify putative inhibitory receptors in the human genome, amino acid sequences for 96,457 protein coding, as annotated by Ensembl, transcripts were retrieved from Ensembl (release 105, December 2021) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunningham et al., 2022</xref>) using the <italic>biomaRt</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durinck et al., 2009</xref>) in R.

Experimental follow-up to demonstrate the claimed properties for the proteins identified, or mining existing experimental data sources on gene expression across tissues to at least show that the pipeline correctly identified genes likely to be specific to immune cells (or something along these lines), would make this work more complete and compelling.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors for their critical reading and assessment of our manuscript. We acknowledge that the present study is limited by a lack of experimental follow-up.

When expressed in immune cells (such as neutrophils, monocytes, CD8+, CD4+, and T-cells), such receptors inhibit the functional activity of these cells. Blocking inhibitory receptors represents a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.</p><p>As such, this is a high-quality and important bioinformatics study. One general concern is the absence of direct experimental validation of the results. In addition to the fact that the authors bioinformatically identified 51 known receptors, providing such experimental evaluation (of at least one, or better few identified receptors) would, in my opinion, significantly strengthen the presented evidence.</p><p>I will now briefly summarize the results and give my comments.</p><p>First, using sequence comparison analysis, the authors identify a large set of putative receptors based on the presence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), or immunoreceptor tyrosinebased switch motifs (ITSMs). They further filter the identified set of receptors for the presence of the ITIMs or ITSMs in an intracellular domain of the protein. Second, using AlphaFold structure modeling, the authors select only receptors containing ITIMs/ITSMs in structurally disordered regions. Third, the evaluation of gene expression profiles of known and putative receptors in several immune cell types was performed. Fourth, the authors classified putative receptors into functional categories, such as negative feedback receptors, threshold receptors, threshold disinhibition, and threshold-negative feedback. The latter classification was based on the available data from Nat Rev Immunol 2020. Fifth, using publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ cells from nearly twenty types of cancer, the authors demonstrate that a significant fraction of putative receptors are indeed expressed in these datasets.</p><p>In summary, in my opinion, this is an interesting, important, high-quality bioinformatics work. The manuscript is clearly written and all technical details are carefully explained.</p><p>One comment/suggestion regarding the methodology of evaluating gene expression profiles of putative receptors: perhaps it might be important to look at clusters of genes that are co-expressed with putative inhibitory receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and suggestions. We acknowledge that looking at co-expressed genes and subsequently at gene ontology enrichment could be an interesting approach to prioritize the inhibitory receptors. However, since there are many ways to approach the results of the gene coexpression networks, which also depend on the cell type and activation status of interest, we have chosen to discuss the implications of these networks in the discussion with the following paragraph, rather than reporting all these different approaches in the paper:</p><p>“To further prioritize inhibitory receptors in immune cell subsets or diseases of interest, gene coexpression networks of putative inhibitory receptors could be assessed. On the one hand, the cooccurrence of putative inhibitory receptors with known inhibitory receptors within a module could be one approach, while on the other hand the presence of putative inhibitory receptors in a different module could suggest novel regulation of different biological functions than the known receptors. The location of the putative inhibitory receptors in the network could also change depending on the cell type and the activation status of the cell. Additionally, one could look at the co-expression of candidates with other genes within a gene module to look at potential biological function, and at co-expression with signalling molecules known to interact with inhibitory receptors, such as Csk, SHP-1, SHP-2 and SHIP1, although their regulation might be more post-translationally regulated rather than at mRNA level.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors developed a bioinformatic pipeline to aid the screening and identification of inhibitory receptors suitable as drug targets.

For example, the result that both known and putative immune inhibitory receptors are expressed across a wide variety of tumor-infiltrating T-cell subsets is reassuring, but this would have been more informative and illustrative if the authors could demonstrate using a disease with known targets, as opposed to a pan-cancer context. Additionally, a discussion that contrasts the known and putative receptors in the context above would help readers better identify use cases suitable for their research using this pipeline. Particularly,</p><p>• For known receptors, does the pipeline and the expression analysis above rediscover the known target in the disease of interest?</p><p>• For putative receptors, what do the functional category mapping and the differential expression across various tumor-infiltrating T-cell subsets imply on a potential therapeutic target?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their assessment and comments. The primary purpose of the bioinformatics pipeline was to identify putative inhibitory receptors in a disease-agnostic manner and allow the scientific community to further explore targets in their specific diseases of interest. We performed our pan-cancer expression analysis as a preliminary proof of concept and agree that exploring targets in specific diseases, cancer or otherwise, could be more informative. To validate that we rediscovered known immunotherapeutic targets, we analyzed the expression of known inhibitory receptors on tumorinfiltrating T cells of melanoma patients using the same dataset as figure 3. We find high expression of known therapeutic targets, such as PD-1, in addition to other known inhibitory receptors that are being targeted in clinical trials, one of which being TIGIT. We have added this information to the results section and added the corresponding graph as supplementary figure 5.</p><p>For the putative inhibitory receptors, we believe the functional categorization can assist in selecting targets that are more likely to be successful in a therapeutic context. As we previously proposed in our perspective on functional categorization of inhibitory receptors (Rumpret et al., Nat Imm, 2020), it might be beneficial to target inhibitory receptors of different functional categories in cancer immunotherapy. Targeting a threshold receptor to lower the threshold for activation and a negative feedback receptor to lengthen and strengthen the cellular response might therefore be more effective than targeting two receptors of a single functional category. Even though we realize RNA sequencing data of in vitro stimulated immune cells is not identical to data from TILs, we have tried to characterize the functional categories expressed by TILs by extrapolating the defined functional categorization per gene from figure 2, and added the corresponding graphs as supplementary figure 4. This shows that mainly threshold receptors and some (threshold-)negative feedback receptors are expressed by the different T cell subsets, which would open the possibility of using the proposed therapeutic strategy of targeting different functional categories. However, we acknowledge that this will require further validation of expression patterns in vivo in different cancers and immune cell subsets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>One comment/suggestion regarding the methodology of evaluating gene expression profiles of putative receptors: perhaps it might be important to look at clusters of genes that are co-expressed with putative inhibitory receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>See our reply to the suggestion above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Results section</p><p>(a) &quot;Putative ITIM/ITSM-bearing immune inhibitory receptors can be found in the human genome&quot;</p><p>i.

We have adjusted the figure legend to better indicate the information provided in the figures. The predicted genes are all unknown transmembrane candidates that contain an ITIM or ITSM in their intracellular domain, as determined using TOPCONS.</p><p>ii. Due to the nature of permutation testing, there is some variation in the individual likelihood values for each protein sequence. However, as they were generally below 0.25 in any given iteration, we decided to define this value as a threshold for inclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) &quot;AlphaFold structure predictions can assist in identifying likely functional ITIM/ITSMs&quot;</p><p>i. Readability would increase if the author indicate how pLDDT score is computed and in what range is it (between 0 and 100.)</p><p>ii. Third paragraph. Can the author comment on why 80 pLDDT is chosen as the cutoff? The first sentence of this paragraph states &quot;We found that 99 out of 101 ITIM/ITSMs of the 51 known receptors had low confidence score, i.e., less than 80 pLDDT, with an average confidence score of 49.3 pLDDT...&quot; However, it was later stated in the Discussion, page 10, starting Line 11 &quot;We determined a threshold of 80 pLDDT based on the average prediction scores of the ITIM/ITSMs in known inhibitory receptors....&quot;. If 99 out of 101 ITIM/ITSMs had pLDDT&lt;80, then it seems strange that the average of the 101 is at 80pLDDT, even in the extreme where the remaining 101-99=2 ITIM/ITSMs attain the maximum pLDDT score at 100, unless the distribution of those 99 is narrowly centered around 80? A distribution of the pLDDT would help clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>i. The pLDDT scores are computed by AlphaFold as a way to determine how well a specific residue and/or region is expected to be modelled in three-dimensional space. We now refer to the corresponding AlphaFold publications and references therein to clarify this (10.1093/nar/gkab1061, 10.1038/s41586021-03819-2, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt473). We also have now included the range (i.e., 0-100) in the text.</p><p>ii. The threshold of 80 pLDDT was chosen as this still encompasses all known inhibitory receptors and was not calculated based on an average of the prediction scores. In this way, we still included ITIM/ITSMs with a relatively high pLDDT, such as those observed in PD-1 and LAIR-1. The previous text ‘average prediction scores of the ITIM/ITSMs in known inhibitory receptors’ referred to the averaging of the confidence score for each of the six amino acids encompassing the ITIM/ITSM into one overall score per ITIM/ITSM. We have adjusted the text to better reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) &quot;Putative inhibitory receptors are expressed across immune cell subsets&quot;</p><p>Figure S2, the last sentence in the caption (relevant for panel C) states &quot;Cell subsets without uniquely expressed putative inhibitory receptors i.e., B cells and T cell, are excluded from the panel for clarity&quot;, but B cells and T cells are present in panel C?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, but they are only included for the cases where the cell subsets share receptor expression with other immune cell subsets.

Figure 3 and S3 do not contain a panel C, but panel B consists of a lower (CD8+) and an upper (CD4+) subpanel, we have more clearly indicated this in the figure legend in the revised manuscript.</p><p>ii. While some T cell subsets, such as exhausted CD8+ T cells and CD4+ regulatory T cells, appear to not differ much in their expression of either single- or multi-spanning receptors, we do observe that, for example, effector memory CD4+ T cells or EMRA CD8+ T cells express single-spanning inhibitory receptors to a higher extent than multi-spanning inhibitory receptors. It is possible that these differences and similarities reflect some of the roles multi-spanning inhibitory receptors could play in regulating immune cells, for example in response to chemokines, as many chemokine receptors are multi-spanning proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data and Code availability</p><p>Although the Methods section provides some context for the computational analysis and citations for relevant data, software availability and a data availability statement are lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a data availability statement to the data files and code in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
