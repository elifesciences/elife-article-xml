Therefore, gene expression is strictly regulated at all stages from transcription to translation. Regulation of meiotic gene expression is especially crucial to differentiate between the somatic and germ cells. It has been demonstrated that ectopic expression of germline genes causes various cellular defects, including genome instability and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Folco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greve et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Janic et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Hundreds of genes are upregulated when the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> cells enter meiosis from the mitotic cell cycle in response to nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mata et al., 2002</xref>). During the mitotic cell cycle, meiotic genes are strictly suppressed by post-transcriptional mechanisms, in addition to transcriptional regulation, since mistimed expression of meiotic genes severely impairs cell growth. A large number of meiosis-specific transcripts carry a specific region called DSR (determinant of selective removal) and are recognized by a YTH family RNA-binding protein, Mmi1, in mitotically growing <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells. Mmi1 then induces nuclear exosome-mediated RNA elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harigaya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>). DSR activity is exhibited by enriched repeats of the hexanucleotide UNAAAC motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hiriart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamashita et al., 2012</xref>). The Mmi1 YTH domain preferentially binds to the unmethylated UNAAAC motif, contrasting with the YTH domains in other organisms including mammals, which selectively bind to N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine-containing RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). The DSR region has been found in a group of meiotic transcripts including <italic>mei4,</italic> which encodes a key meiotic transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horie et al., 1998</xref>), and <italic>ssm4,</italic> which encodes a subunit of the dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Niccoli et al., 2004</xref>). Red1, a zinc-finger protein, is another crucial factor involved in the Mmi1-driven RNA elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugiyama and Sugioka-Sugiyama, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamashita et al., 2013</xref>). Red1 constitutes a complex termed MTREC (Mtl1-Red1 core) or NURS (nuclear RNA silencing) with the Mtr4-like RNA helicase, Mtl1, and transfers the Mmi1-bound meiotic transcripts to the nuclear exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Egan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). In human cells, a similar protein complex, PAXT, composed of a Red1-related zinc-finger protein (ZFC3H1) and an Mtr4 ortholog (hMTR4), has been reported to induce nuclear exosome-dependent RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meola et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, ZFC3H1 and hMtr4 have also been shown to prevent nuclear export of non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogami et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Mmi1 forms several dot structures in the nucleus of the mitotically growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harigaya et al., 2006</xref>). Many factors cooperating with Mmi1, including Red1 and exosome subunits, localize to the Mmi1 foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugiyama and Sugioka-Sugiyama, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamashita et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that the foci are the site of degradation of the DSR-containing meiotic transcripts; however, the precise location of the Mmi1 foci in the nucleus remains elusive.</p><p>When <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells initiate meiosis, Mmi1-mediated RNA degradation must be suppressed so that DSR-containing meiotic transcripts are expressed. Downregulation of Mmi1 during meiosis is achieved by sequestration of Mmi1 to a meiosis-specific chromosome-associated dot, Mei2 dot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harigaya et al., 2006</xref>). Mei2 dot is composed of an RNA-binding protein, Mei2, and its binding partner, meiRNA, and is located at the <italic>sme2</italic> locus, which encodes meiRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shimada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watanabe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamashita et al., 1998</xref>). meiRNA carries the DSR region and is targeted by Mmi1, suggesting that meiRNA serves as a decoy for luring Mmi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shichino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamashita et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Mmi1 also plays vital roles in a wide range of regulation of target gene expression, in addition to RNA elimination. Mmi1 induces the assembly of facultative heterochromatin at a subset of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hiriart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tashiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zofall et al., 2012</xref>). Binding of Mmi1 to target transcripts triggers the recruitment of factors involved in heterochromatin formation along with Red1. It has been demonstrated that a highly conserved multiprotein complex, Ccr4/Not, participates in the Mmi1-mediated heterochromatin formation, albeit to a limited extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cotobal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sugiyama et al., 2016</xref>). Mmi1 has also been shown to accelerate deadenylation by Ccr4/Not, although its in vivo significance remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, Mmi1 regulates the termination of transcription of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chalamcharla et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Touat-Todeschini et al., 2017</xref>). Our recent study has revealed that Mmi1-mediated termination of an upstream non-coding RNA ensures the expression of downstream genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Touat-Todeschini et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Mmi1-mediated multilevel regulation is obviously important for proper gene expression in the mitotically growing cells. However, the mechanism of Mmi1-mediated regulation is still not completely known. In this study, we report that Mmi1 prevents the mistimed expression of meiotic proteins by tethering their mRNAs to the nuclear foci. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Mmi1 interacts with itself through the N-terminal region, assisted by a highly conserved cofactor, Erh1. Mmi1 self-interaction is critical for the nuclear retention of meiotic transcripts and consequent prevention of their translation. These results revealed a novel facet of Mmi1-mediated regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mmi1 prevents expression of meiotic proteins in cells with impaired RNA degradation</title><p>Disruption of <italic>mmi1</italic> results in a severe growth defect due to the aberrant expression of meiotic transcripts. This defect was alleviated by the deletion of <italic>mei4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harigaya et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that <italic>mei4</italic> is a crucial target of Mmi1-mediated elimination. <italic>red1∆</italic> cells inappropriately accumulate meiotic transcripts such as <italic>mei4</italic> and <italic>ssm4</italic> during vegetative growth, but are viable albeit showing cold and weak high-temperature sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugiyama and Sugioka-Sugiyama, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamashita et al., 2013</xref>). Deletion of <italic>mei4</italic> did not suppress this temperature-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that these defects are independent of meiotic transcript accumulation. This was also the case in a temperature-sensitive mutant of <italic>rrp6</italic>, which encodes a catalytic subunit of the nuclear exosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To analyze the discrepancy between growth profiles of <italic>mmi1</italic> and <italic>red1</italic> mutants, we investigated the expression of transcripts and proteins of <italic>mei4</italic> in temperature-sensitive <italic>mmi1-ts3</italic> and <italic>red1∆</italic> cells. <italic>mei4</italic> transcripts were ectopically accumulated in both mutants during the mitotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Strikingly, Mei4 protein expression was hardly detected in <italic>red1∆</italic> cells, but accumulated in cells with reduced Mmi1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the temperature-sensitive <italic>rrp6-32</italic> mutant, expression of Mei4 protein was suppressed, whereas <italic>mei4</italic> transcripts accumulated, as seen in <italic>red1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Mei4 protein was detected in both <italic>mmi1-ts3 red1∆</italic> and <italic>mmi1-ts3 rrp6-32</italic> double mutants, indicating that Mei4 protein expression requires both transcript accumulation and Mmi1 inactivation. Similarly, protein expression of <italic>ssm4,</italic> another DSR-containing gene, was detected when Mmi1 activity was dampened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results suggest that Mmi1 likely inhibits the expression of proteins encoded by ectopically accumulated DSR-containing mRNAs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32155.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mmi1 prevents expression of proteins encoded by ectopically accumulated meiotic transcripts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth profiles of <italic>red1∆ mei4∆</italic> and <italic>rrp6-32 mei4∆</italic> double mutant cells. 10-fold serial dilutions of wild-type (<italic>WT</italic>), <italic>mei4∆</italic>, <italic>red1∆</italic>, <italic>red1∆ mei4∆</italic>, <italic>rrp6-32</italic>, and <italic>rrp6-32 mei4∆</italic> cells were spotted on YE media and incubated at the indicated temperatures.

Foci were scarcely observed in cells expressing transcripts containing 0 and 4 DSR motifs, suggesting that, unlike smFISH, transcripts could be detected in this system only when a certain concentration of molecules were gathered.

The meiotic transcripts carrying DSR are recognized by Mmi1, localized in nuclear foci through Mmi1 self-interaction, and degraded by the nuclear exosome. Induction of RNA degradation might be a primary function of Mmi1. However, even though RNA degradation is impaired, nuclear export of the DSR-containing transcripts is prevented by Mmi1 and consequently their protein expression is suppressed. Transcription of some Mmi1-target gene loci, including <italic>mei4,</italic> is also silenced through Mmi1-mediated facultative heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hiriart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tashiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zofall et al., 2012</xref>). In the <italic>red1</italic> and <italic>rrp6</italic> mutant cells, degradation of meiotic transcripts is dampened. However, transcripts are tethered to the nuclear Mmi1 foci and their expression is suppressed through sequestration from the translation machinery. In the absence of Mmi1, degradation of the DSR-containing meiotic transcripts is compromised and they are exported to the cytoplasm and translated, leading to the deleterious expression of meiotic genes. Recently, ZFC3H1, a possible counterpart of Red1 in human cells, has been demonstrated to induce nuclear exosome-mediated degradation of long noncoding RNAs, and prevent their nuclear export in cooperation with hMtr4, an ortholog of which forms a complex with Red1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogami et al., 2017</xref>). hMtr4 has also been shown to induce degradation of mRNAs by inhibiting their nuclear export and recruiting the nuclear exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2017</xref>). It is an intriguing question whether a target-recognition factor, equivalent to Mmi1, works in human cells, although Red1 and ZFC3H1 act differently in nuclear export of the target transcripts.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32155.025</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Multi-layered regulation to prevent mistimed expression of meiotic genes by the YTH-domain protein Mmi1.</title><p>In wild-type (<italic>WT</italic>) cells, meiotic transcripts carrying DSR are recognized by Mmi1, localize in nuclear foci through Mmi1 self-interaction, and are degraded by the nuclear exosome.

During oogenesis in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, a small subset of mRNAs, such as mRNAs encoding key regulators for meiotic progression, are translationally activated, whereas other mRNAs are repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sheets et al., 2017</xref>). Changes in poly(A) tail length are known to be important for this regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weill et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, it has been suggested that the N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine modification, which is often recognized by the YTH domain, is involved in this translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qi et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, ribosome profiling has also shown that translation efficiency of the DSR-containing transcripts is indeed upregulated during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duncan and Mata, 2014</xref>). This is consistent with our findings that Mmi1 modulates gene expression profiles, between mitosis and meiosis, by regulating protein expression through nuclear tethering of meiotic mRNAs, in addition to controlling their stability.</p><p>The DSR-containing meiotic transcripts localize in the nuclear Mmi1 foci, where many other factors involved in selective elimination exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugiyama and Sugioka-Sugiyama, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamashita et al., 2013</xref>), implying that Mmi1 foci are the major sites of meiotic transcript degradation. The Mmi1 foci are distinct from the <italic>mei4</italic> locus, which encodes a key target of Mmi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Egan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shichino et al., 2014</xref>), while enrichment of Mmi1 at the <italic>mei4</italic> locus has been observed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chalamcharla et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tashiro et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that Mmi1 co-transcriptionally recognizes its target transcripts at their gene loci and Mmi1-transcript complexes move to the nuclear foci where RNA degradation takes place; however, we cannot exclude the possibility of Mmi1-inducing RNA degradation on its target gene loci. Further investigation would be required to determine the site of RNA degradation and the precise localization of the Mmi1 foci.</p><p>Mmi1 interacts with itself through the N-terminal SID region with assistance from Erh1. Mmi1 self-interaction is likely to trigger nuclear foci formation, which may be a prerequisite for target transcript degradation and their nuclear tethering. The following observations support this proposal: SID is required for foci formation; Mmi1 lacking SID loses its function of inducing degradation of the target transcripts and preventing their protein expression; <italic>erh1∆</italic> cells, in which Mmi1 self-interaction is impaired, have less Mmi1 foci and show weakened Mmi1 activity, although the interaction between Mmi1 and Red1 is intact. Mmi1 forms foci exclusively in the nucleus. This may be because Mmi1 foci are formed only when a certain number of Mmi1 molecules are enriched in a limited area. However, the possibility of a nuclear-specific factor(s), essential for Mmi1 foci formation, cannot be completely excluded. Further studies would be needed to fully elucidate the mechanism underlying self-interaction and nuclear foci formation of Mmi1.</p><p>Erh1 is highly conserved among eukaryotes. Orthologs of Erh1 have been shown to play roles in various processes, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weng and Luo, 2013</xref>). It is an intriguing question whether ERH proteins play a similar role as the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Erh1.</p><p>Foci formation by the YTH family proteins is known in cells of higher eukaryotes. YTHDC1/YT521-B, which controls mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>), interacts with itself and forms nuclear foci called YT bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nayler et al., 2000</xref>). The cytoplasmic YTH protein YTHDF2, which regulates the stability of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), also aggregates into the cytoplasmic foci and interacts with the processing body, which is enriched in the factors involved in RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). These YTH-containing proteins have regions that are enriched in particular amino acids (proline, arginine, and glutamic acid in YTHDC1; proline, glutamine, and asparagine in YTHDF2) and these regions are crucial for proper localization of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The SID region of Mmi1 is also enriched in serine (20/120 amino acids), arginine (12/120), tyrosine (12/120), and proline (15/120). Most YTH-family proteins do not share sequence similarity without the YTH domain. It is possible that some of them share structural features, such as low complexity regions, and have the ability to form foci through those regions.</p><p>Rigorous Mmi1-mediated regulation may function to remove meiotic factors harmful for mitotic growth.

First, the bright field micrograph of cells was blurred using a Gaussian filter to remove noise and smoothen the cell region. Second, edge detection was performed, and the resultant image was binarized. Further, small isolated regions were removed by the area opening operation. Third, a closing operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soille, 2003</xref>) was applied to the binarized image to fill holes and cracks in the binarized cell region. When adjacent or aggregated cell regions were clustered, it was difficult to separate them automatically. Therefore, the contact areas of cells were manually separated, and the shape of the segmented cell region was restored by a region growing technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soille, 2003</xref>) and manual editing.</p><p>Finally, we measured the ratio of the number of spots in the nuclei region to that in the cytoplasmic region.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Yamashita et al. suggests that Mmi1 tethers meiotic transcripts to nuclear foci and thereby inhibits nuclear export and translation of this class of mRNAs. In addition, the authors illustrate that with the assistance of Erh1, Mmi1 interacts with itself and that this self-interaction is required for nuclear foci formation, target degradation and translation suppression. Overall, the manuscript is well written and the experiments are well conducted. Still improvements are needed as outlined below:</p><p>1) A major concern is the way in which the authors talk about the role of Mmi1 in 'translational suppression'. In several parts of the manuscript, the impression is given that this is a direct role of the protein (see for example the title, parts of the Abstract, and in the Discussion). This is misleading. In fact, the authors show that Mmi1 has a role in preventing mRNA export, indicating that any effects on protein levels are likely to be indirect. Indeed, the conclusion on nuclear export in the mmi1 mutant might even be an indirect consequence of defects in Mmi1-dependent nuclear retention and nuclear decay. The question is whether the primary function of Mmi1 is to retain meiotic transcript in the nucleus to prevent cytoplasmic translation and/or to promote nuclear decay at the site of transcription. These issues need to be clarified by more careful interpretation and discussion of the data.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The authors use RT-qPCR to measure the levels of <italic>mei4-TAP</italic> and <italic>ssm4-TAP</italic> mRNAs. Yet, Mmi1 was recently shown to influence transcription termination. It would therefore be important to confirm that <italic>mei4</italic> and <italic>ssm4</italic> mRNAs accumulating in mmi1 and red1 mutants have similar 3' ends and poly(A) tail length, both of which are known to influence nuclear export and cytoplasmic translation. Accordingly, the authors should analyze <italic>mei4</italic> and <italic>ssm4</italic> transcripts by Northern blotting and/or RNase cleavage assays to examine the 3' end of these mRNAs.</p><p>3) The last part of the manuscript, which describes Mmi1 function in the pairing of homologous chromosomes, is somewhat out of context with the rest of the paper. To tie it better together, the authors could provide more data e.g. by examining the mmi1 domain deletion strains and/or explain/discuss more explicitly why these results are important in the scope of this manuscript. Alternatively, the data could simply be left out of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32155.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) A major concern is the way in which the authors talk about the role of Mmi1 in 'translational suppression'.

We consider that the primary function of Mmi1 may be induction of RNA degradation. Accordingly, we have added the following sentence in the revised manuscript: “Induction of RNA degradation might be a primary function of Mmi1”. However, it is difficult to demonstrate this, because we cannot distinguish multiple Mmi1 functions at this point (e.g. by using a mutant that would lose the Mmi1 function, only to tether targets to nuclear foci). We realize that a detailed dissection of the functions of Mmi1 might be beyond the scope of this article. Further study will be required to shed light on this aspect. Nevertheless, the role of Mmi1 in tethering its target transcripts to nuclear foci is apparently important, as shown in the case when Mmi1-mediated RNA degradation is impaired.</p><p>We also consider that Mmi1-mediated RNA degradation might primarily occur at Mmi1 nuclear foci, which are distinct from its major target gene loci, because both, target transcripts and the nuclear exosome, localize there. Therefore, we have added the following sentences: “It is possible that Mmi1 co-transcriptionally recognizes its target transcripts at their gene loci and Mmi1-transcript complexes move to the nuclear foci where RNA degradation takes place; however, we cannot exclude the possibility of Mmi1-inducing RNA degradation on its target gene loci. Further investigation would be required to determine the site of RNA degradation and the precise localization of the Mmi1 foci”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The authors use RT-qPCR to measure the levels of mei4-TAP and ssm4-TAP mRNAs. Yet, Mmi1 was recently shown to influence transcription termination. It would therefore be important to confirm that mei4 and ssm4 mRNAs accumulating in mmi1 and red1 mutants have similar 3' ends and poly(A) tail length, both of which are known to influence nuclear export and cytoplasmic translation. Accordingly, the authors should analyze mei4 and ssm4 transcripts by Northern blotting and/or RNase cleavage assays to examine the 3' end of these mRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added northern blot analysis (subsection “Mmi1 prevents expression of meiotic proteins in cells with impaired RNA degradation”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) in the revised manuscript. Transcripts of <italic>mei4</italic> and <italic>ssm4</italic> were similar in size in <italic>mmi1-ts3</italic> and meiotic wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>), indicating no significant role of Mmi1 in the termination of both genes.

These observations also suggest that nuclear tethering of meiotic transcripts, by Mmi1, is independent of the regulation of transcription termination.</p><p>In mutant cells with reduced Red1 or Rrp6 function, much longer <italic>ssm4</italic> transcripts were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which have been shown to initiate from a promoter of an upstream gene and encompass the upstream gene as well as <italic>ssm4</italic> (Zofall et al., Science, 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The last part of the manuscript, which describes Mmi1 function in the pairing of homologous chromosomes, is somewhat out of context with the rest of the paper.
