Here, we reveal the enigmatic history of the genus <italic>Cochlearia</italic> (Brassicaceae)<italic>,</italic> a Pleistocene relic that originated from a drought-adapted Mediterranean sister genus during the Miocene. <italic>Cochlearia</italic> rapidly diversified and adapted to circum-Arctic regions and other cold-characterized habitat types during the Pleistocene. This sudden change in ecological preferences was accompanied by a highly complex, reticulate polyploid evolution, which was apparently triggered by the impact of repeated Pleistocene glaciation cycles. Our results illustrate that two early diversified Arctic-alpine diploid gene pools contributed differently to the evolution of this young polyploid genus now captured in a cold-adapted niche. Metabolomics revealed central carbon metabolism responses to cold in diverse species and ecotypes, likely due to continuous connections to cold habitats that may have facilitated widespread adaptation to alpine and subalpine habitats, and which we speculate were coopted from existing drought adaptations. Given the growing scientific interest in the adaptive evolution of temperature-related traits, our results provide much-needed taxonomic and phylogenomic resolution of a model system as well as first insights into the origins of its adaptation to cold.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cochlearia</kwd><kwd>brassicaeae</kwd><kwd>cold adaptation</kwd><kwd>evolutionary genomics</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KO2302/13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koch</surname><given-names>Marcus A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KO2302/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koch</surname><given-names>Marcus A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evolutionary dynamics of polyploid plants of the genus <italic>Cochlearia</italic> during past periods of rapid climate change indicate increased rates of speciation and diversification in response to pronounced glacial cycles and cold periods in particular.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vast spatiotemporal variation across natural environments subjects all organisms to abiotic stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gienapp et al., 2008</xref>). Dynamic shifts in these stressors lead to migration, adaptation, or extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aitken et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the current acceleration of global warming and climate volatility demands a better understanding of evolutionary dynamics resulting from climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Root et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Thomas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Jump and Peñuelas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Visser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Franks et al., 2014</xref>). Further, there is a strong economic rationale for understanding the consequences of environmental change on plants, which typically lack the option of rapidly migrating away from changing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Xoconostle-Cazares et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Olsen and Wendel, 2013</xref>). An especially powerful natural laboratory for the study of climate change adaptation is represented by the recurrent cycles of glaciation and deglaciation during the Pleistocene. Thus, looking backwards in time by investigating the evolutionary footprints of this epoch can provide valuable insight for our understanding of adaptive evolution.</p><p>The genus <italic>Cochlearia</italic> L. represents a promising study system for the evolutionary genomics of adaptation not only because of proximity to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and other Brassicaceae models, but also because of distinctive ecotypic traits which evolved within a short time span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Koch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Koch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Koch, 2012</xref>). Among these are adaptations to extreme bedrock types (dolomite versus siliceous), heavy metal-rich soils, diverse salt habitats, high alpine regions, and life cycle variation. This diversity is accompanied by a remarkably dynamic cytogenetic evolution within the genus. Two base chromosome numbers exist (n=6 and n=7) and out of the 20 accepted taxa, two-thirds are neopolyploids, ranging from tetraploids to octoploids (previous phylogenetic hypotheses are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and Appendix 1 for details). The connecting element between the various cytotypes and ecotypes is the cold character of the diverse habitat types standing in sharp contrast to the preferences of the sole outgroup sister genus <italic>Ionopsidium</italic>, which occurs only in arid Mediterranean habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Koch, 2012</xref>). These two genera constitute the monophyletic tribe Cochlearieae with a stem group age of approx. 18.9 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Walden et al., 2020</xref>) and which forms with various other tribes from Brassicaceae the rapidly emerging evolutionary lineage II with highest net diversification rates 16–23 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Walden et al., 2020</xref>). In total, the genus <italic>Cochlearia</italic> comprises 16 accepted species and 4 subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kiefer et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>While on species-level it has been shown in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> that drought- and temperature-adaptive genetic variants are shared among Mediterranean and Nordic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Exposito-Alonso et al., 2017</xref>), the separation of <italic>Cochlearia</italic> from <italic>Ionopsidium</italic> is much deeper, dating to the mid-Miocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Koch, 2012</xref>). However, the formation of the genus <italic>Cochlearia</italic> as we see it today first started much more recently, during the middle (0.77–0.13 mya) and late (0.13–0.012 mya) Pleistocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Koch, 2012</xref>). This long lag between the divergence of the sole outgroup <italic>Ionopsidium</italic> and <italic>Cochlearia</italic> raises the hypothesis of a long-lasting footprint of drought adaptation in <italic>Cochlearia</italic>. The strong association with cold habitats shown by almost all <italic>Cochlearia</italic> species may therefore be interpreted as a cold preference that was acquired rapidly in adaptation to the intense climatic fluctuations which characterized this epoch.</p><p>There is a growing interest in the genus <italic>Cochlearia</italic> from diverse fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Reeves, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dauvergne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brandrud et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Mandáková et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Nawaz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bray et al., 2020</xref>), but the evolutionary history of the genus has been highly recalcitrant. Thus it is still unknown how the genus managed the rapid transition from Mediterranean to circum-Arctic or high-alpine habitat types in combination with a highly dynamic cytogenetic evolution. Here, we overcome the first obstacle, presenting the first genus-wide picture, using comprehensive cytogenetic data and highly resolving phylogenomic analyses, complemented by insights into the <italic>Cochlearia</italic> metabolome response to cold. Herein the metabolome is primarily used as a complex phenotype, which might characterize potentially different bioclimatically defined biomes or species distribution ranges. However, since it has been shown for <italic>A. thaliana</italic> that the cold metabolome can reflect continental-scale biogeographically defined clines along temperature gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Pritchard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Weiszmann et al., 2020</xref>), it can be assumed that on evolutionary scales past footprints of diversification might be detectable, and that in principle genomic analyses (e.g., GWAS) may allow to identify candidate genes involved in pathway regulation and metabolic reaction plasticity. Our phylogenetic and cytogenetic analysis uncovers a recurrent boosting of speciation by glaciation cycles in this cytotypically very diverse genus and indicates that, despite clear challenges brought by global warming, the genus survives evolutionarily while, we speculate, rescuing its species diversity with reticulate and polyploid evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cytogenetic analyses show geographic structuring and parallel evolutionary trends toward shrinking haploid genomes in higher polyploids</title><p>In order to first resolve its cytogenetic evolution, we generated a comprehensive survey of 575 georeferenced chromosome counts and/or genome sizes across the <italic>Cochlearia</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) based on our novel cytogenetic data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and a review of published literature over the last century (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

Aneuploidies are frequently found in polyploid <italic>Cochlearia</italic> taxa, especially along the coasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), but they are only rarely spotted in diploids and therefore are nearly absent from Arctic regions, where only diploids are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>).

Both analyses revealed that (1) the high frequency of polyploidization events is accompanied by increasing genome sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>), while there is (2) a slight but significant negative correlation of chromosome size with increasing chromosome numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>). This trend was independent of inclusion or exclusion of the annual species <italic>C. danica</italic> and the short-lived Arctic diploids.

Extensive past hybridization and reticulate evolution of polyploid taxa results in complex evolutionary scenarios, which are often not well resolved by strict phylogenetic reconstruction using nuclear data. Therefore, conclusions herein are restricted mostly to diploid taxa and respective gene pools. To provide a highly resolved organellar phylogeny, we generated genome sequence data for 65 <italic>Cochlearia</italic> accessions, representing all accepted <italic>Cochlearia</italic> species, as well as three species from the sister genus <italic>Ionopsidium</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Using these data, complete plastid genomes were assembled de novo for all samples. A maximum likelihood (ML) analysis using RAxML based on our whole chloroplast genome alignment (122,798 bp, excluding one copy of the inverted repeat) covering a total of 5292 SNPs (1003 within <italic>Cochlearia</italic>) revealed six well-supported major lineages within the genus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>, congruent to lineages as illustrated in BEAST chronogram, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A radiation of plastome diversity was indicated by the existence of several polytomies, despite the generally high resolution of the ML tree. To test if the phylogenetic scenario as revealed by plastid genome analyses was also supported by the mitochondrial genome, we generated a mitochondrial ML phylogeny based on a combination of de novo assembly and referenced-based mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>).

For a data set of 22 European (2n=12) and 12 Arctic (2n=14) individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref> for sampling), we analyzed 2140 fourfold degenerate SNPs (Materials and methods). The sampling of Arctic accessions covers different taxa with deep evolutionary splits as exemplified by plastome analyses and the entire Arctic range is covered, therefore unequal sampling size is expected to have a minor effect if any. Overall, the EUR metapopulation exhibits much higher genetic diversity than the ARC metapopulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>), which is in accordance with population-based analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>). In both populations, 2n=12 and 2n=14, we found an excess of rare alleles (negative Tajima’s D, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>), indicating that they are not in mutation-drift equilibrium. Differentiation and divergence between ARC and EUR were overall very low (Fst ~0.098, dxy ~0.0036, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).</p><p>Given the dynamic nature of their ice-age-associated speciation histories, we hypothesized that after the EUR and ARC metapopulations separated, they underwent dramatic changes in effective population sizes (N<sub>e</sub>) over time, and that they experienced gene flow. We first tested four different hypotheses regarding the occurrence and relative timing of gene flow between ARC and EUR, because failure to account for gene flow can confound the inference of population size changes. Our gene flow hypotheses were formulated as different model categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), and random forest ABC (ABC-RF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Marin and Pudlo, 2015</xref>) was used to test under which model the observed data was most probable to have arisen. However, discriminating between the four gene flow models was ambiguous (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>), as the most probable model depended on the priors, particularly on the upper bound of the N<sub>e</sub> priors. When allowing N<sub>e</sub> up to 400,000, a model of ongoing secondary contact (OSC) prevailed over a model without any gene flow (model SI; posterior probability &gt;0.75, i.e., Bayes Factor &gt;3), but OSC was not clearly better than a model with continuous gene flow (CM) or a past secondary contact (PSC). Yet, when choosing a less informative N<sub>e</sub> prior with a greater upper bound of three million, all four models were similarly in agreement with the observed data. In the absence of strong prior information for N<sub>e</sub>, we could not establish the occurrence of gene flow between ARC and EUR metapopulations with confidence (see Appendix 3 for further information on ABC model choice).</p><p>To estimate changes in N<sub>e</sub> through time, we fitted parameters of a model without any gene flow (SI) and a model of OSC, considering both high and low N<sub>e</sub> upper prior bounds, amounting to a total of four model fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). The general pattern of changes in N<sub>e</sub> through time were always modeled such that each of ARC and EUR had an older phase of constant N<sub>e</sub> followed by a recent phase of exponential expansion or decline.</p><p>The model without gene flow (SI) contained the fewest parameters, and this model with a smaller N<sub>e</sub> prior bound of maximal 400,000 provided the best fit to the data (smallest Euclidean distances between observed and predicted values from posterior predictive checks; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>). This model fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) is consistent with the remaining three model fits. Importantly, all model fits agreed about the relative N<sub>e</sub> of EUR and ARC: they evolved drastically differently, with the EUR metapopulation having risen to 4–12-fold the N<sub>e</sub> of their common ancestral population followed by a moderate decline (0.4–0.8-fold in three out of four models), or constant size up to the present (OSC with smaller N<sub>e</sub> upper bound). In contrast, the ARC metapopulation experienced a bottleneck after splitting from the common ancestor (0.2–0.5-fold), followed by a dramatic expansion of 9–52-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). Estimated N<sub>e</sub> for the ancestral population and for ARC during the ancient phase were robust to the choice of model and priors, but other N<sub>e</sub> parameters, in particular the ancient phase of EUR and the recent phase of ARC (i.e., the phases in which their N<sub>e</sub> were largest), increased when the prior’s upper bound was increased. However, the relative N<sub>e</sub> trends through time were robust to these uncertainties, as mentioned above.</p><p>If EUR and ARC did not experience gene flow (SI model fit), they must have separated only about 65,000–73,000 generations ago, corresponding to 0.2–3 N<sub>e</sub> units. This estimate was robust to the choice of priors and may coincide with the last interglacial period (considering a 2-year average generation time; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abs, 1999</xref>). If gene flow is assumed (OSC), this split could have occurred earlier (119,000–227,000 generations ago; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). Further parameters were poorly estimable as indicated by large prediction error, and little deviation between prior and posterior. These include the timing of the transitions from ancient to recent phases of N, the timing of migration, and the migration rates. Considering our BEAST analyses from plastome data, a split-time of 65,000–73,000 generations ago is more likely (e.g., dating of splits within the green evolutionary lineage). An important implication of this is that polyploid inland taxa, such as alpine hexaploid <italic>C. tatrae</italic> from the High Tatra mountains, showing footprints of both diploid gene pools cannot have evolved earlier than during the Last Interglacial. The example of hexaploid <italic>C. bavarica</italic> showed a postglacial origin and footprint of both diploid gene pools dated with approximately 12–15,000 years ago predating rapid Holocenic temperature increase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Genus-wide cold response characterized by metabolic profiling indicates an ancient origin of cold temperature tolerance</title><p>We hypothesized that a very early evolved tolerance to cold facilitated the observed widespread adaptation to alpine and subalpine habitats across the <italic>Cochlearia</italic> genus.

A possible, but far from causal, hypothesis is that the ancestral and exclusively circum-Arctic 2n=14 taxa may have also benefitted from one extra centromere, which increases total recombination rate and thus may also be favorable under harsh conditions and drastic environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Stapley et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Whereas the presence of chromosomal aberrations in <italic>Cochlearia</italic> has been postulated to be caused by B-chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gill, 1971b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gill, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Gill et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Nordal, 1988</xref>), these aneuploidies could also be the result of hybridization/polyploidization events followed by mitotic/meiotic difficulties or independent ascending/descending dysploidies via chromosome rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lysak, 2014</xref>), although the exact mechanisms in this genus are yet unclear. Karyotypic variation and aneuploidy following hybridization in plants have been described as adjustment processes within the allopolyploid genome putatively connected to the beginning of re-diploidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Mandáková et al., 2016</xref>). For <italic>Cochlearia</italic>, the high frequency of chromosomal aberrations in polyploids likely reflects a highly dynamic genome evolution, given the near absence of interspecific fertility barriers between cytotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gill, 1971a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gill, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, a trend for reducing genomic redundancy in the young polyploids is suggested by the negative correlation of chromosome size with increasing chromosome numbers. Combined with the stable diploid karyotypes, these patterns are well in accordance with the hypothesis of a necessary balance between both genomic flexibility and stability allowing for further adaptive evolution to a continuously changing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hohmann et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite the highly fluid genome dynamics across the genus, we did observe a tight concurrence of high glacial periods and diversification times within the six major lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests a boosting impact of these climatic fluctuations on the diversification of the genus. Accordingly, the observed polytomies, especially within the green and the purple lineage, likely reflect events of rapid, reticulate radiation during the last two glacial periods, where we speculate that polyploidization and hybridization may have facilitated adaptation to dramatically changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hohmann et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Based on the organellar phylogenies and divergence-time estimates (and contradicting former hypotheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gill, 1971a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gill, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Koch et al., 1996</xref>]), an evolutionary scenario with an ancestral base chromosome number of n=7 in diploid Arctic ancestors followed by reduction to n=6 in European diploids is most parsimonious. This view is supported by the finding that also within the green lineage (Arctic-European), basal groups are confined to Arctic regions. However, in accordance with former hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Koch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Koch et al., 2003</xref>), we can also postulate that additional glacial refugia must have existed in Europe north of the primary refugia for European species (Iberian Peninsula, Southern Italy, Balkans; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Taberlet et al., 1998</xref>), as also described for other taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Stewart and Lister, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Tribsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Tribsch and Schönswetter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Provan and Bennett, 2008</xref>). The putative Arctic background of the entire genus <italic>Cochlearia</italic> might have (a) promoted the general association with cold-characterized habitat types throughout the genus and (b) facilitated later adaptation to different high alpine regions in Europe. As revealed from the plastid phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>), the latter has taken place repeatedly in the High Tatra Mountains (<italic>C. tatrae</italic>, orange lineage, Eastern Europe), in the Austrian Alps (<italic>C. excelsa</italic>, green lineage, Arctic-European), in alpine habitat types in Great Britain (<italic>C. alpina</italic>/<italic>C. micacea</italic>, purple lineage, western European), and in several other European habitats with a more subalpine character, namely in the Pyrenees or in Switzerland.</p><p>With respect to the putative Arctic origin of the genus in its current shape with an ancestral base chromosome number of n=7, the very strong admixture between both diploid genetic clusters of different chromosome numbers (as seen in diploid Arctic Icelandic accessions) provides evidence of genetic coherence. Considering the numerous polyploids and their independent, multiple origins in <italic>Cochlearia</italic> (see Appendix 1) and the exceptional case of sympatry of both different diploid cytotypes in an arctic environment in Iceland, it seems that the two early separated gene pools serve as a continuous source for the evolution of new, often transient, and currently highly endangered species. Regarding the demographic histories of the two gene pools, our ABC data suggest that ARC and EUR metapopulations are only weakly differentiated and share most of their genetic variation, either because of recent separation or gene flow. They currently have large and similar effective population sizes, but ARC has expanded after a bottleneck whereas EUR has remained constant, or recently declined.</p><p>When exposed to low but non-freezing temperatures, plants commonly activate cold acclimation responses involving changes in gene expression, enzymatic activities and ultimately, concentrations of many central carbon intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Kaplan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Kaplan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hoermiller et al., 2017</xref>). As part of this low temperature response, particular accumulations of carbohydrates, polyols, and amino acids are detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Kaplan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Krasensky and Jonak, 2012</xref>). All <italic>Cochlearia</italic> and <italic>Ionopsidium</italic> species analyzed herein showed this response, too. However, despite covering a broad phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity and clustering taxa according to bioclimatically defined clusters, low temperature response did not differentiate among those, as it has been demonstrated for <italic>A. thaliana</italic> across a gradient from the Mediterranean toward Scandinavia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Weiszmann et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Given that all <italic>Cochlearia</italic> species, regardless of origin and habitat type, exhibited similar responses to the temperature treatment performed under controlled conditions for central carbon intermediates, we hypothesize that these similar responses to cold within the genus reflect continuous connections to cold-characterized habitats acquired over the course of a migration to northern/circum-Arctic regions during the early evolution of the genus. Apparently, a constitutive cold tolerance has not been lost secondarily within <italic>Cochlearia</italic>. Future analyses of the cold-induced metabolome of <italic>Cochlearia</italic> will require untargeted metabolomics analyses to systematically account for the contribution of species/ecotype-specific metabolic characters in the overall cold response. In this respect, previous studies on glucosinolate and tropane alkaloid chemotypes, which are key to biotic stress adaptation, have shown rapid structural diversification and ecotype specificities within the <italic>Cochlearia</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blažević et al., 2020</xref>). Regarding the overall similar response of central carbon metabolism to the cold treatment of annual species from the genus <italic>Ionopsidium,</italic> which are adapted to at least seasonally dry habitats and/or salt habitats, we may conclude that commonalities between cold and salinity/drought stress would enable a putative recruitment of the cold tolerance from existing adaptations to drought and/or salt as hypothesized for other plant taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Böndel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Exposito-Alonso et al., 2017</xref>). We speculate that a potential mechanism for this conserved response may be hinted at by the pleiotropic nature of metabolic networks, potentially exposing these networks to constraining selection.</p><p>Because both drought, salt and cold stress strongly involve osmotic challenge, our data also support the idea that an evolution to one of these stressors in the common ancestor not only allowed for the survival under Mediterranean conditions (<italic>Ionopsidium</italic>), but also may have preadapted the nascent <italic>Cochlearia</italic> genus to habitats characterized by cold or salt, and with Arctic environments often characterized by drought, too.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results indicate that the immense karyotypic diversity of <italic>Cochlearia</italic> reflects not only postglacial or even recent hybridization, but also speciation boosting during Pleistocene glaciation cycles. This in turn appears to have triggered the parallel exploration of new ecological niches on a continental scale ranging from the Arctic toward lower latitude alpine regions. We speculate that species richness and thereby genetic diversity was meanwhile rescued in reticulate and polyploid gene pools, often resulting in sometimes porous species boundaries. Irrespective of their habitat contrasts, both <italic>Cochlearia</italic> and its Mediterranean sister genus <italic>Ionopsidium</italic> show a pronounced response to cold stress based on metabolite profiling. This leads to the idea that a shared ancestral adaptation to drought enabled not only the survival under dry Mediterranean conditions, but also may have preadapted the nascent <italic>Cochlearia</italic> genus to habitats characterized by cold or salt: all of these stressors have at their cores osmotic challenge. As colonization of these habitat types occurred multiple times independently, <italic>Cochlearia</italic> represents a powerful system to predict the fate of this and other taxa in a world marked by climate change.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and taxon sampling for cytogenetic analyses</title><p>Our cytogenetic analyses (chromosome counts and flow cytometry) were performed on a large collection of living plants including different ploidy levels and covering big parts of the genus’ distribution range.

that the genus <italic>Cochlearia</italic> has a complex and putatively reticulate evolutionary background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Koch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Koch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Koch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Koch et al.,

complexity of the species complex. Since morphological differentiation is often insufficient for species identification within <italic>Cochlearia</italic>, the different taxa are ideally characterized by ploidy level and ecotype. A summary of previous evolutionary hypotheses regarding ploidy levels and ecology as revealed from previous studies, is given with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>. Based on the two different base chromosome numbers (n=6 and n=7), a range of ploidy levels from diploid to octoploid has evolved, and although the evolution of polyploid taxa within the genus <italic>Cochlearia</italic> has been studied intensively, especially based on cytogenetic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gill, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gill, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Gill et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Koch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Nordal and Laane, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Koch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Kochjarová et al., 2006</xref>), many aspects are still unknown and require further investigation.</p><p>The polyploid taxa can be categorized into coastal and inland polyploids. Along the coasts of continental Europe and Great Britain, we find tetraploid, hexaploid, and octoploid species. According to BrassiBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kiefer et al., 2014</xref>), these are <italic>C. officinalis</italic> L. (2n=4x=24), <italic>C. scotica</italic> Druce (2n=4x=24), <italic>C. danica</italic> L. (2n=6x=42), and <italic>C. anglica</italic> L. (2n=8x=48 or 2n=10x=60) as well as three subspecies of <italic>C. officinalis</italic>, namely <italic>C. officinalis</italic> subsp. <italic>integrifolia</italic> (Hartm.) Nordal &amp; Stabbetorp (2n=4x=24), <italic>C. officinalis</italic> subsp. <italic>norvegica</italic> Nordal &amp; Stabbetorp (2n=4x=24) and <italic>C. officinalis</italic> subsp. <italic>officinalis</italic> L. (2n=4x=24) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Their ecological preferences (e.g., regarding salt tolerance) are slightly differint, yet distribution ranges are often overlapping and many cases of hybridization between coastal taxa have been observed even across ploidy levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Saunte, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fearn, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Pegtel, 1999</xref>). The near absence of interspecific fertility barriers observed throughout the genus has also been demonstrated experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Crane and Gairdner, 1923</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gill, 1971a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gill, 1971b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gill, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gill, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Gill et al., 1978</xref>). In combination with a high level of morphological plasticity in response to the habitat type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Elkington, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Nordal, 1988</xref>), this makes the coastal species complex very challenging from a taxonomical point of view.</p><p>The group of inland polyploids found in continental Europe comprises <italic>C. bavarica</italic> Vogt (2n=6x=36), <italic>C. polonica</italic> Fröhl. (2n=2x=36), <italic>C. tatrae</italic> Borbás (2n=6x=42), and <italic>C. borzaeana</italic> (Com. et Nyár.) Pobed. (2n = 8x=42/48). All of them are highly endangered, represent a present-day locally restricted distribution range and are considered as endemics. Besides these, there are tetraploid taxa found at inland stations in Great Britain. Here, populations with a karyotype of 2n=4x=24 have been described as either inland populations of <italic>C. officinalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clapham et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>) or as a separate subspecies <italic>C. pyrenaica</italic> ssp. <italic>alpina</italic> (Bab.) Dalby (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gill, 2008</xref>) with closer affinities to the <italic>C. pyrenaica</italic> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gill, 2008</xref>). In the following, these populations are referred to as <italic>C. pyrenaica</italic> ssp. <italic>alpina</italic>, abbreviated as <italic>C. alpina</italic>, while diploid inland populations, which have also been described as <italic>C. alpina</italic> (Bab.) H.C. Watson are treated as <italic>C. pyrenaica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gill, 1971b</xref>). Another tetraploid British inland species is <italic>C. micacea</italic> E.S. Marshall, with a karyotype of 2n=4x=26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Gill et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clapham et al., 1990</xref>). It is endemic to few high-altitude locations with an alpine character in Scotland.</p><p>New insights regarding the evolution of polyploid <italic>Cochlearia</italic> taxa gained in this study, based on both cytogenetic and phylogenomic data, are discussed below for respective taxa. In general, the observed infraspecific variation for chloroplast genomes, as shown before based on cpDNA restriction site variation analysis (RFLP) for several polyploid coastal species <italic>C. officinalis</italic>, <italic>C. danica</italic> and <italic>C. anglica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Koch et al., 1996</xref>), and also revealed in the present study by the lack of monophyly in all polyploid coastal taxa, can be best explained by reticulate evolution and multiple origin of these polyploids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Koch et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p><italic>Cochlearia officinalis</italic> (2n=4x=24), <italic>C. scotica</italic> (2n=4x=24)</p><p>The tetraploid <italic>Cochlearia officinalis</italic> s. str. is a biennial to perennial species widely distributed along the northern coastlines of continental Europe and Great Britain, where it is mainly found on gravelly beaches, sea cliffs, or drier areas of salt-marshes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Gill et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Nordal and Stabbetorp, 1990</xref>) and rarely in past mining areas on heavy metal contaminated soils along creeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>). Whereas former studies suggested an autopolyploid origin from relatives of the only recent Central European diploid coastal species, <italic>C. aestuaria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Gill et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Elkington, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>), the results presented herein are not in favor of this hypothesis. All samples of <italic>C. officinalis</italic> included in a STRUCTURE analysis of 62 <italic>Cochlearia</italic> samples (based on 400,071 transcriptome-wide SNPs, K=3) show signatures of admixture between the Arctic and the Central European gene pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig15">Appendix 1—figure 15</xref>), whereas <italic>C. aestuaria</italic> is purely grouped within the Central European gene pool. Likewise, in the SplitsTree analysis of all <italic>Cochlearia</italic> samples and <italic>Ionopsidium</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>), <italic>C. officinalis</italic> was grouped in between diploid samples from the Arctic gene pool and the diploid samples from Northern Spain including <italic>C. aestuaria</italic>. In the plastid phylogeny, <italic>C. officinalis</italic> samples do not form a monophyletic lineage but are found both in a basal lineage of coastal polyploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>, blue lineage) and in the derived purple lineage, containing mainly samples from Great Britain as well as <italic>C. aestuaria</italic>. Taken together, these results indicate the repeated formation of the coastal tetraploid <italic>C. officinalis</italic> via two plausible scenarios: (a) autopolyploidization from formerly existing northern European coastal diploids with a strong Arctic impact, or (b) allopolyploidization between <italic>aestuaria</italic>-like diploids and northern diploids forced to come into contact likely during past glacial maxima.</p><p>Compared to <italic>C. officinalis</italic> s. str., the British tetraploid <italic>C. scotica</italic> (2n=4x=24) has been described to have a more compact phenotype with shorter inflorescences. It has also been considered as a morphological variant of <italic>C. officinalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gill, 1971a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gill, 1973</xref>) given the overall weak morphological distinctiveness. Whereas one of the <italic>C. scotica</italic> samples included in our study was placed next to Austrian and Swiss diploids in the organellar phylogenies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">7</xref>), indicating mechanisms such as chloroplast capture or incomplete lineage sorting, no clear distinction between analyzed samples of <italic>C. officinalis</italic> and the two <italic>C. scotica</italic> samples was possible based on the results of the nuclear transcriptome SNP data analyses via STRUCTURE and SplitsTree. Therefore, <italic>C. scotica</italic> might rather be considered as a small growing morphological variant of <italic>C. officinalis</italic> as suggested before.</p><p><italic>Cochlearia alpina</italic> (2n=4x=24) and <italic>C. micacea</italic> (2n=4x=26)</p><p>Based on the different analyses of organellar and nuclear genomes presented in this study, no strong conclusions regarding the evolutionary background of the British tetraploid species <italic>C. alpina</italic> (2n=4x=24) and <italic>C. micacea</italic> (2n=4x=26) can be drawn, but some reasonable speculations can be made.</p><p>In both organellar phylogenies, <italic>C. alpina</italic> did not form a monophyletic clade, suggesting repeated formation of this tetraploid inland species. This hypothesis is supported by the scattered placement of <italic>C. alpina</italic> samples in the SplitsTree network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>). Whereas Calp_0828 is grouped within British tetraploid samples, Calp_0165 and Calp_1127 show closest associations with diploid <italic>C. pyrenaica</italic>. Therefore, putative events of autopolyploidization from <italic>C. pyrenaica</italic> cannot be ruled out, although the organellar phylogenies also reveal a close relation to the coastal species complex.</p><p>The two samples of <italic>C. micacea</italic> analyzed in here, originating from the Scottish mountains Beinn an Dòthaidh (Cmica_0979) and Ben Lawers (Cmica_0983), respectively, are monophyletic in both organellar ML analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">7</xref>). Both phylogenies as well as the SplitsTree network reveal a close association of <italic>C. micacea</italic> with the coastal species complex and especially with <italic>C. officinalis</italic>. Yet, the species-specific karyotype of 2n=26, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gill, 1973</xref> and later on questioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Nordal and Stabbetorp, 1990</xref>, could not be confirmed for the respective accessions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Therefore, the former hypothesis of a formation via primary tetrasomy from autotetraploid <italic>C. officinalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gill, 1973</xref>) cannot be discussed without further cytogenetic studies.</p><p>Based on the results from SplitsTree and STRUCTURE analyses, a clear distinction between <italic>C. alpina</italic> and <italic>C. micacea</italic> is not possible and with regard to the described karyotypic uncertainties, a separate taxonomic status of the two species is questionable (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gill, 2008</xref>). For continental Europe, a formerly wide inland distribution of <italic>C. officinalis</italic>-type plants has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Koch, 2002</xref>; see below for <italic>C. bavarica, C. polonica</italic>/<italic>C. tatrae</italic>/<italic>C. borzaeana</italic>). Assuming a similar picture for Great Britain, and having in mind the phylogenetic association of both species with <italic>C. officinalis</italic>, it stands to reason to treat both taxa as inland populations of <italic>C. officinalis</italic>, as already done before for some <italic>C. alpina</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clapham et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p><italic>Cochlearia bavarica</italic> (2n=6x=36)</p><p>In the existing literature on the inland hexaploid <italic>C. bavarica</italic> (2n=6x=36), endemic to two isolated areas in the Alpine foothills in southern Germany, there is a general consensus about its evolution via allopolyploidization from diploid <italic>C. pyrenaica</italic>-type plants and tetraploid <italic>C. officinalis</italic>-type plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Vogt, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Koch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abs, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Koch, 2002</xref>). A separate STRUCTURE analysis based on 103,874 variants extracted from the variant calling for all samples and including the two sequenced <italic>C. bavarica</italic> samples as well as representatives of the putative parental species further supports this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13</xref>). Based on the generated divergence time estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>), a very recent origin of the species in the 17th/18th century, promoted by the cultivation of <italic>C. officinalis</italic> in Bavarian monasteries as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Vogt, 1985</xref>, can be ruled out as split times between <italic>C. bavarica</italic> and <italic>C. pyrenaica</italic> samples were dated to postglacial ~10/~11 kya. Therefore, an allopolyploidization event predating anthropogenic impact, from <italic>C. officinalis</italic>-type plants that were formerly distributed inland in Central Europe, as suggested by Koch 002 is more likely. The two <italic>C. bavarica</italic> samples, representing the two recent metapopulations, do not form a monophyletic clade in the organellar phylogenies but are linked to geographically close <italic>C. pyrenaica</italic> samples from respective distribution areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>). Yet, in the SplitsTree network, the two <italic>C. bavarica</italic> samples are grouped closely together, both connected to a <italic>C. pyrenaica</italic> sample from Baden-Württemberg (Hohenlohe). This result supports the idea of a single ancient origin followed by genetic differentiation over geographic distances and later disruption of the continuous distribution into two refuge distribution areas as suggested bch based on isozyme data showing a strong geographic partitioning.</p><p><italic>Cochlearia polonica</italic> (2n=6x=36), <italic>C. tatrae</italic> (2n=6x=42), <italic>C. borzaeana</italic> (2n=8x=48)</p><p>The three polyploid inland species <italic>C. polonica</italic> (2n=6x=36), <italic>C. tatrae</italic> (2n=6x=42) and <italic>C. borzaeana</italic> (2n=8x=48), all endemic to different regions in Eastern Europe, are characterized by different karyotypes, yet similar allopolyploidization events have been suggested for all of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bajer, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Koch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Koch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Kochjarová et al., 2006</xref>). The nuclear genomes indicate a shared evolutionary history and group all them into a monophyletic clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref>). As described for <italic>C. bavarica</italic> (see above), <italic>C. pyrenaica</italic>-like diploids and <italic>C. officinalis</italic>-like tetraploids have been proposed as putative parental species. In the STRUCTURE analysis of all 62 <italic>Cochlearia</italic> samples, the three polyploid taxa show similar patterns of admixture between the European and the Arctic gene pool and with the <italic>C. danica</italic>-specific cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig15">Appendix 1—figure 15</xref>). This is also reflected in the SplitsTree network, where the three taxa are grouped next to the <italic>Ionopsidium</italic>/<italic>C. tridactylites</italic>/<italic>C. danica</italic> cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>). In the plastid phylogeny, the three species are dispersed, that way indicating independent polyploidization events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). Given the basal positions of both <italic>C. tatrae</italic> and <italic>C. borzaeana</italic> in the plastid phylogeny, the latter grouped together with Spanish <italic>C. danica</italic> and Arctic diploids (2n=14), one hypothesis for the formation of these early diverged (presumably last interglacial) European polyploids would be an earlier southward migration of Arctic diploids, that later on went extinct in Europe but served as parental taxa in the presumed allopolyploidization. This would explain the Arctic footprint in the STRUCTURE results, and formerly described affinities between <italic>C. tatrae</italic> and <italic>C. groenlandica</italic> based on chloroplast DNA analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Koch et al., 1996</xref>) support this hypothesis. Still, based on the data presented herein, no final conclusions on the complex reticulate evolutionary history of the three species can be made.</p><p><italic>Cochlearia danica</italic> (2n=6x=42)</p><p>Although the annual coastal species <italic>C. danica</italic> (2n=6x=42) shares a common base number of n = 7 with hexaploid <italic>C. tatrae</italic> and the Arctic diploids like the widespread <italic>C. groenlandica</italic>, closer phylogenetic relationships with these species have been rejected by former studies based on chloroplast DNA analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Koch et al., 1996</xref>) or the special cytogenetic characteristics of <italic>C. danica</italic> three chromosome sets of varying size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gill, 1976</xref>). Instead, allopolyploid formation from tetraploid <italic>C. officinalis</italic> relatives and <italic>C. aestuaria</italic>-like coastal diploids has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Koch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>). Our SplitsTree network revealed a close association of <italic>C. danica</italic> with <italic>Ionopsidium</italic> and <italic>C. tridactylites</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>). The connection with the Arctic species complex is further supported by the plastid phylogeny where a Spanish <italic>C. danica</italic> is placed in the second most basal lineage together with <italic>C. borzaeana</italic> (2n=6x=42/48) and the two Arctic diploid species <italic>C. groenlandica</italic> and <italic>C. sessilifolia</italic> (2n=2x=14; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). However, in the STRUCTURE analysis of all <italic>Cochlearia</italic> samples, <italic>C. danica</italic> forms a clearly separated cluster and only one Scottish sample (Cdan_0654) shows signs of admixture with the Arctic gene pool likely as a result of recent introgression from other coastal species. Thus, the origin of <italic>C. danica</italic> remains somewhat cryptic but an early allopolyploidization event involving n=7 parental taxa with subsequent southward migration along Western European coasts seems likely. A respective genetic coastal gradient from North to South has been demonstrated earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koch et al., 1998</xref>). Regarding the frequently described naturally occurring hybrids between <italic>C. danica</italic> and other coastal taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Pegtel, 1999</xref>), subsequent hybridization and introgression following the initial formation of the species can be assumed.</p><p><italic>Cochlearia anglica</italic> (2n=8x=48)</p><p>The octoploid coastal species <italic>C. anglica</italic> (2n=8x=48), which is distributed from northern France to southern Sweden, was hypothesized to be an auto- or allopolyploid from a <italic>C. officinalis</italic>-like tetraploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Koch et al., 1996</xref>). Initially, two accessions of <italic>C. anglica</italic> were included in the present NGS study, yet one accession (Cang_1157, Scotland, north of Creetown) was finally determined to be a putative hybrid between <italic>C. anglica</italic> and <italic>C. officinalis</italic> (<italic>C. x hollandica</italic>) based on chromosome counts and genome size measurements (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), whereas no cytogenetic data are available for the other accession (Cang_1023, France, Département Morbihan, La Trinité-sur-Mer). Hence, possibly no true <italic>C. anglica</italic> was included in the study and results for Cang_1023 must be handled with caution. The latter shows signatures of admixture with the <italic>C. danica</italic>-specific cluster in the STRUCTURE results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig15">Appendix 1—figure 15</xref>), which would argue against an autopolyploidization from <italic>C. officinalis</italic> as none of the included <italic>C. officinalis</italic> samples shows this pattern. The association with <italic>C. danica</italic> is further supported by the SplitsTree network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>), yet as stated above, given the described karyotypic uncertainties, no conclusions on the origin of <italic>C. anglica</italic> can be drawn from these results and further studies are needed to verify the formation of this octoploid species.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Illustration of previous evolutionary hypotheses.</title><p>A summary of hypotheses regarding the evolution of the genus <italic>Cochlearia</italic> combined with information on ploidy levels and ecology.

It has been shown that genetic data from low-divergence populations may fit equally well to a model without any gene flow and recent population split time, and an alternative model with strong gene flow and ancient split time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hey et al., 2015</xref>), which can lead to very high false-positive rates for the inference of gene flow in low divergence data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cruickshank and Hahn, 2014</xref>). Although this problem was so far addressed mainly in the context of a particular inference method, the IMa2 program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hey, 2010</xref>), it is likely to be relevant in general, and it may affect traditional rejection-ABC model choice in particular. This method approximates the relative posterior probability of a model and priors by the frequency of simulated data sets that are similar to the observed data. However, low genetic divergence will necessarily be obtained more frequently under models with gene flow than under models without gene flow, all other priors of the models being equal. In other words, low divergence is a-priori more probable with gene flow than without it, and thus rejection-ABC for low divergence data sets can provide little insight beyond this intuitive expectation. In contrast to rejection-ABC model choice, the method we used here, ABC model choice with Random Forests (ABC-RF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Marin and Pudlo, 2015</xref>), is not affected by this fallacy, and can instead indicate a lack of power for model choice of low-divergence data sets between models with and without gene flow (‘posterior probability’ between 0.25 and 0.75). This is because ABC-RF estimates the probability to choose the correct model specifically for the observed data, rather than the model’s relative probabilities of obtaining the observed data. We believe that ambiguity (lack of power) is preferable over clear but positively misleading rejection-based ABC model choice outcomes.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71572.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kliebenstein</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of California, Davis</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><related-object id="sa0ro1" link-type="continued-by" object-id="10.1101/2021.07.11.451959" object-id-type="id" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.07.11.451959"/></front-stub><body><p>This work has the potential to be of broad interest to scientists seeking to understand the evolutionary dynamics of plants during past periods of rapid climate change.

This, on its own is an interesting taxonomic and phylogeographic discovery, and I believe this result, and the phylogenetics supporting it, to be very strong. The authors then use the multiple lineages within <italic>Cochlearia</italic> as separate lines of evidence to speculate about parallel and adaptive evolution. In some cases, this would also offer strong evidence. However, here, where evolution is known to be highly reticulate, it is not clear that the species really do offer independent lines of evidence for adaptation.

We also cited now the excellent paper presented by Weiszmann et al., (2020) exemplying the potential power of metabolome analyses across biogeographic and continental‐scale gradients (here, even within one single species – namely <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Below are specific comments regarding sections of the manuscript that I feel could use some more clarification etc.</p><p>[1] – Framing tests of adaptation –</p><p>The main take home is that Cochlearia diverged from more temperate relatives around the start of the Pleistocene, and given its' current poleward and higher elevation distribution, this is evidence that speciation coincided with and was possibly caused by, a changing climate. This, on its own is an interesting taxonomic and phylogeographic discovery, and I believe this result, and the phylogenetics supporting it, to be very strong. The authors then use the multiple lineages within Cochlearia as separate lines of evidence to speculate about parallel and adaptive evolution. In some cases, this would also offer strong evidence. However, here, where evolution is known to be highly reticulate, it is not clear that the species really do offer independent lines of evidence for adaptation. Further, how in a system like this can one infer 'parallel' evolution? Couldn't any observed conserved phenotypes (or distributions) be due to recent admixture? Indeed, in several cases, the authors present evidence showing strong and recent gene flow between the modestly diverged genetic clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the thoughtful comments. We agree in general, and recognize challenges to strongly infer parallelism in the face of admixture. In this respect we think It is useful to note the variety of degrees of admixture in our study: many species (strongly defined by ecology/distribution and cytotype) here are actually geographically isolated entities and not subjected to “recent” admixture. In fact, for one taxon only a postglacial hybrid origin is shown (<italic>C. bavarica</italic>), and for other taxa such as <italic>C. tatrae</italic> (hexaploid) we work to show an ancient connection between diploid gene pools in the text – but no recent geneflow. Therefore, it is indeed meaningful that highly endemic diploid <italic>C. excelsa</italic> and hexaploid <italic>C. tatrae</italic> evolved in two different high mountain ranges “in parallel”. However, we do note that recent geneflow is mostly obvious along coastal lines involving salt adapted species (between hexaploid <italic>C. danica</italic>, tetraploid <italic>C. officinals</italic>, <italic>C. anglica</italic> – and eventually resulting in those numerous aneuploids), but this very recent geneflow is out of the scope of this study.</p><p>In this respect we absolutely do agree: it depends on species and <italic>Cochlearia</italic> lineages being selected how powerful the system is to study parallel and/or convergent evolution. We endeavor in our revision to reflect this more subtle but important point – and we fully agree that there we have often have to speculate about “parallel evolution”.</p><p>Please consider also Suppl. Figure 1 illustrating the close association of substrate adaptation and distribution, which is thereby presenting another summary of convergently evolving traits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[2] – Nuclear vs. cp/mt genome phylogeny –</p><p>The bulk of the phylogenetic analyses are supported by single-locus chloroplast or mito genome alignments.

Indeed, the maternal (cytoplasmic) data are mostly used to document maternal and, thereby, also biogeographic patterns of major dispersal routes since these organelles are inherited maternally and “propagated via seeds” and its genomes do not recombine significantly.</p><p>We note that we believe the organization is explicit regarding the data: the chapter mentioned by the reviewer is in fact headed “Organeller phylogenies …” and in response to the reviewer we framed this section now more explicitly. However, yes, we do also fully agree that we should comment and compare to the genomic perspective here, too. We do also agree that we may not use terms such as “rapid radiation” referring to speciation processes and being more precise and have thus removed instances of ‘rapid’. We rephrased this and also explained limits of the cytonuclear as well as the nuclear phylogenies; e.g. lines 186‐190, 295‐299.</p><p>The reviewer mentioned SI Figure 11. This is indeed true and the same is true with TreeMix analysis (SI Figure 15, congruent to Figure 11). Unfortunately, here TreeMix is not able to demonstrate early geneflow (e.g. hybridization and allo‐polyploidization), which has been already documented for some polyploids (e.g. in <italic>C. bavarica</italic>). This is why we largely refer to structure analysis recognizing significantly three gene pools in <italic>Cochlearia</italic> with varying degrees of admixture; and also neighbor‐net analysis (Figure 3) provides compelling evidence for “polyploid intermediacy”. Therefore, trees from the nuclear genome – as the reviewer correctly noted – do not show the reticulate patterns and may be even more misleading than cytonuclear trees. We phrased this accordingly to provide the reader with this information.</p><p>Please note: with additional SI Figures numbering changed with the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[3] – Metabolomics –</p><p>I had trouble understanding how these results supported the phylogeographic patterns.
