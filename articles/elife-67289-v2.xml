Previously, we reported a signaling network SiaABCD, which regulates biofilm formation by modulating c-di-GMP level. However, the mechanism for SiaD activation by SiaC remains elusive. Here we determine the crystal structure of SiaC-SiaD-GpCpp complex and revealed a unique mirror symmetric conformation: two SiaD form a dimer with long stalk domains, while four SiaC bind to the conserved motifs on the stalks of SiaD and stabilize the conformation for further enzymatic catalysis. Furthermore, SiaD alone exhibits an inactive pentamer conformation in solution, demonstrating that SiaC activates SiaD through a dynamic mechanism of promoting the formation of active SiaD dimers. Mutagenesis assay confirmed that the stalks of SiaD are necessary for its activation. Together, we reveal a novel mechanism for DGC activation, which clarifies the regulatory networks of c-di-GMP signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SiaD</kwd><kwd>SiaC</kwd><kwd>crystal structure</kwd><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32170188</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Haihua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31870060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Haihua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21722802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Liang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91853118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Liang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31700064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Gukui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ShaanXi Science and Technology Innovation Team</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019TD-016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Haihua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The diguanylate cyclase activity of SiaD is activated by its binding partner SiaC thourgh a dynamic mechanism of promoting the formation of active SiaD dimers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The intracellular messenger cyclic dimeric (3'–5') guanosine monophosphate (cyclic di-GMP or c-di-GMP) is a nearly ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that mediates various physiological aspects of diverse environmental and pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jenal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Römling et al., 2013</xref>). It was first described in 1986 as an allosteric factor that activated cellulose synthase in <italic>Acetobacter xylinum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ross et al., 1987</xref>). To date, c-di-GMP has been shown to regulate the cell cycle, biofilm formation, dispersion, motility, virulence, and other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jenal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Römling et al., 2013</xref>) as well as to promote community interactions during biofilm growth in many Gram-negative bacteria by stimulating the production of exopolysaccharide and adhesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jenal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Simm et al., 2004</xref>). The intracellular c-di-GMP level is controlled by a dynamic balance of synthesis by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs, containing a GGDEF domain) and degradation by specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs, containing EAL or HD-GYP domains) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kulasakara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schmidt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Simm et al., 2004</xref>). Degradation of c-di-GMP by PDEs containing an HD-GYP or EAL domain results in the production of GMP or 5-phosphoguanylyl-(3',5')-guanosine (pGpG), which is further hydrolyzed by oligoribonucleases into two GMP molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Orr et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Multiple DGCs with characteristic GG(D/E)EF domains produce c-di-GMP in response to a variety of environmental stimuli due to the presence of specialized sensory or regulatory domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schirmer, 2016</xref>). Diverse molecular mechanisms have been reported for the activation of DGCs in several bacterial species. Phosphorylation of a DGC by a related kinase promotes its activity, as reported for PleD in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paul et al., 2007</xref>) and WspR in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hickman et al., 2005</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hickman et al., 2005</xref>). The activity of some DGCs is regulated by a partner-switch system (PSS). For example, the activities of both BgrR in <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena et al., 2017</xref>) and HsbD in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Valentini et al., 2016</xref>) are regulated by a STAS domain protein (BgrV or HsbA). Notably, the phosphorylation status of the STAS domain protein is essential to its control of DGC activity. Recently, we elucidated that the DGC activity of SiaD is modulated by its binding partner via direct interaction, whereas phosphorylation of SiaC by the kinase SiaB prevents the SiaC-SiaD interaction and activation of SiaD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Other mechanisms for DGC activation have been also reported. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the DGC DgcZ is regulated allosterically by zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zähringer et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, DgcZ is a substrate for the Sir2 family protein deacetylase CobB. Deacetylation of DgcZ by CobB enhances its activity and thus promotes c-di-GMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the presence of oxygen regulates the DGC activity of SadC via the proteins OdaA and OdaI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the SiaA/B/C/D signaling network regulates biofilm and aggregate formation in response to environmental stimuli. Although we revealed that the DUF1987 domain-containing protein SiaC significantly promotes the DGC activity of SiaD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), the underlying mechanism for SiaD activation remains unclear. In this study, we provide structural, biochemical, and in vivo data to elucidate how the activity of SiaD promoted by its binding partner SiaC. The widespread distribution of DUF1987 domain proteins indicates the significance of this activation mechanism. Hence, we reported a novel and atypical mechanism for DGC activation by its binding partner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The coding sequence of SiaD is redefined and its activity is promoted by the binding partner SiaC via direct interaction</title><p><italic>siaD</italic> is co-transcribed with <italic>siaABC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klebensberger et al., 2009</xref>). The <italic>siaD</italic> gene has been annotated as a 708 bp-length gene initiated with a GTG codon (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pseudomonas.com/">https://www.pseudomonas.com/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klebensberger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Winsor et al., 2016</xref>).

Therefore, we speculated that the coding sequence of <italic>siaD</italic> begins at this ATG codon upstream of the previously annotated GTG codon. To confirm the coding sequence of the <italic>siaD</italic> gene, two plasmids, overexpressing <italic>siaD</italic> or <italic>siaD<sup>ΔN40</sup></italic>, were constructed (pMM-<italic>siaD</italic> and pMM-<italic>siaD<sup>ΔN40</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A biofilm assay showed that the plasmid overexpressing <italic>siaD<sup>ΔN40</sup></italic> failed to restore biofilm formation in the Δ<italic>siaD</italic> mutant. However, biofilm formation in the Δ<italic>siaD</italic> mutant was fully restored by SiaD overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This result suggests that the longer SiaD sequence, but not SiaD<sup>ΔN40</sup>, is the functional form of this protein in vivo. Therefore, we refer to SiaD as the longer protein at the ATG initiation codon henceforth.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SiaC promotes the DGC activity of SiaD through direct interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of the initiation codon and coding sequence of SiaD.

To determine the relationship between SiaC and SiaD, a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay was performed using purified GST-SiaD. The results showed that SiaC was retained with GST-SiaD, but not with GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming the SiaC–SiaD interaction. This observation led us to explore whether SiaC influences the stability of SiaD in vivo. To this end, wild-type PAO1 and Δ<italic>siaC</italic> mutant with the pMMB67EH-<italic>siaD</italic>-flag plasmid were cultured in the presence of 1.0 mM IPTG for 1 hr; 50 μg/ml spectinomycin was added to the medium to block protein synthesis. Samples of bacterial culture were collected at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 hr and subjected to western blotting. Data showed that the stability of SiaD was not influenced by deletion of <italic>siaC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the DGC activity of SiaD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) was evaluated in vitro by measuring the production of c-di-GMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, which showed retention times consistent with those of the GTP and c-di-GMP standards. DGC activities of SiaD both in the presence and absence of SiaC were determined. Consistent with the results for SiaD<sup>ΔN40</sup>, little c-di-GMP was produced when GTP was incubated with SiaD alone. In the presence of SiaC, the production of c-di-GMP increased sharply, suggesting that SiaC promotes the DGC activity of SiaD via direct interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, we found that in the presence of SiaC, the DGC activity of SiaD was significantly greater than that of SiaD<sup>ΔN40</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), which further highlights the importance of amino acids 1–40 of SiaD and accounts for the inability of <italic>siaD<sup>ΔN40</sup></italic> to promote biofilm formation. As SiaC was unable to produce c-di-GMP or enhance the activity of another DGC, WspR, we concluded that interaction with SiaC is essential for the DGC activity of SiaD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Overall structure of the SiaC–SiaD complex reveals a unique binding pattern</title><p>To investigate the regulation of SiaD by SiaC, we determined the crystal structure of full-length SiaD in complex with SiaC.

The stalk and DGC domains of SiaD monomers bind each other in parallel, with a central C2 axis of symmetry, to form a dimer that covers one-third of the SiaD protein surface (4460 Å<sup>2</sup> of 15,159 Å<sup>2</sup>). In contrast to several DGCs (such as WspR and PleD), which employ a functional N-terminal CheY-like domain to specifically receive and respond to signals from upstream pathways, the N-terminal domain of SiaD has no such sensory domain. Instead, the two N-terminal helices (α–1 and α–2) are arranged in an antiparallel fashion with the dimeric coiled-coil composed of α–3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although these short α-helices do not structurally interfere with the binding of SiaC, their deletion significantly diminishes the enzymatic activity of SiaD, suggesting that the N-terminus of SiaD plays a unique and critical role in dynamic catalytic and regulatory processes, rather than sensing upstream signals as reported in other DGCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The DGC domain of SiaD is critical for substrate binding and allosteric inhibition</title><p>In contrast to the N-terminal domain of SiaD, the structure of the C-terminal GGDEF domain of SiaD is highly conserved throughout the DGC family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De et al., 2008</xref>). Two DGC domains in the complex are oriented anti-parallel, with their active sites facing each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Each DGC domain consists of a core canonical fold of five antiparallel β-strands (β1–β5) around which five α-helices (α0–α4) and two short antiparallel β-strands are wrapped (β3ʹ and β3&quot;), forming a highly conserved GTP substrate-binding site (GGDEF domain, A-site) and a c-di-GMP product binding/inhibitory site (I-site).</p><p>The A-sites are located at one end of the GGDEF domain, and predominantly consist of residues from one SiaD monomer, hence there are two A-sites observed in the SiaD dimer complex. Structural and sequence alignment showed that residues involved in binding GTP and ion are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, there was only one GpCpp molecule observed in one of the SiaD A-sites, leaving the other A-site empty. Glutamate was the fourth amino acid of GGDEF, which was considered to be the ‘general base’ and can activate the nucleophile donor of another GGDEF monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hallberg et al., 2019</xref>). By overlapping SiaD-A (containing GpCpp) with the GGDEF domains of <italic>Is</italic>PadC (a DGC structure with catalytic conformation, pdb code: 5LLX), it was observed that the conserved ‘general base’ E182 was still oriented toward the 3’ hydroxyl group from the GpCpp of the opposite monomer, which suggested cooperativity and conservation of SiaD as a catalytic dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Inside the GpCpp bound A-site, GpCpp and an Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion are held in the catalytically competent position through multiple hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with residues inside the pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Moreover, comparing structures of SiaD-A (with GpCpp) and SiaD-B, the interaction between Mg<sup>2+</sup>/GpCpp and several key amino acids leads to deflection of the conformation (D138, E181, K250, and R254), which further stabilizes binding of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the phosphate group of GpCpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Multiple hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions between SiaD and GTP hold the ligand in the active pocket with a K<sub>d</sub> value of 34 µM, while SiaC alone does not bind GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The divalent cation Mg<sup>2+</sup> is essential for DCG catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jenal et al., 2017</xref>). Consistently, we revealed that a divalent cation, Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>, is necessary for SiaD activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, a biofilm assay showed that mutation of key residues involved in binding GTP and Mg2<sup>+</sup> (D138A, D155A, E181A, and K250A/D254A) leads to loss of SiaD function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Notably, these mutated forms of SiaD were well expressed during biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We attempted to purify these SiaD mutant proteins. However, the expressed fusion proteins of SiaD<sup>D155A</sup> and SiaD<sup>K250A–D254A</sup> were present in the form of inclusion bodies. Therefore, only two mutant proteins (SiaD<sup>D138A</sup> and SiaD<sup>E181A</sup>) were purified. HPLC assay results showed that the D138A and E181A mutations significantly impaired the DGC activity of SiaD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Together, these results show that the residues involved in GTP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding are essential for SiaD activity.</p><p>In contrast to the A-site, c-di-GMP product binding/inhibitory site (I-site) is located at the other end of the GGDEF domain, far away from the A-site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The I-site could bind an intercalated c-di-GMP dimer in a pocket, which consists of residues from both of the GGDEF domains that are highly conserved among the DGC family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wassmann et al., 2007</xref>). As for SiaD, each of the I-sites consists of residues located at α3 (R201, P197, and V198), a loop between α3 and β3 (D194, T190, N189, L187), and loop between α2 and β2 (D173, Y172, R170, L169) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that binding of c-di-GMP to the inactive SiaD protein precludes the formation of the 2:4 stoichiometric SiaC–SiaD complex, leading to disordered aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additionally, the enzyme activity of SiaD was inhibited by c-di-GMP more extensively than the SiaC–SiaD complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). SiaD appeared to exist as an oligomer in SEC, as the retention time was shorter than that of the SiaC–SiaD complex. Subsequently, mutation of the primary I-site (R201A) restored the SiaC–SiaD interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and promoted the DGC activity of SiaD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistently, overexpression of the R201A mutation significantly promoted biofilm formation compared to that of SiaD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In the active state (SiaC–SiaD complex), the addition of excess c-di-GMP did not alter the retention time or peak appearance of the SiaC–SiaD complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that the SiaC–SiaD complex retains its 2:4 conformation. However, addition of c-di-GMP inhibited, albeit moderately, activity of the SiaC–SiaD complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, this inhibition was eliminated by the R201A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the protein thermal shift assay (PTSA) showed that the binding of c-di-GMP to the I-site of the DGC domain promotes protein stability of SiaD, whereas the binding modes for SiaD and SiaC–SiaD complex may be different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, both the active and inactive forms of SiaD are inhibited by c-di-GMP, suggesting two distinct inhibitory modes for active and inactive SiaD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Feedback inhibition of I-site of SiaD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of I-sites between SiaD and PleD dimer.

Consistent with the SEC-MALS results, the calculated model intensity of a SiaD pentamer predicted by the GalaxyHomomer server fitted well to the experimental SAXS data, with a discrepancy χ<sup>2</sup> value of 1.116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The ab initio data showed good consistency (normalized standard deviation = 1.486 ± 0.186) and improved ensemble resolution of 65 ± 5 Å with no symmetry added in reconstruction. By contrast, the experimental PDDF and the parabolic dimensionless Kratky plots for SiaD exhibited a nearly perfect symmetric peak, indicating that SiaD adopts a spherical and single domain conformation in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Furthermore, the SiaD radius of gyration (Rg = 41.53 ± 0.14 Å) and the maximum particle dimension (Dmax = 127.8 Å) based on SAXS data are similar to those of the complex (44.54 ± 0.17 Å and 134.8 Å, respectively), indicating a larger SiaD oligomer than a dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). The estimated molecular weight of the SiaD oligomer in solution is 159.5 kD, which is near the theoretical molecular weight of the SiaD pentamer (157.3 kD). Additionally, the pentamer oligomer conformation of SiaD alone was confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, a low-resolution particle model was reconstructed from the SAXS experimental profiles. The model showed a circular dish-like shape, with five SiaD monomers well fitted into the particle model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Notably, the particle model does not accommodate a model with an extended stalk conformation from the complex, as it is too long. Alternatively, SiaD adopts a compact N-terminal conformation, with the extended stalk domain reduced to five short helices and two β-strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Then, the secondary structure of SiaD in its active or inactive state was analyzed by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. To characterize the variations in the secondary structure for SiaD, we tracked CD signals by gradually increasing the SiaC concentration. The CD data suggested that the α-helix increased, while the beta-sheet decreased during SiaD activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>), which supports the model showing that inactive SiaD adopts a compact N-terminal conformation. These biochemical and biophysical results suggest that SiaD may undergo three steps of conformational change upon SiaC binding and activation: pentamer deoligomerization, reconstruction of the SiaD N-terminal stalk domain, and SiaD dimerization with SiaC binding.</p><p>In conclusion, our results redefine the SiaD operon and reveal the dynamic regulatory mechanism of SiaD by SiaC in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Dynamic switching between the inactive pentamer and active dimer is regulated by SiaC: SiaC induces deoligomerization of the inactive SiaD pentamer and binds to the two conserved motifs in the stalk domain of the reconstructed active SiaD dimer to stabilize its conformation for further catalysis. Phosphorylation of SiaC T68 by the kinase SiaB prevents this binding and thereby shuts down the enzymatic activity of SiaD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that SiaC stimulates the DGC activity of SiaD through direct interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Here, we discovered that SiaD alone has an inactive pentamer conformation, whereas binding of SiaC to its stalk region promotes the formation of an active dimer. DGC catalyzes the condensation of two identical substrate molecules of GTP to form the twofold symmetric c-di-GMP product. As the DGC domain binds only one substrate, DGC activity relies on an oligomerization event that brings two GGDEF domains into close proximity. The formation of distinct oligomeric states contributes to both the activation and auto-inhibition of DGCs. Oligomerization is involved in the modulation of WspR activity through the switch from an active to a product-inhibited dimer via tetrameric assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De et al., 2008</xref>). The activity of WspR is modulated by a helical stalk motif, which is a key regulatory element for oligomerization activation and auto-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, our SiaC–SiaD complex structure contained a long helical stalk of SiaD, which is essential for SiaD modulation through the SiaC–SiaD interaction and SiaD dimer formation. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paul et al., 2007</xref> reported that a dimer conformation represents the enzymatically active state of PleD. Modulation of its active aspartate residue with the phosphoryl analog BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leads to stabilization of the PleD dimer, which is the catalytically active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wassmann et al., 2007</xref>). Several lines of evidence have indicated that SiaD has a pentamer conformation. Upon SiaC binding, the compact N-terminus turns into a extended stalk domain and a SiaD dimer forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, the in vitro assay showed that SiaD alone exhibited negligible DGC activity, but such activity was drastically promoted upon SiaC binding, indicating that switching to the dimer conformation with the aid of SiaC is critical for SiaD activation.</p><p>Conformation-induced activation has also been observed in other diguanylate cyclase families, such as the LapD-GcbC system in <italic>Pseudomonas,</italic> where sensing and binding to c-di-GMP leads to conformational changes that trigger the signal transduction across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dahlstrom et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giacalone et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the critical conformation changes are predominantly supported and regulated by the long coiled coil regions for stabilization of the GGDEF domain homodimers, such as Zn-dependent activation of DgcZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zähringer et al., 2013</xref>) and the red light activated bacteriophytochrome diguanylyl cyclase PadC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>). However, the SiaD<sub>5</sub> to SiaD<sub>2</sub>-SiaC<sub>4</sub> conformation switch, as well as the stabilization of the long stalk region by four SiaC, redefines this family. Two SiaC binding motifs are located at the N-terminal stalk of SiaD. It is possible that SiaC binds sites in a sequential manner. However, the amino acid sequences of the two SiaC-binding motif are highly conserved, and the ITC experiments showed a continuous ‘S’ curve for SiaC–SiaD binding, indicating that there was no significant difference in affinity between the two binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Subsequently, our mutagenesis study showed that the two SiaC-binding motif mutations still resulted in the formation of the SiaC–SiaD complex, making it difficult to clarify their individual roles.</p><p>Product inhibition represents another layer of DGC modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De et al., 2008</xref>). Product feedback inhibition of DGCs may establish precise cellular threshold concentrations of c-di-GMP available to be read by downstream targets. Meanwhile, the product inhibition allows for a rapid enzymatic response to environmental fluctuations in that the rate of c-di-GMP synthesis can be manipulated without having to translate or degrade a given DGC. Many of the DGCs are subject to non-competitive product inhibition through the binding of c-di-GMP to the allosteric I-site on the surface of the GGDEF domain. In PleD and WspR, an intercalated c-di-GMP dimer binds the primary I-site and a secondary I-site, thereby immobilizing the GGDEF domains in a non-catalytic state (inhibition by domain immobilization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De et al., 2008</xref>). For PleD, two modes of product inhibition have been proposed. In inactive PleD, the primary I-site cross-linked to the secondary I-site of the REC2 domain stabilizes an inactive conformation. In active PleD, dimeric c-di-GMP cross-links the primary I-site with a secondary I-site on the neighboring DGC domain to immobilize the active sites away from each other. Analogously, in this study, we revealed two distinct inhibitory modes for SiaD. In the inactive state, c-di-GMP inhibits SiaD activity by preventing the formation of the SiaC–SiaD complex. Since SiaD has a canonical primary I-site and an arginine-rich N-terminus, it is possible that c-di-GMP inhibits SiaD by cross-linking the GGDEF and N-terminal domains to prevent dimerization (activated state) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christen et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, tge PTSA showed that the binding mode of c-di-GMP may differ between inactive and active SiaD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the active state, c-di-GMP did not destabilize the 2:4 stoichiometric conformation, but inhibited DGC activity. The secondary I-site on the GGDEF domain (R125 for SiaD, and R313 for PleD) is conserved among SiaD and PleD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We deduced that the intercalated c-di-GMP dimer inhibits SiaD activity in a manner analogous to that of PleD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wassmann et al., 2007</xref>), and the rotation of the paired GGDEF domains in the SiaC–SiaD complex may be facilitated by the flexible linkers that connect the N-terminal stalk and GGDEF domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Modulation of activity has been reported for several DGCs, including WspR, PleD, and DgcB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hickman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meek et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, protein phosphorylation plays a critical role during DGC modulation, as WspR, PleD and DgcB are all activated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hickman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meek et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paul et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this function, we have shown that protein phosphorylation plays a central role in the modulation of SiaD activity. However, apparent differences in DGC activation can be observed between SiaD and WspR or PleD. First, the phosphorylation site of SiaC (threonine) differs from that of WspR or PleD (aspartate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Second, WspR and PleD are activated by phosphorylation, whereas phosphorylation of SiaC prevents the SiaC–SiaD interaction, and thus SiaD activation. Most importantly, SiaD does not contain a N-terminal sensory domain to specifically receive phosphate group from upstream pathways, and therefore modulation of SiaD activity is facilitated by phosphorylation of its binding partner SiaC, with SiaC functioning as a sensory domain of SiaD. The biological significance of the mode of SiaD activation is interesting and confusing. At present, it remains unclear why bacteria encode an extra binding protein for DGC activation. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the biological significance of this phenomenon.</p><p>Bacterial PSSs constitute regulatory modules that act through reversible protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation events. PSSs are reportedly involved in modulation of DGC activity. In <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the activity of DGC HsbD was modulated by the HptB-HptR-HsbA PSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Valentini et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the BgrSTUWV PSS modulates the activity of DGC BgrR in <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena et al., 2017</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena et al., 2017</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena et al., 2017</xref>). The DGC activities of HsbD and BgrR are modulated by their STAS-domain binding partners HsbA and BrgV. We revealed that SiaD is modulated by SiaABC PSS. Interestingly, its binding partner SiaC contains a domain of unknown function, DUF1987, which is structurally related to the STAS domain of HsbA or BrgV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). As the DUF1987 domain is widespread among bacteria, we suggest that a common function of DUF1987 domain-containing proteins is modulating the activity of adjacent proteins.</p><p>Overall, we have provided structural details of the mechanism through which SiaC activates SiaD function and thus biofilm development in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. These structural data provide the molecular basis for SiaC–mediated conformation changes of SiaD from the inactive pentamer to active dimer form, which supports the elucidation of the functions of DUF1987 domains in other bacteria. Based on the data from this and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), we propose a model of SiaD modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel mechanism of DGC activation by a binding partner protein. The phosphatase SiaA and kinase SiaB modulate the phosphorylation state of SiaC. Phosphorylation of SiaC precludes the SiaC–SiaD interaction, whereas unphosphorylated SiaC directly interacts with the stalk of SiaD, facilitating its conformational transition from inactive pentamer to active dimer to synthesize c-di-GMP. High levels of c-di-GMP then repress SiaD activity via I-sites through two distinct modes. Through modulation of the DGC activity of SiaD, bacteria can rapidly respond and adapt to environmental changes. Moreover, this unique regulatory model expands our general understanding of GGDEF modulation and provides a new starting point for elucidating the molecular mechanisms responsible for modulation of the DGC family.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for SiaC-mediated activation of SiaD.</title><p>Without SiaC binding (depletion or phosphorylation of SiaC), SiaD alone forms an inactive pentamer conformation in solution.

The SAXS data under various concentrations showed highly similarity and the data from 8 mg/ml SiaD or 11 mg/ml SiaC–SiaD complex were further analyzed. The scattered X-ray photons were recorded with a PILATUS 1 M detector (Dectris, Switzerland) at BL19U2. The setups were adjusted to achieve scattering q values of 0.009 &lt; q &lt; 0.45 Å<sup>−1</sup>, where q = (4π/λ)sinθ, and 2θ is the scattering angle. The working energy is 13.43 keV (λ = 0.923 Å). 150 μl of protein sample was injected, and 1.5 s exposures were collected in succession. 2D scattering images were converted to 1D SAXS curves by the software package BioXTAS RAW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hopkins et al., 2017</xref>). Scattering profiles of the proteins were calculated by subtracting the background buffer contribution from the sample-buffer profile. Program PRIMUS was used to perform Guinier analysis of the low q data, which provides an estimate of the radius of gyration (Rg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Konarev et al., 2003</xref>). Regularized indirect transforms of the scattering data were carried out with the program GNOM to obtain P(r) functions of interatomic distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Svergun, 1992</xref>). The P(r) function has a maximum at the most probable intermolecular distance and goes to zero at Dmax, the maximum intramolecular distance. The values of Dmax were chosen to fit with the experimental data and to have a positive P(r) function. The volume of correlation (Vc) was calculated using the program RAW, and the molecular weights of solutes were calculated on a relative scale using the Rg/Vc power law developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rambo and Tainer, 2013</xref>, independently of protein concentration and with minimal user bias.

The aligned structures were then averaged, giving an effective occupancy to each voxel in the model, and filtered at half-maximal occupancy to produce models of the appropriate volume that were used for all subsequent analyses. For SiaC–SiaD complex, although the experimental data fitted well with the crystal structure (CRYSOL<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>=1.388), all the models were variety in terms of agreement with the experimental data due to the multiple domains. For SiaD, with no symmetry added in reconstruct, the ab initio has good consistency (NSD = 1.163 ± 0.109) and better ensemble resolution 51 ± 4 Å. When using fivefold symmetry, the influence of the anisometry condition increased the ensemble variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tuukkanen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>For Homology Modeling using SAXS Data, SiaD pentamer structure was predicted from a monomer sequence using GalaxyHomomer server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baek et al., 2017</xref>).

First, two rounds of operations were performed independently, and ten models were obtained. Second, the models were ranked according to the agreement with the experimental scattering profiles using CRYSOL. Finally, less reliable loop or terminal regions of the best model were re-modeled.

The contribution of the buffer was substracted. As SiaC conformation has no significant change in SiaC–SiaD complex compared to its native structure, the CD signal of SiaC control was substracted from that of the corresponding SiaD–SiaC mixture sample to obtain the CD spectra of SiaD in mixture sample.

After the activation of the surface using NHS and EDC (1:1, v/v), the protein was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (GE healthcare) by using standard amine-coupling at 25°C with buffer PBS-P (20 mM phosphate buffer, 2.7 mM NaCl, 137 mM KCl, 0.05% surfactant P-20, pH 7.4). The protein concentration was fixed at 50 ng/μl and the immobilization level of protein was about 5000 RU (response unit, 1 RU response value is roughly equivalent to 1 pg/mm<sup>2</sup> change of the concentration of the bound substance on the chip surface). After coupling, unreacted NHS ester groups were blocked with ethanolamine. After equilibration by running buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% surfactant P-20, pH 7.5), different concentrations of analytes were serially injected into the channel to evaluate the binding kinetic parameters. A reference channel was only activated and blocked to eliminate compound unspecific binding to the surface of the chip. An extra wash with 2 mM NaCl was added to remove the last remaining sample in the pipeline.

cyclase, an enzyme that controls bacterial biofilm formation, by its binding partner protein. The work also assigns a molecular function to DUF1987 domains that also occur in other bacterial proteins, potentially suggesting a similar mode of partner-protein regulation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural basis for diguanylate cyclase activation by its binding partner in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Holger Sondermann as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Based on an illuminating structure-function study, a novel mechanism is uncovered for the activation of a bacterial diguanylate cyclase that controls biofilm formation in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> via the production of the second messenger c-di-GMP. By providing structural models for activated and autoinhibited states of the enzyme and revealing how the enzyme transitions between them through the action of a binding partner, a convincing model is put forward that could pave the way for comparative studies on proteins with similar folds and regulation.</p><p>The structure determinations by X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering were thorough and their interpretation convincing. Quantitative binding, enzyme activity and biofilm assays provide further validation of the proposed model and are consistent with the structural analysis. Although the reviewers were enthusiastic about the study that provides first insight into a novel concept of diguanylate cyclase activation, a few key areas were identified, which are crucial aspects of the activation model and for which further support would strengthen the mechanistic arguments. Thus, the reviewers felt unanimously that a deeper characterization of the following points would be within the scope of the present study and were viewed as being essential.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A central feature of the activation model is the stabilization of a SiaD dimer by four molecules of SiaC. A mutagenesis study of the two individual SiaC binding sites on SiaD would likely provide insight into the cooperativity of the activation process and may reveal an order of events or relative importance of the binding sites. As readout, enzyme activity (c-di-GMP production) could be correlated with complex formation (via multi-angle laser light scattering). Please also comment whether SiaC is monomeric or dimeric in solution in the absence of SiaD.</p><p>2. A particular regulatory feature of a subset of diguanylate cyclases, including SiaD, is product inhibition via a distinct c-di-GMP binding site. The authors identified such a site on SiaD and demonstrate that c-di-GMP inhibits SiaD (albeit at fairly high second messenger concentration). Considering the central role of inhibitory-site regulation in diguanylate cyclase regulation and c-di-GMP signaling networks, a more thorough analysis of this site on SiaD would be warranted. Minimally, the impact of inhibitory-site mutations on <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> biofilm formation, SiaD activation and SiaD-SiaC complex stability should be assessed. A central question is whether c-di-GMP binding to the allosteric, inhibitory site destabilizes the SiaC-SiaD complex.</p><p>3. Central to the model of SiaD activation is the restructuring of the N-terminal domain of the enzyme, from an apparent globular fold containing β-strands to a long, extended helix. However, data supporting this transition is sparse. One way to potentially clarify this mechanism is to perform Circular Dichroism (CD) to determine the secondary structure and folding properties of SiaD in the presence and absence of SiaC.</p><p>Essential textual changes were summarized elsewhere.</p><p>Addressing these points would substantially strengthen the conclusion of the study, providing a more complete model of SiaD regulation and bacterial biofilm formation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Signaling via the bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP has emerged as a major pathway to control cellular physiology, foremost in the transition from a free-swimming to a sessile, social lifestyle. The production of c-di-GMP in bacteria is catalyzed by GGDEF domain-containing enzymes that act as diguanylate cyclases. Their activity is regulated by various mechanisms, but for many we lack structural insight of how this activity modulation is achieved. The manuscript by Chen et al. describes an interesting molecular mechanism responsible for the activation of a diguanylate cyclase in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, SiaD, by its binding partner protein, SiaC. Based on structural analyses of a catalytically active SiaC-SiaD complex bound to a GTP analog and an autoinhibited SiaD, the authors deduce a mechanism by which four SiaC proteins stabilize an elongated, dimeric conformation of SiaD, positioning the GGDEF domains within the dimer for catalysis. In contrast, the inactive state appears to be a homo-pentamer, with each SiaD protomer adopting a more globular fold. Binding studies and biofilm assays involving structure-guided mutant variants of the proteins further support the proposed mechanism.</p><p>The observed protein-protein interaction via a protein of unknown function, the DUF1987 domain, may be a diverse mechanism of diguanylate cyclase modulation that might be widespread among bacteria and could control other enzymes in a similar fashion. The present study could form the basis for investigating the function of other DUF1987 domain-containing proteins by providing a first model for an activation mechanism. The work also extends the group's previous finding that SiaC is regulated by phosphorylation, reversing the activation effect.</p><p>In summary, the present study is sound and provides new insights into a diguanylate cyclase activation mechanism by a binding partner protein with more general implications for GGDEF regulation and DUF1987 function. The work should be of great interest to a broad audience including the communities interested in cyclic dinucleotide signaling, structural biology, and microbiology.</p><p>To further improve the manuscript's quality and clarity, we would recommend addressing the following points. There are three points that, in our opinion, require more effort:</p><p>1. The authors conclude that SiaD is a pentamer in the absence of SiaC. This is an important finding since SiaC would need to destabilize this oligomer, stabilizing an alternative, dimeric SiaD conformation, which ultimately poises the GGDEF domains for catalysis. To corroborate this hypothesis, the authors have done an extensive study using SAXS, SEC-MALS, and blue-native PAGE experiments. However, what remains somewhat enigmatic is how SiaC gains access to its binding sites on SiaD, which appear to be non-accessible in the inactive SiaD pentamer. Hence, an improved characterization of SiaD in presence and absence of SiaC is critically important. Specific questions are:</p><p>– It is not clear why no SEC-MALS experiments were reported for the SiaC/SiaD complex. Given that the method provided insight into the autoinhibited SiaD oligomer, one may argue that it could also support the formation and activation path (e.g., through SiaC titration experiments) to an active SiaD complex. Given the stoichiometry of the active complex and refolding of the central SiaD stalk, one may also expect cooperativity as part of the SiaC-SiaD mechanism, which was not explored here.</p><p>– The authors have performed blue-native PAGE analysis to observe oligomerization of SiaD and SiaD-SiaC complex formation (Figure Supplement 13) and conclude that SiaD may undergo three steps of conformational change upon SiaC binding and activation (i.e., pentamer deoligomerization, reconstruction of the SiaD N-terminal stalk domain, and finally SiaD dimerization with SiaC binding). However, their experiments do not sufficiently substantiate this claim. There are some caveats with this experiment that deserve attention: i. The blue-native PAGE gel lane corresponding to SiaC alone does not show any specific protein? Why is that? What was the concentration of SiaC alone used here? ii. The lane that corresponds to SiaC/SiaD complex does not indicate intermediate species (e.g., SiaD monomer, dimer, trimer or tetramer; or excess SiaC). Thus, the data does not directly support a multi-step process. Titration experiments may provide some resolution of the individual steps of SiaD activation. iii. Some technical details should be reported: How long was the SiaC-SiaD mixture incubated before electrophoresis? What are the kinetics of SiaC-SiaD complex formation? A time-course experiment could provide further insight into the steps leading to SiaD activation and thus providing justification for the proposed mechanism.</p><p>2. SEC-SAXS experiments were performed to gain insight into the autoinhibited oligomer of SiaD. Interestingly, the low-resolution SiaD particle model (Figure 4F) would not accommodate a pentameric SiaD with extended stalks as seen in the active-state crystal structure. To fit SiaD into the particle model, the authors have proposed an alternative model of SiaD, which includes a compact conformation of the N-terminal motifs, with the extended stalk domain reduced to five short helices and two β- strands (Figure 4F). Key parameters of how this model was derived were not specified:</p><p>– Please share (e.g., in the Material and Methods section) how monomeric SiaD homology modeling was performed (including the modeling of the specific N-terminal fold).</p><p>– The authors propose that SiaC induces deoligomerization of the inactive SiaD pentamer and binds to the two conserved motifs in the reconstructed, active SiaD dimer stalk to stabilize its conformation for further catalysis. There are several caveats pertaining to these conclusions. i. No experimental data is provided that demonstrate the loss of two β-strands during SiaC interaction and the increase of helical content. ii. It is unclear how the binding of SiaC helps to fold an extended stalk. One way to potentially clarify this mechanism is to perform Circular Dichroism (CD) to determine the secondary structure and folding properties of SiaD in the presence and absence of SiaC. Mutation of single SiaC-binding sites on SiaD could inform whether there is a particular order of binding, leading to distinct steps in the activation mechanism. For example, it could answer whether there is one particular site on the SiaD stalk that is exposed in the inactive pentamer, where SiaC binding could lead to pentamer disassembly. Such experiments would strengthen the interpretation of the results and provide support for the proposed regulatory mechanism. In general, a more detailed discussion of the activation model is warranted.</p><p>3. The fact that diguanylate cyclase activity of SiaD could be inhibited by c-di-GMP (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) suggests the I-sites of SiaD exists and is functional. However, the model has not been confirmed experimentally (e.g., through site-directed mutagenesis) and the structural basis of c-di-GMP binding is not clear as SiaD would have to adopt an alternative conformation for the completion of a proper I-site pocket.</p><p>– Specifically, we wonder what a c-di-GMP-inhibited SiaD conformation may look like. Does c-di-GMP revert SiaD back to a pentamer? What is the relative location of the I-sites in the modeled pentamer?</p><p>– Some diguanylate cyclases have been reported to be inhibited by product binding to the active site. A targeted mutagenesis study impacting the I-site would confirm that c-di-GMP inhibition is indeed involving the I-site of SiaD. Relevant to this, figure supplement 3 states usage of 50 mM c-di-GMP as inhibitor in the kinetic assays. This seems to be an extremely high concentration. At that concentration, one cannot rule out that the active site is impacted as well (i.e., competition with substrate GTP).</p><p>– Is c-di-GMP binding compatible with SiaC binding, or does it destabilize the active state? Answers to these questions could come from assays already established here, for example SEC-MALS and/or SEC-SAXS in the presence of c-di-GMP. Also, the complexes pulled-down by GST could be challenged with c-di-GMP to assess, where the cyclic dinucleotide affects complex stability. Such experiments could be viewed as important additions to the present study as I-site-mediated inhibition is an integral regulatory mechanism in diguanylate cyclases. The analysis seems feasible and could provide more insight into the oligomerization transitions of SiaD.</p><p>4. The chapter &gt;The DGC domain of SiaD is critical for substrate binding&lt; (lines 167-229) can be shortened considerably since many high-resolution crystal structures of GGDEF domain-containing proteins have been described in detail in the literature and SiaD follows suit. Likewise, it has already been established that divalent cations bind to a specific site on the GGDEF domains and are important for catalysis. Hence, this entire chapter could be reduced to a few sentences pointing out that SiaD is conserved with regard to these features.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors detail the mechanism of activation of the diguanylate cyclase SiaD by a partner protein SiaC. This work pertains to the production of cyclic-di-GMP that governs biofilm formation in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>SiaD and related divergent cyclases require a dimeric state to become active, often achieved through stimulus binding to a sensory domain. In this particular case the authors use structural biology and related biochemical experiments to reveal that SiaD activation is driven by SiaC (in its unphosphorylated form) binding to two regions on a helical stalk domain of SiaD. This binding (in a 4:2 stoichiometry) encourages productive dimerization of SiaD (complexed here with a substrate analogue in one of the active sites – an interesting finding but unrelated to the activation process). This model is corroborated by mutants of SiaC (at the SiaC:SiaD interface) unable to bind SiaD and thus unable to form biofilm.</p><p>The model additionally benefits from characterisation of non-activated SiaD, via a lower resolution SAXs model, that reveals a pentameric non-catalytic conformation. This does support the above but is more open to interpretation, whereas a higher resolution (atomic) model would make the details of the unactivated state more certain.</p><p>The structural biology elements of the manuscript are technically sound and explain the mechanism of activation to a strong degree (hence the authors achieve many of the goals set out to understand this system although a few points remain). The outcome of SiaD stimulation by SiaC represents the first case in the literature of characterization of a cyclase activated by a partner protein; this makes the manuscript of fair interest to the c-di-GMP field, even in the cases where bacteria use a different means of activation.</p><p>The SiaC:SiaD model should guide the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> field and find use in the design of variants to probe c-di-GMP signalling.</p><p>I would like the writing / phrasing to be tightened throughout – there are quite a few errors too numerous to list here.</p><p>The science therein details activation of a system particular to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and related strains – because it is not immediately relevant to a broader audience I would suggest that it would benefit the study to have a higher degree of characterisation. To my mind this could come from one of two points:</p><p>– a high resolution form of the unactivated pentameric state that would reveal key contacts (that would be more useful to others in field than a low resolution envelope model).</p><p>OR</p><p>– mutagenesis of the two different SiaC sites present on SiaD. At present, the mutagenesis focusses on SiaC but instead I was left wondering what the consequences would be if the two SiaC sites on the stalk was reduced to a single site via mutation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper seeks to elucidate the structure and mechanism by which the diguanylate cyclase SiaD from the bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is activated by the protein partner switch SiaC. Previously, the same authors showed that SiaC directly activates SiaD to produce cyclic di-GMP, but phosphorylation of SiaC by SiaB represses this activity. The specific questions the authors tackled in this study are: (1) how does SiaC bind to SiaD to activate diguanylate cyclase activity? (2) how does phosphorylation of SiaC prevent binding and activation? (3) what is the inactive conformation of SiaD?</p><p>Major strengths include the structure of the SiaD-SiaC complex, which revealed that SiaC binds as a dimer in two places on an α helical 'stalk' of SiaD, which is in an alternate conformation in the absence of SiaC. This may be the first structure of an active diguanylate cyclase enzyme in complex with its protein binding partner. The structure specifically shows how phosphorylation of SiaC prevents binding to SiaD and led to identification of two homologous binding sites for SiaC on the stalk.</p><p>Another major strength was the characterization of SiaD. A critical point was determination of the correct coding sequence with additional 40 aa at the N-terminus. SAXS analysis revealed that SiaD forms an inactive pentamer in the absence of SiaC. Throughout, the structural analyses were supported by biochemical methods as well as in vivo biofilm assays of mutants.</p><p>One major weakness in the paper is the section on the DGC domain of SiaD. The analysis is written as if there were no prior analyses of GGDEF domains, so is missing a lot of important context that the authors need to include. Another major weakness is there are inconsistencies or gaps in some of the description of the structural analyses of SiaD and SiaC on their own.</p><p>The significance of this work relates to the importance of DGC enzymes in regulating cyclic di-GMP levels, which controls biofilm and colonization phenotypes in almost all bacteria. The structure of this complex may serve as a paradigm for other protein partner switch-DGC systems.</p><p>1) DGC analysis: It should be made clear whether the observed interactions are the same or different than other GTP bound or GpCpp bound GGDEF structures. Furthermore, the authors did not compare the GpCpp versus no ligand bound GGDEF domains in their structure, and did not analyze the catalytic residues, even though activation of the enzyme is the key feature. Please see https://elifesciences.org/articles/43959: is the conserved general base oriented for catalysis in the SiaD-SiaC complex?</p><p>2) For SiaD, please explain how the alternate conformation of the N-terminal region of SiaD in absence of SiaC was determined or modeled.</p><p>3) For SiaC, the authors should determine whether it forms a dimer on its own or dimerizes in the presence of SiaD.</p><p>4) The authors are inconsistent in their description of SiaC. On one hand, it has a homologous structure to STAS proteins, on the other hand, it contains a domain of unknown function, DUF1987, and has a unique fold. Perhaps the line of reasoning is that their results show that DUF1987 domains are structurally related to STAS domains; if so, this should be more clearly stated.</p><p>5) Along these lines, is the N-terminal domain of SiaD a DUF or other conserved domain class? This would strengthen the significance of the paper: if the SiaD-SiaC interaction domains are both conserved, then this structure could serve as the paradigm.</p><p>6) The manuscript main text includes a lot of structural description that are mostly listing AA residues, which are redundant with the figures themselves. Please consider revising to focus on reporting the results (what the data mean) rather than describing the data itself. In addition, some of the non-structural figures are made so small that the graph labels are almost illegible.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67289.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Accordingly, the key residues (S50, Q54 and S82, Q86) of the two SiaC binding sites on SiaD stalk have been mutated into alanine, respectively. Further SEC and SEC-MALS assays showed that both SiaD<sup>S82A-Q86A</sup> and SiaD<sup>S50A-Q54A</sup> were able to form complex with SiaC. However, the stability of SiaC-SiaD<sup>S82A-Q86A</sup> complex turns to be worse and the complex partially dissociated after overnight incubation, indicating that the SiaC binding site of SiaD that is proximal to GGDEF domain (S82, Q86) is more critical for the maintenance of the SiaC-SiaD complex (<italic>Figure 5C</italic>). Furthermore, in vitro activity assays showed that the enzyme activity of SiaD<sup>S82A-Q86A</sup>, but not SiaD<sup>S50A-Q54A</sup>, was significantly lower than that of wild type SiaD in the presence of SiaC (<italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 1</italic>). Consistently, biofilm formation experiment showed that overexpression of SiaD<sup>S50A-Q54A</sup> restored the biofilm formation of Δ<italic>siaD</italic> mutant.

A particular regulatory feature of a subset of diguanylate cyclases, including SiaD, is product inhibition via a distinct c-di-GMP binding site. The authors identified such a site on SiaD and demonstrate that c-di-GMP inhibits SiaD (albeit at fairly high second messenger concentration). Considering the central role of inhibitory-site regulation in diguanylate cyclase regulation and c-di-GMP signaling networks, a more thorough analysis of this site on SiaD would be warranted. Minimally, the impact of inhibitory-site mutations on Pseudomonas biofilm formation, SiaD activation and SiaD-SiaC complex stability should be assessed.

The production of c-di-GMP in bacteria is catalyzed by GGDEF domain-containing enzymes that act as diguanylate cyclases. Their activity is regulated by various mechanisms, but for many we lack structural insight of how this activity modulation is achieved. The manuscript by Chen et al. describes an interesting molecular mechanism responsible for the activation of a diguanylate cyclase in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, SiaD, by its binding partner protein, SiaC. Based on structural analyses of a catalytically active SiaC-SiaD complex bound to a GTP analog and an autoinhibited SiaD, the authors deduce a mechanism by which four SiaC proteins stabilize an elongated, dimeric conformation of SiaD, positioning the GGDEF domains within the dimer for catalysis. In contrast, the inactive state appears to be a homo-pentamer, with each SiaD protomer adopting a more globular fold. Binding studies and biofilm assays involving structure-guided mutant variants of the proteins further support the proposed mechanism.</p><p>The observed protein-protein interaction via a protein of unknown function, the DUF1987 domain, may be a diverse mechanism of diguanylate cyclase modulation that might be widespread among bacteria and could control other enzymes in a similar fashion. The present study could form the basis for investigating the function of other DUF1987 domain-containing proteins by providing a first model for an activation mechanism. The work also extends the group's previous finding that SiaC is regulated by phosphorylation, reversing the activation effect.</p><p>In summary, the present study is sound and provides new insights into a diguanylate cyclase activation mechanism by a binding partner protein with more general implications for GGDEF regulation and DUF1987 function. The work should be of great interest to a broad audience including the communities interested in cyclic dinucleotide signaling, structural biology, and microbiology.</p><p>To further improve the manuscript's quality and clarity, we would recommend addressing the following points. While these are mostly minor issues, there are three points that, in our opinion, require more effort:</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the positive evaluation for our manuscript. The constructive comments and suggestions have helped us improve the quantity of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors conclude that SiaD is a pentamer in the absence of SiaC. This is an important finding since SiaC would need to destabilize this oligomer, stabilizing an alternative, dimeric SiaD conformation, which ultimately poises the GGDEF domains for catalysis. To corroborate this hypothesis, the authors have done an extensive study using SAXS, SEC-MALS, and blue-native PAGE experiments. However, what remains somewhat enigmatic is how SiaC gains access to its binding sites on SiaD, which appear to be non-accessible in the inactive SiaD pentamer. Hence, an improved characterization of SiaD in presence and absence of SiaC is critically important. Specific questions are:</p><p>– It is not clear why no SEC-MALS experiments were reported for the SiaC/SiaD complex. Given that the method provided insight into the autoinhibited SiaD oligomer, one may argue that it could also support the formation and activation path (e.g., through SiaC titration experiments) to an active SiaD complex. Given the stoichiometry of the active complex and refolding of the central SiaD stalk, one may also expect cooperativity as part of the SiaC-SiaD mechanism, which was not explored here.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We had supplemented the SEC-MALS results of SiaC-SiaD complex. The results showed that the molecular weight of the complex was 120 kD, which was completely matched with the data of SAXS and crystal structure (<italic>Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</italic>).</p><p>To identify the role of the two SiaC-binding sites during SiaD activation and to get insight into the formation and activation path to an active SiaD complex, the key residues (S50, Q54 and S82, Q86) of the two SiaC binding sites on SiaD stalk have been mutated into alanine, respectively. Further SEC and SEC-MALS assays showed that both SiaD<sup>S82A-Q86A</sup> and SiaD<sup>S50A-Q54A</sup> were able to form complex with SiaC. However, the stability of SiaC-SiaD<sup>S82A-Q86A</sup> complex turns to be worse and the complex partially dissociated after overnight incubation, indicating that the SiaC binding site of SiaD that is proximal to GGDEF domain (S82, Q86) is more critical for the maintenance of the SiaC-SiaD complex (<italic>Figure 5C</italic>). Furthermore, in vitro activity assays showed that the enzyme activity of SiaD<sup>S82A-Q86A</sup>, but not SiaD<sup>S50A-Q54A</sup>, was significantly lower than that of wild type SiaD in the presence of SiaC (<italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 1</italic>).

However, their experiments do not sufficiently substantiate this claim. There are some caveats with this experiment that deserve attention: i. The blue-native PAGE gel lane corresponding to SiaC alone does not show any specific protein? Why is that?

The SiaD-SiaC was incubated for 30 minutes before electrophoresis. To get insight into the process for SiaD activation beside from the blue-PAGE data, we performed a series of circular dichroism spectrum experiments by gradually increasing the concentration of SiaC from 0 to 16 μM (Materials and methods). The CD data suggested that the numbers of α-helix increased, while the numbers of β-sheet decreased during SiaD activation (Figure 6-figure 6—figure supplement 3 and table S5), which supports the model that inactivated SiaD adopts a more compact N-terminal conformation. In addition, the ITC titration experiments showed a continuous “S” curve for SiaC-SiaD binding, indicating that there was no significant difference in affinity between the two binding sites (Figure 4G). we considered that there was no certain order for SiaC binding to these two sites on the stalk.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. SEC-SAXS experiments were performed to gain insight into the autoinhibited oligomer of SiaD. Interestingly, the low-resolution SiaD particle model (Figure 4F) would not accommodate a pentameric SiaD with extended stalks as seen in the active-state crystal structure. To fit SiaD into the particle model, the authors have proposed an alternative model of SiaD, which includes a compact conformation of the N-terminal motifs, with the extended stalk domain reduced to five short helices and two β- strands (Figure 4F).

Comparing the structure of SiaD-A (with GpCpp) and SiaD-B, there are conformational deflections of several catalytic amino acids (D138, E181, K250 and R254), which further stabilize the binding of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the phosphate group of GpCpp(<italic>Figure 2—figure supplement 3</italic>). The role of several catalytic residues, such as D138, D155, E181, K250 and R254, has been evaluated by biofilm formation assay and enzymatic assay. Data showed that these residues are essential for SiaD activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please see https://elifesciences.org/articles/43959: is the conserved general base oriented for catalysis in the SiaD-SiaC complex?</p></disp-quote><p>By superposition with <italic>Is</italic>PadC (pdb code: 5LLX), we observed that the conserved general base E182 (E375 in <italic>Gm</italic>GacA) is oriented for catalysis in the SiaC-SiaD complex, which suggested the cooperativity and conservation of SiaD as a catalytic dimer(<italic>Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For SiaD, please explain how the alternate conformation of the N-terminal region of SiaD in absence of SiaC was determined or modeled.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. Based on the circular dish-like shape model of SAXS, the structure was predicted by swiss-model (swissmodel.expasy.org).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For SiaC, the authors should determine whether it forms a dimer on its own or dimerizes in the presence of SiaD.</p></disp-quote><p>Our SEC-MALS and GST-pull data showed that SiaC was monomeric on its own. In the complex, SiaC binds to the conserved sites of SiaD, and the distance between SiaC is not enough to form dimer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors are inconsistent in their description of SiaC. On one hand, it has a homologous structure to STAS proteins, on the other hand, it contains a domain of unknown function, DUF1987, and has a unique fold. Perhaps the line of reasoning is that their results show that DUF1987 domains are structurally related to STAS domains; if so, this should be more clearly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We have clearly stated the relevant description in the revised manuscript (P17, Lines: 477).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Along these lines, is the N-terminal domain of SiaD a DUF or other conserved domain class? This would strengthen the significance of the paper: if the SiaD-SiaC interaction domains are both conserved, then this structure could serve as the paradigm.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. The DUF1987 domains of SiaC were widely distributed. However, analysis of the SiaD N-terminal sequence by BLAST and InterPro revealed no conserved domain class.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The manuscript main text includes a lot of structural description that are mostly listing AA residues, which are redundant with the figures themselves. Please consider revising to focus on reporting the results (what the data mean) rather than describing the data itself.</p></disp-quote><p>Many structural description sentences and paragraphs have been rearranged accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, some of the non-structural figures are made so small that the graph labels are almost illegible.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We have rearranged these figures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
