their molecular nature is poorly understood. Mutations in <italic>leopard</italic> (<italic>leo</italic>), encoding Connexin 41.8 (Cx41.8), a gap junction subunit, cause a phenotypic series of spotted patterns. A new dominant allele, <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup>, leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. In a genetic screen, we identified this component as Cx39.4 (<italic>luchs</italic>). Loss-of-function alleles demonstrate that <italic>luchs</italic> is required for stripe formation in zebrafish; however, the fins are almost not affected. Double mutants and chimeras, which show that <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luchs</italic> are only required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores, suggest that both connexins form heteromeric gap junctions. The phenotypes indicate that these promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, respectively, and those cells instruct the patterning of the iridophores.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05125.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05125.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05125.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The colour patterns that mark an animal's skin, hair, or feathers—called the pigmentation pattern—can be very important for its survival and fitness, helping it to hide from predators or to attract a mate. As a result, there is considerable interest in understanding how genes, proteins, and cells work together to produce the many different pigmentation patterns that exist in the animal world.</p><p>Adult zebrafish have a characteristic pigmentation pattern of horizontal dark and light stripes on their bodies and fins. There are three types of pigment cell that create this pattern. Xanthophores and iridophores are found all over the body, and the dark stripes also contain melanophore cells. The silvery, reflective iridophores are the first of the cells to populate the skin, giving rise to the first light stripe. They then form a dense network of cells that breaks up to form the darker stripes. However, iridophores are not required to form stripes in the fins, suggesting that patterning occurs differently in the fins and the body.</p><p>Mutations to a gene called <italic>leopard</italic>, or <italic>leo</italic> for short, cause spots to form on the skin of the zebrafish in place of the usual stripes. This gene encodes a member of the connexin family of proteins, which form channels in the membranes that surround cells. These channels—known as gap junctions—allow neighbouring cells to communicate with each other. Each gap junction is made up of two half channels, with one half coming from each neighbouring cells. If the two half channels are identical, the gap junction is known as ‘homomeric’; ‘heteromeric’ gap junctions are made from two different half channels, each consisting of a different connexin protein. The connexin encoded by <italic>leo</italic> is required for both types of gap junction to form between melanophores and xanthophores.</p><p>Irion et al. discovered a new mutation to the <italic>leo</italic> gene that completely disrupts the patterning of the zebrafish. A technique called a genetic screen revealed that the same patterning defects are also seen in the body of zebrafish with mutations to another gene called <italic>luchs</italic>, which encodes a different connexin protein to the one produced by <italic>leo</italic>. However, the fins of zebrafish with mutant versions of <italic>luchs</italic> remain striped.</p><p>The findings of Irion et al. suggest that heteromeric gap junctions formed from the connexins produced by <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luchs</italic> are important for xanthophores and melanophores to communicate with each other and so form the stripy patterning seen on the body of the zebrafish. The signals transmitted through the gap junctions may also make the iridophores adopt the looser arrangement that is required for the dark stripes to form. As a next step, it will be important to identify the signals that pass through these gap junctions that allow the cells to communicate with their neighbours and establish the pigmentation pattern.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05125.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05125.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>pigmentation</kwd><kwd>gap junction</kwd><kwd>connexin</kwd><kwd>leopard</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZF-HEALTH grant, 242048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nüsslein-Volhard</surname><given-names>Christiane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Melanophores and xanthophores interact via heteromeric gap junctions composed of Connexin 41.8 and Connexin 39.4 to establish the adult pigment pattern in zebrafish.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) display a characteristic pattern of horizontal dark and light stripes on their bodies as well as on their anal fins and tailfins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

At the onset of metamorphosis, iridophores appear in the skin at the region of the horizontal myoseptum that provides a morphological pre-pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frohnhofer et al., 2013</xref>). They proliferate and spread as densely connected cells to form the first light stripe. While spreading further ventrally and dorsally, into the regions where the first two dark stripes will form, they change their appearance and become more loose, then they aggregate again at a distance to form the next light stripes (Singh et al., 2013). Larval xanthophores, covering the flank of the fish, start to proliferate and re-organize into densely packed compact cells above the dense iridophores of the light stripe and into more loosely organized, stellate cells in the dark stripe regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mahalwar et al., 2014</xref>). Melanoblasts migrate along spinal nerves into the skin in the presumptive stripe regions where they finally differentiate and expand to fill the space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Budi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dooley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). In the fins, stripe formation does not require iridophores, suggesting that the patterning mechanisms in the body and fins are different.</p><p>A number of mutants are known in which the pattern is not formed normally. In one class of them, one type of pigment cell is absent; in mutants for <italic>nacre/mitfA</italic> melanophores are missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lister et al., 1999</xref>), mutations in <italic>pfeffer/csf1rA</italic>, lead to the lack of xanthophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Odenthal et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parichy et al., 2000b</xref>), and in <italic>shady/ltk, rose/ednrb1b,</italic> and <italic>transparent/mpv17</italic> mutants iridophores are absent or strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parichy et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lopes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krauss et al., 2013</xref>). In all these cases, the remaining two types of chromatophores form an irregular residual striped pattern. These genes are autonomously required in the respective cell types indicating that interactions among all three chromatophore types are necessary to generate the striped pattern on the trunk of the fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maderspacher and Nusslein-Volhard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parichy and Turner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frohnhofer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krauss et al., 2014</xref>). Based on the analysis of these mutants and on ablation experiments, several attractive and repulsive signals acting over long or short ranges between the chromatophores have been postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maderspacher and Nusslein-Volhard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamaguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamasu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frohnhofer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Patterson and Parichy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krauss et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In another class of mutants, an abnormal pattern is formed with all three chromatophore types present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haffter et al., 1996</xref>); in these animals, the communication between the cells might be affected. The genes identified in this group encode integral membrane proteins, for example, <italic>obelix/Kir7.1</italic>, a rectifying potassium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iwashita et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>seurat/Igsf11</italic>, a cell-adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eom et al., 2012</xref>), or <italic>dali/Tetraspanin 3c</italic>, a transmembrane-scaffolding protein (Inoue et al., 2012). The best-known example for this class of mutants is <italic>leopard</italic> (<italic>leo</italic>), where the stripes are wavy or broken up into a series of dark spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The original mutant has been regarded as a separate <italic>Danio</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirschbaum, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirschbaum, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Frankel, 1979</xref>). Subsequently several dominant alleles were identified in <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haffter et al., 1996</xref>), and it has been shown that the <italic>leo</italic> phenotype is caused by a mutation in <italic>connexin 41.8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>), which codes for a subunit of gap junctions (gap junction protein α5, GJA5).</p><p>Gap junctions are intercellular channels that allow the passage of small molecules and ions between neighbouring cells, and thus are responsible for their chemical and electrical coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kar et al., 2012</xref>). They are formed by the juxtaposition of two hemi-channels (connexons), composed of six connexin subunits, in adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Unwin and Zampighi, 1980</xref>). Connexins are integral membrane proteins with four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, one intracellular loop, and intracellular N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milks et al., 1988</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Hemi-channels can be composed of different subunits; the resulting gap junctions are homotypic, if identical connexons from neighbouring cells pair, or heterotypic, if different hemi-channels come together. In addition to the subunit composition, gap junction conductivity is regulated by a number of different factors, for example, by the intracellular levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, by polyamines, by the membrane potential, or by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thévenin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that the function of the <italic>leo</italic> gene is required in two of the chromatophore types, the melanophores and the xanthophores, for homotypic and heterotypic cellular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maderspacher and Nusslein-Volhard, 2003</xref>). Wild-type and mutant forms of Cx41.8 artificially expressed in melanophores can lead to different variations of the stripe pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watanabe and Kondo, 2012</xref>). This could indicate that gap junctions are responsible for some of the short range signals postulated to occur within and between these two chromatophore types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parichy and Turner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inaba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frohnhofer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Three alleles of <italic>leo</italic> have been described so far. The original allele, <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>t1</italic></sup>, is recessive; it has a premature stop codon at position 68 of the coding sequence and is most likely a functional null-allele. Two dominant alleles, <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tq270</italic></sup> and <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tw28</italic></sup>, carry missense mutations; they lead to a stronger phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haffter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>). The dominance of these alleles led to the suggestion that heterotypic as well as homotypic connexons containing Cx41.8 could be involved in pigment patterning, postulating the existence of other connexin partner(s) in the potential heterotypic channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identified several additional alleles of <italic>leo</italic>. All of them are dominant, and the strongest of them, <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup>, leads to a complete loss of the pigmentation pattern in homozygous carriers; the number of melanophores is reduced, and they appear as small groups or individual cells in the skin, embedded in an expanded light region of dense iridophores covered by xanthophores. In a genetic screen, we found two dominant alleles of a gene we named <italic>luchs</italic> (<italic>luc</italic>) as enhancers of the <italic>leo</italic> loss-of-function phenotype. We show that the <italic>luc</italic> gene codes for another connexin, Cx39.4. A loss-of-function allele for <italic>luc</italic> displays a phenotype similar to <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>t1</italic></sup>; however, the fins are not affected. Further we show that both genes, <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luc</italic>, are required in the trunk in xanthophores and in melanophores, but not in iridophores. Our results suggest that Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 form heteromeric gap junction channels in the plasma membranes of melanophores and xanthophores. In the complete absence of the channels, iridophores take over and almost fully fill the space normally occupied by alternating light and dark stripes, whereas melanophores are suppressed. This suggests that the heteromeric gap junctions function in the communication between xanthophores and melanophores and potentially in the transduction of signals to the dense iridophores to induce the transition into the loose shape required for dark stripe formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>New alleles of <italic>leo</italic></title><p>In a number of experiments designed to find mutants with adult phenotypes, we identified four additional alleles of <italic>leo</italic>. All of them are dominant. Three of our new alleles result in a phenotypic series of patterns from undulating stripes to breaking up of the dark stripe regions into small spots. As in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–A′</xref>), the dark stripe regions of melanophores are covered with loose blue iridophores. The light stripe regions composed of dense iridophores covered by compact xanthophores are expanded and ingress into the stripe regions. Depending on the genotypes, they display varying strengths, similar to the previously described dominant alleles <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tw28</italic></sup> and <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tq270</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haffter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>). However, one allele, <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup>, is considerably stronger. In heterozygous fish, it leads to an intermediate phenotype similar to the one seen in homozygotes for the loss-of-function allele <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>t1</italic></sup>. Fish homozygous for <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup>, or trans-heterozygous for <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup> and <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>t1</italic></sup>, show a much stronger phenotype with a loss of any striped arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>).

Therefore we created chimeric fish with mutant xanthophores next to wild-type melanophores by transplanting cells from <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup><italic>;spa;rse</italic> mutant blastula embryos (that provide mutant xanthophores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parichy et al., 1999</xref>]) into <italic>pfe</italic> hosts (lacking xanthophores). Whereas the transplantation of wild-type xanthophore progenitors can completely restore the striped pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parichy and Turner, 2003</xref>), the chimeric animals that received <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup> xanthophores display a distribution of melanophores strongly resembling the <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup> mutant phenotype, indicating that mutant xanthophores cannot restore the wild-type striped pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,B′</xref>). Therefore the <italic>leo;luc</italic> function must be required cell autonomously in xanthophores. Finally, we assessed the function of <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> in melanophores by transplanting cells from <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup><italic>;pfe;rse</italic> donor embryos into <italic>nac</italic> hosts. In these cases, where mutant melanophores are confronted with non-mutant xanthophores and iridophores, we again did not get a normal stripe pattern. However, the mutant melanophores did cluster together producing meandering fields of cells rather than creating spots or staying as individual cells, like in <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,C′</xref>). This indicates that the function of <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> is required in melanophores, but the wild-type xanthophores are able to exert some normalising influence over the mutant melanophores. Similar transplantation experiments using <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>t1</italic></sup> or <italic>luc</italic><sup><italic>tXG1</italic></sup> embryos instead of <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup> confirm that <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> are required in xanthophores and, to a lesser extent, in melanophores, but not in iridophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, heteromeric connexons formed by Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 are not required in iridophores, but the function of <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> is required in melanophores and xanthophores instructing iridophores.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>A new connexin involved in pigment pattern formation</title><p>The <italic>leo</italic> phenotype varies, depending on the strength and combination of different alleles, from irregular, wavy stripes that are occasionally interrupted, over rows of spots to a complete loss of the pigment pattern, where isolated melanophores remain dispersed in a uniform background of dense iridophores and xanthophores. In the complete absence of Cx41.8 protein, in <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>t1</italic></sup> mutants, there is still some patterning activity present, leading to the formation of spots. The homozygous <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup> phenotype is considerably stronger than this, indicating that the mutant Cx41.8 protein present in <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup> cells has a dominant negative effect on some further component(s) involved in pigment pattern formation. In a simple model, this additional factor could be another connexin involved in the formation of heteromeric gap junctions together with Cx41.8, a notion that has been suggested previously, based on the analysis of <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tq270</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>). The zebrafish genome contains 37 genes coding for connexins and it is impossible to deduce from the predicted amino acid sequences alone possible partners for Cx41.8. Therefore we performed a mutagenesis of <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>t1</italic></sup> fish and screened for mutants enhancing the phenotype to a strength similar to <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup>. In this screen we identified two dominant alleles of <italic>luc</italic>; we show that <italic>luc</italic> encodes another connexin, Cx39.4, and that loss-of-function of <italic>luc</italic> leads to a phenotype very similar to that of <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>t1</italic></sup>. The loss of both connexins results in a phenotype that is as strong as the one seen in homozygous mutants for the dominant alleles of <italic>leo</italic> or <italic>luc</italic>. Therefore the strong phenotypes of the dominant alleles can be fully explained by the loss of the two proteins.</p><p>Cx39.4 is a fish specific connexin, closely related sequences can only be found in the genomes of other teleost fish. It has been classified either as novel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eastman et al., 2006</xref>) or placed into an orthology group together with mammalian Cx37 (GJA4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cruciani and Mikalsen, 2006</xref>) with which it shares 54% amino acid similarity. However, Cx39.4 is the only α-Connexin where the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 23 amino acids is extended by two residues. As in the case of Cx41.8, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain in Cx39.4 also contains an ExxE motif, therefore the conductivity of gap junctions formed by Cx39.4 could also be regulated by polyamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Musa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Watanabe et al., 2012</xref>). Both, Cx41.8 and Cx39.4, have neither an R type nor a W type sequence motifs regulating heteromeric compatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koval et al., 2014</xref>), so that no sequence based predictions about their ability to form heteromeric complexes are possible.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Requirement for <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> function in chromatophores</title><p>Based on transplantation experiments, the function of <italic>leo</italic> was reported to be required in melanophores and in xanthophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maderspacher and Nusslein-Volhard, 2003</xref>). We repeated the experiments with the loss-of-function allele <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>t1</italic></sup>, the new strong allele <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup>, and one of our dominant alleles of <italic>luc</italic> as donors. In agreement with the previous study, we show that <italic>leo</italic> function is needed in melanophores and xanthophores. We find the same requirement for <italic>luc</italic> function in both cell types. But neither <italic>leo</italic> nor <italic>luc</italic> has a role in iridophores. The results of our transplantation experiments also show that there is no contribution of non-pigment cells to the <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> phenotypes. Otherwise we would not have expected to find the complete rescue of a wild-type pattern to coincide in all cases with the transplanted iridophores into the <italic>shd</italic> or <italic>tra</italic> mutants.</p><p>Mutant melanophores, in chimeric animals, seem to be influenced by wild-type xanthophores in their neighbourhood, as they form continuous meandering patches larger than the spots found in <italic>leo</italic> or <italic>luc</italic> mutants. However, unlike wild-type melanophores when transplanted into <italic>nac</italic> hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maderspacher and Nusslein-Volhard, 2003</xref>), they do not form normal stripes, so clearly <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> are required in melanophores for the formation of a wild-type pattern. The function of both genes is also required in xanthophores; mutant xanthophores, when confronted with wild-type melanophores in the chimeras, do not generate a wild-type pattern but spot or disperse melanophores in large dense iridophore regions. When we tested iridophores we found that they require neither <italic>leo</italic> nor <italic>luc</italic> function, as the mutant cells can contribute to a completely wild-type pattern if they are next to other wild-type cells. This is surprising and indicates that the dramatic expansion of the dense iridophores that is associated with the mutant phenotypes is an indirect effect, possibly caused by mutant xanthophores covering the iridophores.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Gap junction communication between chromatophores</title><p>Taken together our data suggest that Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 interact to form heteromeric gap junctions and that these channels are responsible for some of the interactions that take place among chromatophores while the pigment pattern is established. This is corroborated by our analysis of double mutants where one chromatophore type is missing and <italic>leo</italic> or <italic>luc</italic> is mutant. In the absence of xanthophores, in <italic>pfe</italic> mutants, melanophores cluster together; this clustering is lost in double mutants with <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup>, where <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> function are affected, indicating that the channels are responsible for homotypic interactions among melanophores. In the double mutants of <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup> with <italic>nac</italic>, where melanophores are missing, mutant xanthophores are unable to confine the light stripe regions, suggesting an instructive interaction between xanthophores and iridophores during normal development. In double mutants with <italic>shd</italic> or <italic>tra</italic>, where iridophores are lacking, the number of melanophores is further reduced and xanthophores are evenly distributed, indicating that in wild-type there might be a positive interaction between melanophores and xanthophores via gap junctions. The phenotypes of the double mutants with the <italic>leo</italic> or <italic>luc</italic> loss-of-function alleles are generally a bit weaker than with <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup>. This indicates that in the absence of one of the connexins, when heteromeric channels cannot form, homomeric channels retain some functionality.</p><p>The <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> mutant phenotypes seem to be caused by iridophores not behaving appropriately and failing to undergo the transition from the dense to the loose form at the correct time and place. Recently it was shown that proliferation and dispersal of iridophores during metamorphosis, the time when the adult pigment pattern is generated, outline the light and dark stripe regions in the trunk of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2014</xref>); at the same time the larval xanthophores also start to proliferate, they re-organize and change their shapes to densely cover the light stripe regions and loosely the dark melanophore stripes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mahalwar et al., 2014</xref>). This raises the possibility that in normal development the xanthophores, which cover the iridophores, induce the transition to the loose form when they reach the regions destined to form dark stripes. It is interesting in this context that in <italic>schachbrett</italic> (<italic>sbr</italic>) mutants, which display interrupted dark stripes, the affected gene is specifically expressed in iridophores and codes for Tight Junction Protein 1a (Tjp1a, ZO-1) (Andrey Fadeev, JK, HGF, and CN-V, submitted). If gap junctions are indeed involved in the signalling events between xanthophores and iridophores, there must be (at least) one, so far unidentified, connexin, which is expressed in iridophores. Alternatively, other signalling pathways could be responsible for the cross-talk between iridophores and xanthophores, and gap junctions might only be required for the homotypic interactions among xanthophores. Whether direct interactions between xanthophores and melanophores, which have been demonstrated in an in vitro system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamanaka and Kondo, 2014</xref>), are also possible in vivo is not known. In the skin of the fish these two cell types are always separated by a layer of iridophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hirata et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>), however, recently it has been shown that melanophores of the dark stripe produce long cellular extensions reaching towards the light stripe xanthophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hamada et al., 2014</xref>); these extensions could allow direct contact between melanophores and xanthophores. These direct cell-to-cell contacts would permit communication between the cells via gap junctions.</p><p>Our data suggest that in the absence of one connexin-partner, homomeric channels can exist, but they retain only some residual functionality, as can be seen in <italic>leo</italic> or <italic>luc</italic> loss-of-function mutants. The non-functional proteins present in the dominant mutants can lead to a complete block of activity, equal to the one seen in the <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>k.o.</italic></sup>;<italic>luc</italic><sup><italic>k.o.</italic></sup> double mutants. Interestingly, in <italic>luc</italic> mutants the fins are striped, suggesting that homomeric <italic>leo</italic> channels suffice for patterning the fins, where stripes can be formed in the absence of iridophores.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish husbandry</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brand et al., 2002</xref>); we used the following genotypes: Tübingen, <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>t1</italic></sup>, <italic>nac</italic><sup><italic>W2</italic></sup><italic>, pfe</italic><sup><italic>tm236b</italic></sup><italic>, rse</italic><sup><italic>tLF802</italic></sup><italic>, shd</italic><sup><italic>j9s1</italic></sup><italic>, spa</italic><sup><italic>b134</italic></sup><italic>, tra</italic><sup><italic>b6</italic></sup>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marianne Bronner, BRE; Rob Cornell and Richard White, peer reviewers</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper contributes to a growing literature that uses stripe formation as a model for cell interactions during organogenesis. Irion and colleagues use forward and reverse genetic methods in zebrafish to identify a new gene that contributes to stripe formation. By performing a genetic modifier screen in the <italic>leo</italic> (t1) background, they identified two alleles of cx39.4, which they refer to as luchs. Using transplantation and mutant crosses, they propose a model where cx39.4 and cx41.8 form a heteromeric gap junction required in xanthophores and melanophores, although there are no biochemical experiments to prove this. They conclude that xanthophores mutant for the two channels lack the ability to restrict the expansion of dense iridophores (iridophores are otherwise confined to light stripes) resulting in the visual phenotype of light stripes expanded into the dark stripes. In addition the channels are necessary within melanophores for the homotypic clustering of melanophores in the absence of xanthophores.</p><p>A particularly elegant aspect of this work is the use of a dominant enhancer screen in zebrafish to find the protein that interacts connexins 41.8 (encoded by the <italic>leo</italic> locus) whose existence had been implied by the observation that the dominant alleles of <italic>leo</italic> had a stronger phenotype than the null alleles. There are very few other published examples of enhancer and suppressor screens using zebrafish. Another strength is the construction of appropriate triple mutants that establish that melanophores and xanthophores, but not iridophores, require connnexins 41.8 and 39.4 autonomously for the proper organization of the iridophores.</p><p>The following additional experiments would strengthen the paper:</p><p>1) The authors conclude that there is “no contribution of non-pigment cells to the <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> phenotypes”, which is supported by their transplant data. However, it would be very useful to characterize the expression pattern of cx39.4 during embryonic development, either through in situ or transgenic reporters. This would support the model that the gene is required in these cell types, but would also give insight into additional cell types that may not be phenotypically obvious but still dependent upon this protein.</p><p>2) Is it known whether <italic>luc</italic> deficient precursors have a survival vs. differentiation defect? Were the chimeric transplants (i.e. <italic>nac;pfe;leo-tk3</italic>) done with GFP labelled blastula cells, which could help discern whether those cells were even present when the adults were assayed?</p><p>3) There is no mention of numbers of animals or any statistical considerations at all. At a minimum, this needs to be provided for the blastula transplant experiments, which are often somewhat noisy, yet many of the conclusions of the paper are based on this. In general, a more clear quantification of some data would make some conclusions more convincing.</p><p>4) The Introduction is needlessly long and could be shortened by 1/3 to 1/2 of its current length.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05125.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors conclude that there is “no contribution of non-pigment cells to the leo and luc phenotypes”, which is supported by their transplant data.

This would support the model that the gene is required in these cell types, but would also give insight into additional cell types that may not be phenotypically obvious but still dependent upon this protein</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it would be very good to know where the gene is expressed, not only during embryonic development, but also during metamorphosis, the stage when the adult pigmentation pattern is established. Through RT-PCR experiments we know that <italic>cx39.4</italic> mRNA is present in embryos and in light and dark stripes of adult fish. Unfortunately, however, we were so far unable to obtain clear and unambiguous in situ signals; this might possibly reflect low levels of expression in the embryo and the technical difficulties of in situ hybridizations during later stages.</p><p>Also, we agree that a reporter transgene would be very useful, however the construction of one is hampered by the fact that the promoter of <italic>cx39.4</italic> is entirely uncharacterized. The gene has an intron in the 5’ untranslated region of 7.7 kb and an upstream (gene-less) region of approx. 500 kb, making BAC recombineering or, preferably, knock-in by homologous recombination the methods of choice for the construction of such a reporter. Both methods are rather time-consuming and labour intensive and it is not possible to get results within the next few months.</p><p>With the experiments described in the manuscript we have shown that the function of both connexins is required in xanthophores and in melanophores. Although we have no direct proof, we think it is unlikely that other cell types are dependent upon the proteins for two main reasons. First, we have hypermorphic alleles for both genes; these could uncover functions of the proteins that might otherwise be masked by redundancy, but mutant fish are viable and fertile, and no additional phenotype could be detected. Second, in the transplantation experiments of <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup><italic>;nac;pfe</italic> into <italic>rose</italic>, where we used donors that provide iridophores as the only type of chromatophore, we obtained good rescue in all chimeras. It is very likely that in several of these cases we also transplanted other cells, however they never lead to phenotypic consequences.</p><p><italic>2) Is it known whether</italic> luc <italic>deficient precursors have a survival vs. differentiation defect? Were the chimeric transplants (i.e.</italic> nac;pfe;leo-tk3<italic>) done with GFP labelled blastula cells, which could help discern whether those cells were even present when the adults were assayed?</italic></p><p>There are probably two different issues here; first, the number of melanophores is reduced in mutants homozygous for the dominant <italic>leo</italic> or <italic>luc</italic> alleles. In these cases it is interesting to ask whether this is due to survival or differentiation defects; however it is not easy to obtain unambiguous answers, using for example <italic>mitfA:GFP</italic> as a marker, and we haven’t done the experiment, so far.</p><p>What we can say is, that the defect is not autonomous to melanophores, but depends on the presence of xanthophores and therefore presumably on cell-cell interactions, because the melanophore number is greater in <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup><italic>;pfe</italic> double mutants compared to <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup> alone.</p><p>The second issue is about the transplantations we present in our manuscript; in the case of <italic>leo</italic><sup><italic>tK3</italic></sup> we used triple mutant donors, which can only provide one type of chromatophore, and transplanted cells into hosts lacking exactly this cell type. Therefore we can be sure that the cells we identify later in the chimeric animals (due to their pigment content) are indeed derived from the donor and therefore carry the <italic>leo</italic> mutation. Nevertheless, transplanting GFP-labelled cells would also have been informative, e.g. in providing information about transplanted non-pigment cells. However it takes at least two generations, i.e. a minimum of six months, to get a GFP-transgene into the triple mutant background. Without one further generation of inbreeding only 3 in 256 donor fish will have at least one copy of the transgene and be homozygous for the three mutations; therefore we did not carry out these experiments.</p><p><italic>3) There is no mention of numbers of animals or any statistical considerations at all.

Any additional statistical evaluation seems inappropriate, given the small numbers and the variable sizes and positions of the clones</p><p><italic>4) The Introduction is needlessly long and could be shortened by 1/3 to 1/2 of its current length</italic>.</p><p>We have shortened the Introduction to 1062 words.</p></body></sub-article></article>
