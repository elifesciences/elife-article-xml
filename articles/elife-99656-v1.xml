Incomplete knowledge of how bactericidal antibiotics work limits our understanding of partial resistance due to phenotypic tolerance in mycobacteria, a driver for developing genetic resistance. Using proteomics, <sup>13</sup>C isotopomer analysis, genetic and biochemical assays, we investigated the physiological response of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> challenged with aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Two distinct classes of antibiotics elicited remarkably similar responses and increased flux through the TCA cycle, causing enhanced respiration, ROS generation, and ATP burst. We observed that excessive ATP levels and not ROS dominantly contribute to cidality, which may in part be conferred by sequestration of divalent metal ions by ATP. Consequently, <sup>13</sup>C isotope tracing indicated TCA cycle flux deviation from its oxidative arm as a bacterial adaptive mechanism, which also included activated intrinsic resistance and a higher propensity to develop antibiotic resistance. Our study provides a new understanding of the intricate mechanisms of antibiotic-induced cell death and expands the current paradigm for antibiotic action.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mycobacterium</kwd><kwd>smegmatis</kwd><kwd>actinobacteria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03tjsyq23</institution-id><institution>Dept. of Biotechnology, Govt of India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR20820/MED/30/1875/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Raju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00cwqg982</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/T007648/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beste</surname><given-names>Dany JV</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multiomics and biochemical studies reveal that excess ATP levels, and not ROS, is the dominant driver for antibiotic cidality in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibiotics have saved millions of lives from bacterial infections; however, the emergence of resistance against all classes of antibiotics renders clinically available antibiotics ineffective and undermines efforts to combat lethal bacterial infection. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is responsible for approximately 700,000 deaths per year and, if left unchecked, is projected to exceed 10 million by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tagliabue and Rappuoli, 2018</xref>). The conventional approach for combating AMR through pathogen-specific antibiotics is no longer viable, as the drug discovery pipeline has shrunk over the past several decades. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop novel interventions for preserving and enhancing the efficacy of the existing drugs through synergy or adjuvant therapy. However, there are gaps in our understanding of how precisely the existing antibiotics mediate cell death and what the bacterial counter responses to these challenges are at a system-wide scale.</p><p>Antibiotics are commonly believed to cause cell death either by inhibiting essential cellular processes facilitating cell division or compromising the integrity of the cell envelope, while antibiotic resistance involves more complex mechanisms and manifests as genotypic resistance, antibiotic tolerance, and persistence. A proposed hypothesis posited a unified mechanism underlying antibiotic lethality driven by the presence of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), rather than solely targeting their intended primary targets. This hypothesis suggests that antibiotic-induced cell death occurs through a series of interconnected events, including enhanced respiration, disruption of iron-sulfur clusters, increase in intracellular iron levels, and triggering of the Fenton reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lobritz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dwyer et al., 2014</xref>). These processes culminate in the autocatalytic generation of ROS, ultimately leading to oxidation of biomolecules and cell death. However, this hypothesis has faced significant rebuttals. Some studies have shown a lack of ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu and Imlay, 2013</xref>) or no clear correlation between ROS levels and antibiotic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keren et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, research has demonstrated that increased respiration and intracellular iron pool enhance antibiotic lethality not because they produce ROS, but by promoting antibiotic uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, a recent study examining <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with aminoglycosides revealed that lethality stems directly from dysregulated membrane potential, which was independent of the voltage-dependent drug uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruni and Kralj, 2020</xref>) as was widely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taber et al., 1987</xref>). Likewise, the role of active growth rate and metabolic activity in antibiotic efficacy has been subject to contradictory findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greulich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lopatkin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amor and Gore, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lapińska et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, respiration-decelerating antibiotics were found to inhibit the lethality of respiration-accelerating antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lobritz et al., 2015</xref>), highlighting the need for a new understanding of the drug’s mode of action, particularly in a combination therapy. Despite the intuitive deleterious effects of ROS on bacterial physiology, sub-lethal concentrations were found to promote multidrug resistance by inducing superoxide radical-induced mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kohanski et al., 2010</xref>). These results demonstrate the intricate nature of the repercussions stemming from antibiotic action and the metabolic factors influencing cell death. They underscore the necessity of investigating antibiotic actions to dissect the specific metabolic factors governing cell death amidst the complex interplay with factors like respiration, ROS, membrane potential, and ATP. Bacterial responses to these mechanisms contribute to the emergence of phenotypic and eventually genetic resistance.</p><p>Antibiotic tolerance results from physiological adaptation that enables a bacterial population to withstand lethal doses of antibiotics for a longer duration and also provides the driving force to develop genetic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin-Reisman et al., 2017</xref>). Although the significance of antibiotic tolerance is recognised, the precise metabolic state and sequence of the adaptive events leading to the development of antibiotic tolerance remain poorly characterised. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the etiological agent for tuberculosis, a prominent cause of death from infectious disease, shows exceptional tolerance to antibiotics and partly explains the reason for a long treatment regimen requiring a combination of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>). Despite having low rates of mutation and recombination, the rapid increase in multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis infections compels us to re-examine our current understanding of the mechanisms of antibiotic action in mycobacteria and identify vulnerable targets for adjuvant therapy to shorten the treatment time in TB.</p><p>A systemic investigation of the physiological responses to antibiotic exposure prior to the emergence of resistance holds the key to deciphering the nature and quantum of antibiotic-induced stresses. In this study, we employed temporal quantitative proteomics and <sup>13</sup>C isotopomer analysis to comprehensively understand the physiological responses of the model organism, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics from two distinct classes, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside. Through genetic and biochemical assays, we show the involvement of ROS and ATP burst in antibiotic lethality. Here, we attempted to underscore the interplay between ROS and ATP burst in contributing to cell death. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms underpinning antibiotic-induced cell death in mycobacterium with implications for preventing the development of antibiotic tolerance and resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exposure to sub-lethal doses of aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone reveals physiological adaptation without genetic resistance</title><p>In order to understand the biology of antibiotic-stressed mycobacteria, we designed a growth assay to measure the responses of mycobacteria to sublethal antibiotic concentrations. <italic>M. smegmatis mc<sup>2</sup>155</italic> (OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 0.0025) was challenged with either 1 x, ½x, or ¼x MBC<sub>99</sub> (minimum bactericidal concentration) of fluoroquinolone (norfloxacin) and aminoglycoside (streptomycin) antibiotics.

The experiments were terminated when the culture reached stationary phase (~ OD<sub>600nm</sub>=1) to prevent the stationary phase response from interfering with the antibiotic-induced response. The prolonged lag time observed during the stress phase is of profound significance in deciphering the nature of antibiotic-induced stresses and has implications for the development of antibiotic tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreno-Gámez et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, a thorough understanding of the recovery phase cells can reveal cellular determinants involved in adaptation to antibiotics. Towards this end, we first ruled out whether the resumption of growth on sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics was due to the emergence of an antibiotic-resistant population. For this, bacteria were harvested from the recovery phase (25 hr), and the MIC of the antibiotics on cells grown with and without ¼x MBC<sub>99</sub> of the same antibiotic were compared. No changes in MIC confirmed that the growth resumption during the recovery phase was physiological rather than a result of genetic resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Norfloxacin and streptomycin induce similar proteomic responses</title><p>We performed untargeted label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics on mycobacteria grown with and without ¼x MBC<sub>99</sub> of both antibiotics, during all three growth phases to observe the physiological alterations in mycobacterium exposed to antibiotics.

In contrast, cells from the stress phase (15 hr) and the recovery phase (25 hr) displayed several up- and down-regulated proteins in response to both antibiotics. We also noted a transition from a coordinated to an uncoordinated state of the proteome, and back to an unperturbed state depending on the time for growth recovery. Consistent with its mode of action, streptomycin (STR) treatment up-regulated proteases, peptidases, and proteasomal complex components implicated in the degradation of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Likewise, norfloxacin (NOR) treatment induced the SOS response by down-regulating LexA, the repressor of SOS response, and up-regulating DNA repair proteins, such as RecA/B/C and PafC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These data indicate that the sub-lethal doses of antibiotics used in our study exert sufficient stress on their primary targets. Next, we sought to determine the secondary consequences of antibiotic-target interactions. Towards this end, proteins involved in central dogma (DNA replication, transcription, and translation), and cell cycle and cell division processes were found significantly down-regulated in response to both the antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>), correlating with the observed decrease in growth rate during the stress phase. Our results suggest that the initial bacterial response to antibiotics may involve downregulation of essential cellular processes that are required for optimal growth and antibiotic lethality.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Norfloxacin and streptomycin have a common mechanism of action.</title><p>Heat map analysis represents the log<sub>2</sub> fold changes of proteins involved in (<bold>A</bold>) DNA damage response and proteostasis network, (<bold>B</bold>) DNA replication and transcription, (<bold>C</bold>) translation, and (<bold>D</bold>) cell cycle and cell division processes, identified from proteomics data.

It remains uncertain whether the common response to antibiotics indicates a shared mechanism of action or a general stress response independent of specific modes of action of NOR and STR. To determine the cause of these similarities, we attempted to gain a deeper insight into the shared processes impacted by antibiotics. For this, we conducted pathway enrichment analysis on proteins that were up-regulated and exclusively expressed upon antibiotic treatments. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, pathway enrichment analysis showed that central carbon metabolic pathways were enriched for both antibiotics. Notably, enzymes of the TCA cycle (CitA, Icd, Acn), glyoxylate shunt (Icl1 and GlcB), GABA shunt, the anaplerotic node (Pck, Pca), and PPP shunt (G6-PDH, 6-PGD) were significantly up-regulated for both antibiotics, suggesting metabolic alterations in response to antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>).

Thereafter, to interrogate whether the antibiotics induce oxidative stress, we administered sub-lethal to lethal doses of both antibiotics to Mycobacteria containing the biosensor.

Proteins of TCA cycle enzymes and the ETC chain incorporate Fe-S clusters for electron exchange that are very susceptible to ROS-induced damages, resulting in the release of iron (Fe<sup>+2</sup>) in the cytoplasm and induction of the Fenton cycle. Free hydroxyl radicals are generated via the Fenton cycle, which results in further ROS production and could also contribute to antibiotic-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vilchèze et al., 2013</xref>). Using the iron-chelator bipyridyl (BP), known to inhibit the Fenton cycle-mediated burst of ROS, we found that indeed, iron sequestration significantly reduced antibiotic-induced death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and I</xref>).

While in growth-based assays, luminescence can be normalised to OD<sub>600nm</sub> or total protein content, experiments involving bacterial death upon antibiotic treatment, employing a similar normalisation could lead to incorrect measurement of ATP levels per bacterium. Hence, we opted to normalize the data using viable counts as reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gengenbacher et al., 2010</xref>). However, a recent study revealed that antibiotic-induced ROS production may persist even after drug removal, potentially preventing bacteria from forming colonies post-treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hong et al., 2019</xref>), resulting in underestimating viability and reporting higher RLU/CFU values. Furthermore, the ratiometric biosensor has a limited dynamic range, and its effectiveness in measuring ATP may not be optimal during oxidative damage and cell death. Therefore, it was not feasible to determine the exact magnitude of the increase in ATP levels subsequent to antibiotic exposure. Notably, previous studies reporting a surge in ATP levels using OD<sub>600nm</sub>-based normalisation yielded only 4–5-fold increase upon antibiotic treatment that resulted in over 3–4 log<sub>10</sub> fold killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shetty and Dick, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2019a</xref>).

Despite over 3–4 log<sub>10</sub> fold killing observed with 1 x MBC drugs at 6 hr, resazurin reduced faster in antibiotic-treated cells than in untreated cells.

To establish the contribution of increased ATP levels to mycobacterial death, it was necessary to specifically inhibit the antibiotic-induced ATP burst without reducing the overall metabolic rate. To achieve this, we co-treated cells with antibiotics and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a protonophore, at non-toxic levels to mitigate ATP burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). CCCP carries protons (ions + charge) across the membrane, thereby collapsing the pH gradient (∆pH) and the membrane potential (∆ψ), resulting in disruption of ATP synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, CCCP uncouples oxidative phosphorylation from ETC, without directly affecting ATP synthase or the respiratory chain. Expectedly, co-treatment with CCCP dissipated the antibiotic-induced ATP burst in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B, D and E</xref>), confirming that the increase in ATP levels mediated by NOR and STR treatment was the result of increased respiration followed by oxidative phosphorylation. Subsequently, we reasoned that if ATP burst contributes directly to antibiotic action, then dissipating antibiotic-induced ATP burst would increase bacterial survival on antibiotics. To test this hypothesis, we compared antibiotic kill curves with CCCP (mitigating ATP burst) and without CCCP (causing ATP burst).

Since CCCP disrupts both ∆pH and ∆ψ, it collapses the PMF across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicholls, 2013</xref>) and may inhibit the uptake of streptomycin. Therefore, to rule out the possibility of reduced streptomycin uptake being responsible for the increased survival in the presence of CCCP, we measured ATP levels and cell survival in the presence of nigericin. Nigericin is a K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter and carries out electroneutral exchange of H<sup>+</sup> only to collapse ∆pH, leaving the ∆ψ unaffected and the PMF compensated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicholls, 2013</xref>). Consistent with the results obtained with CCCP, nigericin co-treatment prevented antibiotic-induced increase in ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>) and consequently rescued mycobacteria against lethal levels of STR or NOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

While 24 hr of pre-treatment with BDQ at 25 x to 200x-MIC<sub>99</sub> had no effect on cell survival, they significantly reduced the killing rate of STR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>) and NOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>To ascertain our findings further, we made use of the genetic method to demonstrate the involvement of ATP in antibiotic action to rule out off-target activity of CCCP, nigericin, and BDQ.

Together, these data show that mitigation of antibiotic-induced ATP burst using chemical (CCCP, nigericin, and BDQ) or genetic (<italic>ΔatpD M. smegmatis</italic>) methods diminishes antibiotic lethality, and therefore, elevated ATP levels are metabolic drivers of antibiotic lethality. The causal link between increased ATP levels and antibiotic action observed in our study aligns with previous findings that strongly link low ATP levels to antibiotic persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conlon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shan et al., 2017</xref>), and high metabolic activity with antibiotic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lopatkin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kitzenberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lobritz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lobritz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).

After demonstrating that inhibiting either ROS generation or excess ATP production can inhibit antibiotic-induced cell death, we sought to determine which of these two mechanisms is the dominant driver of lethality. Distinguishing between the effects of ROS and ATP becomes challenging due to their common origin from aerobic respiration. For this, ROS levels were compared under the conditions of ATP burst formation (antibiotic treatment alone) and ATP burst mitigation (antibiotic plus CCCP/nigericin or in <italic>ΔatpD M. smegmatis</italic>). We reasoned that if damage by ROS is the dominant mechanism driving cell death, then antibiotic treatment in <italic>ΔatpD M. smegmatis</italic> or co-treatment with CCCP/nigericin would decrease ROS levels to impart enhanced survival in the presence of antibiotics. Interestingly, while the antibiotic treatment alone increased fluorescence ratio at 405/488 nm and caused cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>), CCCP-protected cells also had elevated 405/488 nm ratio (oxidative stress), indicating that the ATP burst, and not ROS production, is the dominant mechanism driving antibiotic lethality. Similar to CCCP, increased ratios of fluorescence at 405/488 nm were obtained with antibiotic and nigericin co-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as well as in the <italic>ΔatpD M. smegmatis</italic> exposed to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In all cases, antibiotic-induced ATP burst was minimised; however, the ROS levels remained higher in the surviving cells. To reciprocally test that ROS is not the dominant driver of antibiotic action, we examined the effects of co-treatment with 10 mM GSH on antibiotic-induced ATP bursts. The antioxidant GSH not only reduced oxidative stress but also prevented the ATP burst caused by antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, GSH-mediated rescue of cell survival upon antibiotic treatment could be attributed to both the reduction of oxidative stress as well as the inhibition of the ATP burst, and therefore, antibiotic-induced ATP burst is the dominant driver of antibiotic action.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Norfloxacin and streptomycin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) is insufficient to mediate cell death.</title><p>Ratiometric response of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> expressing Mrx1-roGFP2 redox biosensor (left y-axis) and the cell viability (right y-axis) in response to streptomycin (STR) (<bold>A, B</bold>) and norfloxacin (NOR) (<bold>C, D</bold>) with and without the co-supplementation with carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) post 3 hr and 6 hr of treatments.

It points out that ROS is a by-product of antibiotic action (i.e. enhanced respiration) rather than the predominant secondary mediator of cell death, as originally understood. Notably, the CCCP-mediated increase in respiration was also evident from a dose-dependent increase in 405/488 nm ratios with CCCP treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Importantly, our results do not rule out the generation and deleterious effects of ROS upon antibiotic exposure but rather suggests to emphasise that antibiotic lethality is dominantly mediated by excessive ATP levels, and in the absence of it, mycobacteria can survive antibiotic-induced ROS for longer periods of time. In summary, our results show that NOR and STR treatments increase respiration, resulting in a lethal ATP burst that drives mycobacterial death.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Antibiotic-induced ATP burst deprives cells of essential divalent metal ions</title><p>ATP synthesis is essential for optimal growth and survival against stresses in all living organisms. Therefore, the involvement of ATP in cell death is difficult to comprehend. However, ATP is known to bind and chelate various divalent metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jahngen and Rossomando, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Distefano and Neuman, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan and Martell, 1962</xref>) and intriguingly, a study reported growth inhibitory activity of exogenously supplied ATP on multiple bacterial species, which was rescued upon co-treatment with magnesium and iron salts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tatano et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these studies, we hypothesised that the ATP surge observed upon antibiotic treatment may have sequestered and deprived the macromolecules and cellular processes of their essential divalent metal ions, resulting in cell death. Towards this end, we first established whether metal ion chelation alone is lethal to cell survival. Since the metal ion chelators, EDTA and EGTA are not taken up by Mycobacteria, as a proof-of-concept, we employed the cell-permeable iron chelator, bipyridyl (BP), to test whether intracellular iron depletion causes bacteriostasis or cidality. The <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> strain challenged with increasing concentrations of bipyridyl displayed a dose-dependent killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), demonstrating that iron removal causes cell death. Next, we reasoned that if ATP burst-mediated cell death was due to metal ion depletion, then exogenous supplementation of divalent metal ions should increase bacterial survival to antibiotics. To test this, we compared cell survival upon NOR or STR treatment with and without the co-supplementation of four different divalent metal ions: Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. We observed a concentration-dependent protection from antibiotics provided by all four metal ions, suggesting that elevated ATP levels contribute to cell death in part by sequestering divalent metal ions. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>). A similar level of protection was not achieved from monovalent metal ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Separately, we also tested whether divalent metal ion supplementation was toxic to cells and caused growth inhibition, leading to increased cell survival. Notably, the high salt concentration of 5 mM used in our experiment had no adverse effect on the bacterial growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), and thus, the enhanced survival obtained with salt co-treatment was not due to any growth arrest or metabolic inhibition by metal ions. A decrease in cell survival observed with the co-treatment of 10 mM Fe<sup>2+</sup> could be attributed to the antibiotic-induced Fenton cycle-mediated ROS generation resulting from excessive free iron in the cells. This observation further suggests that co-treatment with up to 10 mM salts did not hinder antibiotic uptake, and the enhanced survival observed with metal ions was unlikely to be due to reduced drug uptake. We should also note that the elevated ATP levels may affect multiple other physiological processes in bacteria; for instance, the status of protein phosphorylation or allosteric activity of metabolic enzymes. However, studying the impact of ATP burst on different aspects of mycobacterial physiology upon antibiotic exposure is beyond the scope of this study and demands a more focused investigation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Antibiotic-induced ATP levels chelate divalent metal ions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effect of increasing concentrations of bipyridyl (BP) for 6 hr on the survival of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> (0.8 OD/ml).

It has been demonstrated that the redox state of the cells influences the reversal of PEPCK activity and has been associated with increased ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Machová et al., 2014</xref>). This finding was further corroborated by the increase in the aspartate label (a surrogate for oxaloacetate) and the M+3 and M+5 ionic species of <sup>13</sup>C-citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). This increased flux into OAA can facilitate greater utilisation of acetyl-CoA by the TCA cycle, as indicated by the increased label of citrate. Since antibiotic-mediated death was caused by increased respiration, ROS, and ATP levels, we expected that bacteria exposed to sub-lethal doses of antibiotics may remodel their central carbon metabolism (CCM) to minimize respiration and improve their chances of survival. In agreement with this hypothesis, the enhanced flux in the oxidative arm of the TCA cycle (alpha-ketoglutarate) was found to diverge towards glutamate, glutamine, and GABA shunt following streptomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). This deviation of the flux was facilitated by upregulation of glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamate synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate decarboxylase, as evident from the proteomics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). The amino acids glutamate and glutamine direct the carbon flux to amino acid biosynthesis and help regulate energy and nitrogen metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borah Slater et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viljoen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallant et al., 2016</xref>).

Since the enzymes of the oxidative stage (G6-PDH and 6-PGD) of the PPP were found upregulated in our proteomics analysis, it may be speculated that the flux from ribose 5-phosphate got channelised towards purine biosynthesis, which is consistent with the enrichment of the purine metabolic pathway in response to STR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

This study, while exploring the mycobacterial responses to antibiotics, identifies ATP burst as the new and dominant driver of antibiotic-induced cell death in mycobacteria. Our differential proteomics analysis upon antibiotic exposure revealed a rewiring in the central carbon metabolism and generation of an anti-oxidant response due to the production of ROS. Damage by ROS has been proposed as an universal mechanism that many bactericidal antibiotics use to eliminate bacteria, irrespective of their primary targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>). Respiration-inducing molecules, such as Vitamin C, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and other thiols were found to use ROS to enhance antibiotic lethality, even against drug-induced persisters, while ROS quenching by antioxidants rescued bacteria from cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vilchèze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nandakumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vilchèze et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grant et al., 2012</xref>). Our measurements revealed upregulated central carbon metabolism enzymes, increased flux through the TCA cycle, high NADH/NAD +ratios, and elevated ROS levels in response to antibiotic. Notably, the set of bacterial responses were shared by norfloxacin and streptomycin, which belong to two distinct classes of drugs, the fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, respectively. Thus, our observations further strengthen the evidence of increasing involvement of ROS in antibiotic action and also in inducing tolerance in bacterial pathogens, including mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nandakumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rowe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>What is the trigger for high respiration and ROS production? While electron leakage from the ETC is the primary source of ROS, it is unclear how antibiotics are sensed beyond their primary targets and how they modulate the ETC to generate ROS. Recent studies have demonstrated that antibiotic treatments deplete the purine nucleotide pool, resulting in an increase in purine biosynthesis and hence ATP demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lobritz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). This increased energy demand becomes a significant reason for increased respiration, oxygen consumption, and ROS generation, thus contributing to enhanced antibiotic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lobritz et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, the increased purine biosynthesis may increase levels of AMP, reducing the ATP/AMP ratio, which could stimulate the rate-limiting steps of glycolysis and TCA cycle to enhance aerobic respiration, ROS production, and ATP synthesis. Similarly, a down-regulation of proteins involved in central dogma and cell division processes in response to sub-lethal levels of NOR or STR could be interpreted as an indication of diminished availability of biosynthetic building blocks and energy and may have triggered increased metabolic activity as a compensatory mechanism. Therefore, perturbing the target function by antibiotics could lead to multiple stimulating impacts on bacterial metabolism and respiration, originally intended as a bacterial response, resulting in its fatality.</p><p>To confirm that increased respiration led to ROS production, we directly measured ATP levels, the end product of aerobic respiration. Both norfloxacin and streptomycin treatments resulted in a substantial dose- and time-dependent rise in ATP levels that was inversely proportional to cell survival. By inhibiting antibiotic-induced ATP burst using a protonophore uncoupler of ETC and oxidative phosphorylation (CCCP and nigericin), an inhibitor of ATP synthesis (Bedaquiline), or the ATP-deficient Δ<italic>atpD</italic> strain (genetic uncoupler), we showed that the observed increase in ATP concentration was due to enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and significantly contributed to antibiotic action and cell death.</p><p>Growth rate and metabolism were shown to influence antibiotic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greulich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haugan et al., 2019</xref>). A previous study concluded that the bacterial metabolic state, not the growth rate, is the primary driver of cidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lopatkin et al., 2019</xref>); however, the precise metabolic reactions or factors governing antibiotic lethality remain unclear. In addition to increased respiration, our proteomics analysis revealed that downregulation of ATP-consuming processes, such as the central dogma and cell division could be contributing to ATP accumulation. Thus, energy metabolism and particularly ATP synthesis become a central component of the connection between metabolic state and antibiotic susceptibility. Recent studies have observed a remarkable correlation between lower ATP levels and generation of persister population in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conlon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shan et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, exogenous supplementation of alanine or glucose increased the susceptibility of drug-resistant <italic>E. tarda</italic> by boosting the flux through the TCA cycle and increasing the proton motive force, resulting in increased kanamycin uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peng et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these observations, it may be logical to reason that inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation would result in reduced antibiotic cidality and reveal a plausible direct role of ATP in determining antibiotic susceptibility. Supporting this hypothesis, cell wall-acting antimycobacterials were shown to increase ATP levels in <italic>M. bovis BCG</italic>, which directly correlated with antibiotic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shetty and Dick, 2018</xref>).

These studies, however, fell short in establishing a time and dose-dependent relationship between antibiotics and ATP levels, and also in adequately distinguishing the specific impact and significance of ATP levels in antibiotic lethality compared to overall metabolic and respiratory activities, as well as levels of ROS.</p><p>Since inhibition of either ROS generation or ATP burst was sufficient to reduce the lethality of norfloxacin and streptomycin, we sought to determine which of the two is the dominant contributor. Intriguingly, measurements of ROS in CCCP-protected mycobacteria revealed that elevated ROS levels were insufficient to cause cell death upon antibiotic treatment in the absence of an ATP burst, indicating that ATP burst is the dominant mechanism driving cell death. Conditions, such as hypoxia, stationary phase, nutrient starvation, biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ojha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Samuels et al., 2022</xref>) or an artificial reduction of the NADH/NAD+ ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shee et al., 2022</xref>) render mycobacteria less susceptible to antibiotics compared to actively growing cells, and this phenotype has been attributed to lower levels of ROS. Based on our findings, we speculate that these conditions would also generate lesser flux through the electron transport chain (respiration), which, in addition to decreasing ROS levels, would also produce lower levels of ATP. Since the metabolic rate, ROS, and ATP burst are interrelated, studying their individual contributions remains challenging but necessary. We show that in the absence of an ATP burst, mycobacteria can tolerate the consequences of primary target inhibition and the damage from ROS for a longer duration, making them insufficient to cause rapid cell death. Contrary to our observations, a genetic uncoupling of ATP synthesis potentiated lethality in <italic>E. coli</italic>, indicating that enhanced respiration and ROS production is the dominant driver of efficacy for bactericidal antibiotics in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lobritz et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest similarities in the bacterial metabolic toolkit exploited by cidal antibiotics while targeting across genera, yet identify the differences in the pivotal component that drives cell death in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Therefore, the secondary mechanisms of lethality should be tested for a panel of bactericidal antibiotics, with distinct mode of action, across different bacterial pathogens, including <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, which is an intriguing lacuna of our study. Likewise, while we note the commonality in the involvement of ROS and ATP burst in fluoroquinolones and aminoglycoside action, we highlight that the extent of ROS and ATP’s contribution may differ between the two antibiotics. The levels of ROS produced were higher for norfloxacin, whereas the extent of ATP burst was greater for streptomycin, which demanded additional bedaquiline to suppress the streptomycin-induced ATP burst and killing.</p><p>Metal ion binding by ATP is a well-known phenomenon, where ATP forms a stable coordination complex with the divalent metal ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Distefano and Neuman, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan and Martell, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nanninga, 1957</xref>). We observed that co-supplementation with divalent metal ions rescued mycobacteria from the cidality of STR and NOR. Further, exogenous supplementation with ATP was found to cause bacteriostasis in various bacteria, including mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tatano et al., 2015</xref>). Based on this observation, we propose metal ion chelation and depletion by ATP burst as a novel bactericidal mechanism executed by antibiotics in mycobacteria. We have separately established that the depletion of Fe<sup>2+</sup> is lethal in mycobacteria, suggesting the essentiality of these cofactors for cell survival. Future studies should investigate the comprehensive mechanism of antimicrobial action of excessive ATP. For instance, a recent study found increased ATP levels generated upon aminoglycoside treatment resulting in ATP hydrolysis through the reversal of F<sub>0</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase activity, causing hyperpolarisation of the membrane and cell death in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruni and Kralj, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study fills a gap and expands the current understanding of how antibiotics ultimately cause cell death in the context of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Whether other bactericidal antibiotics employ ATP burst to mediate their lethality in pathogenic mycobacteria and other serious pathogens warrants further investigation. In conjunction, compounds that synthetically generate ATP burst should also be tested for antimycobacterial efficacy.</p><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is an outlier among multi-drug resistant pathogens due to its low recombination rate, limited genetic diversity, and absence of an accessory genome. Becoming a successful pathogen, despite its inability to rapidly evolve and withstand new antibiotics, alludes to the presence of an effective innate mechanism of resistance. Low fitness-cost mutational events causing transient antibiotic tolerance in the absence of a strong selective pressure precede and possibly boost successive qualitative mutations on antibiotic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kohanski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin-Reisman et al., 2017</xref>). In our observations, Mycobacterial counter responses included downregulation of central dogma and cell division processes, thereby reducing the vulnerability of the target and thus efficacy of the antibiotic. Reduction of the energy-consuming processes could reduce the anabolic demand and help decrease their energy metabolism, ROS production, and ATP synthesis. <sup>13</sup>C isotopomer analysis revealed rerouting of flux from alpha-ketoglutarate to glutamate-glutamine and GABA, bypassing the oxidative arm of the TCA cycle. We also measured an increased mutation frequency and the induction of Eis, demonstrating that the antibiotic-adapted population may facilitate the selection of drug-resistant mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kohanski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin-Reisman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schrader et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zaunbrecher et al., 2009</xref>). In summary, we observed that upon exposure to sub-inhibitory levels of antibiotics, Mycobacterium transiently switched to a quiescent state that could reduce its respiration, thus denying the antimicrobial effect of ROS and metal ion chelation by ATP. These findings could be used to develop antibiotic adjuvants that enhance aerobic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kitzenberg et al., 2022</xref>) and increase ROS-mediated damage and ATP production. Our study also advocates for a thorough understanding of the proximate and ultimate causes of antibiotic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baquero and Levin, 2021</xref>), in order to avoid drug combination with overlapping (secondary) actions and mechanism of tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, growth conditions</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> MC<sup>2</sup>155 (Msm) strain was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) supplemented with 2% glucose, 0.05% Tween-80 at 37 degree incubator at 200 rpm shaking or on Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with 2% glucose.

Results presented in Figure 9 clearly demonstrate that <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> attempt to reduce respiration by decreasing flux through the complete TCA cycle, thereby mitigating ROS and ATP production in response to antibiotics. Additionally, the bacterial response also included increased expression of the protein Eis, which is exemplar for intrinsic drug resistance, with a concomitant increase in mutation frequency, thereby hinting at the development of antibiotic tolerance followed by resistance. We still believe that these data should be included to support our observations and they make the study more comprehensive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors are trying to test the hypothesis that ATP bursts are the predominant driver of antibiotic lethality of Mycobacteria</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>No significant strengths in the current state as it is written.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A major weakness is that <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> has a doubling time of three hours and the authors are trying to conclude that their data would reflect the physiology of M. tuberculossi that has a doubling time of 24 hours.

Since this is <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, it would take no longer than two weeks to repeat this experiment and replace the figure. I understand that obtaining CFU counts is much more laborious than OD measurements but it is necessary. Your graph still says that there is 0 bacteria at time 0, yet in your legend it says you started with 600,000 CFU/ml. I don't understand why this experiment was not repeated with CFU counts measured throughout. This is not a big ask since this is <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> but it appears that the authors do not want to repeat this experiment. Minimally, fix the graph to represent the CFU.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s concern and have changed title of the manuscript by specifying <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> instead of Mycobacteria.</p><p>It is still not clear to the authors what the reviewer mean by OD measurements. All the data presented in the entire manuscript , including in Figure 1 are solely based on CFU measurements. So, as suggested by the reviewer, all experiments are already presented in terms of CFU.</p></body></sub-article></article>
