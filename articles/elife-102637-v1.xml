The exact etiology of UC remains elusive. Available evidence suggests that IBDs are caused by dysregulated immune responses against components of the microbiota and intestinal wall in genetically susceptible individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xavier and Podolsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang, 2020</xref>). The adaptive immunity is classically considered to play a major role in the pathogenesis of IBDs; however, accumulating evidence has shown that the innate immunity is equally as important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geremia et al., 2014</xref>). IBDs may result from impaired functioning of the intestinal innate immune system, which is comprised of the epithelial barrier and a variety of innate immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parikh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drury et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Na et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shale and Ghosh, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and Interleukin-3 (IL-3) are a group of hematopoietic growth factors for the myeloid lineage mainly functioning under inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dougan et al., 2019</xref>). They regulate various inflammatory responses that promote rapid clearance of pathogens while contribute to the persistence of chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dougan et al., 2019</xref>). Besides, these cytokines also mediate the cross-talk between innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dougan et al., 2019</xref>). The receptors for GM-CSF and IL-3, expressed on various immune cells, are both heteromers comprising a ligand-specific α subunit (CD116 and CD123, respectively) and a shared β common subunit (CD131) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dougan et al., 2019</xref>). The α chains provide specificity for the cytokines but bind with relatively low affinity, while their association with the β common chain provides high affinity necessary for effective downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broughton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The role of these cytokines in the pathogenesis of IBDs has been investigated but is still controversial. For instance, GM-CSF has been shown to deliver pleiotropic effects, either pro- or anti-inflammatory, on the intestinal inflammation depending on the cellular and cytokine milieu as well as disease model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castro-Dopico et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). The different results imply that additional factors influence the overall function of GM-CSF, including the expression and functional status of its receptor. For example, a previous study showed that IBD was characterized by impaired expression and function of CD116 in circulating granulocytes and monocytes, suggesting a defect in innate immunity in response to GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstein et al., 2011</xref>). Besides, in a genetic analysis of Ashkenazi Jewish populations that have a high prevalence of Crohn’s disease, a frameshift mutation in CSF2RB gene (encoding CD131) was shown associated with higher risk for Crohn’s disease and reduced monocyte signaling in response to GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuang et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, a better understanding of the effect of GM-CSF receptor in the pathogenesis of IBD is necessary.</p><p>Here, we investigated the role of CD131, the β common chain mediating the effects of GM-CSF and IL-3 signaling, in the pathogenesis of UC. We established murine colitis model by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water and compared the immune and inflammatory responses between wild-type and CD131-deficient mice. Besides, we analyzed clinical data and pathology specimens from UC patients to unravel its clinical significance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CD131 contributed to DSS-induced murine colitis</title><p>We firstly explored the change of <italic>Csf2rb</italic> gene (encoding CD131) expression in murine colon tissues in response to DSS administration in the drinking water by analyzing the gene expression dataset GSE22307 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2011</xref>).

The pleiotropic effects of the cytokines on intestinal inflammation suggest that additional factors influence their overall function, where the receptor may play a role. In the present study, we investigated the role of CD131 in the pathogenesis of UC, with the use of murine colitis model established by administration of DSS in the drinking water. By comparing the immune and inflammatory responses between wt and CD131-deficient mice, we found that CD131 contributed to DSS-induced murine colitis, which functioned in synergy with tissue-infiltrating macrophages. Besides, we also demonstrated that the effect of CD131 on chemotaxis of macrophages, together with T cells, was mediated by CCL4. In addition, we analyzed clinical data and pathology specimens from UC patients and found that CD131 was associated with the endoscopic and pathological severity of intestinal inflammation, as well as macrophage and T cell infiltration. Taken together, we demonstrated the pro-inflammatory effect of CD131 on murine colitis, which may have clinical significance.</p><p>There is currently no published study to date dedicated to investigating the role of CD131 in IBD. In a recent study investigating its ligand cytokine, IL-3, in the pathogenesis of UC, the authors showed that CD131 knock-out mice exhibited depressed neutrophil infiltration into the colon in response to DSS administration,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bénard et al., 2023</xref>) which was in accordance with our findings. Reduced neutrophil infiltration indicated milder inflammatory response; and we also showed less body weight loss and shortened colon length, less tissue destruction on histology sections, as well as lower inflammatory cytokine expression in the colonic tissues in CD131-deficient mice, which all suggested that CD131 contributed to the intestinal inflammation. Interestingly, however, another study found that activating the heteromer receptor formed by CD131 and erythropoietin receptor could exert potent anti-inflammatory effects and thus ameliorate experimental colitis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nairz et al., 2017</xref>). Obviously, the conversion from pro- to anti-inflammatory effects was attributable to the interaction between CD131 and erythropoietin receptor, and the underlying mechanism warrants further investigation. One concern about our findings was that our CD131-deficient mice were all heterozygous, while homozygous ones were fatal at an early stage. It appears that homozygous CD131-deficient mice were used by others;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nairz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rousselle et al., 2022</xref>) the gene knock-out manipulation of our mice might be different from theirs which accounts for the early fatality, but it is unknown. Nevertheless, we observed significantly lower <italic>Csf2rb</italic> mRNA expression in these mice, and performed repeated experiments to confirm our findings.</p><p>Macrophages are key players in inflammation which exert both pathogenic and protective functions depending on the subset differentiation and polarization in response to local microenvironment signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murray and Wynn, 2011</xref>). We showed that macrophages were elevated in the colonic tissues of DSS-treated wt mice, while depleting macrophages with clodronate liposomes was protective with respect to body weight loss, colon shortening, and inflammatory cytokine expression. These were consistent with the previous studies showing that macrophages contributed to murine colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pan et al., 2022</xref>). Of note, however, studies also indicated that M2-like macrophages were also present in the intestine to alleviate inflammation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bain and Mowat, 2014a</xref>) As simply defining the macrophages as M1 or M2 phenotypes is not readily suitable in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bain and Mowat, 2014a</xref>), we demonstrated elevated expression of TNF in intestinal macrophages in DSS-treated wt mice, suggesting a pro-inflammatory role and possibly predominance of M1-like phenotype in murine colitis. Besides, we showed that CD131 was expressed on colonic macrophages, as is already known,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dougan et al., 2019</xref>) which allows them to respond to the stimulation by cytokines GM-CSF and IL-3. By stimulating cultured murine macrophage cell line with rm-GM-CSF, we demonstrated elevated TNF expression, which indicated that CD131 signaling could exert pro-inflammatory effect. Thus, our results suggested that macrophages mediated the pro-inflammatory effect of CD131 on DSS-induced colitis in wt mice.</p><p>On the other hand, our CD131-deficient mice did not exhibit elevation in colon macrophages upon DSS administration, nor did these macrophages produce more TNF. Besides, the changes following macrophage depletion, as seen in wt mice, were absent in the CD131-deficient counterparts subjected to DSS administration. It is reasonable to believe that, as a result of lacking CD131, these mice were not able to effectively respond to GM-CSF and IL-3 stimulation. Therefore, the macrophage-mediated inflammatory response in the colonic tissues of DSS-treated wt mice was, at least in part, attributable to CD131 signaling. Our findings were consistent with previous studies showing that GM-CSF promoted pro-inflammatory function of macrophages and thus facilitated intestinal inflammation by various mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castro-Dopico et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Griseri et al., 2012</xref>), although these studies were not dedicated to the investigation of the function of CD131. Admittedly, our findings were limited by the fact that we did not have macrophage-specific CD131-deficient mice, therefore we could not confirm the effect of macrophage-specific CD131 on DSS-induced murine colitis, which awaits further investigations.</p><p>As macrophages and T cells were higher in the colonic tissues, but not in the blood, of DSS-treated wt mice instead of CD131-deficient ones, we speculated that a possible mechanism affecting the chemotactic process was involved. It is consistent with a previous study demonstrating that the circulating monocytes migrate to the intestine to maintain a normal intestinal macrophage pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2014b</xref>). CCL4, previously known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), is a chemokine produced in high amounts by monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Menten et al., 2002</xref>). CCL4 signals through its receptor CCR5, and is involved in the chemotaxis and trans-endothelial migration of monocytes, T cells, and other immune cells, which possibly contributes to local inflammatory response. It is in accordance with our findings that antagonizing CCL4 with antibodies resulted in decreased macrophage and T cell infiltration into the colon and alleviation of intestinal inflammation. We showed that the expression of CCL4 was elevated in colonic tissues of DSS-treated wt mice, but not their CD131-deficient counterparts. To the best of our knowledge, there is so far no study investigating the effect of CD131 signaling on chemokines like CCL4. One of the downstream signaling mechanisms of GM-CSF/IL-3 receptor complexes is the JAK2/STAT5 pathway, which controls the differentiation and inflammatory signature of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dougan et al., 2019</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that blocking SOCS3 on macrophages, a feedback inhibitor protein of JAK/STAT signaling pathway, resulted in enhanced and prolonged activation of JAK/STAT pathway, as well as elevated expression of M1 phenotype-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, the authors showed that mice with SOCS3-deficient macrophages experienced exacerbated Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis, which was associated with enhanced JAK/STAT pathway activation and increased plasma levels of cytokines/chemokines such as CCL4. Therefore, their results appear to support our findings that CD131 signaling could possibly contribute to the elevation of CCL4 expression. Of note, however, CD131 signaling might also contribute to the local proliferation of macrophages, as indicated by the accelerated proliferation of cultured macrophage cell line in response to GM-CSF stimulation, but apparently it warrants future investigation in colitis.</p><p>The major limitation of the present study is that we did not investigate the role of CD131 expressed on other immune cell populations. Apart from monocytes and macrophages, we also showed that CD131 was expressed at different levels on various cell types, as is already known from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dougan et al., 2019</xref>). Although the role of these cells in CD131-contributed intestinal inflammation needs to be investigated in future studies, the effect of CD131, in synergy with macrophages, on murine colitis is still important as shown in the present study. Besides, the functional status of CD131 molecule was not studied in the present work. Its ligand cytokine GM-CSF appears to exert pleiotropic effects in the intestine: although GM-CSF is generally accepted as a pro-inflammatory cytokine contributing to colitis, treatment with a recombinant human GM-CSF agent, sargramostim, has shown some benefit in Crohn’s disease patients.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dieckgraefe and Korzenik, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Korzenik et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valentine et al., 2009</xref>) This inconsistency raised the possibility that the functional status of the receptor molecules might play a role in the overall effect of GM-CSF stimulation. In support of this, a genetic analysis of Ashkenazi Jewish populations, which show a high prevalence of Crohn’s disease, demonstrates that monocytes from carriers of a frameshift mutation in CSF2RB gene exhibit reduced responses to GM-CSF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuang et al., 2016</xref>). It suggests that an intact wild-type CD131 molecule is essential in mediating proper response to GM-CSF treatment; nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms await further studies. Lastly, the present study may be limited by the low number of UC patients included in the analysis. Although we have a high volume of UC patients in our medical center, the need for surgical intervention is significantly decreased since the advent of biologicals. Those who did receive surgical treatment were generally suffering from severe colitis, which could explain the reason why CD131 expression had no significant correlation with clinical evaluation. Therefore, caution need to be exercised when interpreting the results of our patient cohort analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that CD131 and tissue-infiltrating macrophages synergistically contributed to DSS-induced murine colitis. Besides, CD131 may have promoted the chemotaxis of macrophages and T cells into the colon through CCL4. In addition, CD131 was associated with the endoscopic and pathological severity of intestinal inflammation in clinical UC patients. The present study provides a novel way to the understanding of the mechanisms of GM-CSF and IL-3 effects in the intestine, which will benefit the development of therapeutic approaches. For instance, as discussed above, IBD patients with a functionally intact wild-type CD131 receptor molecule may have better clinical responses to sargramostim treatment and should be selected for future clinical trials. Indeed, more insightful studies are needed to improve the understanding of GM-CSF-CD131 signaling in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, which may shed light on an alternative avenue of IBD therapy avoiding immunosuppression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human</title><p>This observational study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

The input genes were ranked by the Signal2Noise method. The gene sets database ‘m2.cp.v2023.2.Mm.symbols.gmt’ was chosen as the reference database. A pathway with false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-5"><title>DEGs analyses</title><p>The identification of DEGs between two study groups was performed by calculating TPM differences using limma package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). Genes with FDR &lt;0.05 and absolute log<sub>2</sub>(fold change [FC]) &gt;1 were considered as DEGs. As we were investigating the role of CD131 on murine colitis, we intersected the DEGs between wt groups and non-DEGs between CD131-deficient groups, and subjected the acquired genes to further analyses. The Gene Ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>) and KEGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</xref>) enrichment analyses were performed by subjecting the intersect gene lists to DAVID bioinformatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2009</xref>) to explore the main biological functions of these genes. The enrichment was considered significant at FDR &lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Gene microarray data analyses</title><p>We selected a human IBD gene expression dataset GSE179285 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keir et al., 2021</xref>) and a DSS-induced murine colitis gene expression dataset GSE22307 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2011</xref>) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edgar et al., 2002</xref>). In GSE179285 study, patients with IBD and healthy volunteers from multiple centers in North America were enrolled in separate studies, where in one cohort none of the patients were taking any medications for their disease, and in the other cohort none of the patients received treatment with investigational drugs or biologics within the previous 3 months. The normal intestinal tissues from healthy controls (<italic>n</italic> = 31), uninflamed (<italic>n</italic> = 32) and inflamed (<italic>n</italic> = 23) tissues from UC patients, as well as uninflamed (<italic>n</italic> = 121) and inflamed (<italic>n</italic> = 47) tissues from Crohn’s disease patients were collected during ileocolonoscopy. Total RNA was extracted from the intestinal tissues and gene expression profile was generated based on Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (GPL6480 platform) and uploaded by the research group. The Crohn’s disease patients were not included in our analysis. In GSE22307 study, C57BL/6J mice were given 3% DSS in the drinking water and the colon tissues were collected at days 0 (<italic>n</italic> = 5, control group euthanized prior to DSS treatment), 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 6), 4 (<italic>n</italic> = 6), and 6 (<italic>n</italic> = 6). Subsequently, total RNA was extracted from the colon tissues and gene expression profile was generated based on Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (GPL1261 platform) and uploaded by the research group. The normalized expression levels of genes of interest were extracted manually and analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to check for the Gaussian distribution of the data. For comparing between two groups, unpaired <italic>t</italic> test with or without Welch’s correction (when Gaussian distribution was assumed) or Mann–Whitney test (when Gaussian distribution was not assumed) was performed. The p values are two-tailed. For the comparison among three or more groups, the statistical methods included one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison correction (when Gaussian distribution was assumed) and Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison correction (when Gaussian distribution was not assumed). Adjusted p values are reported. All differences were considered statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation in bar graphs or a dot graph as appropriate. For correlation analysis between continuous variables, the Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) was determined, where rs &gt; 0.5 and p &lt; 0.05 were considered high correlation. For correlation analysis involving ordinal variables, the Kendall’s tau-b coefficient (<italic>τ</italic>) was determined.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All protocols involving human subjects were approved by the Institutional Review Board (#2023PS953K), while written informed consent was exempted as only retrospective, de-identified clinical data and archival pathology specimens were used without jeopardizing the clinical treatment of the patients.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>All protocols for animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#2022PS856K).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) pathway analysis of colon tissues between wt and CD131-deficient mice.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102637-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>List of intersected differentially expressed genes (DEGs).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102637-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the intersected, up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102637-supp3-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the intersected, down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102637-supp4-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of the intersected, up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102637-supp5-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of the intersected, down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102637-supp6-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp7"><label>Supplementary file 7.</label><caption><title>Demographic and clinical data of ulcerative colitis patients.</title><p>ESR: erythrocyte sedimentation rate;

By comparing wild-type and CD131-deficient mice, the authors demonstrate that CD131 contributes to DSS-induced colitis, working in concert with tissue-infiltrating macrophages.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The research shows that CD131's influence on macrophage and T cell chemotaxis is mediated by CCL4. The authors conclude by proposing a pro-inflammatory role for CD131 in murine colitis and suggest potential clinical relevance in human inflammatory bowel disease.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The statistical association between increased CD131 expression and clinical IBD was not observed in Table 1, indicating that the main results from animal experiments were not reproduced in human subjects. Additionally, due to the absence of experimental results regarding the downstream signaling pathways through CD131, it is difficult to infer the precise differentiated outcomes of this study. Furthermore, the effects of CD131 on immune cells other than macrophages were not presented, and the results specific to macrophage-selective CD131 were not shown. Therefore, I conclude that it is challenging to provide a detailed review as there is a lack of supporting evidence for the core arguments made in this paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102637.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates the potential role of CD131, a cytokine receptor subunit shared by GM-CSF and IL-3, in intestinal inflammation. Using heterozygous mice with an inactivating mutation on this gene, the study demonstrates ameliorated inflammation, associated with less infiltration of macrophages. Moreover, the depletion of macrophages prevented many of the inflammatory effects of DSS and made both WT and mutant mice equivalent in terms of inflammation severity. Correlative data showing increased CD131+ cells in tissues of patients with ulcerative colitis is also demonstrating, evidence for plausibility for these pathways in human disease.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The phenotype of mutant mice seems quite robust and the pathways proposed, GM-CSF signaling in macrophages with CCL4 as a downstream pathway, are all plausible and concordant with existing models. Many of the experiments included meaningful endpoints and were overall well performed.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Experimental rigor was lacking in this manuscript, which provided limited or no details on the number of independent iterations that each experiment was done, the number of animals per group, the number of technical or biological replicates in each graph, etc.</p><p>(2) Details of animal model validation showing that this particular mutant allele results in a lack of CD131 protein expression were not shown. Moreover, since the paper uses heterozygous mice, it is critical to show that at the protein level, there is indeed reduced expression of CD131 in het mice compared to controls (many heterozygous states do not lead to appreciable protein depletion).</p><p>(3) Another major weakness is that the paper asserts a causal relationship between CD131 signaling and CCL4 production: the data shown indicates that the phenotypes of CCL4 deficiency (through Ab blockade) and CD131 partial deficiency (in het mice) are similar. However, this does not establish that CD131 signaling acts through CCL4.</p><p>(4) Lastly, while the paper claims that CD131 acts through macrophage recruitment, the evidence is circumstantial and not direct. DSS-induced acute colitis is largely mediated by macrophages, so any manipulation associated with less severe inflammation is accompanied by lesser macrophage infiltration in this model: this does not directly establish that CD131 acts directly on macrophages, which would require cell-specific knockout or complex cell reconstitution experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102637.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Zhiyuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenyang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Lindi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenyang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Chenchen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>shengjing hospital of china medical university</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">shenyang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenyang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yun</surname><given-names>Duo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Friendship Hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Junliang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenyang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhihao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenyang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wenjun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenyang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lv</surname><given-names>Qingjie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenyang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenyang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p><bold>Our response to Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of our work. Whether the effect of GM-CSF/IL-3 on the bowel is pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory has been controversial. In the present study, we have shown that CD131 mediated a pro-inflammatory effect of GM-CSF on the intestine, which may have worked in synergy with tissue-infiltrating macrophages. While its down-stream signaling has been investigated back and forth, we did not put effort into it. Using macrophage-specific CD131-deficient animals is important to clarify the effects of macrophage-specific CD131 on bowel inflammation. Our present work is indeed incomplete, and we anticipate to work on it further in future research. Concerning the results on human subjects, it is indeed that results from animal experiments were not completely reproduced. We believe that CD131 does have an effect on ulcerative colitis; however, due to the use of biological agents (e.g. anti-TNFs), the need for surgery in the treatment of ulcerative colitis has dramatically decreased and we could not get enough samples to reach a more convincing statistical analysis. Twenty-nine patients shown in the present study were all that received surgical intervention at our center during the past decade, and more human subjects will be needed in future research, possibly from multi-center study.</p><p><bold>Our response to Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Many appreciations for the valuable reviewer’s comments and suggestions. We realized that the number of animals per group was not indicated in each figure; in order to clarify the experimental rigor, we have deposited data used to generate the results of the present study in Dryad. Concerning the heterozygous CD131 knock-out animals, we think that others have used the homozygous mice in their studies; however, we observed premature deaths in those animals and we could not get any single homozygous mouse. We could not tell the exact reason, but we did observe robust phenotypes in these heterozygous mice. We do realize that our present work is incomplete, and more experiments need to be done to establish a causal relationship between CD131 and down-stream effects. We anticipate to use macrophage-specific homozygous CD131-deficient mice in our future research, which we believe will produce more meaningful and convincing results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
