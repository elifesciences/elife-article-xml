The strong interactions between SNARE domains are clearly important in membrane fusion, but it is unclear whether they are involved in any other cellular processes. Here, we analyzed two classical SNARE proteins, syntaxin 1A and SNAP25. Although they are supposed to be engaged in tight complexes, we surprisingly find them largely segregated in the plasma membrane. Syntaxin 1A only occupies a small fraction of the plasma membrane area. Yet, we find it is able to redistribute the far more abundant SNAP25 on the mesoscale by gathering crowds of SNAP25 molecules onto syntaxin clusters in a SNARE-domain-dependent manner. Our data suggest that SNARE domain interactions are not only involved in driving membrane fusion on the nanoscale, but also play an important role in controlling the general organization of proteins on the mesoscale. Further, we propose these mechanisms preserve active syntaxin 1A–SNAP25 complexes at the plasma membrane.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>protein-nanoclustering</kwd><kwd>microdomains</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Number 112927078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>Thorsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SNARE–SNARE interactions that have previously only been proposed to participate in membrane fusion on the nanoscale also serve to organize SNARE domains on the mesoscale.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Molecular crowding is a basic feature of biological cells. In some cellular regions, the volume occupied by macromolecules even exceeds that taken by solvating water molecules. Theoretical simulations and in vitro studies suggest that molecular crowding influences thermodynamic equilibria, increases macromolecule activity, promotes molecule assembly, diminishes diffusion rates, and limits steric accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). This implies that in crowded environments macromolecules behave no longer like freely diffusing, single-molecular species.</p><p>Molecular crowding routinely occurs in cells wherever large supramolecular assemblies form. Already more than 30 years ago, the plasma membrane has been recognized as a crowded cellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ryan et al., 1988</xref>). It is constituted of scattered protein-rich and protein-poor regions, each covering roughly half of the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lillemeier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saka et al., 2014</xref>). In mitochondrial membranes, electrophoretic protein migration into a single, maximally crowded patch shows that half of the membrane volume is occupied by proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sowers and Hackenbrock, 1981</xref>). These protein-rich regions consist of closely associated membrane domains/protein clusters and are referred to as multi-protein assemblies. Some, not yet understood organization principles on the mesoscale determines that different protein types prefer different locations within these multi-protein assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saka et al., 2014</xref>). However, a higher level of understanding is difficult to achieve, because these cellular structures are not susceptible to crystallographic analysis, and the high protein density limits mapping of the molecule distribution by fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>Two proteins organized in such multi-protein assemblies are the classical SNAREs syntaxin 1A and SNAP25. Together with the vesicle-associated SNARE synaptobrevin 2/VAMP they mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunger et al., 2019</xref>). To this end, their SNARE domains assemble into a tight bundle during which the opposed membranes are pulled together until fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stein et al., 2009</xref>), a process that is highly regulated by accessory proteins, such as Munc18.</p><p>Syntaxin 1A is a single-span transmembrane protein with no extracellular segment. Intracellularly, a compact folded N-terminal domain is connected via a long unstructured segment to a SNARE domain, that is attached to the transmembrane segment via a short poly-basic linker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rizo and Xu, 2015</xref>; see also Figure 6). Syntaxin 1A concentrates in clusters exhibiting a high packing density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sieber et al., 2007</xref>). The number of molecules per syntaxin cluster has been estimated by three groups employing different approaches. First, a modelling approach based on (1) the experimentally determined cluster density, (2) the molecule copy number per cell, and (3) the diffusion rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sieber et al., 2007</xref>). Second, quantification of fluorescence arising from single clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knowles et al., 2010</xref>), and third, counting of clustered molecules by PALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rickman et al., 2010</xref>). All studies come to the conclusion that a cluster harbours several dozens of molecules that concentrate on a spot smaller than 100 nm in diameter. Moreover, dSTORM imaging shows that the density of molecules decreases from the cluster centre to its periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-On et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Clustering occurs at least through two mechanisms. On the one hand, ionic interactions between the polybasic linker region and PIP<sub>2</sub> sequesters the protein into larger, less-densely packed, and more dynamic clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Merklinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van den Bogaart et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, the SNARE domain immobilizes the protein by packing the molecules more densely into smaller clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Merklinger et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Like syntaxin 1A, SNAP25 is not homogenously distributed, but its clusters are less pronounced, most likely because they are not forming via the above described two mechanisms involving ‘lipid-mediated pre-clustering’ and ‘cluster tightening by protein–protein interactions’. Instead, SNAP25/SNAP23 enrichment in crowds is only dependent on cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chamberlain and Gould, 2002</xref>) and clustering is not further increased by homophilic SNARE-domain interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halemani et al., 2010</xref>). One study found dense ensembles of 40–50 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rickman et al., 2010</xref>), another study suggested that 50–70 SNAP25 molecules accumulate at secretory vesicle docking sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knowles et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, dSTORM imaging suggests that also in SNAP25 clusters, that are larger and more elliptical than syntaxin 1A clusters, the molecule density diminishes in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-On et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to syntaxin 1A, SNAP25 has a second SNARE domain, but neither a large N-terminal domain nor a transmembrane region. Instead, it is anchored to the cell membrane by palmitoylation of a cysteine-rich segment located within the linker region that connects the SNARE domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greaves et al., 2010</xref>; see also Figure 6). Different from the SNARE domain of syntaxin 1A, the SNARE domains of SNAP25 are not helical in the isolated protein, yet they become helical in SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fasshauer et al., 1997</xref>). Taken together, both proteins, even though very different in structure, form crowds of similar copy number.</p><p>An interaction between the first SNARE domain of SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A diminishes SNAP25 mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halemani et al., 2010</xref>), indicating that the two plasmalemmal SNAREs, as expected, associate. However, microscopy finds no perfect overlap between syntaxin 1A and SNAP25 in neuroendocrine cells and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nagy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pertsinidis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rickman et al., 2010</xref>; for one exception in chromaffin cells see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rickman et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Here, we study the lateral distribution of syntaxin 1A and SNAP25 in the plasma membrane. We find that both proteins, although forming tight complexes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</xref>), are highly segregated in entities, and that these entities organize specifically via SNARE–SNARE interactions. Because syntaxin 1A is able to determine the distribution of an excess of SNAP25, we propose the syntaxin 1A/SNAP25 entities largely preserve their internal architecture and interact only at their peripheries.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>For studying membrane protein distribution, we employ super-resolution STED (stimulated emission depletion) microscopy, a technique dependent on fluorescent labelling of the target under study. In the crowded environment of the cell membrane, the accessibility of binding probes to SNAP25 is limited, such that antibody labelling only imperfectly visualizes the distribution of SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zilly et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, genetic labelling by attaching GFP (green fluorescent protein) to its N-terminus is required, which does not affect the protein’s function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delgado-Martínez et al., 2007</xref>). Due to the rigid structure of GFP and its molecular size being similar to that of SNAP25, we aimed for labelling only about half of all SNAP25 molecules by GFP-SNAP25 expression, as 100% labelling may interfere with SNAP25 crowding. To test how syntaxin clusters affect the SNAP25 distribution, we express additional syntaxin 1A (Stx-full), or a syntaxin 1A deletion variant being less efficient in forming syntaxin clusters (Stx-ΔS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Merklinger et al., 2017</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ratio between SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A</title><p>In the P12 cells used in this study, the SNAP25 copy number exceeds the one of syntaxin 1A by 12-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), a value in fair agreement with a previously reported 14-fold excess in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knowles et al., 2010</xref>). To make sure that also in our co-expression experiments SNAP25 is more abundant than syntaxin 1A, we analyzed by Western Blot the levels of the expressed constructs in relation to endogenous proteins. We find that expression of GFP-SNAP25 alone or together with Stx-full/Stx-ΔS does not change the endogenous levels of SNAP25 or syntaxin 1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, E</xref>). Moreover, trafficking of GFP-SNAP25 to the cell membrane is not affected by co-expression of Stx-full/Stx-ΔS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). GFP-SNAP25 expression leads to a ~30–50% increase of total SNAP25 (endogenous SNAP25+ GFP-SNAP25) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and expression of Stx-full more than doubles the total syntaxin 1A level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>); Stx-ΔS is equally high expressed as Stx-full (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (for equal Stx-full and Stx-ΔS trafficking to the plasma membrane, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Merklinger et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, in whole cells, SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A are elevated by roughly 50% and 150%, respectively, which diminishes the physiological SNAP25:syntaxin 1A ratio from 12- to 7-fold. Assuming like Knowles et al. that all syntaxin 1A but only 80 % of SNAP25 localize to the plasma membrane, specifically in the plasma membrane, the ratio diminishes by 40% (from 10- to 6-fold). This value, however, is an average including non-transfected and overexpressing cells. To find out the ratio in the plasma membrane of transfected cells, cells were unroofed by a brief ultrasound pulse, leaving behind flat, glass-adhered plasma membrane sheets that are stained for total/overexpressed SNAREs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, at the plasma membrane, SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A are elevated over endogenous levels at most to 4- and 9-fold, respectively, which reduces the SNAP25:syntaxin 1A ratio maximally to 4-fold. In membrane sheets from the middle expression range, the ratio diminishes less, to about 5-fold, showing that SNAP25 still largely exceeds the concentration of syntaxin 1A in our experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression levels of endogenous SNAREs and overexpressed GFP-SNAP25, Stx-full, and Stx-ΔS.</title><p>PC12 cells are transfected with GFP-SNAP25 alone or in combination with Stx-full/Stx-ΔS.

Moreover, SNAP25 clustering reduced the emission of its attached fluorescent protein, most likely due to self-quenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zilly et al., 2011</xref>), an effect described to occur in GFP-labelled oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ochiishi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>). In the following, we test whether elevation of syntaxin 1A has any influence on the conformational state of SNAP25, possibly reducing its antibody accessibility. It should be noted that syntaxin 1A binds to the SNARE domains of SNAP25 and by this may prevent antibody binding to SNAP25 independent from the SNAP25 packing state. Therefore, we probed the molecular accessibility by targeting the GFP-tag instead of the SNARE domain using a fluorescent-labelled anti-GFP nanobody. As a fluorophore we selected ATTO647, because in contrast to GFP it is suitable for STED microscopy, allowing us to use the same samples for studying the mesoscale organization at super-resolution (see below).</p><p>Accessibility to SNAP25 was analyzed specifically in the plasma membrane employing membrane sheets that are fixed, stained, and imaged by epifluorescence microscopy. High overlap between the signal arising from GFP and the GFP-bound nanobody indicates that the nanobody reliably reports the overall distribution of GFP-SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Plotting the nanobody- against GFP-SNAP25 signal from individual membrane sheets (control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; see black regression line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) shows that nanobody binding positively correlates with the GFP-SNAP25 expression level. Expressing additional syntaxin (Stx-full), the slope of the regression line is much smaller (magenta line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). That under this condition the same number of GFP molecules correlates with a lower intensity in the ATTO647 channel suggests that syntaxin 1A decreases the accessibility of the nanobody to the GFP-tag of SNAP25. This observation is further supported by a trend towards a smaller Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between GFP and ATTO647 that decreases from 0.73 to 0.62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Finally, we also find a diminishment of the average GFP intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), pointing to the possibility of GFP self-quenching. Together, the three analyzed parameters all support the view that an elevation of syntaxin 1A is associated with a change in the packing state of SNAP25.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Syntaxin 1A overexpression reduces nanobody accessibility to GFP-SNAP25.</title><p>Cells from the same preparations as used for Western Blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were unroofed, leaving behind glass-adhered plasma membrane sheets that are fixed and stained with an ATTO647-labelled GFP nanobody.

None of these changes is observed upon expression of Stx-ΔS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that they depend on a fully functional syntaxin 1A SNARE motif.</p><p>Overexpression of both Stx-full and Stx-ΔS doubles the PCC between the syntaxin and the SNAP25 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, see values stated in the overlay images). This is counterintuitive when assuming that only Stx-full has an effect on SNAP25 distribution, but can be explained. Overexpression of Stx-full and Stx-ΔS each strongly increases the number of syntaxin maxima at a specific distance from SNAP25 maxima (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In accordance with this we observe substantial shortening of the distance between a SNAP25 and its nearest syntaxin maxima (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This results under both conditions in an increase of the overlap between the syntaxin and SNAP25 channels, finally leading to similar increases in the PCC.</p><p>Altogether, the data suggest that syntaxin clusters recruit the more widespread distributing SNAP25 crowds via the syntaxin 1A SNARE domain, whereas Stx-ΔS clusters only intermingle with SNAP25 crowds without changing their distribution.</p><p>SNAP25 has two SNARE domains that are integral part of the ternary SNARE complex forming during membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stein et al., 2009</xref>).

Moreover, SNAP25-WT showed the highest PCC with the syntaxin channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). A significant decrease in the PCC and the rSDM is observed upon deletion of the N-terminal SNARE domain in the constructs SNAP25-ΔN and SNAP25-ΔN/C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>). It should be noted that the rSDM decreases with higher mean intensity, raising the possibility that the rSDM of SNAP25-WT is only larger because its signal intensity is lower. However, this is not the case, because when similar intensities are compared on the level of individual membrane sheets, the rSDM of SNAP25-WT is larger than the one of SNAP25-ΔN/C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, see magnified view). Analyzing the number of syntaxin 1A maxima at a specific distance from SNAP25 maxima and the probability density function analysis undermines the PCC and rSDM results. Smallest distances between maxima in the syntaxin and SNAP25 channels are most frequent when SNAP25-WT is expressed, followed by SNAP25-ΔC, and SNAP25-ΔN/SNAP25-ΔN/C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Hence, the N-terminal SNARE-domain of SNAP25 is required for recruitment to syntaxin clusters. Higher fluorescence intensities of SNAP25-ΔN and SNAP25-ΔN/C (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) can be explained by better molecular accessibility to the nanobody because of less/no recruitment to syntaxin clusters.</p><p>We also wondered whether the SNARE domains are sufficient for mesoscale organization, or if perhaps Munc18 influences mesoscale organization by controlling the syntaxin 1A/SNAP25 interaction (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhardt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rickman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weninger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zilly et al., 2006</xref>). Membrane sheets from cells expressing GFP-SNAP25 were incubated for 15 min with control buffer or 6 µM Munc18, fixed, stained, and analyzed by STED microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). As previously reported, incubation of membrane sheets causes syntaxin 1A patching, resulting in a more clustered pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zilly et al., 2011</xref>). This is noted in a trend towards a lower number of maxima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-On et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, SNAP25 maxima appear unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Hence, addition of Munc18 has no significant effect on the rSDM and the maxima per µm<sup>2</sup> and consequently appears to have no influence on the SNAP25 mesoscale distribution, although it may have one on the nanoscale organization (e.g. the formation of complexes between single syntaxin 1A and Munc18 proteins).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Visualization of proteins by fluorescent labelling and the interpretation of staining patterns</title><p>For studying the subcellular distribution of biomolecules at nanoscale resolution, specific fluorescent labelling is inevitable. Under ideal conditions, each copy of a specific protein is labelled by a single fluorophore, and each fluorophore is detected with equal efficiency. However, this cannot be realized in tightly packed crowds in which the epitope for labelling is obscured and not accessible to binding probes. Turning to GFP, genetic labelling allows for 100 % labelling efficiency. However, apart from the possibility that GFP may affect molecule packing, self-quenching of close (e.g. less than 5 nm) fluorophores results in signal underestimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ochiishi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, not all molecules in a tightly packed crowd are detected.</p><p>In our experiments, we observe different signal intensities at the same molecule number. Regarding GFP-SNAP25, the ratio between nanobody and GFP intensity is reduced upon overexpression of syntaxin 1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We argue that the change in nanobody intensity is caused by differences in GFP accessibility that most likely decreases due to shielding by syntaxin 1A’s N-terminal domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Yet, we cannot rule out a component of ATTO647-fluorophore quenching if two nanobodies get very close. In addition, we may underestimate GFP intensity due to self-quenching (see trend towards lower GFP intensity upon overexpression of syntaxin 1A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). On the other hand, Stx-ΔS labelling yields a larger staining intensity than Stx-full labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Merklinger et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, we deal for each protein with a unique relationship between packing state/conformational change and signal intensity. However, the lateral changes in the SNAP25 distribution cannot be explained by distortions in the visualization of proteins and are due to syntaxin 1A-mediated changes in its organization. Therefore, we can safely conclude that upon overexpression of syntaxin 1A the signal of SNAP25 becomes dimmer and more clustered because SNAP25 crowds are recruited to syntaxin clusters via a SNARE–SNARE interaction.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of SNAP25 crowd recruitment to a syntaxin 1A cluster.</title><p>Syntaxin 1A molecules form tightly packed clusters resembling a bunch of flowers. SNAP25 is enriched in cholesterol-dependent lipid phases (shaded membrane). In the unbound crowd (right), the GFP-tags are able to move freely. Hence, it is less likely that two GFPs are close enough for self-quenching. Moreover, in the unbound crowd all GFPs are accessible to the nanobody. This is different in the bound crowd (left). Here, the N-terminal SNARE domain of SNAP25 interacts with the surface of the syntaxin 1A cluster, positioning the crowd close to the trunk such that some of the GFP-tags are shielded under the cluster’s roof and are no longer accessible to nanobody binding. The GFPs pack more densely and are immobilized, which promotes self-quenching (see grey GFP barrel). One syntaxin 1A cluster can recruit several SNAP25 crowds, explaining how syntaxin controls a surplus of SNAP25. The legend shows the binding probes, GFP-SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A.

Many studies describe the presence of various membrane proteins being organized in structures referred to as rafts, membrane microdomains, or clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Destainville et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>). When comparing the distribution of ‘all proteins’ to ‘a specific protein’ one finds that proteins are either in protein-rich or depleted areas, and within the protein-rich area, a specific protein forms its own cluster at a preferential position, known as the mesoscale organization of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saka et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We find that the mesoscale organization can be explained by specific interactions between protein crowds. In the case of syntaxin 1A and SNAP25, each protein tends to form its own crowd. While SNAP25 crowds are more diffuse in appearance, syntaxin 1A forms tighter crowds (clusters) that recruit SNAP25 crowds via the SNARE domain, and by this, SNAP25 becomes less uniformly distributed, as noticed in a larger rSDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We estimate that in our experiments the physiological SNAP25:syntaxin 1A ratio is roughly halved from 10- to 5-fold. However, the rSDM increase is not related to the diminishment of the physiological ratio, or an increase in SNARE concentration, because as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>, we do not observe a trend towards larger rSDMs upon stronger overexpression.</p><p>Using SNAP25 deletion constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we further specify that for recruitment the N-terminal SNARE domain of SNAP25 is relevant, whereas deletion of the C-terminal domain has no significant effect, although trends towards a smaller PCC/rSDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>) and a diminishment of short distances between SNAP25 and syntaxin particles are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In SNAP25 mobility measurements employing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), the same SNAP25 constructs showed that overexpression of syntaxin 1A slows down SNAP25 diffusion only if the N-terminal SNARE domain is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halemani et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, syntaxin 1A clusters associate with SNAP25 via the N-terminal SNARE domain which is noticed in a higher PCC/rSDM in super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>) and a slower SNAP25 diffusion in FRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halemani et al., 2010</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Setting aside the mesoscale organization and considering the nanoscale organization, what could the internal molecular anatomy of the syntaxin 1A/SNAP25 assemblies be? One possibility would be that only molecules at the border of the entities interact. In single-molecule localization experiments, the molecule concentration thins out towards the periphery, both in syntaxin 1A and SNAP25 entities, which is why syntaxin 1A–SNAP25 complexes could form in areas of lower packing around the core of syntaxin clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-On et al., 2012</xref>). In a simplified view, in this scenario we deal with two syntaxin cluster phases, a pure cluster core and a cluster annulus containing heteromeric complexes. However, there may be no annulus. Instead, the syntaxin-cluster trunk could constitute a tight oligomeric bundle of alpha-helical SNARE-domains, serving as a binding surface for SNAP25. The SNARE domain of SNAP25 could zipper into one of the grooves of the trunk, becoming alpha-helical as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), similar to the SNARE-zippering reaction upon SNARE-complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). This model is supported by the finding that in the above-mentioned FRAP measurement, SNAP25 mobility increases after introducing helix breakers into the N-terminal SNARE domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halemani et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>An alternative scenario would be clustering of binary syntaxin 1A–SNAP25 complexes, in other words, there are no longer distinguishable syntaxin 1A and SNAP25 entities. This interpretation is challenged by the following two arguments. First, microscopic overlap between syntaxin clusters and SNAP25 crowds is only partial in the sense that they do not overlap concentrically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halemani et al., 2010</xref>). In single-molecule imaging experiments, the majority of SNARE molecules are located in clusters and about half of the clustered syntaxin or SNAP25 molecules overlap with the nearest SNAP25 or syntaxin cluster, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pertsinidis et al., 2013</xref>). Regarding the high abundancy of SNAP25 in PC12 cells, one may not expect half of the SNAP25 crowds in close proximity to syntaxin clusters. However, it should be noted that in Pertsinidis et al. mouse hippocampal neurons were used and that in a similar sample (rat synaptosomes) SNAP25 is only slightly more abundant than syntaxin 1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilhelm et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, as Pertsinidis et al. point out, not all molecules present may be detected, because steric hindrance does not allow binding of an antibody to every molecule in the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pertsinidis et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the large fraction of SNAP25 being close to syntaxin clusters can also be explained by several SNAP25 crowds gathering around one syntaxin cluster. In any case, analyzing overlap between two types of densely packed molecules is technically limited and provides no definite answer. For this reason, the following second argument is more conclusive. SNAP25 exceeds the concentration of syntaxin 1A, in the condition Stx-full roughly still about 5-fold (see above). If clusters would be large oligomers of syntaxin–SNAP25 complexes, in the condition Stx-full, 80 % of SNAP25 should not respond to syntaxin 1A overexpression. The strong effect we observe suggests that only a few molecules from the SNAP25 crowds directly interact with syntaxin clusters. Therefore, SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A entities may largely preserve their identities, interacting only at their peripheries. However, under certain conditions the excess of SNAP25 may be just too large to be controlled by syntaxin 1A. For instance, in the control of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, in which only SNAP25 is elevated, the cellular SNAP25:syntaxin 1A ratio is expected to increase up to 20- to 30-fold (the 10-fold physiological ratio doubles/triples using membrane sheets from the middle expression range, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Under this condition, the endogenous syntaxin 1A is no longer capable of re-organizing the majority of SNAP25, explaining why SNAP25 is spread all over the membrane, also in areas lacking any syntaxin 1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, upper row).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Possible impact of mesoscale organization on the SNARE-assembly pathway</title><p>In cell-free experiments, several types of syntaxin 1A/SNAP25 complexes form. An early report found that two syntaxin and one SNAP25 molecule assemble into a tight 2:1 ([syntaxin 1A]<sub>2</sub>:SNAP25) complex considered to be an ‘off-pathway’ dead-end-complex actually inhibiting the fusion reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fasshauer and Margittai, 2004</xref>). In liposome fusion assays, fusion rates increase when the 2:1 complex is avoided by using a small fragment of synaptobrevin for stabilizing a 1:1 complex, that acts as an acceptor of synaptobrevin from the liposome destined to fuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pobbati et al., 2006</xref>). The current view is that the 1:1 complex acts as an acceptor of synaptobrevin in vivo as well. This raises the question, how can unfavourable complexes in the plasma membrane be avoided? The law of mass action predicts that the more SNAP25 is available, the less (syntaxin 1A)<sub>2</sub>:SNAP25 form. It has been previously suggested that more abundant SNAP25 disfavours the 2:1 complex and that differences in the clustering mechanisms between SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A increases the ratio between reactive SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halemani et al., 2010</xref>). Our study undermines this theory. In accordance with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knowles et al., 2010</xref>) we find that in PC12 cells, aside from possible clustering effects, SNAP25 is manifold more abundant than syntaxin 1A. Hence, clustering in combination with the mesoscale organization could increase the abundancy of 1:1 ‘on-pathway’ and minimize 2:1 ‘off-pathway’ complexes, which could have a positive effect on the formation of fusion-relevant complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Molecular crowding in biological matter</title><p>‘Like attracts like’ is often observed in nature, from atoms to galaxies. With respect to cellular architectures, macromolecules tend to flock together beginning with the formation of dimers that may grow to larger oligomers. This localizes different species into different crowds, but in order to interact they have to get together. How this happens for SNAREs is revealed by our study. Compared to cell-free experiments in the absence of mesoscale organization, interacting crowds in the plasma membrane may preclude or favour specific reaction pathways. Hence, mesoscale organization of proteins is a cellular characteristics that could control protein assembly pathways in a crowded environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PC12 cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other, <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weber et al., 2017</xref><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Rolf Heumann (Bochum, Germany), similar to clone 251;

After background correction, from each ROI’s mean intensity and size the integrated density was calculated.

For SNAP25 noise reduction was necessary. To this end images were smoothed with a Gaussian blur (<italic>σ</italic> = 0.5) prior to analysis to reduce pixel noise and thereby improve maxima detection. The coordinates of detected maxima were used for maxima size analysis. The maxima size was determined by applying a vertical and a horizontal 31 × 3 pixel linescan at the maxima position. A Gaussian function was fitted to the intensity distribution. The full width at half maximum of the Gaussian was taken as maxima size. Depending on the best fit quality, the size value was taken either from the horizontal or vertical linescan. Maxima with a fit quality of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.8 and a non-centred peak (not in the middle third of the linescan) were excluded. For each individual membrane sheet, all size values were averaged.

For SNAP25, we calculated the relative standard deviation of the mean (rSDM), which is a parameter describing the degree of clustering (previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zilly et al., 2011</xref>). To this end, the standard deviation of the mean intensity was determined and related to the mean intensity. Box plots were created using the program GraphPad Prism.</p><p>The PCC describes the linear relationship between two variables and was calculated using ImageJ. The same ROIs used for the rSDM were also used to measure the PCC between two channels. As a co-localization control, to mimic a non-related distribution between the two channels, one channel was flipped vertically and horizontally before determining the control PCC (‘flipped’). For epifluorescence microscopy, squared ROIs where placed on the plasma membrane sheets only if they covered a reasonably large fraction of the plasma membrane area. Due to the low magnification in the recordings and the irregular shape of the membrane sheets, much less data points were obtained in comparison to the measurement of the average intensity using a binary mask (see above).</p><p>The pair distribution functions, radial maxima statistics, and distances to nearest neighbours were computed from the list of maxima positions (coordinates of SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A maxima extracted from the custom written ImageJ macro which was used for STED micrograph analysis) using MATLAB. We computed distances between maxima of similar and different types. As references, we consider ideal gases with the same maxima densities. As in ideal gases the locations of particles are uniformly randomly distributed, a comparison provides information about the structure of distributions, for example, the enrichment of short distances. For the computation of the different statistics only particles at sufficient distance from the slide boundaries were considered.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5"

The degree of co-localization increases as the syntaxin concentration is increased (relative to that of SNAP-25), and this increase depends on the two SNARE domains of SNAP-25, in particular on the N-terminal domain. When Munc18 is added to the plasma membrane sheets, little effect is observed on the syntaxin and SNAP-25 co-localization.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Among the new findings is an increase in the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) when syntaxin is over-expressed (Figure 4A). It is surprising that PCC increases even further when syntaxin-deltaS is over-expressed, consider that the interaction between syntaxin-deltaS and SNAP-25 is reduced (Figure 3). The authors attribute this to an increase in syntaxin clustering without a change in SNAP-25 distribution. However, if so, the radial pair distribution function should be similar at shorter distances. Please calculate pair distribution functions for all images shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6.</p><p>2. Figure 6 suggests that addition of Munc18 does not change the distribution of SNAP-25 and syntaxin. As mentioned above, please calculate the pair distribution functions for SNAP-25 and syntaxin. More importantly, however, the apparent lack of an effect of Munc18 is perhaps not so surprising. First, Pertsinidis et al., (2013) found Munc18 near SNAP-25 and syntaxin. Thus, addition of Munc18 is not expected to alter the distribution of SNAP-25 and syntaxin unless Munc18 was knocked out in the PC12 cultures. Second, if SNAP-25 and syntaxin were to form complexes in the membrane sheets, they have to be disassembled first by the action of NSF/SNAP (Ma et al., Science 339, 421-425, 2013; Lai et al., Neuron 95, 591-607 2017; Choi et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 7, e36497, 2018). Thus, ideally, to make this experiment interesting, endogenous Munc18 should be deleted, or, NSF/SNAP/ATP should be added to the membrane sheets. In the absence of such additional experiments, the conclusions drawn from this experiment need to be substantially toned down.</p><p>3. The authors have published several articles addressing the mobility of SNAREs in similar membranes. Did they (or colleagues in the literature) encounter also mobility changes in SNAP25, in relation to the expression of sytaxin 1?</p><p>4. Is the correlation coefficient between syntaxin-deltaS and SNAP25 significantly larger in Figure 4 than that for syntaxin-full length over-expression? If so, this would be counterintuitive.</p><p>5. Although the authors go to significant lengths to ensure at population averaged levels exogenous Syntaxin1A and SNAP-25 are only 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold overexpressed, many of the conclusions are based on single cell measurements that span a 20-40-fold range of expression levels. Since the conclusions are based on trend-lines and behaviors over this much wider dynamics range, which the authors did not calibrate, it is not clear if the conclusions apply to conditions where the system has been taken significantly out of its physiological dynamic range (e.g. from cells that vastly overexpress these proteins). Please calibrate the single-cell intensities, for quantifying degree of overexpression vs. the amount of endogenous protein, and try to analyze and see if conclusions can be drawn from a near-physiological dynamic range.</p><p>6. The methodological details are not clearly presented and some controls are missing. Specifically, which color was used for each protein, what was the STED raw resolution. This details are important to evaluate the conclusions (e.g., are SNAP25 fluorescent spots &quot;diffuse&quot; because of lower resolution)? What happens if two colors are swapped? Co-localization and resolution controls are missing. Please mention in figures or figure legends the fluorophores used for each imaging experiment. Please mention the raw resolution achieved by the two-color STED, for each color.</p><p>7. Please change the dyes in the two-color experiment and verify that the diffuse vs. tight clusters are not because of differences in the imaging performance (resolution, background) in the two difference color channels.</p><p>8. A limitation in relating the observations about mesoscale organizations into clusters and function of these proteins is that the experiments did not focus on the organization at active zones/fusion sites. Thus, the discussion about functional relevance is purely speculative at this point and should be toned down.</p><p>9.

The two proteins have been described more than two decades ago to form the SNARE complex that drives neuronal exocytosis, together with VAMP2 (synaptobrevin 2). At the same time, their distribution on cellular membranes has been investigated in multiple works by several groups, including the group of the corresponding author (Dr. Lang), and both proteins have been found to form clusters.</p><p>The current manuscript analyzes the relative distribution of the two proteins, based on imaging different mutated forms of both syntaxin 1 and SNAP25, both with conventional optics and super-resolution. They conclude that:</p><p>– Syntaxin 1 expression changes the packing of SNAP25 in the membrane (Figure 2).</p><p>– Syntaxin 1 expression modifies the localization of SNAP25 (Figure 4).</p><p>– The N-terminal domain of SNAP25 is required for such changes (Figure 5).</p><p>– The SNARE interactor Munc18 does not influence the organization of SNAP25.</p><p>Taking into account that SNAP25 is substantially more abundant than syntaxin 1 (work from the Almers group, Knowles et al., PNAS, 2010), this work implies that syntaxin 1 is an unusually strong regulator of the organization of SNAP25, and that this regulation requires SNARE domain interactions.</p><p>Overall, this results in the novel conclusion that the well-known SNARE domain interaction of the two proteins, which is the basis of exocytosis, is also important in driving the mesoscale organization of the proteins. I find this conclusion novel, especially as SNARE domain interactions have not been shown to carry substantial weight beyond the nanoscale.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This work presents new data on a previously identified phenomenon, clustering of Syntaxin1A and SNAP25 on cell membranes. The authors perform a series of quantitative and super-resolution fluorescence imaging experiments, using a set of Syntaxin1A and SNAP25 deletion mutants that are over-expressed in PC12 cells. The authors discover that syntaxin1A overexpression reduces the overall membrane fluorescence signal from ectopically expressed GFP-SNAP25, both for the GFP tag, as well as an Atto647N-labelled GFP nanobody, likely reflecting increased self-quenching of GFP, and reduced accessibility of GFP to the nanobody. The magnitude of these effects is reduced when, instead of WT, a mutant Syntaxin1A lacking part of the SNARE domain (Stx-∆S) is overexpressed. This suggests that interactions via the Syntaxin1A SNARE domain change the organization and accessibility of SNAP25. Further using two-color super-resolution imaging, the authors discover that the mesocale organization of SNAP25 changes upon Syntaxin1A overexpression: SNAP25 forms mostly diffuse clusters that partially overlap with more tight Syntaxin1A clusters. Upon Syntaxin1A overexpression, SNAP25 becomes more tightly clustered around regions with Syntaxin1A clusters, an effect observed for WT Syntaxin1A but not for Stx-∆S overexpression. The authors investigate which SNAP25 domain is responsible for re-organization of SNAP25 upon WT Syntaxin1A overexpression. When simultaneously overexpressing WT Syntaxin1A and WT GFP-SNAP25 or GFP-SNAP25 lacking one or both of its N- or C-terminal SNARE domains, the authors observed that the effect of re-organization of GFP-SNAP25 around Syntaxin1A clusters can be mostly attributed to the N-terminal SNAP25 SNARE domain. Finally, incubation of &quot;unroofed&quot; PC12 cells with recombinant Munc18 protein has no effect on the mesocale organization of SNAP25 and Syntaxin1A, suggesting that the observed effects are mostly attributed to SNARE-mediated interactions. The authors attempt to discuss these observations in the context of how mesoscale protein organizations, clustering and molecular crowding might regulate biochemical reactions in the cell.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Particular strength of the manuscript is the use of various Syntaxin1A and SNAP25 mutants, and the extensive quantitative analysis of super-resolution images of clustered proteins.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the authors go to significant lengths to ensure at population averaged levels exogenous Syntaxin1A and SNAP-25 are only 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold overexpressed, many of the conclusions are based on single cell measurements that span a 20-40-fold range of expression levels. Since the conclusions are based on trend-lines and behaviors over this much wider dynamics range, which the authors did not calibrate, it is not clear if the conclusions apply to conditions where the system has been taken significantly out of its physiological dynamic range (e.g. from cells that vastly overexpress these proteins).</p><p>Another weakness of the manuscript in its current form is that methodological details are not clearly presented – for instance which color was used for each protein, what was the STED raw resolution etc. – so the basis for the conclusions cannot be evaluated (is SNAP25 diffuse because of lower resolution? What happens if two colors are swapped?) Co-localization and resolution controls are missing.</p><p>Finally, an important limitation in relating the observations about mesoscale organizations into clusters and function of these proteins is that authors did not look specifically at the organization at fusion sites. Thus the discussion about functional relevance appears speculative at this point.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The mesoscale organization of syntaxin 1A and SNAP25 is determined by SNARE-SNARE-interactions.&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have toned down the conclusions, shortened the paragraph in the Results section and removed the Munc18 paragraph from the discussion. We now state (line 570) “We also wondered whether the SNARE-domains are sufficient for mesoscale organization, or if perhaps Munc18 influences mesoscale organization by controlling the syntaxin 1A/SNAP25 interaction….Membrane sheets from cells expressing GFP-SNAP25 were incubated for 15 min with control buffer or 6 µM Munc18, fixed, stained and analyzed by STED-microscopy (Figure 5 —figure supplement 3)…addition of Munc18 has no significant effect on the rSDM and the maxima per µm<sup>2</sup> and consequently appears to have no influence on the SNAP25 mesoscale distribution, although it may have one on the nanoscale-organization (e.g. the formation of complexes between single syntaxin 1A and Munc18 proteins).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors have published several articles addressing the mobility of SNAREs in similar membranes. Did they (or colleagues in the literature) encounter also mobility changes in SNAP25, in relation to the expression of sytaxin 1?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we studied before mobility changes of SNAP25 in relation to syntaxin 1A expression. We cited the paper in the original version “We identified the N-terminal SNARE domain, that was a likely candidate, as a previous report showed it slows down SNAP25 mobility in a syntaxin dependent fashion (<italic>Halemani et al., 2010</italic>).” In the revised manuscript we expanded the discussion on line 643 “In SNAP25 mobility measurements employing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), the same SNAP25 constructs showed that overexpression of syntaxin 1A slows down SNAP25 diffusion only if the N-terminal SNARE domain is present (Halemani et al., 2010). Hence, syntaxin 1A clusters attach to SNAP25 via the N-terminal SNARE domain which is noticed in a higher PCC/rSDM in super-resolution microscopy (Figure 5B and C) and a slower SNAP25 diffusion in FRAP (Halemani et al., 2010), respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The statistical analysis of the differences between the PCCs is now provided in Figure 4 – Supplement 5 (line 440). Please see our reply to point #1 for an explanation why the PCC increases upon overexpression of Stx-ΔS as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Although the authors go to significant lengths to ensure at population averaged levels exogenous Syntaxin1A and SNAP-25 are only 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold overexpressed, many of the conclusions are based on single cell measurements that span a 20-40-fold range of expression levels.

A critical issue is the excess of SNAP25 over syntaxin 1A. Knowles et al., (cited in the manuscript) find in PC12 cells a vast excess of 14-fold in the plasma membrane. Consequently, in our experiments under all conditions SNAP25 should be much more abundant than syntaxin 1A.</p><p>Because the issue is of great importance, we first verified the previously published SNAP25 excess in our PC12 cells by Western blot analysis. We found that SNAP25 is 10-fold more abundant than syntaxin 1A (Figure 1 – Supplement 1; line 164), which is very much in agreement with the above-mentioned 14-fold difference found in the literature. Regarding individual plasma membranes generated from overexpressing cells, we now show in Figure 1 – Supplement 3 (line 198) that syntaxin 1A and SNAP25 are elevated up to 9- and 4-fold, respectively, which assures a still 5-fold excess of SNAP25 over syntaxin 1A when using membrane sheets from the middle expression range. However, it is possible that the rSDM increases only at high expression levels, and not if SNAREs are close to physiological concentration. This has been addressed in Figure 4 – Supplement 6 (line 451) by plotting from 139 membrane sheets the rSDM against the syntaxin expression level (which varies by a factor of 10). We do not observe that the rSDM increases with expression level, rather the opposite is the case.</p><p>We state on line 348 “Finally, with reference to Figure 1 —figure supplement 3, the above-mentioned 5-fold increase in staining suggests that we imaged membrane sheets from the middle overexpression range, leaving still a 5-fold excess of SNAP25 over syntaxin 1A.” and on line 636 “We estimate that in our experiments the physiological SNAP25:syntaxin 1A ratio is roughly halved from 10-fold to 5-fold. However, the rSDM increase is not related to the diminishment of the physiological ratio, or an increase in SNARE concentration, because as shown in Figure 4 —figure supplement 6, we do not observe a trends towards larger rSDMs upon stronger overexpression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Please mention the raw resolution achieved by the two-color STED, for each color.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not having presented clearly enough methodological details and certain controls.</p><p>a) As requested, we swapped colors (line 457, Figure 4 – Supplement 7; please note that AlexaFluor594 coupled GFP-nanobodies are not available which is why we used instead ATTO594 nanobodies; AlexaFluor594 and ATTO594 spectral properties are very close). We observe the same trends and fluorescent spot characteristics (see also reply to next point). We state in the figure legend (line 462) “As in Figure 4, Syntaxin 1A maxima are sharply defined and cover only a small area, whereas SNAP25 maxima appear more diffuse and are more widespread. (B and C) Compared to Figure 4, the same trends in ROI intensity, maxima number, maxima size and rSDM are also apparent after switching fluorophores.”</p><p>b) We have determined the raw resolution in the two channels (line 386, Figure 4 – Supplement 1) which is 67 nm and 66 nm for the AlexaFluor594- and ATTO647N-channel, respectively.

As control for two non-related images, the image of one channel is flipped horizontally and vertically and the PCC is calculated again. In all cases, the PCC in the flipped images is zero. Please note that in Figure 2 the original ROIs were not squares, a prerequisite for flipping. Therefore, the PCC analysis was repeated placing squared ROIs manually only on larger membrane sheets, which is the PCC analysis now includes less values. This change did not affect the statistics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

In the discussion, now we just focus on how the ratio between SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A may influence the different types of SNAP25-syntaxin 1A complexes. We state on line 696 “The current view is that the 1:1 complex acts as an acceptor of synaptobrevin in vivo as well. This raises the question, how can unfavourable complexes in the plasma membrane be avoided? The law of mass action predicts that the more SNAP25 is available, the less (syntaxin 1A)2:SNAP25 complexes form. It has been previously suggested that more abundant SNAP25 disfavours the 2:1 complex and that differences in the clustering mechanisms between SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A increases the ratio between reactive SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A (Halemani et al., 2010). Our study undermines this theory. In accordance with others (Knowles et al., 2010) we find that in PC12 cells, aside from possible clustering effects, SNAP25 is manifold more abundant than syntaxin 1A. Hence, clustering in combination with the meso-scale organization could increase the abundancy of 1:1 “on-pathway” and minimize 2:1 “off-pathway” complexes, which could have a positive effect on the formation of fusion-relevant complexes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
