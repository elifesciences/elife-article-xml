neurotransmitter receptors regarding pre-synaptic release sites is a fundamental determinant of the synaptic transmission amplitude and reliability. How modifications in the pre- and post-synaptic machinery alignments affects synaptic currents, has only been addressed with computer modelling. Using single molecule super-resolution microscopy, we found a strong spatial correlation between AMPA receptor (AMPAR) nanodomains and the post-synaptic adhesion protein neuroligin-1 (NLG1). Expression of a truncated form of NLG1 disrupted this correlation without affecting the intrinsic AMPAR organization, shifting the pre-synaptic release machinery away from AMPAR nanodomains. Electrophysiology in dissociated and organotypic hippocampal rodent cultures shows these treatments significantly decrease AMPAR-mediated miniature and EPSC amplitudes. Computer modelling predicts that ~100 nm lateral shift between AMPAR nanoclusters and glutamate release sites induces a significant reduction in AMPAR-mediated currents. Thus, our results suggest the synapses necessity to release glutamate precisely in front of AMPAR nanodomains, to maintain a high synaptic responses efficiency.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AMPA receptors</kwd><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NanoDom</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Letellier</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Choquet</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Thoumine</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name><name><surname>Hosy</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Letellier</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Sainlos</surname><given-names>Matthieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Choquet</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Thoumine</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name><name><surname>Hosy</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Compans</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>nano-dyn-syn</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haas</surname><given-names>Kalina T</given-names></name><name><surname>Compans</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Grillo-Bosch</surname><given-names>Dolors</given-names></name><name><surname>Sainlos</surname><given-names>Matthieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Choquet</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Hosy</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuroligin 1 is a critical adhesion molecule which organizes AMPA receptor nanodomains in close vicinity to pre-synaptic release sites, and whose genetic or chemical disruption severely impairs synaptic transmission properties.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate the vast majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. AMPARs are stabilized at the post-synaptic density (PSD) by interactions with PDZ domain containing proteins such as PSD-95. AMPARs were initially thought to be homogeneously distributed throughout the PSD, but recent work based on super-resolution optical imaging (SRI) and electron microscopy has demonstrated that AMPARs are concentrated in small nanodomains around 80 nm in size, and containing 20 receptors on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Masugi-Tokita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). This specific mode of organization might be critical for synaptic transmission, depending on the relative positioning of pre-synaptic release sites with respect to AMPAR nanodomains. Indeed, previous studies showed that the glutamate content of a single presynaptic vesicle is not sufficient to activate the entire pool of AMPARs inside the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raghavachari and Lisman, 2004</xref>), suggesting that synaptic currents might be stronger if AMPARs were concentrated in front of pre-synaptic release sites rather than dispersed throughout the PSD. Moreover, mathematical models predict that when AMPARs are clustered in front of glutamate release sites, both the amplitude and the reliability of synaptic responses are improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Franks et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rusakov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rusakov and Kullmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tarusawa et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, when AMPAR clusters are not aligned with release sites, synaptic currents are predicted to be weaker and highly variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tarusawa et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to understand the spatial relationship between glutamate release sites and AMPAR domains at the nanoscale level.</p><p>Dual-color SRI offers a new way to analyze the alignment of pre- and post-synaptic elements underlying the intrinsic function of the synapse. Several studies have examined the nanoscale organization of various pre-synaptic proteins, including calcium channels, syntaxin, and neurexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chamma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ribrault et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>), but these proteins did not display a clustered organization resembling that of AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hosy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). A recent study indicated however that the pre-synaptic active zone protein RIM is concentrated in small domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, this study showed that active glutamate release sites are co-localized with RIM and aligned with AMPAR nanodomains. This trans-synaptic ‘nanocolumn’ organization is regulated by long-term synaptic plasticity, highlighting its importance for the control of synaptic transmission. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this alignment are still unknown, and the sensitivity of synaptic currents to mis-alignment has not been experimentally investigated.</p><p>One way to test the importance of pre- to post-synaptic alignment would be to destabilize the trans-synaptic organization and study its effect on synaptic transmission. It has been abundantly described that the adhesion complex neurexin-neuroligin forms a trans-synaptic bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Südhof, 2008</xref>). Pre-synaptic neurexin is implicated in active zone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Missler et al., 2003</xref>), while post-synaptic neuroligin-1 (NLG1) recruits PSD-95, NMDA receptors and AMPARs to partly structure the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Budreck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, a C-terminally truncated NLG1 mutant, unable to bind PDZ domain containing PSD proteins (NLG1-ΔCter), was previously shown to prevent PSD-95 recruitment at newly formed synapses, and reduce AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chih et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nam and Chen, 2005</xref>). Here, using dual-color SRI, we report that expression of the NLG1-ΔCter mutant or incubation with cell-permeant NLG1 C-terminal peptides suppress the co-localization of NLG1 and AMPAR nanodomains without changing the overall AMPAR nanoscale organization. In parallel, those treatments induce a physical shift between pre-synaptic RIM clusters and post-synaptic AMPAR nanodomains, associated with a significant decrease in AMPAR-mediated miniature and evoked EPSC amplitudes. We thus propose that neurexin-neuroligin mediated pre-post synaptic alignment tightly regulates synaptic efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of NLG1-ΔCter does not affect AMPAR nanoscale organization</title><p>To understand the role of NLG1 adhesion in AMPAR nano-organization, we performed direct STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (d-STORM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heilemann et al., 2008</xref>) experiments on primary hippocampal neurons expressing either full length NLG1 (NLG1), or a NLG1 mutant with a truncation in the last 72 amino acids of the C-terminal domain (NLG1-ΔCter), both constructs carrying an N-terminal HA tag. NLG1-ΔCter has an intact extracellular domain allowing normal contacts with pre-synaptic partners such as neurexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chih et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>), but is unable to interact with cytoplasmic proteins within the PSD, and thus should behave as a dominant-negative mutant that uncouples trans-synaptic adhesion from the PSD. Given that AMPAR nanodomains are tightly associated with PSD-95 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nair et al., 2013</xref>), our rationale was that by disconnecting NLG1 from PSD-95, we would perturb the nanoscale positioning of AMPARs.</p><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nam and Chen, 2005</xref>), expression of both truncated and full length NLG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) increases spine density, revealing the synaptogenic role of NLG1 (n = 10; 12; 9 respectively; ANOVA p=0.0004). We then examined the effect of NLG1-ΔCter expression on AMPAR nano-organization. Surface AMPARs were detected by labeling live neurons with a primary antibody specific for the N-terminal domain of the AMPAR GluA2 subunit, followed by fixation and incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 647. Nanodomains are determined as clusters of AMPARs present inside the synapse and containing at least 5 receptors, based on single particle emission properties (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). In control neurons expressing GFP alone, we typically detected between 1 to 2 AMPAR nanodomains per synapse, with an average size of 90 ± 3 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). NLG1 overexpression increased the surface density of AMPAR nanodomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), in agreement with the previous finding that NLG1 potentiates the formation of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chih et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levinson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, NLG1 overexpression led to a re-organization of AMPAR nanodomains by increasing both their size and AMPAR content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Surprisingly, expression of NLG1-ΔCter for 3 days did not affect AMPAR nano-organization compared to the GFP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, ANOVA post-test: p=0.72; 0.82 and 0.33 for figure C; D and E respectively). To validate this observation, we analyzed d-STORM images of AMPARs acquired on neurons expressing either GFP alone or GFP + NLG1-ΔCter, using a cluster quantification method based on Tessellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levet et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Through this analysis, we obtained an estimate of the number of endogenous GluA2-containing AMPARs per spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), per nanodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and the size of the nanodomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

These experiments have the advantage of using the same combination of antibodies as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Since AMPARs form heterotetramers in neurons, the labelling for GluA1 and GluA2 is expected to exhibit a high level of co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The comparison between the size of single fluorescence emitters and both Alexa 532 and Alexa 647 labelled objects clearly demonstrates the presence of GluA1 and GluA2 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Finally, the Manders’ representation in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) reveals two points: first, only 5% of GluA1 and GluA2 object pairs have a null Manders’ coefficient, reflecting that almost all Alexa 532-GluA2 labelled objects co-localize at least partly with Alexa 647-GluA1 labelled objects. Second, even though we co-labelled proteins belonging to the same cluster, less than 20% of objects exhibit a Manders’ coefficient higher than 0.8, but 60% overlapped on an area larger than 50%. This likely originates from the fact that high levels of co-localization are difficult to reach in 2-color super-resolved images due to achromatism and the antibody size.</p><p>We then applied the Manders’ analysis to examine the co-localization between AMPAR nanodomains and NLG1 clusters inside synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D and E</xref>; green line). The similar area distribution between single fluorescence emitters and NLG1 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) reveals that NLG1 does not form large domains inside synapses, but rather several small clusters, confirming previous findings with an alternative labelling strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chamma et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the area distribution of AMPARs displays larger values, due to AMPAR clustering. For the remaining part of the analysis, we took into account all NLG1 objects, only selected AMPAR objects larger than 0.005 µm² (red dashed line <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), a threshold allowing the suppression of 80% of single emitters, to focus analysis only on AMPAR clusters (value of 0.0022 ± 0.0027 µm<sup>2</sup> which correspond to mean ± 1.5*STD). The centroid to centroid bivariate nearest neighbor distance distribution between NLG1 and AMPAR nanodomains was significantly smaller than that expected from an independent distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; green line, n = 512 pairs of co-localized objects), indicating a functional proximity between NLG1 and GluA2 clusters at the nanoscale. The difference between the two curves was already apparent in the first 100 nm, revealing a tight association between NLG1 and AMPAR nanodomains at a short length scale. Finally, Manders’ coefficients were calculated between each pair of objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; green line, n = 512 pairs of objects). Only 20% of NLG1 clusters did not co-localize, even partially, with a GluA2 nanodomain, while 25% of NLG1 clusters co-localized to more than 80% with AMPAR nanodomains.

This led us to the conclusion that there is no preferential association of NLG1-ΔCter clusters with AMPAR nanodomains. This was confirmed by looking at the distribution of Manders’ coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, red line). Only 38% of NLG1-ΔCter co-localized at least partially with AMPARs, compared with 80% for NLG1, revealing that the NLG1 C-terminal truncation significantly decreases the association between NLG1 and AMPAR nanodomains (comparison with NLG1: 2 sample t-test p&lt;0.0001).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NLG1-ΔCter expression shifts the alignment between presynaptic RIM and post-synaptic AMPAR nanodomains</title><p>We then analyzed the effect of NLG1-ΔCter expression on the alignment between pre-synaptic RIM and post-synaptic AMPAR clusters.

In the presence of 2 mM extracellular calcium, we observed a ~4 fold increase in AMPAR-mediated EPSC amplitude (456.1% ± 80.0) in neurons overexpressing NLG1 compared to paired non-electroporated controls, reflecting the well-known synaptogenic effect of NLG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kwon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shipman et al., 2011</xref>). This effect was associated with a decrease in the coefficient of variation (CV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This parameter is commonly related to both number of active synapses and their release probability (quantal content) but previous studies provided evidence for the contribution of post-synaptic parameters into the CV as for example the fraction of silent synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kullmann, 1994</xref>) and ongoing fluctuations of AMPAR number at the synapse and their mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czöndör et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levy et al., 2015</xref>). These results support the idea that NLG1 can both increase the number of functional synapses and stabilize AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levinson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>).

Thus, when compared to NLG1, NLG1-ΔCter expressing neurons display lower EPSCs and higher CV, despite the fact that NLG1- ΔCter expression can still increase synapse number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These joint effects can be explained by either a lack of recruitment of AMPARs at newly formed synapses (i.e. silent synapses) and/or a mis-alignment between pre- and post-synapses. Finally, there was no significant change in the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) upon expression of either NLG1 or NLG1-ΔCter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>; PPR for NLG1: control 1.63 ± 0.11, NLG1 1.36 ± 0.09, for NLG1-ΔCter), indicating no specific modification of the pre-synaptic release probability.</p><p>The amplitude of EPSCs recorded in calcium combines three parameters: the number of synapses (n), the release probability (p), and the quantal size (q), related to glutamate receptor structural organization, possibly including the alignment of AMPARs nanodomains with presynaptic release sites.. To test the idea that NLG1-ΔCter affects quantal size, extracellular calcium was replaced by strontium to trigger asynchronous pre-synaptic release following stimulation, thereby evoking a train of AMPAR-mediated EPSCs generated by glutamate release from single vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goda and Stevens, 1994</xref>). Both NLG1 and NLG1-ΔCter expression increased the frequency of asynchronous EPSCs compared to non-electroporated neurons, again reflecting the synaptogenic effect of NLG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, as observed with miniatures in dissociated cultures, the amplitude of asynchronous EPSCs was reduced by 26% in neurons expressing NLG1-ΔCter but not in neurons expressing NLG1, when compared to control non-electroporated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>, for NLG1 expression: control: 11.59 ± 0.73, NLG1: 11.60 ± 1.03; for NLG1-ΔCter expression: control: 12.01 ± 1.56, NLG1-ΔCter: 8.893 ± 0.70; paired t-test p=0.99 and 0.018).

The similarity of the current decrease obtained in both the NLG1 WT and KO backgrounds, emphasizes the dominant negative role of NLG1-ΔCter which might compete with various NLG isoforms. Together, these results show that NLG1-ΔCter directly affects the quantal size, which is compatible with our concept of synaptic mis-alignment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cell-permeant NLG1 biomimetic divalent ligand disrupts pre-post alignment and decrease AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission</title><p>To confirm the role of NLG1 C-terminal interactions in aligning AMPARs in front of pre-synaptic release sites, without overexpressing NLG1-ΔCter mutants which might also affect pre-synaptic development, we used an alternative strategy. Based on our previous expertise to perturb interactions between stargazin and PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sainlos et al., 2011</xref>), we developed divalent biomimetic ligands comprising the 15 C-terminal amino acids of NLG1, conjugated to a TAT sequence to favor cell penetration. In contrast to the NLG1-ΔCter mutant, those ligands directly compete with endogenous neuroligins to bind PDZ domain containing scaffolding proteins at the post-synapse, without altering the binding of neuroligins to pre-synaptic proteins such as neurexins. Control non-sense ligands had the same structure but mutations in the sequence prevent interaction with PDZ domains. Incubation of 14 DIV hippocampal neurons for 1–2 days with NLG1 competing ligands decreased the co-localization between RIM and GluA2 containing AMPARs observed by dual-color d-STORM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>), and reduced by 30% AMPAR-mediated mEPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Interestingly, NLG1 peptides did not alter AMPAR-mediated mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting an exclusive post-synaptic effect.

In the simulations, the number of released glutamate molecules was fixed to 1500, 2000, 3000 or 4500, to be in the range of the estimated amount per pre-synaptic vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Savtchenko et al., 2013</xref>). Simulations computed the number of open AMPARs, when vesicles containing the various glutamate quantities were released in front of a single AMPAR cluster, or up to 200 nm away from the cluster center, varied with a 50 nm increment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As expected, simulated curves demonstrated that the glutamate content per pre-synaptic vesicle was positively correlated with the synaptic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Strikingly, the simulation further showed that the number of opened AMPAR was inversely correlated to the distance between the release site and AMPAR nanodomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). A release of 3000 glutamate molecules, which is in the upper range of glutamate content per vesicle, at 150 nm from an AMPAR nanodomain, led to a decrease of almost 40% of the synaptic response. In this model, the release distance is measured from the center of the nanodomain, which has a 90 nm diameter size. Even at 50 nm from the centroid (i.e. at the close periphery of the nanodomain), a significant decrease of current amplitude was already observed for low glutamate content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The expected decrease in synaptic current amplitude was also sensitive to the glutamate content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Specifically, the 26% decrease of AMPAR-mediated current observed experimentally corresponds to a glutamate content of around 2000 molecules when the release site is localized 90 nm away from the nanodomain centroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Finally, in order to investigate the possible effect of a complex extracellular matrix and glial processes around the synapse, which might also regulate synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dityatev and Rusakov, 2011</xref>), we varied the glutamate diffusion coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) or the density of astrocytic glutamate transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

First, NLG1 seems to play an important role in the organization of trans-synaptic ‘nano-columns’, by positioning AMPAR nanodomains in close proximity to pre-synaptic release sites. Second, the amplitude of AMPAR-mediated currents is highly sensitive to pre-post synaptic nanoscale alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). At the synapse, NLG1 displays two distinct functions: during synaptogenesis, it binds to pre-synaptic proteins and initiate synapse formation and at later stages of synapse development NRLG1 organizes the post-synaptic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levinson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheiffele et al., 2000</xref>). NLG1 binds pre-synaptic neurexins via its extracellular domain, while its cytoplasmic tail exhibits various binding sites including a C-terminal PDZ domain binding motif, a central gephyrin binding motif, and an upstream non-canonical motif without identified interactor but also important for neuroligin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giannone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Irie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shipman et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we used a NLG1 construct lacking both the PSD-95 and gephyrin binding domains. When expressed during the early stages of synaptogenesis, this NLG1 mutant is able to strongly increase synapse number, but does not recruit enough PSD-95 and AMPARs to sustain normal synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Budreck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nam and Chen, 2005</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>NLG1 is an organizer of the trans-synaptic nano-column</title><p>Expression of NLG1-ΔCter later in development (at the synapse maturation stage) caused a modest increase in spine density, accompanied by a decrease in quantal transmission. Interestingly, the AMPAR content per synapse was not affected, nor their diffusion or organization in nanodomains. Rather, NLG1-ΔCter disrupted nanodomain spatial alignment with pre-synaptic release sites visualized by RIM clusters. Our interpretation is that NLG1-ΔCter outcompeted the endogenous NLG1 for the binding to neurexins (or/and other pre-synaptic partners), allowing unanchored PSD-95 scaffolds and connected AMPAR nanodomains to flow away from the release site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). As previously published, heterodimerization might occur between recombinant NLG1-ΔCter and endogenous NLG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shipman et al., 2011</xref>). However, we observed a clear shift between NLG1-ΔCter labelling and AMPAR nanodomains, suggesting a dominant negative effect. Interestingly, a similar reduction in AMPAR currents induced by NLG1-ΔCter was observed in organotypic slices from both NLG1 WT and KO genetic backgrounds, revealing a potential heterodimerization of NLG1-ΔCter with other NLGs, most likely NLG3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shipman et al., 2011</xref>). Acute application of cell-permeant NLG1 C-terminal ligand confirmed these conclusions. Together, these results demonstrate that C-terminal interactions between NLG1 and PDZ domain containing scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95, are important to align AMPAR nanodomains in front of pre-synaptic release sites.</p><p>The functional effect of such a molecular disorganization caused either by NLG1-ΔCter expression or NLG1 peptide incubation was found to be unexpectedly important, that is a displacement of AMPAR nanodomain of less than 100 nm decreases mEPSC amplitude by about 30%. Modeling confirmed the high sensitivity of AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents to the position of the pre-synaptic release site with respect to AMPAR nanodomains. Considering that quantal synaptic transmission results from the release of glutamate from one vesicle in front of an AMPAR nanodomain, three parameters determine the number of activated AMPARs: 1/the amount of glutamate per vesicle and its diffusion properties inside the cleft; 2/the number of AMPARs per nanodomain; and 3/the degree of apposition between release sites and nanodomains. Our simulations predict that an equivalent 25% decrease of current could be explained by either a 3-fold decrease in glutamate content (from 4500 to 1500 molecules per vesicle), a 32% loss in the number of AMPARs per nanodomain, or a 100 nm shift between pre- and post-organization (for a glutamate content of 2000 molecules per vesicle), underlying the high sensitivity of synaptic currents to pre-post alignment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Pre-post misalignment affects both action potential -dependent and -independent synaptic currents</title><p>Interestingly, a similar effect has been observed on miniature EPSCs recorded from primary cultures and both EPSCs and asynchronous EPSCs recorded from organotypic slices. Action potential-dependent currents recorded from slices in calcium or strontium conditions do not directly reflect the synaptic response because they combine (i) the synaptogenic effect of NLG1 via its extracellular interaction with pre-synaptic adhesion proteins, which affect the parameter n and (ii) its role in AMPAR recruitment and pre-post alignment, affecting the parameter q. Nevertheless, these experiments are necessary to test the potential effect of mis-alignment regarding the pool of vesicle recruited after an action potential, which might differ from the one involved in miniature release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fredj and Burrone, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hua et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilhelm et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The determination of the q from calcium experiments is challenging because EPSC amplitude is dependent on both n, p and q together. First, the absence of effect on the paired pulse properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>) indicates that the p value should not be affected by NLG1 and NLG1-ΔCter expression. Second, the net increase of EPSC amplitude in calcium conditions induced by both NLG1 and NLG1-ΔCter compared to control neurons can be attributed to an increase of the n parameter by recruiting additional pre-synapses, as abundantly described in the literature and shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the significant decrease of evoked AMPAR-mediated EPSC amplitude caused by NLG1-ΔCter with respect to NLG1, combined with the increase in CV is more difficult to explain. It can be attributed to either a recruitment of silent synapses by NLG1-ΔCter, or a decrease of the quantal size (q) due for example to pre-post synaptic mis-alignment.</p><p>Strontium experiments represent a tempting way to overcome this multifactorial effect, by decorrelating action potential stimulation and quantal release. Our results show a significant increase of asynchronous EPSC frequency, which can be attributed to the formation/stabilisation of additional synapses, and a decrease of amplitude which likely results from a disruption of the pre-post alignment. However, we cannot exclude the bias due to the origin of the vesicle pool recruited during asynchronous EPSC, which is under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 1995</xref>). However, taken together, spontaneous miniature currents recorded in calcium and asynchronous EPSCs recorded in strontium suggest that NLG1-ΔCter expression affects both action potential-dependent and -independent synaptic transmission. Although glutamatergic synapses from cultured systems and brain slices share a similar organization in nanomodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hruska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tang et al., 2016</xref>), it could be interesting to validate our results in more intact preparations.</p><p>Our observations, done both on dissociated neurons and organotypic slice cultures, support a new model of synaptic function, where the quantum of synaptic transmission is more sensitive to AMPAR nanoscale organization and alignment with respect to release sites, than to the glutamate content per vesicle and even AMPAR content per nanodomain. These specific properties are due in part to the relatively low affinity of AMPAR for glutamate (mM range) and the fact that released glutamate rapidly fades away laterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lisman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tarusawa et al., 2009</xref>). These results suggest two changes in our conception of the efficacy of synaptic function. First, synapses exhibit a relative tolerance to variability both in the glutamate content per vesicle and in the number of AMPAR per nanodomain. Indeed, a 10–20% variation in these parameters will not drastically affect synaptic transmission efficacy. Our computer simulations predict that the combination of pre-post alignment and nanodomain organization is sufficient to bring some stability to synaptic transmission. Second, fast and large modifications in synaptic amplitude can be better achieved by molecular pre-post misalignment than by changes in AMPAR number. This prediction is in line with the transient physiological misalignment between RIM and PSD95 clusters previously described upon induction of chemical Long Term Depression (LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, our modeling data predict that the amplitude of AMPAR currents is not sensitive to the glutamate clearance by glial cells, in agreement with the model that AMPAR activation takes place within the 100 nm surrounding the release site. By varying the gating parameters, we do not observe AMPAR opening beyond 250 nm from the site of vesicle fusion.</p><p>Previous models suggested that high efficiency of synaptic transmission, high amplitude response and low variability, requires a tight clustering of AMPA receptors, and an alignment of these clusters with the pre-synaptic release site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tarusawa et al., 2009</xref>). Our study proposes that synapses, via NLG1-based trans-synaptic adhesion, optimize the use of glutamate by controlling the alignment between pre-synaptic release sites and AMPAR nanodomains, with surprisingly high sensitivity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell and brain slice culture and transfection</title><p>Preparation of cultured neurons was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nair et al., 2013</xref>).

Bicuculline (20 µM) was added to the aCSF to block inhibitory currents and DNQX (100 nM) was added to control epileptic activity. Series resistance was always lower than 20 MΩ. Paired-pulse ratio was determined by delivering two stimuli 50 ms apart and dividing the peak response to the second stimulus by the peak response of the first one. For recordings aEPSCs, extracellular CaCl<sub>2</sub> was substituted to equimolar SrCl<sub>2</sub>. aEPSCs evoked within 500 ms after the stimulation, were analyzed off-line with Mini Analysis software (Synaptosoft). In all cases, at least 20 sweeps per recording were analyzed with a detection threshold set at 5 pA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Co-localization analysis</title><p>Co-localization analysis was performed using custom written program in Matlab (Mathworks, UK). Manders’ coefficients were chosen as co-localization measure because they do not depend on the relative intensity difference between two component images, therefore bypassing alteration in labeling efficiency of different cellular structures. Here, we perform pairwise analysis between coincidental objects observed in two image components. Thus, our Manders’ coefficients represent fraction of the intensity belonging to co-localizing super-resolution pixels of a given object. Manders’ coefficients are calculated using following equations:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where <italic>i</italic> is a pixel index, 1 and 2 stands for two image components and <italic>n</italic> is the number of pixels in an object for which coefficient is evaluated. I<sub>1i</sub> ≥ 0 (I<sub>2i</sub> ≥ 0) are intensity values at the <italic>i<sup>th</sup></italic> pixel of an object in the first (second) component of the dual-color image.</p><p>In first step, two image components are threshold, segmented and reduced to sets of geometrical objects attributed with their weighted centroid location, pixel area, intensity and location. Objects in each component image were divided into two categories, according to their area. This distinction is based on the size of single emitter found both on the coverslip and on the dendrite. With this analysis, we can tell apart the single proteins from the clustered ones, and analyze them independently.</p><p>In subsequent step, first bivariate nearest neighbor distance distribution is calculated for each neuroligin to the nearest AMPAR cluster. Afterwards, the Manders’ coefficients are evaluated between each first nearest neighbor pair of AMPAR cluster and neuroligin. These coefficients were calculated only between pairs of AMPAR and neuroligin separated by the threshold distance, which reflects the maximum distance between two objects considered as related and was obtained from bivariate nearest neighbor distance distribution.</p><p>Co-localization significance was accounted for by image randomization. Objects in one image component were rearranged by random assignment of new position for their weighted centroids. This step was repeated up to 1000 times, each time appropriate measure of co-localization was evaluated. Bivariate first nearest neighbour distributions are compared to the mean of randomized samples and 95% confidence intervals. If the experimental distribution lies above (below) randomized distribution, it indicates tendency towards association (dispersion) at given distances. However, if experimental distribution matches randomized one, it points to random or independent distribution between two classes of objects.

It was followed in France by 3 rulings in 1987, 2001, 2005 (article R214-87 and R214-130 of the rural code) and 3 rulings of 19 April 1988. An ethical system complemented this regulation since 2008, with harmonization of the commitments between the private and the public sector, by the signature of the National Charter for ethical animal experimentation by institutions in animal experimentation ethics (EAA) and by the CNREEA (Centre national of ethical reflection on animal experiments). Our projects are therefore assessed by the Ethics Committee No 50 of Bordeaux attached to the CNREEA. Thanks to our preparation, we will be ready to apply from January 1St, 2013, the 63-2010-EU directive which transcribed in French law will be published on November 12, 2012 in the form of 2 decree

<italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see some of the comments will require additional experiments concerning:</p><p>1) The validation of the culture results using slice recording;</p><p>2) The inclusion of evoked responses in addition to the mEPSC analysis;</p><p>3) Additional simulation to address the comments of both reviewers; and</p><p>4) Editing to avoid overinterpreting the results.</p><p>The original non-overlapping comments of the reviewers are below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Haas et al. examines the role of neuroligin in aligning postsynaptic receptor nanodomains to presynaptic active zones and the functional consequences of this alignment for synaptic transmission. To address these questions, the authors use imaging methods (dSTORM), electrophysiology, and modeling. The main findings are:</p><p>- Super resolution imaging reveals a strong spatial colocalization between AMPA receptors and neuroligin-1;</p><p>- Truncation of the C terminus of neuroligin-1 disrupts this colocalization and shifts the release machinery away from AMPA receptor clusters;</p><p>- Electrophysiological analysis and modeling suggest that this physical shift markedly decreases the efficiency of synaptic transmission.</p><p>Based on these results, the authors conclude that the alignment of pre- and postsynaptic components plays a critical role to ensure the efficiency of synaptic transmission. Overall, I found this a potentially interesting paper. The combination of high-resolution imaging, electrophysiology, and MCell modeling is nice and provides new insights into the mechanisms of synaptic transmission. However, it is also clear that parts of the paper are preliminary, and major revision is required to address these weaknesses.</p><p>1) NLG1 and NLG1 deltaC were mostly expressed on wild-type background. This is a complication, because endogenously and exogenously expressed NLG1 mix. The necessary KO control data come only very late in the manuscript, when functional properties of synaptic transmission are assessed.</p><p>2) The conclusions stand and fall with the validity of the culture systems used. The authors should make an attempt to validate the results in acute slice preparations.</p><p>3) The functional characterization of synaptic transmission is rudimentary. A lot can go wrong in the analysis of miniature synaptic events, and evoked and miniature release may not even be mediated by the same postsynaptic receptors. Thorough analysis of evoked EPSCs seems required to support the conclusions.</p><p>4) The diffusion coefficient of glutamate in the synaptic cleft seems an important parameter. However, the value used is unclear (it is just briefly mentioned in the legend of Figure 6), and how its exact value would affect the conclusions remains open. This point should be addressed in systematic simulations. Furthermore, the synaptic cleft height may affect the conclusions. Why was it assumed 20 nm if the authors have the full reconstruction of the extracellular space?</p><p>5) The presentation of the results requires improvement. The functional significance of the NLG1-mediated alignment seems sometimes overstated. The relation between receptor alignment and previously reported receptor mobility should be better discussed (otherwise an apparent contradiction may remain for naive readers).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a nice work dealing with an important and timely issue, which refers us to the basic mechanisms of synaptic transmission and its efficacy control. The authors employ some cutting-edge super-resolution techniques and electrophysiology in cultured neurons to find that the neuroligin NGL1 plays a key role in the clustering of postsynaptic AMPA receptors in front of the presynaptic glutamate release sites. This finding provides novel and important insights into the molecular machinery underpinning the functioning of brain circuits.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Pre-post synaptic alignment through neuroligin tunes synaptic transmission efficiency&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>Both editors and reviewers think that the manuscript has been improved and has the potential to be an important paper. However, we think the functional aspects of the work have not reached acceptability. Specifically the discussion among reviewers and editors concluded that additional data requested in the first reviews should be pursued to fully support the conclusions the authors would like to make. We realize that this reflects additional work for the authors, but in our opinion this work would substantially increase the merits of the work. We hope you will be able to address these concerns in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Regarding further experiments for slice recordings, the authors' contention that fast manipulation is not possible with this system is not compelling. It is indeed possible that viral expression generates expression at a sufficiently fast time scale, before structural changes are initiated. Before the authors have tried, it cannot be claimed that it does not work.</p><p>2) Regarding the criticisms concerning the evoked EPSCs, the authors now provide analysis of EPSCs evoked in strontium. However, issues with these data remain. First, strontium is a rather artificial approach to study evoked synaptic transmission. Second, the slow rise time of the evoked EPSCs is 2 ms (Figure 4—figure supplement 2D), which indicates technical problems with these recordings. How the authors can study the functional effects of nanoscale alignment under these recording conditions remains unclear. Finally, the authors try to argue that evoked EPSCs are difficult to interpret, because overlaying effects of receptor alignment and synapse number are difficult to dissect. However, a pessimistic view on the new data shown in the figure for reviewers would be that the central hypothesis is challenged.

Unfortunately, any attempt to obtain short-term expression of the NLG1-ΔC mutant in the brain has failed, because neither in utero electroporation nor virus transfection are compatible with such short-term expression. If mutants were expressed for more than a couple of days in neurons with already present functional synapses or before proper synapses organization, the impairment of neuroligin-1 function would change AMPAR nanodomain organization and affect synaptic function. This renders impossible the specific study of the pre-post alignment effect because it will likely be contaminated by other synaptic modifications.</p><p>The incubation of acute slices with NLG1 TAT-peptides would be an alternative, but the slices are likely to die in a few hours before the pre-post synaptic misalignment takes place. Injecting the peptides in vivo could also be considered, but this would be extremely demanding in the amount of peptides needed (and we have a limited supply). So at this stage, we believe that we cannot provide an alternative to culture systems to demonstrate the effects of NLG1 perturbation on pre-post synaptic alignment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The inclusion of evoked responses in addition to the mEPSC analysis;</p></disp-quote><p>Evoked responses differ from at least two aspects compared to spontaneous mEPSCs:</p><p>i) They potentially do not recruit the same pool of glutamate vesicles at the pre-synapse (this fact is still highly debated, see Fredj and Burrone, 2009, Hua et al., 2010; Wilhelm et al., 2010, Tang et al., 2016). If this is true, it is possible that release sites responsible for evoked and miniature currents are different from each other. We understand the concern of the reviewers regarding the role of Nlg1 and pre-post alignment in evoked transmission. However, miniature responses recorded in the presence of strontium, presented in the paper, correspond to “evoked responses” in the sense that they are triggered by action potentials and likely involve the vesicle pool dedicated to calcium-induced release. Importantly, we observed a similar effect of Nlg1-ΔC expression on miniature AMPA currents recorded in primary neurons and on evoked asynchronous miniature EPSCs in the presence of strontium, suggesting that the Nlg1-ΔC misaligns both types of release sites (if they are different) from AMPAR nanodomains. Computer simulations showing the influence of a misalignment between glutamate release sites and AMPAR nanodomains further validate our experimental approaches. This point is now discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>ii) Evoked responses strongly depend on the number of active synapses (n), a parameter that is known to be altered when manipulating Nlg1 expression or function (e.g., Chubykin et al., Neuron, 2007; Mondin et al., 2011; Giannone et al., 2013; Chih et al., 2005). In particular, when expressed for several days, Nlg1-deltaC is known to increase the number of pre-synapses formed on transfected neurons (e.g., Mondin et al., 2011), in addition to the effect we see on the pre-post alignment. This is the reason why we found difficult to extract with precision the quantal size from EPSCs amplitudes and opted for the analysis of spontaneous and evoked asynchronous miniature events. By analysing the synchronized fraction of evoked currents recorded in strontium (organotypic slices from WT or KO mice), we found that the synaptogenic activity of Nlg1-deltaC depends on the genetic background (WT or KO), which further complicates the analysis and interpretation of results (see response to reviewer 1 for more details and also Shipman et al., 2011). In addition, we performed a new set of experiments to study evoked currents in cell cultures. However, neither the amplitude nor the kinetics of EPSCs show differences between NLG1 WT and the delta C mutant. Those results are included in the response to reviewer 1.</p><p>For all these reasons we would rather not complicate the message of the paper by entering into the highly documented role of neuroligin in the synaptogenesis, and would like to maintain the focus of the paper on the pre-post misalignment at single synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additional simulation to address the comments of both reviewers; and</p></disp-quote><p>All requested simulations have been done, addressing the impact of glutamate diffusion rate (requested by reviewer 1) and the role of environment (requested by reviewer 2).

This is a complication, because endogenously and exogenously expressed NLG1 mix. The necessary KO control data come only very late in the manuscript, when functional properties of synaptic transmission are assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Although we understand that the KO control might appear as necessary, we want to emphasize that the whole strategy of our study was to challenge the role of Nlg1 in already formed synapses by using a dominant-negative strategy. We achieved this goal by using either a Nlg1 truncation mutant or a competing divalent peptide that we introduced in neurons as acutely as possible to limit any effect related to the synaptogenic activity of Nlg1.</p><p>However, in addition to the electrophysiology experiments carried out in organotypic slices, we initially performed super-resolution imaging experiments in cultured neurons from Nlg1 KO mice (not shown in the paper) and found that the number of AMPARs per nanodomain was significantly decreased compared to wild-type neurons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Interestingly, these results are in agreement with the recent report that AMPARs at the plasma membrane are decreased in cultured hippocampal neurons lacking Nlg1/2/3 (Chanda et al., J Neurosci, 2017). Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that NMDAR-mediated transmission is decreased in Nlg1 KO neurons and that NMDAR-dependent LTP is impaired (e.g., Varoqueaux et al., Neuron, 2006; Jiang et al., Mol Psy 2016; Chanda et al., J Neurosci, 2017). Overall, these data suggest that synapses in KO neurons do not maturate as well as in the wild-type condition and this is the reason why we think that dominant-negative approaches were more appropriate for addressing our question.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows an analysis of the number of AMPA receptors per nanodomain in a WT or NLG1 KO background, showing that the knock-out of NLG1 decreases the composition of AMPAR nanodomain. Incidentally, we previously reported defects in AMPAR recruitment in CA1 neurons of acute NLG1 KO slices (p6-p8) by immunohistochemistry, and a decrease in both the amplitude and frequency of AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs (Mondin et al., 2011), that might be related to this phenomenon.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31755-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Interestingly, the fact that we found similar effect of the Nlg1-deltaC expression on evoked quantal events recorded from KO or WT organotypic slices suggest that some other adhesion molecules (most likely Nlg3) compensate to some degree for the absence of Nlg1 in KO neurons (see also Chanda et al., J Neurosci, 2017). In those neurons, Nlg1-deltaC might compete (and possibly heterodimerize) with Nlg3 for binding to PSD-95 at glutamatergic synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusions stand and fall with the validity of the culture systems used. The authors should make an attempt to validate the results in acute slice preparations.</p></disp-quote><p>We did make some attempts to validate our results in acute slices but we were confronted to two main difficulties:</p><p>i) For imaging experiments, the pointing accuracy in slices is deteriorated. We do not consider possible at this point to obtain two colour super-resolution images able to reveal a pre-post misalignment in the order of 100 nm in thick tissue. In our group, we are actively working to towards this goal but it will likely take another few years to reach it.</p><p>ii) For electrophysiological experiments, as detailed in the previous answer, the difficulty of this paper consists to express neuroligin as acutely as possible to avoid the bias due to misformation/ maturation of synapses depending on neuroligin. Our conclusions are based on the fact that we are able to demonstrate that AMPAR nanodomains are not modified when delta C is expressed for a couple of days. Technically, we do not know how to express acutely a construct in acute brain slices. The classical methods, either post-natal viral infection (after synaptogenesis) or in utero electroporation (before synaptogenesis) necessitate more than 10 days of expression and are therefore not appropriate. The use of TAT-peptides is unfortunately not an option either as the injection of peptides in animals would require amounts of peptides that we are not able to produce.</p><p>Unfortunately, for all these reasons, we do not consider as easily feasible the transfer of our conclusions to an acute system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The functional characterization of synaptic transmission is rudimentary. A lot can go wrong in the analysis of miniature synaptic events, and evoked and miniature release may not even be mediated by the same postsynaptic receptors. Thorough analysis of evoked EPSCs seems required to support the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this important remark. However, the difficulty with studying evoked-EPSCs rather than miniature events amplitude is that the former strongly depends on the number of stimulated synapses (n), a parameter which is greatly affected when Nlg1 expression is manipulated, as shown figure 1 and reported in the literature (e.g., Chubykin et al., Neuron, 2007; Mondin et al., 2011; Giannone et al., 2013; Chih et al., 2005). As a result, we found difficult to isolate the effect of Nlg1 on the quantal size parameter (q) from evoked-EPSCs and we therefore opted for analysing spontaneous or evoked asynchronous miniature currents instead.</p><p>To try to take into account the potential differences between spontaneous and evoked currents, which might engage separate presynaptic pools of vesicles (this fact is still highly debated, see Fredj and Burrone, Nat neurosci, 2009, Hua et al., 2010; Wilhelm et al., 2010, Tang et al., 2016), we decided to analyse both spontaneous miniature currents in primary cultures (in Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and evoked miniature currents in organotypic slices (in Sr<sup>2+</sup>). Both experiments gave similar results, showing that q is decreased when overexpressing Nlg1-deltaC. This suggests that whether spontaneous and evoked transmission engage different pools of vesicles or not, they are nonetheless similarly affected by the Nlg1-deltaC mutant. Furthermore, the fact that both peptide incubation and simulation also give similar results makes us confident that our experimental approach is valid. This point relative to the type of miniature or evoked responses is now discussed in the main text.</p><p>In parallel, we performed new analyses and experiments:</p><p>i) In organotypic slices from WT or KO mice, we analysed the amplitude of the first peak of the responses evoked in Sr<sup>2+</sup>, which corresponds to the summation of synchronized events. We found that overexpressing Nlg1-WT increases the amplitude of this peak on both the WT or KO background, an effect that we assume to be related to an increase in synapse number (see for instance Shipman et al., 2011; Bemben et al., Nat Neurosci, 2014; Levy et al., 2015). Overexpressing the Nlg1-deltaC mutant had a similar effect on the WT background but seemed less efficient to promote this effect on the KO background (although not statistically significant). This dependence on the presence of endogenous Nlg1 has been described previously (Shipman et al., 2011) and highlights the difficulty to extract the effect of Nlg1 on the quantal size when analysing EPSCs, which depends also on n. This point is interesting but it seems out of the paper focus, which concerns the role of neuroligin in the molecular pre-post organization. For these reasons we would prefer to not to show these data in the article as they may complicate the message.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>EPSC amplitudes on brain slices (evoked in strontium).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31755-resp-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><p>ii) In cell cultures, we recorded spontaneous, action potential-dependent, currents in the absence of TTX after 2 days of Nlg1-WT or mutant expression. We analysed both the amplitude and the kinetics of EPSCs (larger than 50 pA to exclude miniature events) but found no difference across conditions (see Figure below). However, the amplitude data are difficult to interpret because they highly depend on the number of synapses formed by a single axon on the recorded neuron. This parameter is highly variable because it depends for example on the density of cells in the culture and their axonal and dendritic growth rate, etc.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Properties of EPSCs in cell culture.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31755-resp-fig3-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The diffusion coefficient of glutamate in the synaptic cleft seems an important parameter. However, the value used is unclear (it is just briefly mentioned in the legend of Figure 6), and how its exact value would affect the conclusions remains open. This point should be addressed in systematic simulations. Furthermore, the synaptic cleft height may affect the conclusions. Why was it assumed 20 nm if the authors have the full reconstruction of the extracellular space?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we performed modelling experiments with glutamate diffusion coefficients of 300 and 500 µm²/s. Results are reported in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>. With these values, the effect of pre-post misalignment is stronger than with a diffusion coefficient of 100 µm²/s, and the number of open AMPAR in response to glutamate release is small, particularly for a limited amount of glutamate per vesicle. We know that glutamate diffusion can be slowed down in a dense environment. Based on our simulation, the use of a diffusion coefficient of 100 µm²/s inside the cleft gave us results more conform to the measured one with electrophysiology. These new modelling results are now added as a supplemental figure to the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31755-resp-fig4-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Concerning the synaptic cleft, the structure comes from the digitization of the neuropil taken from electron microscopy images. Briefly, as described in the 2 Bartol papers from 2015 cited in the text, the group of Kristen Harris succeeded to reconstruct a complete piece of hippocampus by connecting successive electron microscopy sections. All these results have been subsequently digitized to deliver a complete 3D image of this piece of brain. Even if not represented on our figure, the model takes into account the exact localization of the pre-synapse, of the surrounding environment as glial cells, since all this information are part of the electron microscopy images.</p><p>Moreover, on the image, the PSD can be distinguished: it corresponds to the red area inside the synapses. The size of the cleft is directly obtained from electron microscopy, and even if fixation can create small artefacts, we believe that it won’t affect too drastically the model and the simulated results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The presentation of the results requires improvement.

This lateral mobility is dependent on AMPAR complex composition, phosphorylation status and desensitization properties (Compans et al., 2016; Constals et al., 2015; Hafner et al., 2015; Tomita et al., 2007).”.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Both editors and reviewers think that the manuscript has been improved and has the potential to be an important paper. However, we think the functional aspects of the work have not reached acceptability. Specifically the discussion among reviewers and editors concluded that additional data requested in the first reviews should be pursued to fully support the conclusions the authors would like to make. We realize that this reflects additional work for the authors, but in our opinion this work would substantially increase the merits of the work. We hope you will be able to address these concerns in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Regarding further experiments for slice recordings, the authors' contention that fast manipulation is not possible with this system is not compelling. It is indeed possible that viral expression generates expression at a sufficiently fast time scale, before structural changes are initiated. Before the authors have tried, it cannot be claimed that it does not work.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this comment, we undertook a lentivirus-based strategy to express either HA-tagged NLG1 or NLG-ΔCter in young rats, and then perform acute slice recordings as suggested by the reviewer. The two DNA constructs that were made for this purpose are under a synapsin promoter to specifically target neuronal cells, and comprise an IRES sequence downstream of NLG1, allowing the expression of a GFP reporter. The two constructs were tested by transfection on dissociated cell cultures, before viral encapsulation: high GFP signals were observed that correlated with anti-HA labelling in the same neurons (see below), revealing the expression of the neuroligin-1 protein. We then inserted the plasmids in lentiviral vectors and carried out the production of lentivirus: the titration was 10<sup>9</sup> viral particles per mL. However, we obtained only sparse and very weak GFP signal on cell cultures with both NRL1 and deltaC viruses. Then, 8 rats (4 rats for each construct) were infected by hippocampal in vivo injection. Unfortunately, acute hippocampal slices 19 and 24 days after injection did not present any GFP signal. Slices were then fixed and immuno labelled with anti-HA antibody, which did not give any signal either.</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Example of neurons labelled with anti-HA alexa647nm in culture transfected by either Nlg1HA-IRES-GFP or NLG1HA-ΔCter IRES GFP plasmids, used for lentivirus production.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31755-resp-fig5-v3.tif"/></fig><p>The total size of the plasmid is 11 000 base pairs, which can explain the difficulty of encapsulation into viral particles. Thus, we fear that the main part of produced particles do not contain the inserted plasmid. In the recent literature, the only examples of virus infection used to modulate neuroligin expression are based on the infection of conditional neuroligin floxed mice with lentiviruses expressing cre-recombinase, a at least 2kb smaller insert (Chanda et al. Journal of Neuroscience 2017; Jiang et al., Molecular Psychiatry 2016).</p><p>We now clearly specify in the text that experiments were done on cultured systems, and added one sentence to discuss the difference between acute and cultured slices. The implementation of another strategy to try to replicate our results on an acute system would take several additional months without guarantee of success. We hope that the reviewer will acknowledge the time and efforts we spent to test in vivo expression of neuroligin-1 using viruses, and understand the limitations of that strategy for this particular construct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding the criticisms concerning the evoked EPSCs, the authors now provide analysis of EPSCs evoked in strontium. However, issues with these data remain. First, strontium is a rather artificial approach to study evoked synaptic transmission.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the text to specify that the recruited pool of pre-synaptic vesicles in the presence of strontium is still under debate (subsection “Pre-post misalignment affects both action potential -dependent and -independent 382 synaptic currents”, third paragraph). Moreover, as suggested by the reviewer, we have performed more dual patch clamp experiments in organotypic slices cultures, now recording evoked AMPAR-mediated EPSCs in CA1 neurons in the presence of calcium, a more physiological condition than strontium. These new data (appearing in Figure 4—figure supplement 2) show that Nlg1ΔCter expression does not produce such a strong increase in AMPAR-mediated EPSCs as Nlg1 WT, as compared to control non-electroporated neurons. These data thus support our measurements of miniature EPSCs and evoked EPSCs in the presence of strontium. Paragraphs mentioning those data and discussing evoked EPSCs in strontium and calcium conditions have been added in the Results and Discussion, respectively. The way to interpret these data is further discussed below (subsection “NLG1 C-terminus truncation impairs synaptic transmission”; and subsection “Pre-post misalignment affects both action potential -dependent and -independent synaptic currents”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the slow rise time of the evoked EPSCs is 2 ms (Figure 4—figure supplement 2D), which indicates technical problems with these recordings. How the authors can study the functional effects of nanoscale alignment under these recording conditions remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the rise-time that we measured, which is about 2 ms is relatively slow compared to what have been reported in the literature for other central synapses including the CA3-CA1 synapse. However, several aspects have to be taken into consideration, which we believe relate more to the analysis method and the model than the quality of the recordings per se:</p><p>- We reanalysed our traces using the miniAnalysis software and measured the 20-80% rise time, which is more often used in the literature as compared to the 10-90% rise time (that we showed in the first version of the manuscript). Indeed, the 20-80% rise-time is less subject to fluctuations due to the noise that can be found at the onset and peak of events, especially when amplitudes are small. This new analysis gives average values which distribute around 1.5 ms and correspond to the normal high range of what has been published in the literature (see for instance Grillo et al., Neuron, 2018 for CA1 neurons) (see table below).</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">10-90% rise time (ms)</td><td valign="bottom">20-80% rise time (ms)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Control</td><td valign="bottom">2,31 ± 0,17</td><td valign="bottom">1,59 ± 0,14</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">NLG1-WT</td><td valign="bottom">2,09 ± 0,16</td><td valign="bottom">1,36 ± 0,17</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">NLG1-ΔC</td><td valign="bottom">2,4 ± 0,16</td><td valign="bottom">1,52 ± 0,17</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>- We plotted the distribution of 10-90% rise-times for individual events recorded in the same cell (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>). As you can see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>, we could detect at least 3 populations of events: those displaying relatively fast (~1.3 ms), intermediate (~3 ms) and slow (~4.5 ms) rise-times. Note that fast events (&lt;0.5 ms) could be detected in our recordings. To what populations of synapses correspond these events is not clear but one should consider that rise-times depend not only on the functional organization of synapses and the biophysics of receptors but also on the location of the stimulated synapses on the dendritic arbor. As a matter of fact, this parameter is often used to estimate the distance of active synapses to the soma as responses generated by distal synapses will be more filtered compared to responses from proximal synapses (see for instance Smith et al., J Physiol, 2003; Grillo et al., Neuron 2018; Balu et al., J Neuroscience 2007). In organotypic slices, it is very likely that the spatial arrangement between stimulated CA3 axons and CA1 neurons and the topography of connections is modified compared to acute slices, and might explain this heterogeneity.</p><fig id="respfig6"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31755-resp-fig6-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Finally, we want to emphasize that strontium experiments have been performed in a paired patch-clamp paradigm, meaning that effect of Nlg1ΔCter expression on asynchronous currents is directly comparable to the control EPSCs recorded from an adjacent non-electroporated neuron, reinforcing the idea that modification of their amplitude is indeed due to the expression of Nlg1 constructs and not to patch-clamp artefacts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors try to argue that evoked EPSCs are difficult to interpret, because overlaying effects of receptor alignment and synapse number are difficult to dissect. However, a pessimistic view on the new data shown in the figure for reviewers would be that the central hypothesis is challenged. The authors could perform nonstationary fluctuation analysis of evoked EPSCs to distinguish between changes in N and q. In any case, additional experiments are needed to address the reviewers’ concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we performed additional experiments and recorded EPSCs in Ca²<sup>+</sup>-containing aCSF from CA1 neurons in organotypic slices. Taking advantage of our dual recordings approach, we decided to compare EPSCs from a neuron expressing recombinant NLG1 (WT or ΔCter) and a nearby non-electroporated neuron upon stimulating the same afferent fibers. We found that overexpressing NLG1-WT or NLG1-ΔCter both increase AMPAR-EPSCs amplitude relatively to the control neuron, consistent with the established capacity of NLG1 to increase the number of synaptic contacts with afferent fibers (Mondin et al., 2011; Chih et al., 2005). However, we found that the normalized EPSC amplitude measured from neurons expressing the NLG1-ΔCter mutant was significantly lower compared to neurons expressing NLG1, which in principle can be explained by a smaller number of functional synapses (n), release probability (p) or quantal size (q). From our previous study (Mondin et al., 2011), expression of NLG1-ΔCter recruits presynaptic terminals to the same extent as NLG1, most likely through the binding to presynaptic Neurexins. This is not surprising given that both constructs share the same extracellular domain. Moreover, our recordings of the paired-pulse ratio do not exhibit any difference between control neurons and neurons expressing NLG1-WT or NLG1-ΔCter, indicating no difference at the pre-synaptic level. Therefore, we propose that the difference of EPSC amplitudes between NLG1-WT and NLG1-ΔCter conditions results from a lack of AMPAR recruitment in front of glutamatergic release sites, most likely due to the inability of NLG1-ΔCter to interact with PDZ domain containing including PSD-95 and S-SCAM. Such a lack of recruitment for NLG1-ΔCter compared to NLG1-WT could lead to either the complete silencing of synapses (decreased n) and/or to the misalignment of presynaptic release sites with respect to AMPAR nanodomains (decreased q).</p><p>To test these ideas further and discriminate between these two possibilities, we considered performing different types of quantal analyses, including recording responses to minimal stimulations, performing variance-mean analysis (Clements, J. Neurosci Methods, 2003; Silver, J Neurosci Methods 2003) and analysing the coefficient of variation (CV) over many trials taking advantage of our dual recordings configuration (Levy et al., 2015). Minimal stimulations has been tested but they presented strong disadvantages as the restricted sampling to a subset of synapses, the recurrent asynchronous poly-synaptic responses and the delayed responses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref>), we decided to not go further with this option. Moreover, we found that the variance-mean analysis which allows to access n and q by varying p with different levels of extracellular calcium (Silver, 2003; Clements, 2003) was highly challenging to apply in organotypic slices due to the high excitability of the circuit. Typically, raising extracellular calcium to 5 mM caused bursts of activity, thus making impossible the analysis of EPSC amplitude and variance (see traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref>). We therefore opted for analysing the CV which is possible thanks to our dual recording approach where the electroporated neuron is normalized to a control neuron (Levy et al., 2015).</p><fig id="respfig7"><label>Author response image 7.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31755-resp-fig7-v3.tif"/></fig><p>The CV is commonly considered as a parameter depending on quantal content (n*p) but not quantal size according to the quantal theory. For instance, comparing the CV in dual recordings enabled Levy et al. (2015) to show the relative loss of functional glutamatergic synapses upon MAGUK knock-down in organotypic slices, consistent with a decrease in the number of asynchronous EPSCs elicited in strontium. However, besides the established contribution of quantal content to CV, several lines of evidence suggest that the dynamic nanoscale organization of AMPARs can also contribute to the CV at the level of individual synapses. For instance, the CV of EPSCs recorded from pairs of neurons is decreased upon crosslinking surface AMPARs with antibodies (Heine et al., 2008), suggesting that AMPAR fluctuations at the synapse due to diffusional exchange can also affect the CV. Furthermore, simulations predict that the CV is inversely correlated with the number of synaptic AMPARs (Czondor et al., 2012). Therefore, while an increase in the parameter n is expected to correlate with a lower CV, one could predict that a lack of PSD-95 dependent anchorage at NRX-NLG adhesion sites produces a higher CV.</p><p>We applied the CV analysis in our dual recordings and found that NLG1-WT expression consistently decreases the CV relatively to control neurons, in parallel of increasing the EPSC amplitude. This could be interpreted as an increase in the number of functional synapses, which is in agreement with the increase of asynchronous events elicited in strontium. However, we did not find such a decrease in CV for neurons expressing NLG1-ΔCter, despite the 200% increase in EPSC amplitude. The higher CV found for neurons expressing NLG1-ΔCter compared to NLG1 could be explained either by a higher proportion of silent synapses (n) and/or a higher number of functional synapses in which the pre/post synaptic misalignment induces higher fluctuations. Considering our strontium recordings showing that NLG1-ΔCter expression increases the number of asynchronous events compared to the control neuron but with smaller amplitudes, we believe that the second option is highly plausible. The calcium experiments have been now added as Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and results are both explained in the main Results and discussed in the Discussion (subsection “NLG1 C-terminus truncation impairs synaptic transmission”; and subsection “Pre-post misalignment affects both action potential -dependent and -independent synaptic currents”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding the adjustment of rate constants in the AMPAR model (subsection “Synaptic efficiency critically depends on the AMPAR nanodomains to glutamate release sites distance”), it is unclear how microscopic reversibility can be maintained with these changes. Calculating the products of rates for the two cycles in clockwise and anti-clockwise direction in the modified model, they do not match, suggesting that microscopic reversibility is violated. Furthermore, the authors refer to Figure 5, but the relevant numbers are in the legend of Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, there was a clear mistake in our model parameters. We corrected the values with respect to microscopic reversibility. New parameters have been written in the text. We have performed again all simulations with the corrected values and changed the figures accordingly. Moreover we added a graph where we superimposed a mean recorded trace of miniatures and the mean simulated trace to verify that new parameters fit with physiological data.</p><p>Here are the new values with notation based on the model by Jonas et al. 1993: k1 = 13.77 μs<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>; k1r = 2130 s<sup>-1</sup>; k2 = 85.2 μs<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>; k2r = 1630 s<sup>-1</sup>; alpha = 1696 s<sup>-1</sup>; beta = 630 s<sup>-1</sup>; alpha1 = 1445 s<sup>-1</sup>; beta1 = 19.6 s<sup>-1</sup>; alpha2 = 86 s<sup>-1</sup>; beta2 = 0.3635 s<sup>-1</sup>; alpha3 = 8.85 s<sup>-1</sup>; beta3 = 2 s<sup>-1</sup>; alpha4 = 6.72 s<sup>-1</sup>; beta4 = 133.28s<sup>-1</sup>; k3 = 3.81 μs<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>; k3r = 22.85 s<sup>-1</sup>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
