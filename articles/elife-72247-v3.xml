Increasing epidemiological studies demonstrated that PM plays a significant role in CNS demyelinating disorders; however, there is no direct testimony of this, and yet the molecular mechanism by which the occurrence remains unclear. Using multiple <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> strategies, in the present study we demonstrate that PM exposure aggravates neuroinflammation, myelin injury, and dysfunction of movement coordination ability via boosting microglial pro-inflammatory activities, in both the pathological demyelination and physiological myelinogenesis animal models. Indeed, pharmacological disturbance combined with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq suggests that TLR-4/NF-kB signaling mediated a core network of genes that control PM-triggered microglia pathogenicity. In summary, our study defines a novel atmospheric environmental mechanism that mediates PM-aggravated microglia pathogenic activities, and establishes a systematic approach for the investigation of the effects of environmental exposure in neurologic disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>particulate matter</kwd><kwd>CNS demyelination</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>tlr-4/nf-κb signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82071396</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An atmospheric trigger, the respirable particulate matter boost microglia pathogenic activities in the context of CNS demyelination by activating TLR-4/NF-kB signaling axis in animal models of immune- and toxicity-induced demyelination, as well as myelinogenesis during postnatal development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Air pollution has become the prominent environmental risk factor that affects public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caplin et al., 2019</xref>).

Although a majority of PM research focuses on the respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, increasing epidemiological evidence has linked the irreversible adverse roles of continuous PM exposure with the morbidity and mortality of central nervous system (CNS) diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Prado Bert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Younan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Studies have confirmed that nanosized PM can physically penetrate the blood-brain barrier and placental barrier, and therefore invade the brain parenchyma of adults and fetuses to directly induce effects in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bové et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maher et al., 2016</xref>). In 2018, the editorial of The Lancet Neurology reported that air pollution has been associated with increased risk of neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">The Lancet Neurology, 2018</xref>). Growing epidemiological reports have indisputably demonstrated that long-time PM exposure affects the development of the nervous system, thus increases the incidence and/or severity of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), stroke, brain atrophy, anxiety, and multiple sclerosis (MS), among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babadjouni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Prado Bert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Khan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Younan et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, due to the specific physiology of fetuses (relatively high ratio of respiration rate to body size and underdeveloped lung), PM exposure during pregnancy or early pregnancy causes long-term and irreversible adverse effects on neurodevelopment of fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandrakumar and ’t Jong, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sripada, 2017</xref>). However, the pathogenic mechanism of PM leading to different/specific neurological diseases needs to be elucidated in depth.</p><p>Myelin sheaths represent key structures for saltatory conduction of nerve impulse and trophic support of axons, and their loss or dysfunction leads to demyelination and impaired neurological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hughes and Appel, 2020</xref>). Clinically, demyelination occurs in a range of human neurological disorders as diverse as MS, optic neuromyelitis, leukodystrophy, spinal cord injury, AD, Parkinson’s disease (PD), white matter stroke, as well as schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goldman and Kuypers, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malpass, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marin and Carmichael, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitew et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pukos et al., 2019</xref>). The exact etiology and pathogenesis of demyelination diseases are unknown so far, involving many complex factors such as environment exposures, autoimmune response, and genetic susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kumar and Abboud, 2019</xref>). Klocke et al. found that exposure to concentrated fine and ultrafine particles during embryonic development affected oligodendrocyte maturation and brain myelination in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klocke et al., 2017</xref>). Taking MS, a representative inflammatory demyelination disease, as an example, epidemiologic evidence highlights the effect of PM exposure on the risk of incidence, relapse, and deterioration of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tateo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting strong correlations connecting PM exposure to demyelination and remyelination failure. However, the direct evidence of PM action on demyelinating disease is lack, and the cellular/molecular mechanisms leading to this disease process remain unclear.</p><p>To investigate this important question, here we develop the complementary pathological and physiological demyelination/myelination models to identify PM that boost microglia-driven neuroinflammation, and define the TLR-4/NF-kB signaling pathways involved in the regulation of microglia pro-inflammatory activities as well as PM-related demyelinating diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PM exposure aggravates myelin injury in EAE, a CNS inflammatory demyelination model</title><p>Neuroinflammation is one of the major pathogenic factors resulting in CNS injury.

Consistent with the clinical finding, histological analysis revealed significantly enhanced inflammatory and demyelinating foci in the white matter of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) in PM-treated animals when compared with the PBS control. PM-treated mice also had a remarkably increased number of mononuclear cells (MNCs) in the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The total number of MNCs per mouse in the PM-treated group was 13.9 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>6</sup>, which is ~2.2 fold of that PBS control (6.24 ± 0.8 × 10<sup>6</sup>, p &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We then determined the effect of PM on myelin loss using anti-MBP (myelin marker) staining. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and a</xref> significant degree of MBP loss (demyelination) had occurred in PM-treated mice, indicating disease progression. Furthermore, significantly accumulation of IBA1+ activated microglia (~2.5 fold in PM-treated EAE mice compared with PBS controls, p &lt; 0.001) and A2B5+ OPCs (~2.7 fold in PM-treated EAE mice compared with PBS controls, p &lt; 0.001) in the area of demyelination injury were detected in PM-treated mice, while PM aspiration did not significantly impact the expression of the astrocyte marker GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To further evaluate the effects of PM treatment on the various inﬂammatory cells in CNS, isolated MNCs from CNS were analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage and absolute number of CD45+ CD11b + cells (microglia and infiltrating macrophages) and other infiltrated immune cells (CD45+ CD11b− cells) were increased obviously in PM group, compared with the PBS control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Increased expression of CD80 and MHCII was also observed in CD11b + cells (microglia/infiltrating macrophages) and CD11c + cells (dendritic cells; DCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), indicating an enhanced activation of these cells. The total numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and percentages of Th17 (CD4+ IL17+) and Th1 (CD4+ IFN-γ+) cells were also significantly increased under PM aspiration (all p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To study the effect of nasopharyngeal inhaled PM on the peripheral immune response, splenocytes of EAE mice were stimulated with MOG<sub>35-55</sub> peptide and analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, splenocytes in PM-treated group exhibited significantly increased numbers and expression of co-stimulatory molecules (e.g. MHC class II, CD80, CD86) of antigen-presenting cells (CD11c+), and higher percentage of IFN-γ+, IL-17+, and TNF-α+ CD4+ T cells. We also examined the effect of PM on Th17 and Th1 cell differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, and similar to LPS stimulation, PM treatment significantly increased Th1 cells but had no significant effects on Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Overall, these results showed that PM exposure possibly aggravates inflammatory demyelination of the CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PM aspiration exacerbates demyelination and prevents remyelination in a toxin-induced demyelination model</title><p>We then investigated the impact of PM aspiration on coprizone-induced demyelination, another classical mammalian animal model that for studying pathological processes associated with demyelinating diseases. Experimental design and treatment paradigms were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, body weight of mice in PBS group showed progressive loss during the 4 weeks of cuprizone fed. After cuprizone withdrawn and returning to normal diet for 2 weeks, weight loss was gradual recovery and remyelination was observed in the corpus callosum area of mice in the PBS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). However, continuous PM aspiration obviously inhibited the weight gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). PM exposure significantly increased the susceptibility to demyelination injury caused by cuprizone (oral administration for 3 weeks), and prevented CNS spontaneous remyelination in the corpus callosum even after cuprizone withdrawn for 2 weeks, as detected by FluoroMyelin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The numbers of CNS resident immune cells, GFAP+ astrocytes and IBA1+ microglia, were also significantly increased in the PM-treated group both at demyelination and remyelination process, indicating that PM exposure exacerbated neuroinflammation and demyelination in toxic-induced demyelinating mice, and significantly inhibited myelin repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

There are similar pathological features in human autopsy study with high levels of air pollution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knochelmann et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that abnormal activation of microglia may be the main cellular event and pathogenic factor in the process of PM promoting neuroinflammation and demyelination. As the resident innate immune cells and sentinels surveying the CNS environment, microglia respond quickly to a vast repertoire of stimuli, including environmental toxins, wound, pathogens, or cellular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>). The abnormal activation of microglia under PM exposure in the demyelination/myelinogenesis animal models led us to hypothesize that the polarization states may have critical roles in regulating the de/remyelination. To test this, primary microglia were stimulated by exposure to PM, using endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a positive control. It is well accepted that LPS is a classic stimuli to induce microglia into proinflammatory phenotype. Interestingly, incubation of PM with the primary microglia could mimic, even completely replace, the effect of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). Most of the cells in PBS group were spindle-shaped with slender branches, while under LPS or PM treatment, the cell body became larger and rounder with decreased and thickened protrusions, presenting typical ‘amoeba-like’ activation morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similar to LPS stimulation, PM-treated microglia expressed higher levels of MHC II and CD86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

The authors concluded that the active components of PM, not the total mass, are the crucial factor mediating the biological responses.</p><p>Our data demonstrated that the cellular mechanisms of PM aggravated the neuroinflammation and demyelination could be mediated by excessive microglial activation by producing neurotoxic pro-inflammatory factors. Microglia are the resident innate immune cells in the CNS, which respond to perturbation caused by environmental stimuli, toxins, trauma or diseases hypersensitive, and performs continuous monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yeh and Ikezu, 2019</xref>). A number of clinical and neuropathological studies have shown that priming microglia exhibit a typical pro-inflammatory phenotype, which is one of the key pathogenic factors during aging and in a variety of CNS-diseases including AD, PD, MS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with our results, recent studies have shown that PM exposure induced neuroinflammatory including increase inflammatory cytokine secretion <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woodward et al., 2017b</xref>). Our study extends these results in the demyelination lesion specificity of the PM response.</p><p>Guided by the gene expression analysis, we defined a role for PM in the activation of TLR4/NF-kB-driven pathogenic activities in microglia. PM enhances pathologic microglia activation in a TLR4/NF-kB-dependent manner leading to worsened demyelination disease in a murine model of EAE. TLR4/NF-kB signal pathway is involved in the regulation of multiple important physiological and pathological processes, such as immunity, inflammation, tumorigenesis, aging, and neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>). NF-kB is a ubiquitous DNA-binding transcription factor, which has differential biological effects depending on the extent and duration of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>). It is also a typical inducible transcription factor, thus the direct target gene profile and corresponding regulatory networks are variable with different stimuli (e.g. LPS, TNF-α, IL-1β or PM) among different types of cells (e.g. lymphocytes, fibroblasts, epithelial cells or microglia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martin et al., 2020</xref>). In other words, the target genes regulated by NF-kB is stimuli and cell-type specific. Although we found PM incubation with microglia mimic the effect of LPS, which present the typical ‘amoeba-like’ activation morphologies and high expression of pro-inflammation cytokines and markers like <italic>Tnfa</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Inos</italic>, <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ptgs2</italic>, and <italic>Stat3</italic>, the target gene profile of PM and LPS is distinct. These findings are consistent with the exacerbation of lung LPS inflammatory responses when combined with PM exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Woodward et al., 2017a</xref>), indicating that the target gene responses of PM were not only due to endotoxin presence in the PM samples, but may also be attributed to the high chemical heterogeneity of PM. TLR4/NF-kB signaling serves as a candidate regulatory axis for PM-induced pathogenic activity in microglia. PM treatment significantly induced TLR4/NF-kB signaling-related genes, such as <italic>Nod2</italic>, <italic>Tnfrsf1b</italic>, <italic>Tnfaip3</italic>, <italic>Fas</italic>, and <italic>NFkb1. Nod2</italic> has been demonstrated to trigger microglial activation via the TAK1-NF-kB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Tnfaip3</italic> could inhibit TNF- and TLR4-induced NF-kB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vereecke et al., 2009</xref>). Stimulation of group II metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) in primary microglia induces a neurotoxic microglial phenotype, and <italic>Fas</italic> ligand enhances the neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>). However, the relationship between the up-regulation of these genes and the health hazards of PM is still unclear, and the function of <italic>Tnfrsf1b</italic> in microglial activation is unknown. Our further study will focus on the function of PM-indused NF-kB-targeted genes in the process of microglial activation. Subsequently, the alleviating and therapeutic effects of candidate genes on PM-induced CNS myelin injury will be evaluated.</p><p>Taken together, our present study confirms that PM inhalation leads to aggravate CNS demyelination, and this action is associated with a previously unrecognized role for TLR4/NF-kB signaling-mediated microglia activation. The results suggest a novel mechanism for PM-produced adverse effects on the nervous system and present a potential intervention target for prevention. Importantly, given the specific nature of PM, e.g., the biologic responses of this complex mixtures is further influenced by the source and constituents, the route of exposure, the particulate matrix within which they reside, the potential different mechanisms and bio-availability of these components, and the genetic differences of the recipients, we believe that the investigation of these differences is necessary to clarify the characteristics of PM exposure and the potential to cause CNS disease. Only then will it be reasonable to propose targeted remediation to stem the tide of demyelination disease that is growing in populations facing air pollution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 mice (8–10 weeks of age) were purchased from the Fourth Military University (Xi’an, China).

Reads distributions (from bigwig) across gene are presented as an average plot (average of reads signals across the targeted genes). The deeptools tool is used for this analysis. Differential peaks were then selected with the absolute value of the log2 fold change was one at a p-value &lt; 0.05 using DESeq2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism six software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Data are presented as mean ± SD. When comparing multiple groups, data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors investigated PM on myelination in the CNS using a well-established animal model of demyelination. They showed that the PM-induced demyelination causes neurological dysfunction that is associated with microglial activation and markers of inflammation. They also show that PM can activate the TLR/NFkB signaling using in vitro model of microglial activation. They use the in vitro data to claim in vivo effects are also due to TLR4/NKFB activation by PM, however, additional evidence is needed to support this claim. Overall, the authors provide evidence that PM can promote and exacerbate demyelination which is associated with increased inflammation in the rodent central nervous system.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title and some claims should be revised given that PM effects on demyelination in vivo do not provide strong evidence for TLR4/NFKB role. The in vitro microglia data indicate activation of TLR4/NFKB by PM but this must be experimentally validated in vivo or the claims adjusted to reflect that the effects of PM in vivo may be in part mediated by activation of TLR4/NFKB. Ultimately, the mechanism of PM exacerbation of demyelination is not elucidated in vivo (i.e. no pharmacological or genetic manipulation of TRL4/NFKB) and may or may not involve the TLR4/NFKB pathway. It is likely they are activated but whether they are primary drivers of the demyelination as the title implies is not demonstrated here. The authors should alter the claims to better reflect the data and its implications or add additional experiments to support the in vivo role of TLR4/NFKB.</p><p>2) In Figure 1, the authors showed that for both central and peripheral immunity, the percentages of Th17 (CD4<sup>+</sup> IL17+) and Th1 (CD4<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ+) cells were significantly increased under PM exposure. PM has already been reported to have some effects on peripheral immunity. The authors remain to examine the effects of PM on different T cells subsets in vitro? Additionally, it is not clear that in Figure 1G, the % of CD45+ cells reached to 130 +/- 20%, is this correct?</p><p>3) In both Figure 2 and Figure 3, the authors show the activation of microglia and astrocytes by PM. Although in Figure 1, the authors mentioned that activated IBA1+ microglia and A2B5+ OPCs accumulated significantly in demyelinated injured areas in PM-treated mice, while PM inhalation had no significant effect on GFAP+ astrocytes. Microglia showed activation results by PM in three complementary animal models, which led the authors to select the final follow-up study subjects of microglia. Given the above results, the authors should examine the direct effects of PM on primary astrocytes, at least in vitro.</p><p>4) In Figure 2C, the column results in &quot;Demyelination scores&quot; showed reduced demyelination in the PM group, and the 4+2 groups even reduced more. These appear to contradict the imaging graphs and conclusions made in manuscript.</p><p>5) For the in vitro modeling, how was the dosage of PM selected? How does the dose compare to what cells would be exposed to in the in vivo model? Also, in Material and Methods, the dose of PM used in microglia culture was 200 mg/ml, but in Figure 4 the dose of PM was 100 μg/mL, why is the different dose used?</p><p>6) In Figure 4. The authors proposed that treatment of purified primary OPC with microglia-conditioned medium (MCM) in vitro prevented OPC differentiation. OPC are essential for remyelination after central nervous system injury. Therefore, it is necessary for the authors to investigate the direct effects of PM on OPC and thus better illustrate the effects of PM exposure on CNS demyelinating diseases.</p><p>7) CD80&quot; was mentioned in the figure legend of 4B and in the Results section, but it was not shown in the figure. It should be added to the figure, or be removed from the legend and Results.</p><p>8) Results and figures of Figure 4E and F are matched each other; however, their legends are opposite to figures and Results. Please check and correct.</p><p>9) In Figure 5. The authors predicted targeted genes for PM to induce microglial activation via the TLR-4/NF-κB signaling axis by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. However, the manuscript would benefit if the authors also discussed the role of predicted target genes in PM-induced microglial activation, and what might be done subsequently.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Atmospheric particulate matter aggravates CNS demyelination in mice via TLR-4/NF-κB-mediated microglia pathogenic activities&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Results shown that both of the inhibitors effectively reversed the deterioration of the disease caused by PM exposure in the EAE model (Figure 4J, page 13, line 282-284), demonstrating that the effect of PM was mediated, maybe partially, by TLR4/ NF-κB activation in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1, the authors showed that for both central and peripheral immunity, the percentages of Th17 (CD4<sup>+</sup> IL17+) and Th1 (CD4<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ+) cells were significantly increased under PM exposure.

According to your suggestion, we had evaluated the effect of PM on Th17/Th1 cell differentiation. The results showed that PM incubation in vitro promoted Th1 cells, while had no significant effect on Th17 cell differentiation (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, page 7, line 142-145).

Because the human body is a complex system, the accurate concentration of PM in the brain is currently unknown. Therefore, in vitro doses cannot be compared to cells exposed in in vivo models. We choose the dosage of PM in the in vitro modeling according to our preliminary experiments of dose optimization. In our study, PM dose used in microglial cell culture is 100 μg/mL, and we apologize for this error, which we have modified in the revised manuscript (Page 29, line 621-622).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 4.
