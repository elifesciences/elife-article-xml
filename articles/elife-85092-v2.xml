Genetic and experimental evidence indicates that chronic alveolar injury and failure to properly repair the respiratory epithelium are intrinsic to IPF pathogenesis. Loss of alveolar type 2 (AT2) stem cells or mutations that either impair their self-renewal and/or impair their differentiation into AT1 cells can serve as a trigger of pulmonary fibrosis. Recent reports indicate increased YAP activity in respiratory epithelial cells in IPF lungs. Individual IPF epithelial cells with aberrant YAP activation in bronchiolized regions frequently co-express AT1, AT2, conducting airway selective markers and even mesenchymal or EMT markers, demonstrating ‘indeterminate’ states of differentiation and suggesting that aberrant YAP signaling might promote pulmonary fibrosis. Yet, Yap and Taz have recently also been shown to be important for AT1 cell maintenance and alveolar epithelial regeneration after <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>-induced injury. To investigate how epithelial Yap/Taz might promote pulmonary fibrosis or drive alveolar epithelial regeneration, we inactivated the Hippo pathway in AT2 stem cells resulting in increased nuclear Yap/Taz, and found that this promotes their alveolar regenerative capacity and reduces pulmonary fibrosis following bleomycin injury by pushing them along the AT1 cell lineage. Vice versa, inactivation of both <italic>Yap1</italic> and <italic>Wwtr1</italic> (encoding Taz) or <italic>Wwtr1</italic> alone in AT2 cell stem cells impaired alveolar epithelial regeneration and resulted in increased pulmonary fibrosis upon bleomycin injury. Interestingly, the inactivation of only <italic>Yap1</italic> in AT2 stem cells promoted alveolar epithelial regeneration and reduced pulmonary fibrosis. Together, these data suggest that epithelial Yap promotes, and epithelial Taz reduces pulmonary fibrosis suggesting that targeting Yap but not Taz-mediated transcription might help promote AT1 cell regeneration and treat pulmonary fibrosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippo</kwd><kwd>Yap</kwd><kwd>Taz</kwd><kwd>lung</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 HL161169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Langhe</surname><given-names>Stijn P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL146461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Langhe</surname><given-names>Stijn P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL132156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Langhe</surname><given-names>Stijn P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HL105355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warren</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Alveolar type 2 stem cells are actively maintained by Hippo signaling and Taz promotes alveolar epithelial regeneration and the resolution of bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis upon inactivation of the Hippo pathway in Alveolar type 2 stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) pathogenesis encompasses alveolar and fibrotic remodeling, inflammation, and eventual loss of lung architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barkauskas and Noble, 2014</xref> resulting in progressive loss of pulmonary function, respiratory failure, and death, often within 5 years of diagnosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">King et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Steele and Schwartz, 2013</xref>.

Interestingly, loss of <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> in AT1 cells leads to spontaneous reprogramming into the AT2 cell lineage. However, while overexpression of a dominant active <italic>Yap1<sup>S112A</sup></italic> in AT2 cells induced <italic>Hopx</italic> expression, these cells did not exhibit the classic flattened and elongated morphology of mature AT1 cells, and most continued to express <italic>Sftpc</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Penkala et al., 2021</xref>. <italic>Yap1<sup>S112A</sup></italic> overexpression often does not recapitulate the effects of Hippo pathway inactivation as <italic>Yap1<sup>S112A</sup></italic> induces a feedback activation of the Hippo pathway, resulting in increased degradation of endogenous Yap and Taz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moroishi et al., 2015</xref>. In addition, the inactivation of <italic>Yap1</italic> alone in AT1 cells has no effect on AT1 cell marker expression. These data suggest that nuclear Yap can drive the expression of some AT1 cell genes but may not be sufficient to fully reprogram AT2 cells into AT1 cells. However, the inactivation of Hippo kinases <italic>Stk3/4</italic> (Mst2/1, respectively), resulting in increased nuclear Yap and Taz, promotes the proliferation of AT2s and their differentiation into AT1s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gokey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Little et al., 2021</xref>.

Together these findings again suggest an important role for Taz in AT1 cell differentiation. Yet, in a pneumonectomy model inactivation of <italic>Yap1</italic> in AT2 cells (<italic>Sftpc<sup>CreER</sup>; Yap1<sup>f/-</sup></italic>) decreased their proliferation and differentiation into AT1 cells compared to AT2 cells heterozygous for <italic>Yap1</italic> (<italic>Sftpc<sup>CreER</sup>; Yap1<sup>f/+</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2016</xref>, though comparison to wildtype (<italic>Sftpc<sup>CreER</sup>; Yap1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) AT2 cells was not performed.</p><p>Clearly, the Hippo pathway plays a very important role in lung development, homeostasis, and repair after injury. Although most of the available literature investigating the role of the Hippo pathway in the lung considers Yap and Taz as functionally redundant, some of the conflicting findings described above can only be explained by the fact that Yap and Taz play distinctive or even contrasting roles in different contexts and have dose-dependent as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic roles. Yap and Taz have common and distinctive structural features, reflecting only partially overlapping regulatory mechanisms and control nonidentical transcriptional programs. The issue of their divergent roles is currently underexplored in lung biology but holds fundamental implications for mechanistic and translational studies.</p><p>Many labs have found that AT2 to AT1 cell differentiation is impaired in IPF and that cells get stuck in a transitional state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kobayashi et al., 2020</xref>. After lung injury, damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs) emerge, representing a transitional state between AT2 stem cells and newly regenerated AT1 cells (aka pre-alveolar type-1 transitional cell state (PATS)) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kobayashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2020</xref>. Interestingly, DATP or PATS express profibrotic genes and show an enrichment of TP53, YAP, TGFβ, DNA-damage-response signaling, and cellular senescence, all of which are known to be involved in fibrosis in multiple organs, including the lung. However, the molecular pathways that induce and/or maintain DATPs are not completely understood nor is it clear whether promoting AT1 cell differentiation is sufficient to drive the resolution of pulmonary fibrosis. Here, by using murine lineage tracing coupled with injury-repair models and spatial transcriptomics studies, we uncovered a method to treat lung fibrosis by promoting AT1 cell differentiation through inhibition of <italic>Yap1</italic>. Mechanistically, the use of loss of function and spatial transcriptomics revealed an inhibition of <italic>Wwtr1</italic> and AT1 cell differentiation by Yap. Importantly, these transitional states correlate with abnormal epithelial cells associated with defective fibrotic foci in human lungs with progressive pulmonary fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AT2 cells are actively maintained by Hippo signaling</title><p>We have previously shown that in the developing lung heterozygous inactivation of epithelial <italic>Yap1</italic> results in a striking lung phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Volckaert et al., 2019</xref>.

However, while <italic>Tead1</italic> is expressed also at lower levels in other lung epithelial cells the expression of <italic>Tead4</italic> was specific to AT1 cells.

Here, we report that in the adult lung Merlin (<italic>Nf2</italic>), the best-known upstream activator of the Hippo pathway is highly expressed in AT2 but not AT1 cells during homeostasis. We further find strong phosho-Mst1/2 staining in AT2 cells during homeostasis, suggesting that active Hippo signaling, preventing nuclear Yap/Taz localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–I</xref>), is required for AT2 stem cell maintenance. Just like during lung development, AT1 cells in the adult lung were characterized by nuclear Taz staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>), suggesting that inactivation of the Hippo pathway in AT2 cells might be necessary for their differentiation into AT1 cells. Indeed, upon bleomycin injury, we find reduced phosho-Mst1/2 staining in regenerated alveolar epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–L</xref>) compared to uninjured lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>).

However, simultaneous or single inactivation of <italic>Yap1</italic> and <italic>Wwtr1</italic> in AT2 cells did not result in an obvious homeostatic lung phenotype in the absence of injury suggesting that Yap and/or Taz are not required for AT2 stem cell maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–L and U</xref> and data not shown).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The Hippo pathway is active in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells but not in AT1 cells.</title><p>Left lung lobes of 8-week-old mice were inflation fixed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.

For acid hydrolysis, the lobes were baked in a 70 °C oven without lids for 2 days until completely dry. The weights of dry lobes were measured and 500 μl of 6 N HCl was added to each sample. The lungs were then hydrolyzed in an 85 °C oven for 2 days with occasional vortexing. The hydrolysates were cooled at room temperature and centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min. The supernatants then were transferred to fresh 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min. Each sample or standard was diluted with citrate-acetate buffer (5% citric acid, 1.2% glacial acetic acid, 7.24% sodium acetate, and 3.4% sodium hydroxide) in a 96-well plate. Chloramine-T solution (1.4% chloramine-T, 10% N-propanol, and 80% citrate-acetate buffer) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Then, Ehrlich’s solution (1.27 M p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, 70% N-propanol, 20% perchloric acid) was added to each sample and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for 20 min. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Standard curves were generated for each experiment using the reagent hydroxyproline (Sigma H-1637) as a standard.

The ‘n’ represents biological replicates and can be found in the figure legends. The significance of differences between two sample means was determined by unpaired two-tailed student’s t-test (assuming unequal or equal variances as determined by the F-test of equality of variances). All datasets followed a normal distribution and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The number of samples to be used was based on the number of experimental paradigms multiplied by the number in each group that is necessary to yield statistically significant results based on power analysis, to reject the null hypothesis with 80% power (type I error = 0.05).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Paul Noble as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers found significant merit in the study. Please address the comments provided by the reviewers:</p><p>1. It would be helpful to include data points on graphs in figures 3, 4 and 7, and associated &quot;n&quot; in figure legends.</p><p>2. Many of the immunofluorescence images would benefit from inclusion of high magnification insets for emphasis.</p><p>3. The extent of Merlin immunoreactivity within AT2 cells (Figure 2) would be more clearly demonstrated if individual channels were shown for Merlin/Sftpc colocalization in addition to a merged image.</p><p>This interesting paper could be strengthened by a careful temporal dissection of the role of YAP and TAZ, since these effectors may have different functional roles in early vs. late phases of lung repair and regeneration. Currently, all models are based on genetic disruption prior to injury with tamoxifen induction starting 3 weeks before bleomycin injury. An important experiment to substantiate the conclusion that epithelial TAZ is protective is to perform &quot;gain of function&quot; studies in established fibrosis to determine whether this reverses fibrosis or accelerates resolution.</p><p>Methodological approaches rely heavily on image analyses, and more quantitative assessments should be included; for example, in Figure 4, the inclusion of hydroxyproline measurements are shown &quot;relative&quot; to the bleomycin-injured wild-type mice, but lacks the un-injured control group, thus it is difficult to assess the relative effects in genetically altered mice (note that &quot;n&quot; values are not shown, and a dot plot figure rather than mean with SD/SEM would be preferred).</p><p>Please present a rationale for the choice of a 6 week post bleo time point in terms of its significance in terms of progressive fibrosis versus repair and regeneration.

As such we think our data better reflects whether our mice develop progressive fibrosis and decreased regeneration as is the case for <italic>Sftpc<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Yap<sup>f/f</sup>;Taz<sup>f/f</sup></italic> or increased regeneration and resolution of pulmonary fibrosis as is the case for <italic>Sftpc<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Mst<sub>1/2</sub><sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice.

Not that even <italic>Sftpc<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Yap<sup>f/f</sup>;Taz<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice show reduced fibrosis at 6 weeks compared to 3 weeks which is likely because airway epithelial cells can contribute to regeneration somewhat.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The transition from embryonic to adult lung studies could be made more smoothly and highlight the significance in a bit more detail. page 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a transition here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion is brief and a bit redundant with the Introduction.
