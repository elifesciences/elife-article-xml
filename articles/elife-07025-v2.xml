cells (ASCs) in planarians that sustain cell replacement during homeostasis and regeneration of any missing tissue. While numerous studies have examined genes underlying neoblast pluripotency, molecular pathways driving postmitotic fates remain poorly defined. In this study, we used transcriptional profiling of irradiation-sensitive and irradiation-insensitive cell populations and RNA interference (RNAi) functional screening to uncover markers and regulators of postmitotic progeny. We identified 32 new markers distinguishing two main epithelial progenitor populations and a planarian homolog to the MEX3 RNA-binding protein (<italic>Smed-mex3-1</italic>) as a key regulator of lineage progression. <italic>mex3-1</italic> was required for generating differentiated cells of multiple lineages, while restricting the size of the stem cell compartment. We also demonstrated the utility of using <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> animals to identify additional progenitor markers. These results identified <italic>mex3-1</italic> as a cell fate regulator, broadly required for differentiation, and suggest that <italic>mex3-1</italic> helps to mediate the balance between ASC self-renewal and commitment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07025.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07025.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07025.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Adult tissues constantly replace the millions of cells they lose on a daily basis. This is made possible by adult stem cells. But how is a stable population of stem cells maintained throughout the life of the organism with constant cell division? One way this can be accomplished is if at every stem cell division, only one of the daughter cells remains a stem cell, while the other becomes specialized. For humans, if this balance is disturbed, cancers may result from too many stem cells, and early aging may result from too few stem cells.</p><p>A freshwater flatworm called <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> is known for its ability to regenerate nearly every part of its body after injury. This flatworm possesses stem cells called neoblasts that can form all of the flatworm's different cell types both during regeneration and during normal tissue turnover. Evidence suggests that the number of neoblasts and the number of specialized cells that neoblasts produce are finely balanced, similar to adult human tissues. However, little is known about the mechanism that controls whether a neoblast takes on a more specialized form.</p><p>To express a gene, it must first be copied or ‘transcribed’ into an RNA molecule. Identifying the RNA molecules that are enriched in the non-stem cells that develop from neoblasts could therefore indicate which genes regulate the cell specialization process. These RNA molecules could also be used as markers that identify which cells have taken on a more specialized form. Using techniques called transcriptional profiling and RNA interference, Zhu et al. identified 32 new markers that indicate that the neoblasts have started to specialize into epithelial cells: cells that line the surfaces of many structures in the body. Further investigation revealed that one gene, called <italic>mex3-1</italic>, is needed for many specialized cell types—not just epithelial cells—to mature from neoblasts in the flatworms. In doing so, <italic>mex3-1</italic> also limits the size of the stem cell population.</p><p>Equivalents of <italic>mex3-1</italic> are found in many different species including humans, and so Zhu et al.'s results may help us to understand how other animals regenerate and control the size of their stem cell populations. Mutant flatworms that cannot express <italic>mex3-1</italic> could also be used to study other genes that help neoblasts to specialize.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07025.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07025.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic></kwd><kwd>planarians</kwd><kwd>flatworms</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004203</institution-id><institution>Ontario Institute for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA-026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hallows</surname><given-names>Stephanie E</given-names></name><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>Bret J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>402264-2011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Currie</surname><given-names>Ko W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006126</institution-id><institution>The Hospital for Sick Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Restracomp</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Shu Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The planarian <italic>mex3-1</italic> gene is required for non-stem cell fates and suppresses a stem cell fate in differentiating cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult stem cells (ASCs) are ultimately responsible for all tissue turnover in humans, which has been estimated to be approximately 10<sup>10</sup> cells per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed, 1999</xref>). This feat is achieved through a delicate balance of proliferation and differentiation, in order to maintain a stable stem cell population while replacing the exact number and type of cells lost to cell turnover or injury. This requires inherent asymmetry in stem cell lineages, with some daughter cells retaining stem cell identity while others become committed to differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rambhatla et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sherley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Simons and Clevers, 2011</xref>). Asymmetry in cell fate outcomes in stem cell lineages is known to happen in several ways. Asymmetry can be largely intrinsic, driven by the asymmetric distribution of RNA and proteins that drive different fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bossing et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doe, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doe and Bowerman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bayraktar et al., 2010</xref>). For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, the cell fate determinant Prospero is physically segregated into the daughter cell of a neuroblast division, where it drives differentiation and suppresses stem cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doe et al., 1991</xref>). In contrast, the size of the stem cell population can be controlled almost entirely by extrinsic means, such as in the mammalian intestinal crypt where paneth cells use WNT/Lgr5 signaling to maintain stem cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Snippert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sato et al., 2011</xref>). As the paneth cell niche expands in colon cancer, so too does the stem cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Lau et al., 2007</xref>). Other stem cell types can use a combination of mechanisms, such as in the mammalian postnatal cortex of the brain where Hedgehog signaling maintains stem cell identity, and asymmetric segregation of RNA-binding protein complexes and cellular processes determines cell fate choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Machold et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller and Gauthier-Fisher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vessey et al., 2012</xref>). For both regenerative medicine and cancer biology, elucidating how non-stem cell fates are specified is a fundamental aspect of understanding the mechanisms of stem cell lineage development.</p><p>The freshwater planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> (a Lophotrochozoan flatworm) is quickly becoming a powerful model system to study gene function, regeneration, and ASC biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Salo and Baguna, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sánchez Alvarado, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cebria, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gurley and Sánchez Alvarado, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rossi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboobaker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gentile et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baguna, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elliott and Sánchez Alvarado, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rink, 2013</xref>). Asexual planarians are constitutive adult animals and their well-known regenerative abilities are dependent on neoblasts, which possess stem cell activity and express the <italic>piwi</italic> homolog <italic>smedwi-1</italic> (<italic>piwi-1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sánchez Alvarado and Kang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reddien et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Neoblasts are broadly distributed throughout the mesenchyme where they constitute approximately 20–30% of all the cells in the animal, and serve to replenish all the differentiated cell types during normal tissue turnover and regeneration after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krichinskaya and Martynova, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). At steady state, the population of neoblasts is relatively constant in number despite high levels of tissue turnover, indicating that proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation are finely balanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellettieri and Sánchez Alvarado, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pellettieri et al., 2010</xref>). Currently, how neoblasts make the choice to adopt non-stem cell fates remains largely unknown; physical asymmetric segregation of cell fate components has not been demonstrated, and descriptions of any permissive niche-like signal remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reddien, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rink, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although all planarian stem cells are <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup>, not all <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are necessarily stem cells. Evidence increasingly shows commitment to particular lineages can occur at the <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> level as small numbers of these cells also express tissue-specific genes, though it remains unknown whether these cells are self-renewing or will directly differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lapan and Reddien, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Currie and Pearson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, recently neoblasts were divided into three major subclasses (sigma, zeta, gamma) based on transcriptional analyses, one of which generates non-dividing progenitors/progeny for the epithelium (zeta) and another postulated to be an intestinal-restricted subclass (gamma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). As neoblasts are the only mitotic cell type in planarians, they can be selectively ablated by irradiation, and over time, the immediate progeny of neoblasts eventually disappear as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reddien et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>). Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of irradiated animals stained with Hoechst, two cell populations can be discerned that are lost compared to non-irradiated animals: the ‘X1’ gate, which represents cells in the cell cycle with &gt;2C DNA; and the ‘X2’ gate, which registers as a &lt;2C DNA population due to Hoechst efflux. The remaining irradiation-insensitive (Xins) cells are assumed to be postmitotic differentiated cell types possessing 2C DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reddien et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayashi et al., 2006</xref>). Studies have shown that the X1 population is &gt;90% <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>, and this gate has been used as the stem cell fraction in comparative transcriptomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reddien et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abril et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sandmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Labbe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Onal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Resch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solana et al., 2012</xref>). The X2 cell population is only 10–20% <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> and is thought to be enriched with immediate postmitotic progeny of neoblasts. This notion is supported by the finding that the five known markers of postmitotic progeny (<italic>prog-1</italic>, <italic>prog-2</italic>, and <italic>AGAT-1/2/3</italic>), predicted to label epithelial progenitors, are most highly expressed in the X2 cell fraction based on RNA-deep sequencing (RNAseq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Labbe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Onal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, other markers that associate with putative committed progenitor cells of the gut, brain, and eyes are also enriched in this cell fraction (<italic>hnf4</italic>, <italic>chat</italic>, and <italic>sp6-9</italic>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lapan and Reddien, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>). No study has comprehensively investigated the cells and transcripts specific to the X2 cell fraction, and the cell types within it remain an enigma.</p><p>Here, we hypothesized that regulators that drive stem cells toward postmitotic fates will be highly enriched in the stem cell progeny-associated X2 FACS fraction. Thus, we selected the top 100 transcripts enriched in this FACS gate, as well as 20 that were irradiation-sensitive with no X1 or X2 enrichment, to explore as putative markers or regulators. We found that while X2-enriched genes represented a heterogeneous mixture of cell types, transcripts expressed in epithelial progenitors comprised the predominant gene signature in the X2 fraction. We identified 32 new progeny markers and demonstrated that they are expressed predominantly in either <italic>prog-1/2</italic><sup>+</sup> or <italic>AGAT-1</italic><sup>+</sup> epithelial progenitors. In addition, <italic>prog-1</italic> and <italic>prog-2</italic> represent members of a larger gene family of unknown function, expressed throughout this epithelial lineage. Through RNA interference (RNAi) screening of the 120 candidate transcripts, we identified a homolog to the RNA-binding protein MEX3 (<italic>Smed-mex3-1</italic>) as a critical regulator of postmitotic stem cell progeny. Knockdown of <italic>mex3-1</italic> completely abolishes regenerative ability and halts the production of <italic>prog-1/2</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>AGAT-1</italic><sup>+</sup> postmitotic progeny populations. <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> stem cells concomitantly increase in number, an increase that was observed in all three neoblast subclasses. Finally, <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> worms have impaired contribution to tissue turnover, as evidenced by drastically reduced production of lineage-restricted neoblast descendants and diminished cell addition towards multiple tissue types, in addition to the epithelium. These results suggest that <italic>mex3-1</italic> functions to maintain asymmetry in stem cell lineage progression by promoting postmitotic fates and suppressing self-renewal. Due to the well-known function of MEX3 in mediating asymmetric cell fates during <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Draper et al., 1996</xref>), we propose that <italic>Smed-mex3-1</italic> mediates a similar process in planarian stem cell lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNAseq analysis of the progeny-associated X2 FACS cell fraction</title><p>Previously, we published two replicates of Illumina RNAseq of the X2 cell fraction to a depth of 206 million reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Labbe et al., 2012</xref>).

We found a very high correlation across all of our sequencing replicates, as well as with two irradiated samples from a previous study, which we subsequently analyzed along with our irradiated sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Onal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Resch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solana et al., 2012</xref>).

This identified 2839 X1 and 1512 X2 transcripts with a p-value ≤ 0.01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). It is important to note that X1 and X2 cells shared the majority of their transcriptional profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and <italic>bona fide</italic> progeny markers can be highly expressed in the X1 fraction, while <italic>bona fide</italic> stem cell markers can be highly expressed in the X2 fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Therefore, to be considered X2-enriched, we imposed the additional criterion that the expression ratio of X2/X1 was &gt;1, to exclude transcripts jointly expressed in both irradiation-sensitive populations. This eliminated previously known stem cell genes, such as <italic>piwi-1</italic> and <italic>-2</italic>, <italic>PCNA</italic> (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), and <italic>cyclinB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; 8th, 45th, 57th, and 80th highest enriched X2 genes, respectively), and reduced the total number of enriched X2 genes to 735 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orii et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reddien et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>).

Combined with evidence from BrdU-labeling studies, the early and late progeny populations have been proposed to reflect a spatiotemporal progression along one lineage of ASC differentiation destined for the epithelium, such that <italic>prog-1/2</italic> expression represents the transition state between neoblasts (potentially zeta-neoblasts) and <italic>AGAT-1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>).

However, these results could similarly arise from defective maintenance and survival of progeny, thus, we examined levels of apoptosis with TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) during phenotypic progression. Quantification of TUNEL showed that <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> animals had comparable levels of cell death to control worms up until 9 days after RNAi, but significantly higher levels from 12 days and onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Given that progeny gene expression was mostly ablated by 6 days after RNAi, we concluded that the loss of progeny populations was not attributed to progeny cell death. The cause of the late rise in cell death remains unclear but is coincident with when morphological homeostatic phenotypes begin to manifest and may be a secondary effect of declining animal health. We next investigated whether impaired stem cell proliferation was the underlying cause of reduced progeny production and performed time-course analysis of phosphorylated histone H3 immunolabeling (H3P). We observed significantly increased levels of proliferation in <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> worms at every time point examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which suggested that stem cell division was not impeded by <italic>mex3-1</italic> knockdown.</p><p>To exclude the possibility that the heightened H3P<sup>+</sup> levels in <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> worms reflected an accumulation of cells arrested in G2/M phase and an inability to complete the cell cycle, we performed labeling with the thymidine analog F-<italic>ara</italic>-EdU to measure S-phase progression.

Relatively little was known about the X2 FACS cell fraction, with the exception that it expresses a disproportionate number of transcription factors and shares most of its gene signature with the X1 fraction, and the few known stem cell progeny markers are most highly expressed in this fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Labbe et al., 2012</xref>). We reasoned here that investigating more genes specific to the X2 fraction could yield many markers and regulators for other tissue-specific progeny types. We found that transcripts enriched in the progeny-associated X2 FACS gate were expressed in a variety of cell types and not necessarily in stem cell progeny. Although transcripts with unique tissue-specific and non-stem cell expression patterns were uncovered and appeared to be potential candidates for novel progenitor types, it is now clear that the epithelial lineage has the strongest bias in terms of sequencing numbers. In total, we describe 32 new markers for early and late epithelial progenitors. Combined with the revelation that zeta-neoblasts are the largest known lineage-restricted stem cell subclass in planarians, we conclude that epithelial progenitors are the predominant output of stem cells, most likely reflecting highest turnover needs as well as molecular complexity of this organ.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>mex3-1</italic> as a candidate mediator of asymmetric cell fate in planarians</title><p>Through RNAi screening of the 120 candidate progeny transcripts, we identified <italic>mex3-1</italic> as a critical factor in cell fate decision-making. <italic>mex3-1</italic> was required not only for all epithelial progenitor fates but also all other tested lineage-restricted stem cell progeny, and to restrict the expansion of the stem cell compartment. MEX3 is an RNA-binding translational repressor discovered in <italic>C. elegans</italic> with embryonic and post-embryonic developmental roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Draper et al., 1996</xref>). MEX3 is a fundamental regulator of asymmetry, mediating one of the earliest steps of cell fate determination in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by restricting expression of the cell fate determinant <italic>pal-1</italic> transcription factor to the posterior blastomere of the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Draper et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2002</xref>). In adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>, MEX3 participates in the maintenance of germline stem cells (GSCs) by promoting proliferation, and interestingly, is not required for GSCs to differentiate and undergo meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ariz et al., 2009</xref>). Four <italic>mex3</italic> homologs (<italic>MexA-D</italic>) are present in vertebrates, which remain poorly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchet-Poyau et al., 2007</xref>). Recent work on MEX3A in murine intestinal cell culture showed that the master intestinal differentiation factor <italic>Cdx2</italic>, one of the vertebrate homologs of <italic>pal-1</italic>, is a target of MEX3A translational inhibition, and furthermore, MEX3A overexpression increased levels of intestinal stem cell markers such as <italic>Bmi1</italic> and <italic>Lgr5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pereira et al., 2013</xref>). Though the role of MEX3A in intestinal stem cell fate in vivo remains to be fully explored, these findings combined with our results in planarians suggest a conserved ancestral function for <italic>mex3</italic> genes in cell fate choice.</p><p>The precise mechanisms by which <italic>mex3-1</italic> exerts its effects in planarians are unresolved. Although both <italic>zfp-1</italic> and <italic>mex3-1</italic> are required for specification of epithelial-fated progeny, unlike <italic>zfp-1(RNAi)</italic> worms, <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> worms completely lose the ability to form any regenerative blastema. <italic>mex3-1</italic> was further needed to prevent the expansion of the stem cell compartment, including sigma-, gamma-, and zeta-class neoblasts, which suggests that <italic>mex3-1</italic> acts to mediate stem cell lineage asymmetry in the general stem cell pool and regulate all postmitotic lineages. As both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and vertebrate MEX3 proteins have been shown to be translational repressors, it is likely that this molecular function has been conserved in planarians. Thus, we propose a model of stem cell lineage progression with <italic>mex3-1</italic> acting as a repressor of stem cell identity and self-renewal genes in postmitotic progenitors to promote differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>During early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryogenesis, the asymmetric distribution of both <italic>mex3</italic> mRNA and protein underlies the asymmetric expression of <italic>pal-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Draper et al., 1996</xref>). While <italic>Smed-mex3-1</italic> mRNA shows no such asymmetry at the current resolution of our tools in planarians, it is possible that asymmetric distribution or activation of MEX3-1 leads to the execution of its function in progeny only. An example of such a mechanism is Prospero in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, where it is transcribed and translated in stem cells and daughter cells, but is segregated to and functions in progeny in a classic example of intrinsic asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doe et al., 1991</xref>). Alternatively, MEX3-1 may have multiple cell type-specific roles and cell type-specific mRNA targets. No planarian homolog to the conserved MEX3 target <italic>Cdx2</italic>/<italic>pal-1</italic> could be found in existing transcriptomes or genomic sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sánchez Alvarado et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robb et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abril et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sandmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Labbe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Onal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Resch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernandes et al., 2014</xref>).

At this juncture, isolating these populations from irradiation-insensitive cells is not achievable as there are no clear boundaries on where these cells would lie in FACS plots. Numerous transcripts, down-regulated after <italic>mex3-1</italic> RNAi, were observed to belong to this WT<sup>high</sup>X<sup>low</sup> category with little expression in the X1 or X2 fractions. The identification of one of these transcripts as a pharyngeal marker with expression in PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells demonstrates that lineage-restricted progeny are present outside the X1 and X2 gates and merits the investment of future efforts toward screening further WT<sup>high</sup>X<sup>low</sup> genes that are regulated by <italic>mex3-1</italic> in order to uncover novel progenitors. This knowledge is necessary in order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the asymmetries specific to ASC lineage organization.

TUNEL was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellettieri and Sánchez Alvarado, 2007</xref>). Mouse anti-PIWI-1 (gift of Dr Jochen Rink [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>]) was used at 1:1000. H3ser10p and TUNEL were quantified using freely available ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Significance was determined by a 2-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test unless otherwise noted. All experiments were, at minimum, performed in triplicate with at least 10 worms per stain and per time point (i.e., n &gt; 30). For irradiation experiments, planarians were exposed to 16.5 or 60 Gy of γ-irradiation from a <sup>137</sup>Cs source. F-<italic>ara</italic>-EdU was fed to worms in liver paste at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml for a 7-day chase (fed at 1fd6) or 0.5 mg/ml for a 24-hr chase (fed at 1fd6 and 1fd9) and stained as previously described following the normal fixation for ISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pearson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neef and Luedtke, 2011</xref>). BrdU was fed (at 1fd6) in liver paste at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and stained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Confocal images were acquired on a Leica DMIRE2 inverted fluorescence microscope with a Hamamatsu Back-Thinned EM-CCD camera and spinning disc confocal scan head, and stitched together for whole-animal images. Images were post-processed in Adobe Photoshop and figures assembled in Macromedia Freehand.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs George Eisenhoffer, Jason Pellettieri, Ricardo Zayas, and Ian Scott for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), Marianne Bronner (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors transcriptionally profiled a population of irradiation-sensitive G1/G0 cells in planarians (from the “X2” FACS gate) that is a mixture of cycling and immediately post-mitotic cells. Analysis of genes enriched in this population identified 32 new markers of postmitotic neoblast progeny differentiating into epidermal fates. Additionally, through RNAi screening of these genes, <italic>mex3-1</italic> was identified as essential for differentiation into multiple planarian cell lineages (eye, neuronal lineages, and epithelium). <italic>Mex3-1</italic> inhibition decreased numbers of post-mitotic progenitors cells and concomitantly increased numbers of proliferating neoblasts, including three lineages specified within that population, causing failure of regeneration and tissue homeostasis. RNA-seq from <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> animals confirmed that <italic>mex3-1</italic> is a master regulator of genes expressed in post-mitotic neoblast progeny and also identified novel markers of differentiating cells in planarians. MEX3 proteins can repress translation to influence differentiation and asymmetric cell division. Still few molecules have been identified that control differentiation and cell cycle exit in planarians, and the identification of <italic>mex3-1</italic> in particular suggests the essentiality of asymmetric cell division in forming progenitor populations.</p><p>Although symmetric and asymmetric divisions have been predicted in this organism, this study provides the first molecular link to those processes in planarians. However, there are significant points that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors need to clarify the role of <italic>mex3</italic> in cell cycle exit by determining the ratio of <italic>piwi</italic>(mRNA)+<italic>piwi</italic>(protein)+ vs. <italic>piwi</italic>(mRNA)-<italic>piwi</italic>(protein)+ cells after <italic>mex3</italic> RNAi.</p><p>2) They should address how <italic>mex3(RNAi)</italic> is distinct from RNAi of other factors required for neoblast differentiation (i.e. <italic>p53</italic>). In particular, does loss of <italic>mex3</italic> result in eventual loss of the neoblasts like <italic>p53</italic>? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> there is a ∼3 fold drop in pH3+ cells between days 12 and 15. Is this due to depletion of the neoblast pool, similar to what happens with <italic>p53</italic>? What about at day 18? The authors should also assess <italic>p53</italic> requirement in gut/neural progenitors to determine if <italic>mex3</italic> is broader in its role.</p><p>3) The authors need to provide further quantification of the neoblast results. The model that <italic>mex3</italic> is promoting the differentiation/renewal balance is influenced from their data on neoblast numbers, but at present, the data are not sufficient to strongly make the case. The EdU quantification indicated that there are more S-phase cells in <italic>mex-3</italic> RNAi animals, but this is a technically limited experiment because of patchy labeling. Where the counting was done in even an individual animal would yield very different results. Furthermore, the FACs quantification of cells greater than 2C (X1s) shows no clear difference or perhaps less in <italic>mex3</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref>), and no increase in expansion of neoblasts, compared to the control, in the sublethal irradiation experiment is apparent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> provides the strongest support, but no numbers are given, and it would be stronger with quantification from many animals and at multiple AP planes.</p><p>4) Along the same lines, using the PIWI antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figure 5D/6C</xref>) labels neoblasts and their descendants. Therefore, technically, stem cell subclasses are not shown. PIWI+ <italic>hnf4</italic>+ cells increase following <italic>mex3</italic> RNAi, whereas <italic>ovo+</italic> or <italic>coe+</italic> PIWI+ cells decrease. How do these opposing results fit with the model? The authors should attempt to resolve quantitative impacts of <italic>mex3</italic> RNAi on neoblast subclasses versus their non-dividing descendants using marker/<italic>piwi</italic>/PIWI labelings.</p><p>5) Figures/data:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>: It is unclear whether the correlations were done on raw values or log-transformed values; if not log-transformed analyses, it should be plotted and analyzed this way to prevent overestimation of the correlation. Range/units on X and Y axes should be present. Graphs are overplotted, and might be better represented with 2D density plots. Red line is unclear; representing “a Pearson correlation coefficient of 1” is unclear. The correlation P values are unnecessary. RPM should be changed to CPM.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Y axis states “over Xins” when the comparison is to whole worms and Xins has been used to refer to a FACs gate in the literature.</p><p>In the first paragraph of the subsection headed “RNAseq analysis of the progeny-associated X2 FACS cell fraction”: “stem cell markers can be highly expressed in the X2 fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>)” – this is not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 A/B</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure1C</xref>: The colors are saturated, and it seems the range shown does not capture the range of the data. If they are setting a maximum/minimum for the graph that is below the range of the data this should be stated in the legend, or the shown range changed.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A/B</xref>: The “Lowess” curve (Loess fit?) is not needed, and the authors are encouraged to remove it.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A/B</xref>: “new progeny markers” is an awkward Figure label for these genes.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> legend: the description is poor – it is a heatmap, Z score range, etc.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref> is hard to read; trimming the end/uninformative part(s) would help focus on the region with similarity. Shown is not a “MUSCLE alignment” but a multiple sequence alignment done with MUSCLE. There is more than one shade of blue, which either represent similar or identical aa. The three rows of information below the alignment should be better described. Why not show all 24 in the alignment?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, genes are divided into early and late, but a given late marker in principle could also have been present in early cells. This might be worth noting in the text.</p><p>In the first paragraph of the subsection headed “New progeny markers label either early or late progeny of the epithelial lineage” the authors find that 5.4% of <italic>prog-1</italic> cells expressed low levels of AGAT-1, and Eisenhoffer 2008 reported 44%. They refer to these populations as “two mainly non-overlapping”, which needs some clarification.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>Part A might be better as time following initiation of RNAi.</p><p>Part E: what happens at longer time points post RNAi? How much expression is not irradiation sensitive?</p><p><italic>mex3</italic> orthology: The tree lacks an outgroup(s) with a similar RNA-binding domain to that present in this protein family. Therefore, without outgroups, any non-<italic>mex3</italic> family protein would give the same result as planarian MEX3 as presented in the tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>C: there is a clear TUNEL effect, without clear explanation. It might be worth simply noting in the text that the explanation for this late rise in TUNEL+ cell number is unclear.</p><p>C/D: Where counts were performed should be stated.</p><p>The X2s by FACs don't seem to be decreased following mex RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>), and yet there is a strong impact on <italic>prog</italic>-like+ cells by in situ. Is there an explanation? For example, is the fraction of X2s that are neoblasts (<italic>piwi+</italic>) increasing?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>B: This is a nice result clearly showing neoblast increases can occur in <italic>mex3</italic> RNAi animals. The images are dark and hard to see in the present figure file.</p><p>D: Using the PIWI antibody labels neoblasts and their descendants. Therefore, technically stem cell subclasses are not shown. I recommend having a simple cell count plot instead of showing ratios. The high variance of the data in the <italic>hnf4</italic> and <italic>zfp1</italic> counts, suggest the the <italic>p</italic>-value is a bit surprising, although without seeing the counts, that is hard to evaluate.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>A: There wasn't really a “chase”, it was a pulse + 7 days. The wording could be modified.</p><p>C: See comments on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. The PIWI ab here is less of a concern, if the wording is clear that these are neoblasts and/or descendants involved in tissue turnover. The ratio comment applies here as well. Number of animals counted should be noted.</p><p>Is <italic>mex-3</italic> expressed in the any/all of these three sets of cells?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>B: Are these indeed a similar class of cells studied in prior parts of the paper? (Several double-FISH tests would quickly confirm this). How do these look in the WT-high X-low data?</p><p>C: numbers, rather than ratios would give reader a better understanding of how many cells were present/ counted. What fraction of these are PIWI+?</p><p>What is the expression of the candidate pharynx progenitor marker in irradiated worms?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “A <italic>mex3</italic> homolog is required for differentiation during planarian stem cell lineage development” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Reply to point #2: “We have included data demonstrating that <italic>mex3-1</italic> is also expressed in <italic>chat</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–Figure supplement 1</xref>)” – this was done with PIWI1 antibody and therefore these cells are not necessarily progenitors; they could be newly differentiated cells. “<italic>p53</italic> knockdown does not significantly reduce <italic>ovo</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> and <italic>chat</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> progenitors” – again, it was done with a PIWI1 antibody, and therefore those are not necessarily progenitors.</p><p>The wording should be addressed accordingly (or <italic>smedwi</italic> mRNA could be used).</p><p>Related to this, in the reply to major point 4: Would the authors’ argument about <italic>hnf4</italic> predict that <italic>smedwi</italic> (mRNA)+ <italic>coe</italic>+ cell would go up in frequency? This could in principle be tested to further support the proposed model.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>. Again, in this reviewer's view plots should be log transformed and correlation done on log-transformed values.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. The response did not satisfactorily address the review comment. The legend states the z-score range shown, but if the data is not showing the actual z-score values, why not state what the actual range of the z-scores was in the data in the legend such that it is clear that some values were much lower/higher than the cutoffs on the range shown?</p><p>4) MEX-3 orthology: The authors clarified their goal for the MEX3 phylogeny, which makes this tree of limited value; however, the answer leaves the evidence for MEX-3 orthology poorly described in the manuscript. Perhaps the authors can more explicitly describe in the methods the evidence that this is a MEX-3 ortholog (e.g., phylogenetics, unique domain architecture specific to this family, or lack of any other proteins with similarity near that present with the MEX-3 family in reciprocal genome searches).</p><p>[Editors' note: final revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “A <italic>mex3</italic> homolog is required for differentiation during planarian stem cell lineage development” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and one of the original reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are still some differences in interpretation that we would ask you to address.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Below is a discussion on comments regarding SMEDWI<sup>+</sup> cells and the term “progenitor”.</p><p>1) Original Review: “We have included data demonstrating that <italic>mex3-1</italic> is also expressed in <italic>chat</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–Figure supplement 1</xref>)”. This was done with PIWI1 antibody and therefore these cells are not necessarily progenitors; they could be newly differentiated cells.</p><p>Author Comment: “We believe this is confusion in terminology. By ‘progenitors’ we do not mean an equivalent of dividing progenitors or transit amplifying cells from other systems, but instead imply a committed cell that has not yet fully differentiated and physically integrated into the terminal tissue…”</p><p>Reviewer Reply: Dividing or being transit amplifying is not the point of confusion. It is simple: a SMEDWI<sup>+</sup> cell could be differentiated. SMEDWI<sup>+</sup> cells can be fully integrated into tissues and express differentiated markers. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagner et al. 2011</xref>: “SMEDWI-1<sup>+</sup> descendant cells expressed a choline acetyl-transferase ortholog, Smed-chat (Figure supplement 6); <italic>chat</italic> expression is widely conserved in cholinergic neurons (34). SMEDWI-1+; <italic>chat</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells were enriched in brain regions and had neuronal morphology, and <italic>chat</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells co-expressed additional neuronal markers (Figure supplement 6), indicating that SMEDWI-1<sup>+</sup>; <italic>chat</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells are differentiating neurons”.</p><p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scimone et al. 2011</xref>: SMEDWI<sup>+</sup> cells can also be seen to co-express protonephridial differentiated cell markers (carbonic anhydrase and cubulin).</p><p>2) Author Comment: “To try to minimize this confusion, we named most of our newly discovered transcripts in the ‘postmitotic progeny’ series. In this current revision, we have also tried to minimize the use of the word progenitor. So to directly address this comment: ‘progenitors’, ‘stem cell progeny’, and ‘newly differentiating cells’ are equivalent”.</p><p>Reviewer Reply: “newly differentiated cells” is what was written, but “newly differentiating” and “newly differentiated” are hard to really to distinguish regardless. The point is that calling something a neural progenitor, when it might be a cell with axons and differentiating or differentiated seems inaccurate.</p><p>3) Author Comment: “Because PIWI-1 labels stem cells and immediate post-mitotic descendants, we consider ‘progenitors’ to be cells that are PIWI-1+[tissue-specific marker]+, to mark cells in the early stages of commitment”.</p><p>Reviewer Reply: In this reviewer’s view, this cannot be concluded (see above). According to available data, it is not possible to exclude, without additional data for a given tissue/cell type, the possible interpretation that any given SMEDWI<sup>+</sup> cell is a differentiated cell.</p><p>4) Author Comment: “As no permanent lineage tracing can yet be done in our system, it is impossible to know the terminal fates of individual cells and whether these <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> progenitors self-renew. We have attempted to clarify this in the text, and this rebuttal document will also help readers”.</p><p>Reviewer Reply: The request was simply to be clear with wording in the instances when PIWI antibody is used only. There is strong evidence that these PIWI+ cells are neoblast descendants, either undifferentiated or newly differentiated. It can be useful as a tool used in this way; the authors should just be clear with wording, describing these cells as neoblast descendants rather than progenitors. Or, one could choose to be more explicit than “neoblast descendant” and state: neoblast, undifferentiated neoblast descendants, or newly differentiated/ing neoblast descendants. Or, if “progenitor” was really desired, something along the lines of “neoblast descendants, including undifferentiated progenitors and possibly newly differentiated cells”.</p><p>5) Original Review: “<italic>p53</italic> knockdown does not significantly reduce <italic>ovo</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> and <italic>chat</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> progenitors” – again, it was done with a PIWI1 antibody, and therefore those are not necessarily progenitors. The wording should be addressed accordingly (or <italic>smedwi</italic> mRNA could be used).</p><p>Author Comment: “We have clarified in the text our use of the term ‘progenitor’. We use the same progenitor term used in Lapan and Reddien (Plos Genetics 2011) and Lapan and Reddien (Cell Reports 2012) describing the <italic>sp6-9</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> and <italic>ovo</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells as eye progenitors, respectively. A similar terminology was used in the <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler, et al., 2014</xref> regarding <italic>FoxA</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> progenitors. Text changes can be found in the third paragraph of the Introduction and in the subsection headed ‘<italic>mex3-1</italic> is required for turnover of multiple tissues’.”</p><p>Reviewer Reply: In the case of the eye, cells outside of the eye (an epithelial optic cup and a neural ganglion) could be visualized and described as progenitors. A SMEDWI<sup>+</sup> neuron in the eye would not considered a progenitor, but an eye cell – a similar such cell would be harder to identify in a less discrete tissue/cell population.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07025.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors need to clarify the role of</italic> mex3 <italic>in cell cycle exit by determining the ratio of</italic> piwi<italic>(mRNA)+</italic>piwi<italic>(protein)+ vs.</italic> piwi<italic>(mRNA)-</italic>piwi<italic>(protein)+ cells after</italic> mex3 <italic>RNAi</italic>.</p><p>This is a good experiment and we now provide these data and show that the ratio of <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup>PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells to <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>-</sup>PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells increases significantly after <italic>mex3-1</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Second, it has been shown that about 10-20% of sorted X1’s could not be labeled for <italic>piwi-1</italic> RNA in previous publications (Reddien, 2005, and Eisenhoffer, 2008), which may skew results if those unlabeled dividing cells were still PIWI-1+.</p><p><italic>2) They should address how</italic> mex3(RNAi) <italic>is distinct from RNAi of other factors required for neoblast differentiation (i.e.</italic> p53<italic>). In particular, does loss of</italic> mex3 <italic>result in eventual loss of the neoblasts like</italic> p53<italic>? In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6D</italic></xref> <italic>there is a ∼3 fold drop in pH3+ cells between days 12 and 15. Is this due to depletion of the neoblast pool, similar to what happens with</italic> p53<italic>? What about at day 18? The authors should also assess</italic> p53 <italic>requirement in gut/neural progenitors to determine if</italic> mex3 <italic>is broader in its role</italic>.</p><p>These are good points. We believe the <italic>mex3-1</italic> RNAi phenotype is very different from that of <italic>p53</italic>. We never see loss of stem cells in the <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> animals as is seen after <italic>p53</italic> knockdown. We have added in additional lineage stains at a longer time point (day 20), as well as stains of animals with a greater number of RNAi feedings (3 feeds) to demonstrate the persistence of stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). With regards to the drop in H3P from day 12 to 15, we believe this is partly attributable to the single-feed effects of <italic>mex3-1</italic> RNAi actually wearing off. As seen at the day 20 lineage stains, epithelial post-mitotic progeny begin to reappear. As this rebalance of making progeny is restored (perhaps asymmetry restored to the lineage), H3P levels are seen to return close normal. Again, this is not due to a loss of stem cells as it is in <italic>p53(RNAi)</italic>, where the H3P levels go to zero. We attribute the fact that 100% of the animals still die to the fact that progeny have been absent for too long for the animal to recover. We have also included additional time points of H3P immunostaining (days 18 and 21), demonstrating that while <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> H3P levels are declining, they are still significantly increased compared to controls.</p><p>Our data also demonstrate that <italic>mex3-1</italic> has a broader role than <italic>p53</italic> in differentiation. <italic>mex3-1</italic> mRNA is present in all <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>prog-1</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>AGAT-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, whereas the majority of <italic>p53</italic> expression is restricted to <italic>prog-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells. We have included data demonstrating that <italic>mex3-1</italic> is also expressed in <italic>chat</italic><sup>+</sup> neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>), and is not restricted to epithelial progenitors. We have also included additional data demonstrating that <italic>p53</italic> knockdown does not significantly reduce <italic>ovo</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>chat</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The authors need to provide further quantification of the neoblast results. The model that</italic> mex3 <italic>is promoting the differentiation/renewal balance is influenced from their data on neoblast numbers, but at present, the data are not sufficient to strongly make the case. The EdU quantification indicated that there are more S-phase cells in</italic> mex-3 <italic>RNAi animals, but this is a technically limited experiment because of patchy labeling. Where the counting was done in even an individual animal would yield very different results. Furthermore, the FACs quantification of cells greater than 2C (X1s) shows no clear difference or perhaps less in</italic> mex3 <italic>RNAi (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</italic></xref><italic>), and no increase in expansion of neoblasts, compared to the control, in the sublethal irradiation experiment is apparent.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref> <italic>provides the strongest support, but no numbers are given, and it would be stronger with quantification from many animals and at multiple AP planes</italic>.</p><p>We have provided additional quantification of neoblast numbers which we believe further support our model. We performed quantification of <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in matched locations for the head, neck, and tail of animals (counting dorsal to ventral, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), as well as quantification at two more AP planes (in the middle of the pharynx, and in the tail, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>), all which show that <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are significantly increased after <italic>mex3-1</italic> RNAi. All graphs now show cell counts normalized to surface area, instead of being expressed as a ratio to controls.</p><p>With regards to the EdU quantification, our EdU labeling is fairly homogenous and similar between animals, but the protocol does result in non-homogenous background staining that is more noticeable in a single confocal plane with low magnification. We have replaced the whole-worm EdU images with new pictures containing less background. Concerning the sublethal irradiation experiment, it should be noted that <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> animals are more susceptible to irradiation than controls, and also die sooner than non-irradiated <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> animals (and not long after the day 9 post-irradiation time point). This overall decline in health may limit the ability of stem cells to expand. We do not believe that FACS-gate quantification is consistent enough to say much more than the cells are present at relatively normal levels.</p><p><italic>4) Along the same lines, using the PIWI antibody (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6"><italic>Figure 5D/6C</italic></xref><italic>) labels neoblasts and their descendants. Therefore, technically, stem cell subclasses are not shown. PIWI+</italic> hnf4<italic>+ cells increase following</italic> mex3 <italic>RNAi, whereas</italic> ovo+ <italic>or</italic> coe+ <italic>PIWI+ cells decrease. How do these opposing results fit with the model? The authors should attempt to resolve quantitative impacts of mex3 RNAi on neoblast subclasses versus their non-dividing descendants using marker/</italic>piwi<italic>/PIWI labelings</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the point that the PIWI-1 antibody also labels immediate neoblast descendants, and have repeated neoblast subclass quantification with <italic>piwi-1</italic> labeling instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Our new quantification similarly shows that the three subclasses measured all significantly increase after <italic>mex3-1</italic> knockdown. Combined with our new data examining the ratios of <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup>PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells to <italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>-</sup>PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> animals, our results show an overall increase in neoblasts and decrease in non-dividing descendants. <italic>hnf4</italic> was recently found to be part of an expression signature of a third subclass of neoblast (gamma subclass), and was postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref> to be a gut-restricted stem cell type, not a postmitotic progenitor type. (In either case, this specific cell type has not been thoroughly investigated.) We believe the increase of <italic>hnf4</italic><sup>+</sup>PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> in <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> animals is due to the increase in <italic>hnf4</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> gamma neoblasts, which we have now shown. To address the impact of <italic>mex3-1</italic> RNAi on gut differentiation, we have included a BrdU labeling experiment looking at entry of new cells into the gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and show that it is decreased.</p><p><italic>5) Figures/data</italic>:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>: It is unclear whether the correlations were done on raw values or log-transformed values; if not log-transformed analyses, it should be plotted and analyzed this way to prevent overestimation of the correlation.

Therefore, we are not trying to determine whether they are actually <italic>mex3</italic>-family genes, which is when outgroups are most helpful. We are only interested about the potential orthology. By selecting an outgroup, you are telling the analysis program that you know something about the ancestral sequence of the gene family in the tree, which we do not. Unrooted trees take an unbiased approach of detecting the relationships between the tips of the branches. The only question we were asking in our phylogeny is whether there is direct orthology in the multiple vertebrate sequences with the multiple planarian sequences. The ancestral condition is clearly a single <italic>mex3</italic> gene in invertebrates, so already by parsimony it would be unlikely that the orthology of a given planarian gene would be orthologous to an individual vertebrate gene, but it was a formal possibility to test with this analysis.

We do not believe these cells can be considered fully differentiated, due to their expression of the stem cell marker PIWI-1, being irradiation-sensitive, and not being stable in their gene expression as you would expect of a truly differentiated cell. (Fully mature neurons do not express PIWI-1 and are not irradiation-sensitive like this population. Guo et al<italic>.</italic> (2006) demonstrated that all PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells are ablated 3 days after irradiation.). We also added a sentence about PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells being of unknown stage of differentiation (“It is unknown how differentiated these <italic>piwi-1-</italic> PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells are, but they are clearly in a transition from a stem cell gene expression state to various 12 postmitotic fates”).</p><p>Furthermore, it cannot be concluded from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagner et al.

Even the authors of that paper refer to these cells as “differentiating”, not “differentiated”. Similarly, in Scimone et al<italic>.</italic> (2011), SMEDWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells which co-express both a transcription factor (such as six1/2-2) and a differentiated marker (such as CA or cubulin) were referred to as “cells in intermediate stages between precursors and differentiated cells”.</p><p>It is inconsistent that this reviewer will allow analogous cells for other tissues <italic>FoxA</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells, <italic>ovo</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells, and <italic>epithelial-progeny-marker</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells being called progenitors, whereas the seemingly equivalent cells in the brain or protonephridia require a different terminology.</p></body></sub-article></article>
