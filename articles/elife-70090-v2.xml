(RPo). Despite extensive study, the mechanism of promoter unwinding has remained unclear, in part due to the transient nature of intermediates on path to RPo. Here, using single-molecule unwinding-induced fluorescence enhancement to monitor promoter unwinding, and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor RNAP clamp conformation, we analyse RPo formation at a consensus bacterial core promoter. We find that the RNAP clamp is closed during promoter binding, remains closed during promoter unwinding, and then closes further, locking the unwound DNA in the RNAP active-centre cleft. Our work defines a new, ‘bind-unwind-load-and-lock’, model for the series of conformational changes occurring during promoter unwinding at a consensus bacterial promoter and provides the tools needed to examine the process in other organisms and at other promoters.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>smFRET</kwd><kwd>transcription initiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110164/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapanidis</surname><given-names>Achillefs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM041376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ebright</surname><given-names>Richard H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-molecule fluorescence experiments reveal transcription initiation proceeds via a 'bind-unwind-load-and-lock' mechanism where promoter DNA unwinds outside the RNA polymerase (RNAP) cleft, the unwound template-DNA loads into the cleft, and RNAP 'locks' the template-DNA by closing the RNAP clamp module.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription initiation is the first and most highly regulated step in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mazumder and Kapanidis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruff et al., 2015</xref>). During transcription initiation, RNA polymerase (RNAP), together with the transcription initiation factor σ, unwinds ~13 bp of promoter DNA to form a ‘transcription bubble’, and places the template-strand ssDNA of the unwound transcription bubble in contact with the RNAP active centre, yielding a catalytically competent RNAP-promoter transcription-initiation complex (RPo; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mazumder and Kapanidis, 2019</xref>). High-resolution structures of RPo define the contacts that RNAP and σ make with promoter DNA, as well as the conformation and interactions of unwound template-strand ssDNA engaging the RNAP active centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zuo and Steitz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Structural and biochemical experiments suggest that transcription-bubble formation is initiated by unwinding the DNA base pair at the upstream end of the transcription bubble – breaking the base pair, and unstacking and flipping the non-template-strand base of the broken base pair, and inserting the unstacked and flipped non-template-strand base into a protein pocket of σ – followed by propagation of the unwinding in a downstream direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mazumder and Kapanidis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feklistov and Darst, 2011</xref>). However, the mechanism by which DNA is unwound and loaded into the RNAP active-centre cleft has remained controversial (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mazumder and Kapanidis, 2019</xref>). In crystal structures of RNAP σ holoenzyme, the RNAP active-centre cleft is too narrow to accommodate double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (&lt;20 Å), and σ obstructs access of dsDNA to the RNAP active-centre cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mekler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murakami et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murakami et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vassylyev et al., 2002</xref>). As a result, there is no unobstructed path by which dsDNA can access the RNAP active-centre cleft in RNAP holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mekler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murakami et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murakami et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vassylyev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Young et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murakami and Darst, 2003</xref>). Accordingly, it has remained unclear where, when, and how promoter DNA is unwound and loaded into the RNAP active-centre cleft.</p><p>To address these questions, two classes of models have been proposed. One class of models, termed ‘load-unwind’ models, propose that: (i) the RNAP active-centre cleft opens, through the swinging outward of one wall, termed the ‘clamp’, of the active-centre cleft, allowing loading of promoter DNA into the active-centre cleft as dsDNA; (ii) promoter DNA unwinds inside the active-centre cleft; and (iii) the active-centre cleft closes, through the swinging inward of the clamp, during or after DNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mazumder and Kapanidis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mekler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murakami et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murakami et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Young et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darst et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakraborty et al., 2012</xref>). The other class of models, termed ‘unwind-load’ models, proposes that: (i) promoter DNA unwinds outside the RNAP active-centre cleft and (ii) unwound-promoter DNA loads into the active-centre cleft as single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mazumder and Kapanidis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vassylyev et al., 2002</xref>).

Moreover, the previous results have been complicated by differences in the species source of the RNAP analysed, differences in the σ factors analysed, and differences in the promoter sequences analysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakraborty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Spassky et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duval-Valentin and Ehrlich, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cowing et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schickor et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mazumder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glyde et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rogozina et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we report the use of single-molecule kinetic studies to define the pathway of DNA unwinding and DNA loading, without the assumptions that complicate analysis of artificially trapped complexes, and without the heterogeneity, population averaging, and time averaging that complicate analysis of ensemble kinetics. We used single-molecule promoter unwinding-induced fluorescence enhancement (smUIFE) to monitor DNA unwinding in solution in real time during formation of RPo, and we used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to monitor opening and closing of the RNAP clamp in solution in real time during formation of RPo. In all experiments, we analysed <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNAP σ<sup>70</sup> holoenzyme at a consensus bacterial core promoter, comprising a consensus –35 element, a consensus –10 element, and a consensus −35/–10 spacer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-molecule UIFE</title><p>Previous work indicates that a promoter derivative having the fluorescent probe Cy3 site-specifically incorporated in the transcription-bubble region exhibits an ~2-fold increase in fluorescence emission intensity upon promoter unwinding during RPo formation and exhibits an ~ 2-fold decrease in fluorescence emission intensity upon promoter rewinding during promoter escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feklistov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ko and Heyduk, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koh et al., 2018</xref>).

These results confirm that sequence-specific, heparin-resistant, complexes were formed only between RNAP holoenzyme and Cy3-containing promoter DNA fragments.</p><p>We extracted intensity vs. time trajectories for the formation of RNAP-promoter complexes, and identified different classes of trajectories. A large class of trajectories (~45%) was characterised by the appearance of a fluorescence intensity of ~200 counts, followed by an increase in fluorescence intensity to ~450 counts, followed by either a decrease of the intensity to ~200 counts or a disappearance of the intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <italic>middle</italic>). Control experiments show that (i) binding of Cy3-containing non-promoter DNA fragments to immobilised RNAP holoenzyme did not result in ≥2-fold fluorescence enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>); and (ii) binding of Cy3-containing promoter DNA fragments to immobilised RNAP core molecules did not result in ≥2-fold fluorescence enhancement events for the overwhelming majority of the time trajectories (~96%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). These results indicate that the detected ~2-fold fluorescence enhancement events represent sequence-specific complexes between RNAP holoenzyme and promoter DNA fragments. Therefore, we assigned the states with no intensity as species that lack promoter DNA or that have promoter DNA with photobleached Cy3; the states with an intensity level of ~200 counts as RNAP-promoter complexes having dsDNA at the Cy3 incorporation site; and states with an intensity level ~450 counts as RNAP-promoter complexes having single-stranded DNA at the Cy3 incorporation site. This assignment yields a reaction sequence comprising: binding of double-stranded promoter DNA to RNAP (~200 counts; ‘pre-unwinding state’), followed by promoter unwinding (~450 counts; ‘unwound state’), followed by promoter rewinding (~200 counts) or probe photobleaching (~0 counts). Upon addition of an NTP subset enabling synthesis of transcripts up to 11 nt in length (ATP, UTP, and GTP), ~ 49% of trajectories showed formation of a stable unwound-promoter state (with fluorescence intensity similar to that of the sub-population exhibiting promoter unwinding), as expected for the formation of initial transcribing complexes (RPitc <underline>&lt;</underline>11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>, top; see also Materials and methods). Upon subsequent addition of a separate NTP subset (GTP and CTP), enabling synthesis of transcripts up to 14 nt in length, ~ 27% of the resulting complexes showed formation of a stable rewound-promoter state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>, bottom), as expected for promoter escape and formation of a transcription elongation complex. The results show that RNAP-promoter complexes formed in these experiments are transcriptionally active and are competent for promoter escape (see also Materials and methods).</p><p>Focusing on the class of trajectories that showed promoter unwinding after binding (as opposed to other classes of trajectories that did not show promoter unwinding after binding; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref> ), we analysed trajectories further to define the kinetics of promoter unwinding (see Materials and methods). Using hidden Markov model (HMM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van de Meent et al., 2014</xref>), we extracted dwell times for the pre-unwinding states and plotted a dwell-time histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>top right</italic>). The dwell-time histogram showed a peaked distribution, indicating a non-Markovian process having more than one rate-limiting steps before the formation of the unwound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Floyd et al., 2010</xref>). We fitted this histogram to a two-exponential function (see Materials and methods for a detailed explanation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Floyd et al., 2010</xref>), and estimated the total time spent in the pre-unwinding state to be ~7.5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>top right</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether the assay reports accurately on the kinetics of promoter unwinding, we analysed altered promoter derivatives predicted to unwind <italic>more quickly</italic> or <italic>more slowly</italic> than lac<italic>CONS</italic>. To accelerate unwinding, we lowered the energy barrier for unwinding by introducing a non-complementary sequence at positions –10 to –4 relative to the transcription start site (pre-unwound lacCONS-[+ 2 Cy3]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Time trajectories for pre-unwound lacCONS-[+ 2 Cy3] were qualitatively similar to those for lacCONS-[+ 2 Cy3] in terms of the intensity increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>middle left</italic>, S4A) and the shape of the dwell-time histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>middle right</italic>); however, the trajectories showed significantly shorter dwell times in the pre-unwinding state (~2.8 s vs. ~7.5 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>middle right</italic> vs. <italic>top right</italic>). To decelerate the process, we raised the energy barrier for unwinding by introducing a G/C-rich sequence at positions –4 to +1 relative to the transcription start site (G/C lacCONS-[+ 2 Cy3]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Time trajectories for G/C lacCONS-[+ 2 Cy3] showed significantly longer dwell times in the pre-unwinding state (~18.8 s vs. 7.5 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>bottom right</italic> vs. <italic>top right</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, these results show that dwell times in the pre-unwinding state depend on energy barriers for promoter unwinding, consistent with expectation that the dwell times report on the kinetics of promoter unwinding.</p><p>Next, to determine whether promoter unwinding occurs in one step, or in more than one step, we assessed whether unwinding of the upstream half of the transcription bubble (positions –11 to –5) coincides with, or does not coincide with, unwinding of the downstream half of the transcription bubble (positions –4 to +2). To probe unwinding of the upstream half of <italic>GC</italic> promoter bubble, we performed analogous smUIFE experiments using promoter derivatives having Cy3 incorporated in the upstream half of the transcription bubble, at template-strand position –9 (lacCONS-[–9 Cy3] and G/C lacCONS-[–9 Cy3]; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The resulting trajectories were similar in terms of intensity increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>) and dwell-time-distribution shapes to those obtained with promoter DNA fragments having Cy3 incorporated in the downstream edge of the transcription bubble, but the dwell times in the pre-unwinding state were significantly shorter: ~ 5.5 s vs. ~7.5 s for lacCONS-[–9 Cy3] vs. lacCONS-[+ 2 Cy3] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>top right</italic> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>top right</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and ~6.0 s vs. ~18.8 s for G/C lacCONS-[–9 Cy3] vs. G/C lacCONS-[+ 2 Cy3] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>bottom right</italic> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>bottom right</italic>; 1D). We conclude that, for the promoters analysed, unwinding of the upstream half of the transcription bubble occurs faster than unwinding of the downstream half of the transcription bubble, and we conclude that we can estimate from our data both the reaction time required for unwinding of the upstream half of the transcription bubble, t<sub>UNWIND-UP</sub> (from the lifetime of the pre-unwinding state when Cy3 is incorporated at position –9; ~ 5.5 s for lacCONS), and the reaction time required for the subsequent unwinding of the downstream half of the transcription bubble, t<sub>UNWIND-DOWN</sub> (from the difference in lifetimes between the pre-unwinding state when Cy3 is incorporated at position +2 and the pre-unwinding state when Cy3 is incorporated at position –9; ~ 2.0 s for lacCONS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

We reasoned that, if clamp opening is obligatory for promoter unwinding, preventing clamp opening by addition of Myx should either prevent or delay downstream unwinding. We first performed smUIFE experiments in the presence of Myx using promoter DNA fragment lacCONS-[+ 2 Cy3], which has Cy3 incorporated at the downstream edge of the transcription bubble. The results showed a fluorescence intensity enhancement of ~2.4-fold, consistent with unwinding of the downstream edge of the transcription bubble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>bottom;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feklistov et al., 2017</xref>) and showed a dwell time between initial binding and intensity enhancement of ~4.1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). We next performed smUIFE experiments in the presence of Myx using promoter DNA fragment lacCONS-[–9 Cy3], which has Cy3 incorporated in the upstream half of the transcription bubble.

For both promoter derivatives, the observed fluorescence intensity enhancements were similar in the absence and presence of Myx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and the observed dwell times between initial binding and intensity enhancement times were shorter – not longer – in the presence of Myx than in the absence of Myx (~3.5 s shorter for transcription-bubble downstream edge and ~1.5 s shorter for transcription-bubble upstream half; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <italic>top panels</italic>). We suggest that Myx prevents formation of heparin-resistant open complexes either by preventing loading of unwound DNA into active-centre cleft or by preventing subsequent locking of the RNAP clamp. We infer – contrary to the models in which clamp opening is obligatory for promoter unwinding – that preventing RNAP clamp opening does not prevent promoter unwinding, and increases, not decreases, the kinetics of promoter unwinding.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Single-molecule promoter unwinding-induced fluorescence enhancement (smUIFE) in the presence of an inhibitor that prevents RNAP clamp opening: preventing RNAP clamp opening does not prevent DNA unwinding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Design of promoter unwinding experiment in presence of myxopyronin (Myx).

The most abundant were Class-I molecules (~45% of all events) that started with E*~0.40, remained at E*~0.40, and then bleached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>), and Class-II molecules (~44%) that started with E*~0.40, transitioned to E*~0.48, and then bleached or returned to E*~0.40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). More rarely, we observed Class-III molecules (~9% of all events) that started with E*~0.48, transitioned to E*~0.40, followed by bleaching or transition to E*~0.48; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>, and, very rarely, we observed Class-IV molecules (~2%) that started with E*~0.40, switched between E*~0.40–0.20 and bleached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>We refer to the new E*~0.48 state observed here as the ‘locked-clamp’ conformation, with Class-II molecules providing information on the time taken to form the ‘locked-clamp’ conformation; in contrast, Class-I molecules represent RNAP molecules that either bleach before the transition to the locked-clamp state or bind non-specifically to DNA; and Class-III molecules represent molecules where the initial clamp locking is missed.</p><p>E* time trajectories for Class-II molecules were fitted to a two-state HMM model, E*-values from the fitted model were extracted, binned, and plotted using Origin (Origin Lab), and were fitted to Gaussian distributions using Origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panels and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>, left panel; coloured curves). The resulting histograms provide population distributions of E* states and, for each E* state, define mean E* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panels and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>, right panel; coloured bars and inset). Dwell-time distributions corresponding to time spent before the first transition from a closed-clamp state to a locked-clamp state were extracted from HMM fits to E* vs. time trajectories, and were binned and plotted as distribution histograms in Origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Dwell-time histograms obtained in this manner exhibited the shape of a peaked distribution, indicating presence of at least two sub-steps, were fitted to a two-exponential function of the form y = A*(e<sup>-x/t1</sup> – e<sup>-x/t2</sup>), where y represents counts of dwells in the closed-clamp state following the initial binding event and before the clamp-locking event, x represents time, and t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub> represent the lifetimes of the individual sub-steps. From the fit, we estimate the time spent in the two sub-steps, as well as the total time before transition to ‘locked-clamp’ conformation (t<sub>LOCK</sub>) from the sum of times corresponding to the two sub-steps. Similar to the case for fluorescence enhancement experiments described previously, we note that there may be more than two steps which contribute significantly to these dwell times, and we could not infer an accurate model in terms of the number and duration of each sub-step involved from this dataset. Therefore, we avoid assigning the two sub-steps to specific conformations or events and focus on the total time spent before the transition to ‘locked-clamp’ conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data and software availability</title><p>All information for replication is included in the submission and data corresponding to each figure are provided as source data files.

Using single-molecule analysis the authors examined two conformational transitions taking place during RNA transcription initiation: DNA unwinding and RNAP clamp movements. The paper will help to distinguish between two competing hypotheses within the literature. Namely, using the bacterial consensus promoter the authors showed that a clamp-opening event is not obligatory for promoter unwinding and that promoter unwinding proceeds via a &quot;bind-unwind-load-and-lock&quot; model. The work will be of relevance to a wide range of researchers interested in the molecular basis of gene expression and gene regulation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transcription initiation at a consensus bacterial promoter proceeds via a &quot;bind-unwind-load- and-lock&quot; mechanism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maria Spies as a Reviewing Editor and Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nigel J Savery (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers and the reviewing editor found the work well executed and technically sounds, but concluded that additional experiments are needed to exclude the model where the RNAP clamp needs to acquire more open conformations in order for DNA unwinding to take place.</p><p>1. Controls suggested by reviewer 1, points (1) and (2) are essential.</p><p>2. The results currently presented in the paper are for a consensus promoter. Including another promoter or two would constitute reasonable amount of work and would greatly increase the generality and impact of the work. Studying multiple promoters within the context of one system and one group seems the best way for deciding if the same mechanism is always observed or if a variety of different mechanisms is possible (which may explain the existence of support for different mechanisms in the field).</p><p>3. The Discussion is quite brief. The authors could discuss their results in the context of the evidences for other models. In particular, the issue of alternative means through which the DNA may be loaded in the cleft despite a lack of conformational change in the clamp should be discussed.</p><p>4. The proposition that no &quot;open&quot; clamp conformations were observed in the E* traces needs further discussion. Considering the time resolution of the experiments, very rapid opening would not be detected. Additionally, DNA opening and RNA polymerase opening were measured in separate experiments and therefore, the conclusions rely in part on correlation between results gained in slightly different conditions. This needs to be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) The claim by the authors that heparin-resistance shows specificity is not convincing as heparin as a variety of effects depending on the system. The authors should do not provide traces from Cy3-labeled promoter-less DNA templates as negative controls. Nor do they provide traces using promoter-less templates to recruit labeled RNAP to the surface. These experiments would allow for the facile identification of non-specific signals. In addition, on promoter templates, core RNAP in the absence of σ factor could be used as a negative control for promoter-specific signals.</p><p>(2) No NTP chase controls are shown to suggest that any of these complexes are on-pathway and capable of escaping the promoter.</p><p>(3) These experiments are done with the lacCONS promoter which does not faithfully represent real <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters. In fact, it is rare for real promoters to have fully consensus sequences. In addition, there may be multiple conformational pathways for DNA unwinding during initiation. Without measuring the process using a variety of real promoters taken from <italic>E. coli</italic>, no general conclusions regarding &quot;the&quot; pathway of initiation can be made.</p><p>(4) The premise is that no &quot;open&quot; clamp conformations are observed in the E* traces. However, I suppose that only a lower limit on the lifetime of such a state can be given based on the time resolution of the measurement.</p><p>(5) It is not clear how to map &quot;openness&quot; from FRET measurements presented here to those made in structural work unless there is some calibrated way to convert E* to a distance.</p><p>The combination of these points really limits the impact that this manuscript would have on the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript was presented logically and clearly and I have only a few suggestions for the authors to consider.</p><p>1. The smFRET experiments directly examine the state of the clamp, and the experiments support the conclusion that the labelled residues do not adopt the &quot;open clamp&quot; conformation during promoter melting (within the time resolution of the experiments). A recent paper has suggested that movement of the Β lobe might allow loading of double-stranded DNA even in the presence of what they called a &quot;partially closed&quot; clamp (Unarta et al., PNAS 2021 PNAS April 27, 2021 118 (17) e2024324118). Ref 17 in the current ms, which examined open complex formation in a different system using cryo-em, also raised the possible importance of movements of the Β lobe for loading of dsDNA. These findings do not affect the validity of the author's conclusions about the state of the clamp in their system, but do suggest that some caution might be needed when deciding how strongly these observations about the clamp suggest that unwinding must be taking place prior to loading. It would be useful to discuss the potential role of RNA polymerase conformational changes that would not be reflected in the smFRET analysis when interpreting the data.</p><p>2. P8 Para 2 line 3. The term E* is introduced for the first time in the manuscript here and it would be helpful to provide more explanation for readers not familiar with the technique.</p><p>3. P8 It is shown that Myx prevents the formation of heparin-resistant complexes, but the reason why the open complexes are not heparin-resistant is not clear, given that promoter unwinding occurs. It would be helpful to add more explanation here: do the authors think that Myx prevents the &quot;lock&quot; stage?</p><p>4. Figure 2B: is the very short lifetime of the unwound state in the example shown for the +2 construct typical of the data collected and was the lifetime of the -9 constructs typically longer? If so, does this indicate that the presence of the probe at that position is affecting the stability of the open complex (and hence potentially the kinetics of unwinding?) I note that this is related in part to point 3 as these experiments are done with Myx, and so the complexes are heparin-sensitive.</p><p>5.

The results show clearly that the fluorescence enhancement signals observed using RNAP holoenzyme and promoter DNA fragments are specific to promoter-unwinding events.</p><p>We have added the following text describing these control experiments:</p><p>“Control experiments show that: (i) Cy3-containing promoter DNA fragments bound exclusively to immobilised RNAP molecules (Figure S2A), and the majority (~60%) of the resulting complexes were resistant to challenge with heparin (Figure S2B); (ii) binding of Cy3-containing non-promoter DNA fragments to immobilised RNAP holoenzyme molecules did not result in heparin-resistant complexes (Figure S2C); and (ii) binding of Cy3-containing promoter DNA fragments to immobilised RNAP core enzyme molecules did not result in heparin-resistant complexes (Figure S2D). These results confirm that sequence-specific, heparin-resistant, complexes were formed only between RNAP holoenzyme and Cy3-containing promoter DNA fragments.”</p><p>and,</p><p>“Control experiments show that (i) binding of Cy3-containing non-promoter DNA fragments to immobilised RNAP holoenzyme did not result in ≥2-fold fluorescence enhancement (Figure S3C); and (ii) binding of Cy3-containing promoter DNA fragments to immobilised RNAP core molecules did not result in ≥2-fold fluorescence enhancement events for the overwhelming majority of the time-trajectories (~96%; Figure S3D). These results indicate that the detected ~2-fold fluorescence enhancement events represent sequence-specific complexes between RNAP holoenzyme and promoter DNA fragments.”</p><p>and,</p><p>“Control experiments show that: (i) doubly-labelled RNAP molecules bound exclusively to immobilised promoter DNA molecules (Figure S6A); (ii) the majority (~87%) of the resulting complexes were resistant to challenge with heparin (Figure S6B); and (iii) doubly-labelled RNAP molecules did not bind stably to immobilised non-promoter DNA molecules (Figure S7C). These results indicate sequence-specific, heparin-resistant RNAP-promoter complexes were only formed between the doubly labelled RNAP holoenzyme molecules and promoter DNA fragments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) No NTP chase controls are shown to suggest that any of these complexes are on-pathway and capable of escaping the promoter.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included NTP chase control experiments showing that complexes formed in these experiments are transcription competent and capable of escaping the promoter. We have added the following text:</p><p>“Upon addition of an NTP subset enabling synthesis of transcripts up to 11-nt in length (ATP, UTP and GTP), ~49% of trajectories showed formation of a stable unwound-promoter state (with fluorescence intensity similar to that of the sub-population exhibiting promoter unwinding), as expected for the formation of initial transcribing complexes (RPitc &lt;11; Figure S3B, top; see also Methods). Upon subsequent addition of a separate NTP subset (GTP and CTP), enabling synthesis of transcripts up to 14-nt in length, ~27% of the resulting complexes showed formation of a stable rewound-promoter state (Figure S3B, bottom), as expected for promoter escape and formation of a transcription elongation complex. The results show that RNAP-promoter complexes formed in these experiments are transcriptionally active and are competent for promoter escape (see also Methods).”</p><p>Further, we have added the following text to Methods:</p><p>“For experiments in Figure S3B top panel, observation wells containing immobilised RNAP-promoter complexes (formed with LC-[+2-Cy3]; sequence in Figure S1) were supplemented with KG7 buffer containing a NTP subset (500 µM ApA and 100 µM each of ATP, GTP and UTP) directing synthesis of RNA up to position +11(RPitc &lt;11), incubated for 5 min at 22ºC, solutions were removed, wells were washed with 2 x 30 µl KG7, and 30 µl KG7 imaging buffer at 22ºC was added. Videos of complexes corresponding to stalled RPitc &lt;11 molecules were recorded. For experiments in Figure S3B bottom panel, observation wells containing immobilised stalled RPitc &lt;11 molecules were supplemented with KG7 imaging buffer, the recording of a video was started, and an NTP subset (100 µM each of GTP and CTP) directing extension of stalled complexes with 11-mer RNA to a 14-mer RNA, was added in real time. Extension of RNA up to +11 results in stalled initial transcribing complexes (45) and extension of RNA to +14 results in promoter escape and leads to formation of stalled elongation complexes for the lacCONS promoter used (Wang, Mazumder et al., in preparation).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) These experiments are done with the lacCONS promoter which does not faithfully represent real E. coli promoters. In fact, it is rare for real promoters to have fully consensus sequences. In addition, there may be multiple conformational pathways for DNA unwinding during initiation. Without measuring the process using a variety of real promoters taken from <italic>E. coli</italic>, no general conclusions regarding &quot;the&quot; pathway of initiation can be made.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. As the reviewer mentions, and as we state clearly in our manuscript, we have performed our experiments using <italic>lacCONS</italic>, a derivative of the <italic>lac</italic> promoter derivative that includes a consensus σ70 bacterial promoter. For that promoter, as well as for several derivatives thereof, we show that a clamp-opening event is not obligatory for promoter unwinding and that promoter unwinding proceeds via a “bind-unwind-load-and-lock” model. We point out that the <italic>lacCONS</italic> promoter has been used extensively in previous work to establish transcription mechanisms: e.g., clamp closure upon RNAP-promoter open-complex formation (Chakraborty et al., <italic>Science</italic> 2012), DNA scrunching in transcription-start-site selection (Winkelman et al., <italic>Science</italic> 2016), DNA scrunching in initial transcription (Kapanidis et al., <italic>Science</italic> 2006), and RNAP pausing in initial transcription (Duchi et al., <italic>Mol Cell</italic> 2016: Winkelman et al., <italic>Mol Cell</italic> 2020), all of which subsequently were validated for other promoters.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that, within the general framework of a “bind-unwind-load-and-lock” model, different promoter unwinding kinetics and pathways are possible for promoters with different sequence elements. Being aware of this issue, we have clearly stated (both in the title and throughout the manuscript) that our study specifically concerns a consensus bacterial promoter.</p><p>In the discussion we now write:</p><p>“The consensus bacterial promoter employed in this study has been used in previous work to define transcription mechanisms, including RNAP clamp closure upon RPo formation (14), DNA scrunching in transcription-start-site selection (40), DNA scrunching in initial transcription (41), and RNAP pausing in initial transcription (42,43), all of which subsequently were validated for other promoters. Nevertheless, we emphasize that it remains to be determined whether the bind-unwind-load-and-lock pathway defined here for the consensus bacterial promoter also is used by E. coli RNAP σ<sup>70</sup> holoenzyme at other promoters and by other <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP holoenzymes.”</p><p>We have begun extending our work--focusing mainly on the kinetics of promoter unwinding, rather than on RNAP clamp conformation--to other promoters. However, analysis of individual other promoters will not enable the question to be settled in a comprehensive and conclusive manner. Therefore, in further separate work, we plan to develop and apply massively parallel single-molecule assays that interrogate large libraries of promoters.

However, we point out that the possibility of an obligatory clamp-opening/clamp-reclosing event occurring on <italic>any</italic> time scale during RPo formation is excluded by our smUIFE experiments showing that the RNAP inhibitor myxopyronin, which locks the RNAP clamp in the closed state, does not block, or even delay, promoter unwinding (Figure 2).</p><p>This following text makes this point:</p><p>&quot;To determine whether promoter unwinding is affected by preventing opening of the RNAP clamp, we repeated our experiments in presence of myxopyronin (Myx; 14, 15, 24, 37-38), an RNAP inhibitor that prevents RNAP clamp opening (14, 24, 37; state with an smFRET efficiency, E*~0.36 in Figure S5D) and that allows formation of heparin-sensitive RNAP-promoter complexes but prevents formation of heparin-resistant RNAP-promoter complexes (37; Figures S5A-B). […] We infer--contrary to the models in which clamp opening is obligatory for promoter unwinding--that preventing RNAP clamp opening does not prevent promoter unwinding, and increases, not decreases, the kinetics of promoter unwinding.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is not clear how to map &quot;openness&quot; from FRET measurements presented here to those made in structural work unless there is some calibrated way to convert E* to a distance.</p></disp-quote><p>The FRET construct used here for monitoring clamp conformation has been characterised and compared to structural work in previous studies (Chakraborty et al., Science, 2012; Duchi et al., NAR, 2018; Mazumder et al., NAR, 2021). We precisely mapped the three FRET states centred on ~0.2, ~0.3 and ~0.4 to open, partly closed and closed structural states respectively, from probe accessible volume calculations on available structures and distance estimations from accurate FRET values in Duchi et al., NAR, 2018.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The combination of these points really limits the impact that this manuscript would have on the field.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript was presented logically and clearly and I have only a few suggestions for the authors to consider.</p><p>1. The smFRET experiments directly examine the state of the clamp, and the experiments support the conclusion that the labelled residues do not adopt the &quot;open clamp&quot; conformation during promoter melting (within the time resolution of the experiments). A recent paper has suggested that movement of the Β lobe might allow loading of double-stranded DNA even in the presence of what they called a &quot;partially closed&quot; clamp (Unarta et al., PNAS 2021 PNAS April 27, 2021 118 (17) e2024324118). Ref 17 in the current ms, which examined open complex formation in a different system using cryo-em, also raised the possible importance of movements of the Β lobe for loading of dsDNA. These findings do not affect the validity of the author's conclusions about the state of the clamp in their system, but do suggest that some caution might be needed when deciding how strongly these observations about the clamp suggest that unwinding must be taking place prior to loading. It would be useful to discuss the potential role of RNA polymerase conformational changes that would not be reflected in the smFRET analysis when interpreting the data.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that a molecular-dynamics simulation has raised the possibility that motions of the RNAP β lobe, termed &quot;gate opening,&quot; could make part of the RNAP active-centre cleft accessible to dsDNA without RNAP clamp opening. We have added the following text in the Discussion:</p><p>“As described in the introduction, it has been the predominant view that structural considerations necessitate RNAP clamp opening for loading of dsDNA into the RNAP active-centre cleft but do not necessitate RNAP clamp opening for loading of ssDNA into the RNAP active-centre cleft (1-2,7-9,11,13-14). Under that predominant view, our finding that the RNAP clamp remains closed throughout promoter unwinding at a consensus bacterial promoter implies that it is ssDNA, not dsDNA, that enters the RNAP active-centre-cleft, and thus that promoter unwinding occurs at least in part outside, not inside, the RNAP active-centre cleft (Figure 4).</p><p>In contrast to the predominant view, it recently has been speculated, based on molecular-dynamics simulations, that part of the RNAP cleft potentially could become accessible to both dsDNA and ssDNA without clamp opening, due to motions, putatively occurring on the nanosecond time-scale, of the RNAP β lobe (&quot;gate opening&quot;; 39). Under this alternative view, our finding that the RNAP clamp remains closed throughout promoter unwinding at a consensus bacterial promoter potentially could be consistent with either ssDNA or dsDNA entering the RNAP active-centre-cleft, and thus potentially could be consistent with promoter unwinding that occurs either outside or inside, the RNAP active-centre cleft. Nevertheless, in view of the absence of experimental support for the alternative view, and in view of the mismatch between the nanosecond time scale of the limiting reaction in the alternative view and the millisecond-to-second time scales of promoter unwinding, we tend to disfavour this alternative view.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

P8 It is shown that Myx prevents the formation of heparin-resistant complexes, but the reason why the open complexes are not heparin-resistant is not clear, given that promoter unwinding occurs. It would be helpful to add more explanation here: do the authors think that Myx prevents the &quot;lock&quot; stage?</p></disp-quote><p>We suggest that Myx prevents formation of heparin-resistant open complexes either by preventing loading of unwound DNA into active centre cleft or by preventing subsequent locking of the RNAP clamp. We have added the following clarification in the main text:</p><p>“We suggest that Myx prevents formation of heparin-resistant open complexes either by preventing loading of unwound DNA into active centre cleft or by preventing subsequent locking of the RNAP clamp.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 2B: is the very short lifetime of the unwound state in the example shown for the +2 construct typical of the data collected and was the lifetime of the -9 constructs typically longer? If so, does this indicate that the presence of the probe at that position is affecting the stability of the open complex (and hence potentially the kinetics of unwinding?) I note that this is related in part to point 3 as these experiments are done with Myx, and so the complexes are heparin-sensitive.</p></disp-quote><p>The lifetime of the unwound state in Figure 2B is not typical of the dataset. Further, we note that end of a time-trajectory signifies either an isomerisation to a rewound state, or bleaching and is not generally indicative of the lifetime in the state. In a separate study, we have been examining lifetimes of unwound states. In that study, the time-traces used are long enough to observe entire dwells in the unwound state and to observe that dwells in the unwound state end by transitions to other intensity states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
