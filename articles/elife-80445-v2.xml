In contrast, previous work indicates that <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other invertebrates store memories using presynaptic plasticity of cholinergic synapses. Here, we provide evidence for postsynaptic plasticity at cholinergic output synapses from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom bodies (MBs). We find that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit α5 is required within specific MB output neurons for appetitive memory induction but is dispensable for aversive memories. In addition, nAChR α2 subunits mediate memory expression and likely function downstream of α5 and the postsynaptic scaffold protein discs large (Dlg). We show that postsynaptic plasticity traces can be induced independently of the presynapse, and that in vivo dynamics of α2 nAChR subunits are changed both in the context of associative and non-associative (familiarity) memory formation, underlying different plasticity rules. Therefore, regardless of neurotransmitter identity, key principles of postsynaptic plasticity support memory storage across phyla.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>postsynaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>learning and memory</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>mushroom bodies</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC-2049-390688087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Owald</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>184695641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Owald</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>327654276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Owald</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>365082554</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Owald</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>467545627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jagannathan</surname><given-names>Sridhar R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emmy Noether Programme</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Owald</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Specific memories can be stored through changes in the postsynaptic cholinergic receptor composition at <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body synapses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The efficacy of synaptic transmission, also referred to as synaptic weight, can be increased or decreased following changes in neural activity profiles or concurrent action of neuromodulators, such as dopamine. Resulting changes to how synapses relay information underlie synaptic plasticity, which is widely believed to be the basis of memory storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glanzman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Korte and Schmitz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nicoll, 2017</xref>). While, it is generally accepted that synaptic plasticity can serve as memory substrate from flies to humans, it is unclear to what degree neurophysiological and molecular principles underlying synaptic plasticity are evolutionarily conserved. One main difference between vertebrates and invertebrates is that memory-storing synapses in vertebrates use glutamate as their primary transmitter, while those in invertebrates (at least for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Sepia officinalis</italic>) use acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shomrat et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, it is widely established that invertebrate nervous systems utilize presynaptic plasticity (with plasticity referring to changes leading to either strengthening (potentiation) or weakening (depression) of synaptic transmission and the rearrangement or exchange of synaptic molecules underlying changed transmission) for storing memories, while the degree to which postsynaptic plasticity can be used is less clear. In contrast, it is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glanzman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Korte and Schmitz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nicoll, 2017</xref>) that storing information in vertebrates can depend on both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, including postsynaptic rearrangements of neurotransmitter receptors.</p><p>Detailed knowledge of the anatomical wiring and functional signaling logic of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> learning and memory centers, the mushroom bodies (MBs; third [‘higher’]-order brain center; learning takes place three synapses downstream of sensory neurons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felsenberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Felsenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hattori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Plaçais et al., 2013</xref>) allow one to address to what extent synaptic mechanisms underlying memory storage are comparable across evolution, despite the use of different neurotransmitter systems. The weights of Kenyon cells (KCs) to MB output neuron (MBON) synapses are modulated by dopaminergic neurons (DANs), which anatomically divide the MBs into at least 15 functional compartments. At the level of these compartments, information is stored on appetitive and aversive (odor) associations, in addition to non-associative information, such as the relative familiarity of an odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hattori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>), a distinct form of habituation. Summed up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>), output from the individual MB compartments will give rise to specific behaviors, weighing up appetitive and aversive associations as well as, for instance, the familiarity of a stimulus.</p><p>Studies so far have identified several traits pointing toward presynaptic storage mechanisms within the KCs during memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Handler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ehmann et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, some studies that have blocked neurotransmitter release from KCs during learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubnau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McGuire et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwaerzel et al., 2002</xref> have brought postsynaptic contributions to synaptic plasticity into question.</p><p>In vertebrates, typically, postsynaptic long-term changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Korte and Schmitz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kandel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lüscher and Malenka, 2011</xref>) are mediated via NMDA-sensitive glutamate receptors (NMDAR) that induce (‘induction’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nicoll, 2017</xref>) an expression phase (‘expression’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nicoll, 2017</xref>) through changed glutamatergic AMPA receptor (AMPAR) dynamics in dependence of postsynaptic scaffolds like PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Won et al., 2017</xref>). Invertebrate nAChRs in principle could take over similar functions to their glutamatergic counterparts in vertebrates, despite their differing molecular characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, nAChRs are pentamers that can be composed of homomeric assemblies of α subunits or heteromeric combinations of different α and β subunits. The composition of subunits determines the physiological properties of the nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dent, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ihara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lansdell et al., 2012</xref>), and synaptic weights could, in theory, be adjusted through the exchange of receptor subunits or entire complexes.</p><p>Here, we capitalize on the genetic accessibility to individual output neurons of the MBs to directly test whether postsynaptic receptors play a role in memory storage. Derived from combined neurophysiological, behavioral, light microscopic, and molecular approaches, our data are supportive of a sequential role for nAChR subunits in appetitive memory storage at the level of MBONs. Using artificial training protocols, we demonstrate that postsynaptic calcium transients can change in response to concurrent activation of DANs and application of acetylcholine, circumventing KC output. Blocking KC output during appetitive, but not aversive, learning abolishes memory performance. Moreover, specific knockdown of the α5 nAChR subunit, but none of the other six α subunits, in the M4/6 MBONs (also known as MBON-γ5β’2a, MBON-β’2mp, MBON- β2β’2a, and MBON-β’2mp bilateral) – an output junction involved in coding appetitive and aversive memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>) – impairs immediate appetitive memories. Knockdown of α2 or α5, however, interferes with 3-hr appetitive memories, as does knockdown of the scaffold discs large (Dlg). We report differential distribution of α subunits throughout the MB and demonstrate that signal recovery of GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged subunits (as measured through fluorescence signal recovered after photobleaching) is changed through plasticity protocols. In addition, postsynaptically expressed non-associative familiarity learning that is encoded at the level of the α’3 neurons of the MBs also depends on α5 and α2 signaling as well as α2 dynamics.

We only observed significant recovery in the odor only condition, whereas dopamine and odor paired with dopamine induced no significant recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a-d</xref>).</p><p>Thus, our data indicate that pairing odor presentation with dopamine application stalls α2<sup>GFP</sup> dynamics, potentially by either stabilizing the already present amount of receptor or hindering new incorporation of α2-containing receptors. Interestingly the opposite, increased receptor dynamics, is observed after odor exposure without reinforcer. Note that the absence of acute stimuli (constant air stream only) did not induce signal recovery, demonstrating that it is the presence of the odor that changes baseline receptor behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e</xref>).

We next asked whether postsynaptic plasticity expressed through α5 and α2 subunit interplay, was exclusive to appetitive memory storage, or would represent a more generalizable mechanism that could underlie other forms of learning represented in the MBs.

This form of learning allows the animal to adapt its behavioral responses to new odors and permits for assaying direct odor-related plasticity at the level of a higher-order integration center. Importantly, this compartment follows different plasticity rules, because the odor serves as both the conditioned (activating KCs) and unconditioned stimulus (activating corresponding DANs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hattori et al., 2017</xref>).

Subsequent expression of memory traces requires α2-containing receptors. Importantly, recovery accompanies synaptic depression at the level of the α’3 MBONs, while being suppressed by paired training in the β’2 compartment. Moreover, α2 appears to be involved in both depression and facilitation of synapses. Thus, synapses could bidirectionally utilize plasticity of the same receptor subunit for storing different types of information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of postsynaptic plasticity sequence across compartments.</title><p>Top panels (circuit and behavior level): Mushroom body (MB) compartments investigated. Odors elicit high responses in M4 neurons inducing α2 receptor dynamics. High activity in M4 tilts the balance toward odor avoidance. Learning (or concurrent odor exposure with dopamine application) reduces receptor exchange. This results in reduced postsynaptic responses and tilts the balance toward approach behavior. Suppressed dynamics through learning could be reminiscent of a ‘dark current’ mechanism as found in the mammalian visual system (please see Discussion). At the level of the α’3 compartment repeated odor exposure triggers increased α2 receptor dynamics. In this compartment, the increased dynamics result in reduced odor-evoked activity in the MB output neurons (MBONs) resulting in familiarity learning (less behavioral responsiveness to familiar compared to novel odors). Middle panels (synaptic level): Our data are consistent with a model in which α5 subunit containing receptors (red) mediate the early phase of postsynaptic memory storage, potentially by leading to elevated calcium flux (not addressed in this study) at individual postsynaptic densities (see Discussion and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> showing separated PSDs (postsynaptic densities) and analyses concerning input specificity). Concurrent events see changed dynamics of the α2 receptor (blue). Changed dynamics likely reflect changed exocytosis of intracellular receptor populations or lateral diffusion across membranes. Nicotinic receptor subunits hereby potentially interact with adaptor proteins to bind to discs large (Dlg). Importantly, we identify elevated α2 subunit dynamics in the context of associative (M4; Kenyon cells [KC] and dopaminergic neuron [DAN] activation needed for memory formation) and non-associative (α’3 MBONs; odor activates both KCs and DANs) memory expression. Increased α2 subunit dynamics in both cases are triggered by odor application. At the level of M4, suppressed dynamics, would correspond to postsynaptic depression, while at the level of α’3 MBONs increased dynamics could result in postsynaptic depression. Therefore, different learning rules might govern the incorporation, exchange, or stabilization of receptors in or out of synapses. Please see Discussion for further details.

How synapses adapt in order to change their efficacy during learning has been a focus of attention over the last decades. While it is undisputed that both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of memory storage exist in vertebrates, invertebrate memory-related synaptic plasticity has been largely localized to the presynaptic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Handler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ehmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tully et al., 1994</xref>). However, the core of the debate boils down to a key question: do vertebrates and invertebrates use similar mechanisms to store memories or are there fundamental differences? A first clear difference appears to be the use of different neurotransmitter systems, glutamate and acetylcholine, respectively, in the vertebrate and <italic>Drosophila</italic> learning centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Postsynaptic plasticity in associative memory storage</title><p>Here, we use the genetic tractability of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system to directly address postsynaptic plasticity during olfactory memory storage in invertebrates.

However, other studies blocking KC subsets did find impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krashes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamazaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>) in the context of short-term appetitive memory, while downstream circuit elements have been implicated in appropriate memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Widmer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we revisited such experiments and found, in accordance with previous studies, only mild, if any, requirement for aversive memory storage. We, however, fully abolished appetitive memories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) by blocking KC output during acquisition, providing the basis for a model of postsynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) that is induced and expressed through distinct nAChR subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>).</p><p>Our study hints toward different pre- and postsynaptic storage mechanisms underlying aversive and appetitive memories. It also argues against the assumption that appetitive and aversive memories will necessarily use the same molecular machinery to store information. Interestingly, arguing for a division of appetitive and aversive storage sites, subpopulations of KCs have been implicated in aversive and appetitive memory, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, postsynaptic contributions were previously ruled out for a synaptic junction required for storage of aversive but not appetitive memories, which is fully consistent with our findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hige et al., 2015</xref>). However, a recent study investigating postsynaptic calcium transients across MB compartments could be in line with postsynaptic modifications occurring following aversive training in some MB output compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hancock et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, the requirement of MBON signaling has been demonstrated, particularly in the context of longer-term memory storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ichinose et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Widmer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we do not wish to exclude a potential involvement of postsynaptic plasticity in aversive memory formation per se. On the contrary, it is conceivable that aversive memories also could have an appetitive component (release from punishment).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Postsynaptic plasticity at the KC to MBON synapse</title><p>Recent anatomical studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eichler et al., 2017</xref> have reported both dopaminergic innervation of presynaptic KC compartments and, somewhat unexpectedly, direct synapses between presynaptic dopaminergic terminals and MBONs. We devised an experiment where we substituted KC input to the postsynaptic MBON compartment through artificial acetylcholine injection, while rendering DANs switchable through optogenetics. A protocol that trained and subsequently tested the synaptic junction between KCs and MBONs, demonstrates that plasticity (represented by a change in calcium responses to acetylcholine injection) was inducible by pairing dopaminergic with postsynaptic MBON activation that lasted beyond the training stage and was observable by mere ‘recall-like’ activation of the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Our proof-of-principle experiments uncovered the ability to potentiate after pairing M6 MBON activation and stimulating a broad population of DANs that convey information on sugar, water, or the relative valence of aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>), while we find postsynaptic plasticity to be required for appetitive memory performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, previous studies looking into ‘natural’ appetitive sugar conditioning uncovered a relative depression in M4 (another MBON of the M4/6 cluster) dendrites, when comparing the responses of the paired (CS+) and unpaired odor (CS−) 1 hr after appetitive conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felsenberg et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, we here show that in vivo appetitive absolute training depresses subsequent responses to the trained odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is important to note that, here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), for our in vitro experiments, we perform global activation of the postsynaptic compartment and not the natural typical coverage of 5% of input synapses per odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Honegger et al., 2011</xref>) (that allow for differential conditioning). Induced changes are therefore likely not comparable to the natural settings, where sparse sets of KCs and DANs are active within a tight temporal window. Moreover, we here abolish network contributions (by suppressing active signal propagation), to be able to concentrate on synaptic mechanisms during plasticity induction. Thus, our artificial training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) through global dendritic activation likely does not mirror precise physiological conditions, allowing for plasticity of a sparse set of synapses to convey odor specificity to a memory. However, the relatively small amplitude of plasticity (here: potentiation) observed actually fits previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Owald et al., 2015</xref>) in vivo observations. Moreover, similar protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>) that involved broad activation of KCs (and thus did not circumvent the presynaptic compartment) have demonstrated comparable plasticity induction at this synaptic junction. It should also be noted that because we are using TTX and local training of KC to M6 synapses in our experiments, we are furthermore missing additional disinhibition that in vivo is mediated via the GABAergic MVP2 MBON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felsenberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>). Of note, how difficult it can be to infer how dendrites compute and integrate all input channels is exemplified by the observation that high levels of odor-mediated dendritic activation after α5 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) appear to be translated to reduced axonal calcium transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>), effectively leading to decreased signal transduction within the MBON. MBONs do not appear to exhibit prominent spines on their dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>) (but see section below: Are cholinergic and glutamatergic synapses interchangeable?). Therefore, increased dendritic activation could lead to a change in membrane resistance and result in synaptic interference.</p><p>It should also be noted that M4, which shows depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and M6 have common but also distinct physiological roles, for instance, during aversive memory extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felsenberg et al., 2018</xref>). Besides that, different temporal requirements for M4 and M6 memory expression have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore possible that physiological changes in the context of appetitive learning lead to different plasticity profiles in M4 and M6 neurons, respectively, or that initial potentiation over time can be reverted to depression. As noted above, MBON drive is bidirectionally modifiable and has the propensity to both potentiate and depress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Handler et al., 2019</xref>). It remains unclear, whether the applied protocols would elicit plasticity (and if so depression or facilitation) at the M4 dendrites, which is difficult to assess with our experimental design. In summary, the observed ex vivo plasticity trace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) should solely be viewed as a proof of principle that postsynaptic (MBON) plasticity can take place without presynaptic (KC) contribution per se.</p><p>Local acetylcholine application to the MB can also activate calcium transients in dopaminergic presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, our protocol could in principle include some dopaminergic contributions already at the pre-training level. However, control experiments using the paired training protocol in the absence of CsChrimson expression in DANs, do not show any signs of plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, it has been previously demonstrated that, to actually release dopamine from the presynaptic terminal, a coincident signal via carbon monoxide is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ueno et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ueno et al., 2020</xref>).

We propose that α5 nAChR subunits (that can form homomeric channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lansdell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eadaim et al., 2020</xref>) could take on a similar role to NMDARs. α5 would gate the potentiation or depression of synaptic strength influencing the incorporation or exchange of additional receptor subunits or complexes. In line with this, we show that knockdown of α5 subunits interferes with familiarity learning in the α’3 compartment of the MBs: flies no longer form familiarity memories, they react to a novel odor the same way as to a familiar one, ‘as if they had learned that this new odor was familiar before’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Moreover, we do not observe α5 subunit dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), whereas knockdown of α5 leads to decreased levels of α2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and α2 dynamics are no longer observable when knocking down α5 in the MBONs of the α’3 compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, we can draw first analogies to glutamatergic systems governing plasticity in vertebrates. Whether more core criteria are met for the comparison of invertebrate and vertebrate plasticity systems, further depends on whether the here observed receptor dynamics will actually translate to exo-/endocytosis of postsynaptic receptors or lateral diffusion of receptor subunits along the MBON dendrites (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Our established system should provide the means to investigate this further in the future.</p><p>We also find that later forms of appetitive memory expression require both the α2 and α1 receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ihara et al., 2020</xref>) has demonstrated that, when expressed heterologously, these subunits can co-assemble to form heterodimers with β subunits, which, depending on the precise composition of these channels, can harbor different properties, potentially reminiscent to AMPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greger et al., 2017</xref>). However, MB distribution profiles of α1 and α2 subunits do not match completely, for instance, at the level of the γ5 or α’2 compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that they could also partake in different or independent receptor configurations.</p><p>In order to dissect distinct roles for receptor plasticity in memory induction and expression, we experimentally probed several time points during associative appetitive memory formation. First, we probed 30-min memory following KC block to invariantly interfere with the memory acquisition and not the retrieval stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Second, we probed immediate and 3-hr memory performance following receptor knockdown to distinguish between memory induction and memory expression requirements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Third, we investigate the time course of receptor dynamics during memory expression following memory induction with a resolution of 5 to 10-min intervals after artificial training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The overarching picture indicates that, indeed, directly following training, memory induction requires α5. Subsequently, at the resolution of minutes, regulation of α2 levels contributes to memory expression. While we cannot resolve the temporal time course at the level of T-maze behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) or FRAP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) below several minutes, our in vivo training data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggests that α2 requirement already becomes apparent within 1 min after training.</p><p>We show that familiarity learning, a specific form of habituation encoded at a higher-order integration center, the MBs, can take place when knocking down α2 nAChR subunits in α’3 MBONs in principle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), however, at clearly decreased efficacy and only after several trials. We speculate that the observation of memories still being expressed per se in this context could be explained by redundancies with α1 or other subunits (but see heterogeneous localization and enrichment in different MB compartments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Redundancies could also explain why we partially observe functional phenotypes after knockdown of individual subunits but only moderate structural changes. We would also like to point out that subunits we did not identify absolutely as required for memory expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) in this study could nonetheless partake in distinct phases of plasticity processes.</p><p>In the context of both familiarity learning and appetitive conditioning, odor exposure induces increased α2 subunit dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) accompanying postsynaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hattori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), while not or mildly affecting α5 subunits (for familiarity learning). Therefore, the same basic mechanisms, odor-induced α2 receptor dynamics, seem to express two opposed plastic outcomes in the context of associative and non-associative memories and contribute to different learning rules across MB compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso and Rubin, 2016</xref>). We speculate that α2 dynamics induced by odor in the M4/6 dendrites could be reminiscent of dark currents in the vertebrate visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagins et al., 1970</xref>), allowing for rapid adaptation with low levels of synaptic noise. Receptor exchange at the level of M4/6 dendrites would actually take place when no associations are formed and stalled when DANs (triggered by sugar) are simultaneously active with KCs (triggered by odor). Indeed, repeated OCT stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) led to a facilitation of calcium transients (potentially corresponding to an increase of receptor incorporation), while depression (in this case likely to be mediated by removal of receptors, but see above) is triggered by paired training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, at the level of the α’3 compartments, odor activates both MBONs and DANs. Here, the plasticity rule would be reversed. Synaptic depression is accompanied by actively changing the receptor composite. We speculate that such plasticity could function reminiscent of mechanisms observed for climbing fiber-induced depression of parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ito, 2001</xref>). However, whether increased dynamics can be translated to more incorporation or removal of α2-type receptors, or depending on the plasticity rule both, will require high-resolution imaging experiments in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Are cholinergic and glutamatergic synapses interchangeable?</title><p>Our study fuels the question of how unique properties of individual neurotransmitter systems at synapses are. While dopamine signaling is remarkably conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates, cholinergic and glutamatergic systems appear, now more than before (with this study), somewhat interchangeable. While vertebrates (but also evolutionarily distant <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>), for instance, use acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and store memories predominantly at glutamatergic synapses, it is the other way around in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other invertebrates, such as <italic>Sepia (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shomrat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owald and Sigrist, 2009</xref>). Now we show that, at cholinergic synapses, α5 and α2 subunits, at least to a certain extent, behave in a potentially comparable way to NMDARs and AMPARs at glutamatergic synapses during postsynaptic plasticity which underlies memory storage. In this context, we offer several lines of evidence that invertebrates utilize postsynaptic plasticity during memory storage.</p><p>We therefore propose that, across phyla, postsynaptic plasticity, with the propensity to store memories and adapt network function plastically, can take place regardless of neurotransmitter identity.</p><p>One key difference between the dendritic arbors of the MBONs analyzed (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>) in this study compared to dendrites of glutamatergic neurons in vertebrates, is a lack of anatomical spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>). Without spines, how can input specificity be preserved at MBON postsynaptic densities? KC output to MBON input analysis of the recently published fly hemibrain connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>; neuprint.org; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clements et al., 2020</xref>) suggests that, at the ultrastructural level, MBON postsynaptic densities are separated spatially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>). Compartmentalization could therefore be mediated by, for instance, biochemical separation of PSDs. Importantly, input-specific plasticity has been shown to be inducible in non-spiny neurons in vertebrates, with diffusion barriers established, e.g., through calcium buffers, between postsynaptic densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Mushroom body (MB) output connectomics (<bold>a</bold>) Example MB output neuron (MBON; here: M6) with pre- and postsynapses labeled.</title><p>(<bold>b</bold>) Reconstructed example synapses from electron microscopic (EM) volume (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neuprint.org/">neuprint.org</ext-link>): two different Kenyon cells (KCs) connect to the same MBON on the postsynaptic side.

Indeed, we find that single presynaptic KC release sites that innervate MBON dendrites can also target other MBONs and/or other postsynaptic targets simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c–g</xref>). Plasticity confined to single postsynaptic densities innervated by a KC terminal could therefore change the weight of transmission for one target (e.g. MBONs involved in memory storage, such as M4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Owald et al., 2015</xref>), while not changing the weight of the connection to other targets (e.g. MBONs not involved in a specific action or other targets of non-MBON identity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10h</xref>). It should be noted that this architecture does not exclude presynaptic plasticity mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stahl et al., 2022</xref>; for instance, following aversive conditioning). Indeed, we would speculate that synaptic connections can be subdivided into distinct compartments on both the pre- and the postsynaptic side, potentially through transsynaptic molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owald and Sigrist, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tang et al., 2016</xref>), allowing for fine-tuned and target-dependent changes of parameters within either side of a synapse.</p><p>Together, we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) in which α5 subunit containing receptors could mediate the early phase of postsynaptic memory storage, and we speculate this could lead to elevated postsynaptic calcium flux (not addressed in this study). Concurrent events see changed dynamics of the α2 receptor. Nicotinic receptor subunits hereby could interact with adaptor proteins to bind to Dlg, reminiscent to what is known for AMPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Won et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, we identify elevated α2 subunit dynamics in the context of associative and non-associative memory expression. Increased α2 subunit dynamics in both cases are triggered by odor application. At the level of M4/6, suppressed dynamics would correspond to synaptic depression, while at the level of α’3 MBONs increased dynamics may result in postsynaptic depression. Therefore, different learning rules could govern the incorporation or exchange or mobilization of receptors in or out of synapses. The precise molecular and biophysical parameters underlying these plasticity rules are currently unknown and will need to be addressed in the future. One option could include potential exchange of α2 subunits for a receptor complex with higher calcium permeability.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with the current MB skew model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>), where the summed MBON output will determine an animal’s choice. However, we add an additional layer, already at the MBON input site. Changes do not happen at the presynaptic compartment only but potentially at both synaptic compartments. Thus, the power to store (potentially conflicting) information separately at either the pre- or postsynaptic site, equips the system with additional flexibility. How precisely pre- to postsynaptic and post- to presynaptic signaling is regulated will need to be addressed in the future but will likely involve transsynaptic signaling routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owald and Sigrist, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tang et al., 2016</xref>).

Photobleaching was accomplished using focused, high intensity laser exposure for ~1 min. Analysis of fluorescence recovery was performed using FIJI. ROIs were manually selected, and the percent recovery fluorescence was calculated by subtraction of the post-bleaching baseline fluorescence and division by the pre-bleaching baseline fluorescence. To fit the inverse exponential decay that is expected for FRAP data, we first inverted the percent fluorescence recovery values by subtracting them from 1 and then log-transformed the resulting values. These log-transformed values were used in a linear mixed effects model without intercept using the interaction between condition and time as fixed effect - to determine condition-specific differences of the recovery kinetics - and time as random effect (R package lme4). A linear mixed effect model was used to appropriately model repeated measures within animals. By inverting and log-transforming the fluorescence recovery values, this approach is equivalent to fitting an inverted exponential decay function. For plotting, all values including regression coefficients were back-transformed to the original scale. Significance of recovery of individual conditions was assessed using the regression coefficients of the condition-time interaction of the linear mixed model. Differences of recovery between pairs of conditions were tested using pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means of the linear mixed model (R package emmeans).

The head capsule and sheath were removed in carbogenated solution (103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM N-Tris, 10 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, 7 mM sucrose, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 295 mOsm, pH 7.3) with forceps. The brain was subsequently perfused with carbogenated solution containing TTX (2 µM; 20 ml/10 min flow speed) and imaged using an Olympus MX51WI wide field microscope with a ×40 Olympus LUMPLFLN objective and an Andor iXON Ultra camera controlled by Solis software. An Olympus U25ND25 light filter was placed in the beam path to minimize baseline CsChrimson activation. A custom designed glass microcapillary was loaded with uncarbongenated solution containing 0.1 mM acetylcholine and maneuvered to the M6 dendrites. The injection pressure of a P25-1-900 picospritzer was calibrated between 3 and 8 psi (depending on initial calcium responses). Each local acetylcholine application spanned 15 ms with a 4 s inter-injection interval.</p><p>Three pulses of acetylcholine followed by a 2–3-min break were recorded after which the optogenetic response was assessed by applying 2 s red light pulses with an inter-red light-interval of 4 s. Three acetylcholine pulses were recorded followed by either five acetylcholine injections, five red light pulses, or both paired. For paired training, both stimuli began simultaneously and the acetylcholine injection lasted for 15 ms (and gave rise to a calcium transients typically lasting &gt;1 s, please see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), while the paired red light pulse lasts for 2 s, allowing for maximal temporal overlap. This process was repeated 5×, with a 4-s break between trials. Following the training trial, three final acetylcholine test injections were applied after 1 min. For analysis, the first of the three acetylcholine injections was always discarded because of initial dilution of the capillary tip, and the remaining two peak intensities were averaged.</p><p>All peaks within an experiment were quantified relative to the fluorescence baseline that we calculated for pre- and post-training acetylcholine responses. Baselines were set independently for each pre- and post-training recording using the polynomial interpolation function in NOSA (neuro-optical signal analysis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oltmanns et al., 2020</xref>). For investigating α2 knockdown, only the paired condition was tested.</p><p>For controls not expressing CsChrimson, we used VT1211-Gal4 driving UAS-GCaMP6f, instead of MB011B, for technical reasons. This was combined with either expression of R58E02-LexA or LexAop-CsChrimson<sup>tdTomato</sup>. Only paired training was investigated in this context.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Excitability of KC axons</title><p>To test whether KC axons were excited by focal acetylcholine injections at the level of M4/6 dendrite innervation, either UAS-SynaptoPhluorin or UAS-GCaMP6f was expressed under the control of OK107-Gal4. Following the acetylcholine injection experiment, the capillary was exchanged with a capillary containing the same solution with additional 300–400 mM KCl, to evaluate tissue health (not shown for GCaMP6f imaging). To pick up potentially small changes, we increased the injection pressure to 8–14 Psi and the injection time to 150–225 ms (GCaMP6f, 8 s inter-injection interval and three consecutive injections) and 300–525 ms (SynaptoPhluorin, with an 8 s inter-injection interval and three consecutive injections).</p><p>Images were analyzed using NOSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raccuglia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oltmanns et al., 2020</xref>) and GraphPad Prism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed as stated in the previous method sections and figure legends.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Simon G Sprecher (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please revise the manuscript focusing on and removing non-essential parts to improve readability (eg add explanations where needed for non-experts, fly genotypes,…). Also, provide a better scholarly referenced background into past work and literature. It felt sometimes that too much is trying to be said, without sufficient depth.</p><p>2. An important point that we would want you to address is the second point of Reviewer 3's list of comments where they ask to compare the difference between paired and unpaired odour responses during the test. Please also consider points 3, 5, and 7 of the same reviewer, but they may be addressed textually.</p><p>3. We ask you to include the necessary details regarding the CRISPR lines you included as &quot;unpublished&quot;. This paper will effectively publish them.</p><p>4. All other points, including the clarifications asked for by reviewer 2 can be addressed textually.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall the manuscript describes an important advance, both experimentally as well as conceptually. However, there are a few points that I think should be taken into account:</p><p>– To follow the experiments perform I feel it is important to describe in the Results section the genotypes used in the experiments performed. This can also be done in brackets to not disrupt the flow of the text. It is clear that some experiments may use complicated genotypes, however, I feel it's important that at least the logic of the experiments is apparent from the text (which Gal4, with UAS, which LexA or temp/opto line in which condition temp/light).</p><p>– An important aspect of the manuscript relates to the differential use, localization, or expression of nAChR subunits. While the knock-down experiments described in figure 1 are easy to follow there is no information on how the expression was assessed, apart from the note that CRISPR was used as unpublished data. The authors should decide if they either want to include this set of experiments and then publish these lines or if they prefer not to publish these lines, but should then exclude this set of experiments. Without information about the locus, what has been modified, and what impact this may have it is not possible to assess these experiments properly. I am admittedly a bit dissatisfied by this section, particularly because of its central position in the logic.</p><p>– The explant optogenetic/thermogenetic/pharmacology experiments are intriguing and – to be frank- quite refreshing. While the authors rightfully point out some limitations am sure the authors are aware of the points that could have been addressed. I do not feel that it is necessary to perform additional experiments here (though of course I'd be curious about the results), however, I would encourage the authors to at least highlight some of the obvious steps that will quite certainly allow probing their model (e.g receptors, dopamine, etc).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As somebody not in the learning and memory field, nor with expertise in the structure and function of the insect mushroom body, I cannot provide a very helpful critique of their specific experiments. However, there are several points, from an outside point of view, which may help improve the presentation. In no particular order:</p><p>1) I think the authors should be more precise and explanatory in the terms they use. For example, what is the difference between relative familiarity with odors (non-associative familiarity learning) and habituation? Similarly, it would help if the paradigms for immediate, intermediate/3 hours, induction, and expression of memories are more clearly explained (perhaps even through schematics in one of the figures. This becomes important when they try to discuss these different forms with activities of different receptor subunits and at different MB compartments.</p><p>2) A schematic of the MB would definitely help, with a focus on the cellular aspects and the different compartments. Their broad drawings of KC and MBONs do not help, since the work emphasizes the sub-cellular nature of receptor dynamics in specific compartments with functional specializations. Similarly, in Supplementary Figure 9, they provide EM data, but this would be helped by a cellular level that shows soma, axons/dendritic projections.</p><p>3) How is synaptic weight defined? And how is their plasticity defined, since they use calcium transients as opposed to actual structural changes in the synapse? Many use GCamp to monitor calcium transient changes – do all these then imply &quot;plasticity&quot;?</p><p>4) There are many cases where different terms are used, and it is not clear to what extent these are similar words for the same process or different processes. For example, in line 272 there is this: &quot;…postsynaptic sensitivity can change independently of the presynapse. Indeed, the observed postsynaptic potentiation was not observed…, consistent with postsynaptic plasticity…&quot;. Thus the word postsynaptic is followed by three different terms (sensitivity, potentiation, and plasticity). This is difficult for non-experts to understand. As a further example, in line 342, it would help if they explained &quot;pre-potentiated synaptic transmission&quot; versus &quot;baseline transmission&quot;.</p><p>5) The Discussion part is divided into seven subheadings---this seems a bit lot in terms of what the major discussion points are. Seven major take-home messages seem like a lot to emphasize for a single paper. It may help to make this part a bit more concise.</p><p>6) The supplement to Figure 9 (EM data) has nothing to do with Figure 9 itself (a speculative model). Maybe the EM data can be put as part of regular Figure 9.</p><p>All in all, I think the paper is very difficult to understand for non-experts because there are so many different terms used and it's not clear what the precise differences are, whether these are fundamentally different concepts or just different terms for similar things. Also, there are numerous very precise statements and not enough references at appropriate places to back them up. For example, line 504: &quot;It also argues against the assumption that appetitive and aversive memories will necessarily use the same molecular machinery to store information. Findings in the past, predominantly based on investigating aversive memories have been generalized to learning per se&quot;. On which/whose works are such assumptions based?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While the results are certainly interesting, I have a number of points for the authors to clarify before publication:</p><p>– The authors sort of misrepresent the field, as if the presynaptic mechanism in Kenyon cells explained all for the induction of olfactory associative memory (e.g. the beginning of the Results [L125-]). This 'presynaptic dogma' is largely based on the dispensability of Kenyon cell output during training. However, the relevant papers were published more than 20 years ago (Dubnau, Nature 2001; McGuire et al., Science 2001), and subsequent studies repeatedly reported data supporting the necessity of downstream circuits for memory induction (e.g. Krashes et al., Neuron 2007; Yamazaki et al. Cell Rep 2018). Other than these, results like the requirement of MBON output during or right after training and the importance of plasticity-related proteins therein have been published to date, all pointing to the importance of interaction with downstream circuits during training (e.g. Pai et al., PNAS 2013; Ichinose et al. Curr Biol 2021). Furthermore, live imaging strongly suggested (or claimed) for the postsynaptic mechanism (e.g. Hancock et al., Sci Rep 2022). The authors should acknowledge these studies, and modify the old presynaptic dogma.</p><p>– Imaging data on the nAChR-a2-dependent plasticity in MBONs (Figure 5) are crucial for the conclusion of this paper. The authors compared odour responses before/after training, and claimed the a2-dependent postsynaptic plasticity based on no significant differences (Figure 5h). This interpretation can be confounded, since the odour responses in these neurons drift with repeated stimulation, and this drift is different between the control and knock-down groups (Figure 5d-f). The authors need to compare the difference between paired and unpaired odour responses during the test (post-training).</p><p>– DAN activation and ACh injection at the same time caused potentiation of ACh-evoked calcium response, independent of KC (presynaptic) input (Figure 3h). On the other hand, odour response of M6 MBONs after learning showed depression (Owald et al., Neuron 2014; Figure 5g). In the light of learning-dependent depression (Figure 5), the authors should discuss and rationalize what this potentiation in Figure 3 would represent. In addition, I must point out that these 'incoherent' plasticity results are based on the calcium responses of different MBONs (M6 and M4 for Figure 3 and 5, respectively). Authors should either do the same experiment with M4 in Figure 3 (and/or M6 in Figure 5), or tone down the conclusion that the major plasticity resides in the postsynaptic sites.</p><p>– Odour-evoked calcium response was significantly increased upon knocking down the a5 subunit in M4/6 MBONs (Figure 5b and c). Why increase upon downregulating nAChR? Indeed Barnstedt et al., in Neuron 2016 showed a reduction of odour responses in the same cells. The authors should provide an explanation for this discrepancy.</p><p>– The storyline is based on different, seemingly complementary experimental batteries. However, the choices of experimental conditions are nearly random. In addition to the different cell types mentioned above, time points of measurements are very inconsistent; the behavioural experiments in Figure 1 use 30-min memory; Figure 2 uses either 3-min or 3-hr memory; imaging experiments measure immediate phenomena (Figures 3 and 5), and FRAP deals with yet other time points (Figure 6). According to their behavioural data, requirements of nAChR depend on time points after training (Figure 2). The authors should have ideally tested all under the same condition, especially if they seriously try to understand in vivo mechanisms underlying appetitive memory induction and expression (cf. title), At the very least, they should provide justification for these different conditions.</p><p>– The FRAP experiment in Figure 6 showed the reduced mobility of the a2 subunit when pairing odour and DA. A more logical explanation is needed: what this receptor mobility represents; how the reduced receptor dynamics are related to postsynaptic depression upon associative learning; why fast or slow receptor replacements should lead to different response sensitivity. In addition, receptor dynamics upon simultaneous odour+DA stimulation look just the sum of separate stimulations. If so, it may not be associative plasticity.</p><p>– In the FRAP exp (Figure 6), they bleached the GFP signal multiple times in the same sample. As the recovery is very minor (less than 10% at max), the order of the stimulations should have been randomized. Besides that, this repeated photobleaching should cause serious phototoxicity that affects their results. The authors should provide additional control experiments and/or compelling justification.</p><p>– If they promote the importance of the postsynaptic mechanism, shouldn't they also try to measure the effect of dopamine receptor knock-down in MBONs on appetitive memory? Along this line, the authors should acknowledge several papers in the field, reporting the defective appetitive and aversive memories of dopamine receptor mutants can be fully rescued in presynaptic Kenyon cells (Kim et al. J Neurosci 2007; Qin et al. Curr Biol 2009). They should also provide discussion on the role of postsynaptic dopamine input for memory induction.</p><p>– In Figure S3h, the authors showed the requirement of a2 for postsynaptic plasticity in Figure 3. As this result is important to support the postsynaptic mechanism, the authors should consider presenting it in the main figure.</p><p>– This article would gain more impact by focusing more. The main scope of this paper is about the postsynaptic plasticity for associative learning (cf. title), but they went on to show less relevant results in Figure 7 and Figure 8, explaining a mechanism of non-associative plasticity. The authors can consider reporting these results elsewhere. Alternatively, they should provide a consequent narrative to perform experiments in Figure 7 and 8.</p><p>– In my understanding, Figure 4 supports the epistatic relationship between nicotinic a5 and a2 receptors, the former being upstream of the latter via Dlg. But if so, why do they overall exhibit different phenotypes, even if they are in the same pathway (Figure 9)?</p><p>– Too much technical and procedure detail in the result part, e.g. from line 389, they should simplify the text.</p><p>– Figure 4d: it is a little weird to see a5 knockdown reduces a2 expression more than the direct knockdown of a2. The authors need to provide reasonable interpretation.</p><p>– Figure 6e: The authors need to justify the linear regression model for FRAP data.</p><p>– Figure 6d: What happens if they wait longer than 20 min? this is relevant to behavioral data as the a2 phenotype is only observable after 3 hrs (Figure 2).</p><p>– L73 &quot;memory storage modes are functionally comparable or evolutionarily conserved.&quot;</p><p>I am not sure what the authors try to say.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80445.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Similarly, it would help if the paradigms for immediate, intermediate/3 hours, induction, and expression of memories are more clearly explained (perhaps even through schematics in one of the figures. This becomes important when they try to discuss these different forms with activities of different receptor subunits and at different MB compartments.</p></disp-quote><p>These are very valid and important criticisms and we thank the reviewer for pointing theses out.</p><p>1) Difference between habituation and familiarity learning: First of all, familiarity learning can indeed be seen as a specific form of habituation. To our understanding the neural processes underlying habituation can take place at several steps of the olfactory</p><p>pathway, including sensory neurons or projection neurons (that connect sensory neurons and mushroom-body intrinsic Kenyon cells). Familiarity learning, however takes place at the neural center that ‘stores’ memories. This becomes important in light of the overall mushroom body signalling logic. First, odor information is expanded from 150 projection neurons to approximately 2200 Kenyon cells per hemisphere. Each odor is represented by activity of approximately 5% of the Kenyon cells. This creates a large odor coding space, allowing for associating the odor with positive or negative reinforcers (or contexts), but also for storing information about the odor. For instance, is the odor ‘novel’ and could potentially come with a risk, or familiar? These memories, appetitive, aversive or e.g. familiarity are stored as synaptic weight changes between KCs and MBONs and prevail for certain time periods ranging from minute to days. At this step information is condensed, with the 2200 Kenyon cells converging on roughly 40 MBONs. In a simple (likely too simple!) model of downstream integration, the output of the MBON channels is summed up. Depending on the compartment the MBON gets input from, activity of the MBONs can promote approach or avoidance behaviour.</p><p>Therefore, information on novelty is likely integrated with prior experiences of encountering an odour in the context of an aversive or appetitive stimulus and all these ‘learnt’ factors are integrated allowing the animal to make a decision on which behaviour to select. So, in our view, habituation is a broader term, where plasticity can take place at several synaptic relay stations, including sensory neurons. If plasticity takes place at sensory neurons (for instance to ‘protect’ the system from sensory overload), this will affect all output channels of the MBs including those responsible for storing appetitive and aversive memories. Familiarity learning (as described by Hattori et al., 2017), however will affect a specific MBON output channel. Or as they put it: ‘The transition from novelty to familiarity is associated with suppression of neural responses in higher brain centers that appears distinct from intrinsic or sensory adaptation.’</p><p>To make this more clear, we now write: line 82ff: ‘The weights of Kenyon cells (KCs) to MB output neuron (MBON) synapses are modulated by dopaminergic neurons (DANs), which anatomically divide the MBs into at least 15 functional compartments, where information is stored on appetitive and aversive associations, in addition to non-associative information, such as the relative familiarity of an odor5,7-12,15,22,23, a distinct form of habituation. Summed up5, output from the individual MB compartments will give rise to specific behaviors, weighing up appetitive and aversive associations as well as, for instance, the familiarity of a stimulus.’</p><p>line 436ff: ‘Our data so far suggest that regulation of α2 subunits downstream of α5 are involved in postsynaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying appetitive, but not aversive memory storage. Besides associative memories, non-associative memories, such as familiarity learning, a form of habituation, are also stored at the level of <italic>Drosophila</italic> MBs. We next asked whether postsynaptic plasticity expressed through α5 and α2 subunit interplay, was exclusive to appetitive memory storage, or would represent a more generalizable mechanism that could underlie other forms of learning represented in the MBs.’</p><p>line 679ff: ‘We show that familiarity learning, a specific form of habituation that takes place at a higher order integration center, the mushroom bodies, can take place when knocking down α2 nAChR subunits in α’3 MBONs in principle (Figure 8), however, at clearly decreased efficacy and only after several trials. We speculate that the observation of memories still being expressed per se in this context, could be explained by redundancies with α1 or other subunits (but see heterogeneous localization and enrichment in different MB compartments, Figure 4). Redundancies could also explain why we partially observe functional phenotypes after knock-down of individual subunits, but only moderate structural changes. We also would like to point out that subunits we did not identify as absolutely required for memory expression (Figure 2) in this study could nonetheless partake in distinct phases of plasticity processes.’’</p><p>As a more general comment: we actually think that the field is indeed sometimes missing clear cut definitions – nomenclature between ‘synapse physiology’ and ‘psychology’ does not always fully match, as the ‘precision’ of localizing the mechanistic origins of observed phenomena is dimensions apart. Also, the read-outs between behaviour and physiology can be quite different. At the behavioural level, we’d agree that familiarity learning is difficult to distinguish from the broader definition of habituation. At the circuit and synapse physiological level the site of memory storage and change is decisive, which could actually warrant categorizing these separately (at least in our opinion).</p><p>2) Paradigms/schematics for induction/expression of memories: We have followed the reviewer’s advice and now include redesigned schematics for figures 1-3 and 5-8. In addition, we have added an own section in our summary figure, to visualize why each paradigm and time point was chosen. We also have added the following paragraph to</p><p>the discussion: line 664ff: ‘In order to dissect distinct roles for receptor plasticity in memory induction and expression, we experimentally probed several time points during associative appetitive memory formation. First, we probed 30 minute memory following KC block, to invariantly interfere with the memory acquisition and not the retrieval stage (Figure 1). Second, we probed immediate and 3 hour memory performance following receptor knock-down, to distinguish between memory induction and memory expression requirements (Figure 2). Third, we investigate the time course of receptor dynamics during memory expression following memory induction with a resolution of 10 minute intervals after artificial training (Figure 6, 7). The overarching picture indicates that, indeed, directly following training, memory induction requires α5. Subsequently, at the resolution of minutes, regulation of α2 levels contributes to memory expression. While we cannot resolve the temporal time course at the level of T- maze behavior (Figure 2) or FRAP experiments (Figure 6) below several minutes, our in vivo training data (Figure 5) suggests that α2 requirement already becomes apparent within 1 minute after training.’</p><p>We hope to have now presented our experimental design and rational more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A schematic of the MB would definitely help, with a focus on the cellular aspects and the different compartments. Their broad drawings of KC and MBONs do not help, since the work emphasizes the sub-cellular nature of receptor dynamics in specific compartments with functional specializations. Similarly, in Supplementary Figure 9, they provide EM data, but this would be helped by a cellular level that shows soma, axons/dendritic projections.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this great idea. We have redesigned our scheme in Figure 9 and now emphasize the subcellular level (mid panels). We also show an MBON overview as suggested as panel (a) of the new Figure 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How is synaptic weight defined? And how is their plasticity defined, since they use calcium transients as opposed to actual structural changes in the synapse? Many use GCamp to monitor calcium transient changes – do all these then imply &quot;plasticity&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We define synaptic weight as ‘activity-dependent modification of the strength or efficacy of synaptic transmission at preexisting synapses’ (Citri and Malenka, 2007). As Citri and Malenka note in the same paper this has been: ‘proposed to play a central role in the capacity of the brain to incorporate transient experiences into persistent memory traces’. Synaptic plasticity therefore refers to a lasting change in synaptic efficacy that happens in response to a certain event (e.g. paired odor-evoked activity with dopamine release). We have reworked the text to be more precise on this account.</p><p>We have added several definitions throughout the text to make this more clear, e.g. :</p><p>Line 58ff: ‘The efficacy of synaptic transmission, also referred to as synaptic weight, can be increased or decreased following changes in neural activity profiles or concurrent action of neuromodulators, such as dopamine. Resulting changes to how synapses relay information underly synaptic plasticity, which is widely believed to be the basis of memory storage1-3. While, it is generally accepted that synaptic plasticity can serve as memory substrate from flies to humans, it is unclear to what degree neurophysiological and molecular principles underlying synaptic plasticity are evolutionarily conserved.’</p><p>And line 68ff: ‘Furthermore, it is widely established that invertebrate nervous systems utilize presynaptic plasticity (with plasticity referring to changes leading to either a strengthening (potentiation) or a weakening (depression) of synaptic transmission and the rearrangement or exchange of synaptic molecules underlying changed transmission) for storing memories, while the degree to which postsynaptic plasticity can be used is less clear.’</p><p>According to our definition changes in the strength of synapses, i.e. the amount of information transmitted at a connection would inherently underly a form of plasticity. However, depending on the type of synapse and way information is stored, synaptic plasticity can be longer lived (minutes to days) or shorter (seconds time scale). The changes reported in our manuscript deal with synaptic weight changes immediately after training that at the molecular level appear to persist at the minutes (to potentially hours) timescale.</p><p>Would every change in synaptic calcium transients be equal to a form of plasticity? We would argue that especially if triggered by an event (in our case: applied protocols that lead to a learning process) and if the change is lasting, yes. Plasticity, in our understanding, will always imply a change in functional connectivity that can alter the outcome of neural computation. We have reworked the text and only refer to plasticity where this definition is met.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are many cases where different terms are used, and it is not clear to what extent these are similar words for the same process or different processes. For example, in line 272 there is this: &quot;…postsynaptic sensitivity can change independently of the presynapse. Indeed, the observed postsynaptic potentiation was not observed…, consistent with postsynaptic plasticity…&quot;. Thus the word postsynaptic is followed by three different terms (sensitivity, potentiation, and plasticity). This is difficult for non-experts to understand. As a further example, in line 342, it would help if they explained &quot;pre-potentiated synaptic transmission&quot; versus &quot;baseline transmission&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for spotting this. We have carefully revised the text and made sure to be more accurate.</p><p>For example, we have now reworked the sentences highlighted to:</p><p>line 294ff: ‘However, our proof of principle experiments demonstrate that postsynaptic plasticity at the level of MBONs can take place independently of the presynapses of the KCs. Intriguingly, we did not observe changes in calcium transient magnitudes when knocking-down α2 (UASnAChRRNAi) in M4/6 (MB011B-Split Gal4; Figure 3h), which is consistent with postsynaptic plasticity being linked to the requirement of nicotinic receptors in memory storage.’</p><p>And</p><p>line 366ff: ‘Odor responses following α5 knock-down (VT1211-Gal4&gt;UAS-α5RNAi), however, clearly depressed after multiple odor exposures (Figure 5f), indicating that loss of α5, in comparison to the controls, actually leads to synapses being potentiated (synaptic weights are already high) from the start, even prior to the application of odors.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Discussion part is divided into seven subheadings---this seems a bit lot in terms of what the major discussion points are.

This 'presynaptic dogma' is largely based on the dispensability of Kenyon cell output during training. However, the relevant papers were published more than 20 years ago (Dubnau, Nature 2001; McGuire et al., Science 2001), and subsequent studies repeatedly reported data supporting the necessity of downstream circuits for memory induction (e.g. Krashes et al. Neuron 2007; Yamazaki et al. Cell Rep 2018). Other than these, results like the requirement of MBON output during or right after training and the importance of plasticity-related proteins therein have been published to date, all pointing to the importance of interaction with downstream circuits during training (e.g. Pai et al. PNAS 2013; Ichinose et al. Curr Biol 2021). Furthermore, live imaging strongly suggested (or claimed) for the postsynaptic mechanism (e.g. Hancock et al. Sci Rep 2022). The authors should acknowledge these studies, and modify the old presynaptic dogma.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their advice and would like to apologize for over-emphasizing the presynaptic dogma, and in particular for not mentioning some crucial references. We have now toned down the ‘presynaptic dogma’ and acknowledge the suggested studies along with a couple of further references that we, after careful review, felt needed inclusion. The reviewer is totally right that we previously missed to cite the study by Yamazaki et al., demonstrating the requirement for γ KC output during training – we now cite this study and have toned down our claim.</p><p>We have now modified the text accordingly throughout. Here are some examples of the changed text addressing the reviewer’s advice:</p><p>Results section, line 136ff: ‘If the postsynapse need not see the neurotransmitter during training, it would likely be dispensable for memory induction. One key argument in favor of exclusively presynaptic memory storage mechanisms in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is based on experiments suggesting that blocking KC or KC subset output selectively during learning leads to unaltered or mildly changed memory performance<sup>28-31</sup>. However, other studies have reported memory impairments following KC subset or downstream circuit element block during training<sup>29,39,40</sup>. Moreover, protein synthesis was shown to be required at the level of MBONs for long-term memory formation<sup>18,41,42</sup>.’</p><p>Discussion, line 522ff: ‘Moreover, several studies indicated that block of KCs during learning does not interfere with memory performance<sup>28,30,31</sup>. However, other studies blocking KC subsets did find impairments<sup>29,39,52</sup> in the context of short-term appetitive memory, while downstream circuit elements have been implicated in appropriate memory formation <sup>18, 41, 42</sup>.’</p><p>And</p><p>line 539ff: ‘However, a recent study investigating postsynaptic calcium transients across MBcompartments could be in line with postsynaptic modifications occurring following aversivetraining in some MB output compartments 54. Additionally, the requirement of MBON signaling has been demonstrated, particularly in the context of longer-term memory storage<sup>18,40-42</sup>. Thus, we do not wish to exclude a potential involvement of postsynaptic plasticity in aversive memory formation per se. On the contrary, it is conceivable that aversive memories also could have an appetitive component (release from punishment).’</p><p>While we are very thankful to the reviewer for pointing out that we did not cover the literature to the needed extent, and do recognize the clear need for altering the ‘presynaptic dogma’, we would also like to briefly mention that, to our knowledge, our manuscript is the first to actually address modes of postsynaptic memory storage in the MB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Imaging data on the nAChR-a2-dependent plasticity in MBONs (Figure 5) are crucial for the conclusion of this paper. The authors compared odour responses before/after training, and claimed the a2-dependent postsynaptic plasticity based on no significant differences (Figure 5h). This interpretation can be confounded, since the odour responses in these neurons drift with repeated stimulation, and this drift is different between the control and knock-down groups (Figure 5d-f). The authors need to compare the difference between paired and unpaired odour responses during the test (post-training).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have repeated all experiments, this time</p><p>including unpaired controls. They are now included as part of Figure 5 (analyses of area under the curve) and Supplementary Figure 5 (analyses of peak responses). Synaptic depression is only observed in control animals using paired training and in none of the other groups.</p><p>To further improve readability and facilitate comparisons to odor responses without any learning protocols, we have decided to now present MCH responses in the main figure and octanol responses in the supplement (which also fits to the data shown in Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– DAN activation and ACh injection at the same time caused potentiation of ACh-evoked calcium response, independent of KC (presynaptic) input (Figure 3h). On the other hand, odour response of M6 MBONs after learning showed depression (Owald et al., Neuron 2014; Figure 5g). In the light of learning-dependent depression (Figure 5), the authors should discuss and rationalize what this potentiation in Figure 3 would represent. In addition, I must point out that these 'incoherent' plasticity results are based on the calcium responses of different MBONs (M6 and M4 for Figure 3 and 5, respectively). Authors should either do the same experiment with M4 in Figure 3 (and/or M6 in Figure 5), or tone down the conclusion that the major plasticity resides in the postsynaptic sites.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct: for technical reasons (explant imaging with neurotransmitter application and optogenetic stimulation), we were only able to perform the proof-of-principle experiments presented in Figure 3 in M6. In Figure 5 and in Owald et al. 2015, the observed depression was observed in M4. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now expanded our discussion on these findings that we think should be taken as proof-of-principle for the ability to induce plasticity without the presynapse per se only. We now explicitly refer to this in several passages of the discussion as well as the fact that we cannot apply the findings to M4 and, for example, now write:</p><p>line 595ff: ‘It should also be noted that M4, which shows depression (Figure 5), and M6 have common but also distinct physiological roles, for instance during aversive memory extinction<sup>13</sup>. Besides that, different temporal requirements for M4 and M6 memory expression have been reported<sup>11</sup>. It is therefore possible that physiological changes in the context of appetitive learning lead to different plasticity profiles in M4 and M6 neurons respectively, or that initial potentiation over time can be reverted to depression. As noted above, MBON drive is bidirectionally modifiable and has the propensity to both potentiate and depress<sup>7,11,17,26</sup>. It remains unclear, whether the applied protocols would elicit plasticity (and if so depression or facilitation) at the M4 dendrites, which is difficult to assess with our experimental design. In summary, the observed ex vivo plasticity trace (Figure 3) should solely be viewed as a proof of principle that postsynaptic (MBON) plasticity can take place without presynaptic (KC) contribution per se.’</p><p>and following the reviewer’s suggestion to tone down the conclusion on postsynaptic</p><p>contributions:</p><p>line 619ff: Previous studies have shown that loss of DopR (dDA1) causes aversive and</p><p>appetitive memory impairments<sup>59,60</sup>. Intriguingly, specifically re-expressing DopR in KCs rescued loss of both types of memory<sup>59</sup>. However, while the reported memory impairments in dopR deficient animals were strong for aversive memories, they were only partial for appetitive memories, indicating that appetitive memory traces could be mediated via other dopamine receptors at the MBON level. Future experiments will need to investigate which dopamine receptors are required at the level of the MBONs as well as the in vivo time course of dopaminergic signaling.</p><p>while we also state:</p><p>line 753ff: ‘It should be noted that this architecture does not exclude presynaptic plasticity mechanisms<sup>70</sup> (for instance following aversive conditioning). Indeed, we would speculate that synaptic connections can be subdivided into distinct compartments on both the pre- and the postsynaptic side, potentially through transsynaptic molecules<sup>67,71</sup>, allowing for fine-tuned and target-dependent changes of parameters within either side of a synapse.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Odour-evoked calcium response was significantly increased upon knocking down the a5 subunit in M4/6 MBONs (Figure 5b and c). Why increase upon downregulating nAChR? Indeed Barnstedt et al., in Neuron 2016 showed a reduction of odour responses in the same cells. The authors should provide an explanation for this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not having made this clear enough. In Barnstedt et al. we did not image</p><p>dendritic but axonal responses. While activity at the level of the axon is the decisive factor for what is transmitted downstream (particularly relevant when assessing the overall responses after learning), we here looked into dendritic response patterns. However, decreased axonal response can be derived from both increased or decreased excitation at the level of the dendrite due to potential synaptic interference (e.g., Stuart and Spruston, 2015).</p><p>In the Results section, we have now modified this section and state:</p><p>line 349ff: ‘We next focused on implications of α2 subunit knock-down on postsynaptic</p><p>function of M4/6 MBONs. Axonal calcium transients had previously been shown to be decreased following knock-down of α subunits<sup>4</sup>. However, depending on the overall topology of dendritic input sites, both increased or decreased postsynaptic drive could lead to changed dendritic integration properties or potential interference of synaptic inputs, resulting in reduced signal propagation<sup>50</sup>.</p><p>To directly test dendritic responses, we expressed UAS-GCaMP6f in M4/6 MBONs (VT1211-Gal4) (Figure 5a), and exposed the flies repeatedly to alternating puffs of the odors octanol (OCT) and MCH (Figure 5; Supplementary Figure 5).’</p><p>the discussion on this topic now reads:</p><p>line 586ff: ‘Of note, how difficult it can be to infer how dendrites compute and integrate all input channels is exemplified by the observation that high levels of odor-mediated dendritic activation after α5 knock-down (Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 5) appear to be translated to reduced axonal calcium transients4, effectively leading to decreased signal transduction within the MBON. MBONs do not appear to exhibit prominent spines on their dendrites<sup>23</sup> (but see section below: Are cholinergic and glutamatergic synapses interchangeable?). Therefore, increased dendritic activation could lead to a change in membrane resistance and result in synaptic interference.’</p><p>We would like to point-out that the presented experiments set up our in vivo imaging training under the microscope experiments. Only after knowing that the general responsiveness following knock-down of α2 was not gravely affected, were we able to perform the axonal imaging (we perform axonal imaging here to assess the integrated outcome of dendritic input) experiments shown in Figure 5k-n.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The storyline is based on different, seemingly complementary experimental batteries. However, the choices of experimental conditions are nearly random. In addition to the different cell types mentioned above, time points of measurements are very inconsistent; the behavioural experiments in Figure 1 use 30-min memory; Figure 2 uses either 3-min or 3-hr memory; imaging experiments measure immediate phenomena (Figures 3 and 5), and FRAP deals with yet other time points (Figure 6). According to their behavioural data, requirements of nAChR depend on time points after training (Figure 2). The authors should have ideally tested all under the same condition, especially if they seriously try to understand in vivo mechanisms underlying appetitive memory induction and expression (cf. title), At the very least, they should provide justification for these different conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not making the rationale for choosing these experimental settings clear enough and thank the reviewer for pointing us towards this. To make our experimental design clearer, we have now added a timeline showing the time points assessed and also point to the technical reasons to do so (revised Figure 9, bottom row). Furthermore, we now state in the discussion:</p><p>line 664ff: ‘In order to dissect distinct roles for receptor plasticity in memory induction and expression, we experimentally probed several time points during associative appetitive memory formation. First, we probed 30 minute memory following KC block, to invariantly interfere with the memory acquisition and not the retrieval stage (Figure 1). Second, we probed immediate and 3 hour memory performance following receptor knock-down, to distinguish between memory induction and memory expression requirements (Figure 2). Third, we investigate the time course of receptor dynamics during memory expression following memory induction with a resolution of 10 minute intervals after artificial training (Figure 6, 7). The overarching picture indicates that, indeed, directly following training, memory induction requires α5. Subsequently, at the resolution of minutes, regulation of α2 levels contributes to memory expression. While we cannot resolve the temporal time course at the level of T- maze behavior (Figure 2) or FRAP experiments (Figure 6) below several minutes, our in vivo training data (Figure 5) suggests that α2 requirement already becomes apparent within 1 minute after training.‘</p><p>For adding more clarity on experimental design, we have further reworked the text. For</p><p>example, we now state for Figure 1:</p><p>line 148ff: ‘We expressed the temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutant UAS-ShibireTS (Shi) at the level of KCs (R13F02-Gal4), trained animals at the restrictive temperature (32°C), and tested for memory performance at permissive temperature (23°C) 30 minutes later. These manipulations allowed us to interfere with the synaptic vesicle exo-endocycle specifically during conditioning, while reinstating neurotransmission afterwards: by choosing the 30 minute time point, we made sure to restore functional Dynamin and not to interfere with any process underlying memory retrieval.’</p><p>We have also redesigned our figures, to make clear which mushroom body output neuron we are studying for the individual experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The FRAP experiment in Figure 6 showed the reduced mobility of the a2 subunit when pairing odour and DA. A more logical explanation is needed: what this receptor mobility represents; how the reduced receptor dynamics are related to postsynaptic depression upon associative learning; why fast or slow receptor replacements should lead to different response sensitivity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point raised by the reviewer and to be frank, we would like to know the answer to this ourselves. However, as the reviewer might agree, the underlying experiments to address these questions are technically very challenging and we feel beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, we are planning to address these points in future experiments and hope to report on the results in due course.</p><p>We hope that our reworked model in Figure 9 now provides a more logical insight in the potential underlying mechanisms. At the moment, we would speculate (as mentioned we now highlight the options in our revised model in Figure 9) that the receptor in- or excorporation will happen through lateral diffusion between synaptic and extrasynaptic receptor populations (for synaptic spacing please see Figure 10b). In first experiments, we actually have probed whether we could observe fluorescence recovery following odor exposure after bleaching the entire dendritic area of the MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Indeed, in these experiments, we did not observe any recovery. Based on this, we, at the moment, would favour a lateral diffusion model over the second option (also highlighted in Figure 9): vesicular exocytosis.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>No recovery is observed after odor stimulation after bleaching of the full dendritic arbors.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80445-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We do take up related points in the discussion. For example, we state:</p><p>line 767ff: ‘At the level of M4/6, suppressed dynamics would correspond to synaptic depression, while at the level of α’3 MBONs increased dynamics may result in postsynaptic depression. Therefore, different learning rules could govern the incorporation or exchange or mobilization of receptors in or out of synapses. The precise molecular and biophysical parameters underlying these plasticity rules are currently unknown and will need to be addressed in the future. One option could include potential exchange of α2 subunits for a receptor complex with higher calcium permeability.’</p><p>And</p><p>line 692ff: ‘In the context of both familiarity learning and appetitive conditioning, odor exposure induces increased α2 subunit dynamics (Figure 6, 7) accompanying postsynaptic depression<sup>7,15</sup> (Figure 7), while not or mildly affecting α5 subunits (for familiarity learning). Therefore, the same basic mechanisms, odor-induced α2 receptor dynamics, seem to express two opposed plastic outcomes in the context of associative and non-associative memories and contribute to different learning rules across MB compartments<sup>22,63</sup>. We speculate that α2 dynamics induced by odor in the M4/6 dendrites could be reminiscent of dark currents in the vertebrate visual system<sup>64</sup> allowing for rapid adaptation with low levels of synaptic noise. Receptor exchange at the level of M4/6 dendrites would actually take place when no associations are formed and stalled when dopaminergic neurons (triggered by sugar) are simultaneously active with KCs (triggered by odor). Indeed, repeated Oct stimulation (Supplementary Figure 5) led to a facilitation of calcium transients (potentially corresponding to an increase of receptor incorporation), while depression (in this case likely to be mediated by removal of receptors, but see above) is triggered by paired training (Figure 5). In contrast, at the level of the α’3 compartments, odor activates both MBONs and dopaminergic neurons. Here, the plasticity rule would be reversed. Synaptic depression is accompanied by actively changing the receptor composite. We speculate that such plasticity could function reminiscent of mechanisms observed for climbing fiber-induced depression of parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses<sup>65</sup>. However, whether increased dynamics can be translated to more incorporation or removal of α2-type receptors, or depending on the plasticity rule both, will require high resolution imaging experiments in the future.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, receptor dynamics upon simultaneous odour+DA stimulation look just the sum of separate stimulations. If so, it may not be associative plasticity.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that odor actively triggers receptor dynamics (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 6).</p><p>This active trigger is suppressed by coincident DA application. As the active process of recovery induced by the odor is suppressed by DA, it is indeed the coincidence of both stimuli that manifest the change in receptor dynamics. We follow the reviewer’s argumentation that DA application (as also applying no stimulus at all (‘air only’), please see Supplementary Figure 6e) by itself does not trigger receptor recovery. However, even if the presence of DA would be the factor that always suppresses recovery (regardless whether in the presence of odor or not) it requires the coincidence of DA with the odor to change the cellular response (here receptor dynamics) triggered by an odor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the FRAP exp (Figure 6), they bleached the GFP signal multiple times in the same sample. As the recovery is very minor (less than 10% at max), the order of the stimulations should have been randomized. Besides that, this repeated photobleaching should cause serious phototoxicity that affects their results. The authors should provide additional control experiments and/or compelling justification.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to control for position effects, we performed similar experiments as in Figure 6 (all conditions probed subsequently in the same fly) in individual flies, were we presented only one of the conditions (without any previous history, Supplementary Figure 6). As seen for the results presented in Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 6, only odor triggered signal recovery and none of the other conditions. We can exclude position effects, as the experiments presented in Supplementary Figure 6 actually have no position. These observations from individual flies also argue against our results being a consequence of phototoxicity. We further ruled out phototoxic effects in additional experiments. First, when we started this experimental series, we measured MBON odor responses with co-expressed calcium indicators following the bleaching protocols. Arguing for healthy tissue, odor responses were clearly observable after conducting bleaching protocols (not shown; of note, these are difficult experiments as red calcium indicators bleach fast under the settings we use). Second, we performed preliminary experiments, where we exposed the flies to a novel odor (OCT) after pairing MCH and DA. As you can see from our preliminary data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>, we observe robust recovery following the third round of bleaching, again arguing against phototoxic effects.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>preliminary experiments demonstrating recovery of signal after three rounds of photo bleaching to a novel odor arguing against significant photo-toxic effects.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80445-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– If they promote the importance of the postsynaptic mechanism, shouldn't they also try to measure the effect of dopamine receptor knock-down in MBONs on appetitive memory? Along this line, the authors should acknowledge several papers in the field, reporting the defective appetitive and aversive memories of dopamine receptor mutants can be fully rescued in presynaptic Kenyon cells (Kim et al. J Neurosci 2007; Qin et al. Curr Biol 2009). They should also provide discussion on the role of postsynaptic dopamine input for memory induction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that identifying the relevant dopamine receptors at the MBON level would be highly interesting, and definitely something we would like to address in the future.

While this partial effect was indeed rescuable by KC expression, this leaves room for a significant component being MBON-dependent. As we also state in the discussion (line 755ff), we actually do suspect pre-and postsynaptic modifications to both take place during memory formation:</p><p>‘Indeed, we would speculate that synaptic connections can be subdivided into distinct compartments on both the pre- and the postsynaptic side, potentially through transsynaptic molecules<sup>67,71</sup>, allowing for fine-tuned and target-dependent changes of parameters within either side of a synapse.’</p><p>As suggested, we also now include the following paragraph to the discussion:</p><p>line 619: ‘Previous studies have shown that loss of DopR (dDA1) causes aversive and</p><p>appetitive memory impairments<sup>59,60</sup>.

We also have reworked the paragraph in the Results section highlighting our reasoning to perform the experiments on familiarity learning:</p><p>line 436ff: ‘Our data so far suggest that regulation of α2 subunits downstream of α5 are involved in postsynaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying appetitive, but not aversive memory storage. Besides associative memories, non-associative memories, such as familiarity learning, a form of habituation, are also stored at the level of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MBs. We next asked whether postsynaptic plasticity expressed through α5 and α2 subunit interplay, was exclusive to appetitive memory storage, or would represent a more generalizable mechanism that could underlie other forms of learning represented in the MBs. We turned to the α’3 compartment at the tip of the vertical MB lobe that has previously been shown to mediate odor familiarity learning. This form of learning allows the animal to adapt its behavioral responses to new odors and permits for assaying direct odor-related plasticity at the level of a higher order integration center. Importantly, this compartment follows different plasticity rules, because the odor serves as both the conditioned (activating KCs) and unconditioned stimulus (activating corresponding dopaminergic neurons)15. While allowing us to test whether the so far uncovered principles could also be relevant in a different context, it also provides a less complex test bed to further investigate whether α5 functions upstream of α2 dynamics.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In my understanding, Figure 4 supports the epistatic relationship between nicotinic a5 and a2 receptors, the former being upstream of the latter via Dlg. But if so, why do they overall exhibit different phenotypes, even if they are in the same pathway (Figure 9)?</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with the reviewer. Figure 4 suggest an epistatic relationship with α5 functioning upstream of Dlg and α2. Indeed, Figure 2 also suggests that α5 is needed for memory induction and α2 for the expression phase downstream. Moreover, at the level of α’3 MBONs, cell-specific knock-down of α5 prevents α2 recovery, adding another line of evidence for an epistatic relationship (Figure 7). The reviewer is fully correct in pointing out that the phenotypes observed are not fully overlapping between α5, Dlg and α2. In our model, α5 takes the role of a gatekeeper allowing to trigger or induce downstream processes. The easiest explanation would be that upstream α5 can have several other downstream effectors besides Dlg and α2 and therefore exhibits a more pronounced and severe phenotype. However, experiments in Figure 5 also point towards loss of α5 leaving the synapse (and as a consequence behavior) in a state with high calcium responses to an odor from the first stimulation onwards. Thus, in line with a disturbed gating mechanism when downregulating α5, synapses appear to be ‘prepotentiated’, or, already in a state, at least approaching the upper barrier of transmission efficacy, that also depress rapidly, quickly approaching the lower barrier. Thus, the dynamic range of weight changes is no longer available to the synapse without α5. This is further reflected in Figure 8, where animals with α’3 MBON-specific knock-down of α5 nAChR subunits behave as if they had learned about the familiarity of an odor before (without actually having learnt anything about the odor), which is likely reflected in rapid synaptic rundown (compare Figure 5). The precise mechanisms underlying the proposed gating mechanisms as well as further downstream targets of α5 will need to be worked out in the future. However, we would like to point out that α2 shows phenotypes that are overlapping with α5 (e.g. Figure 2), which is consistent with α2 functioning downstream of α5, but α5 having more (to be identified – for instance α1, please compare Figure 2) targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Too much technical and procedure detail in the result part, e.g. from line 389, they should simplify the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and thank the reviewer for their advice. We have reduced the technical aspects in the Results section wherever it appeared feasible to us, and especially for the section on in vivo FRAP experiments highlighted by the reviewer.

In brief, for fitting the FRAP data, we assumed an inverse exponential decay of the form 1 ⁻ e<sup>-k*t</sup>, where k denotes the decay constant and t time, as commonly used for FRAP data. To that end, before fitting of the linear mixed effect models, we inverted and log-transformed the intensity values, which is equivalent to fitting an inverse exponential decay function. For plotting, the predicted values were back-transformed to the original scale.</p><p>To further clarify this, we added more details to the methods section and to the figure legends:</p><p>1) Methods (line 906ff): ‘Photobleaching was accomplished using focused, high intensity laser exposure for ~1 minute. Analysis of fluorescence recovery was performed using FIJI. ROIs were manually selected and the percent recovery fluorescence was calculated by subtraction of the post-bleaching baseline fluorescence and division by the pre-bleaching baseline fluorescence. To fit the inverse exponential decay that is expected for FRAP data, we first inverted the percent fluorescence recovery values by subtracting them from 1 and then log-transformed the resulting values. These log-transformed values were used in a linear mixed effects model without intercept using the interaction between condition and time as fixed effect – to determine condition-specific differences of the recovery kinetics - and time as random effect (R package lme4). A linear mixed effect model was used to appropriately model repeated measures within animals. By inverting and log-transforming the fluorescence recovery values, this approach is equivalent to fitting an inverted exponential decay function. For plotting, all values including regression coefficients were back-transformed to the original scale. Significance of recovery of individual conditions was assessed using the regression coefficients of the condition-time interaction of the linear mixed model. Differences of recovery between pairs of conditions were tested using pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means of the linear mixed model (R package emmeans). Correction for multiple pairwise comparisons was performed using Tukey’s method.’</p><p>2) Legend to Figure 6: ‘d)Inverse exponential decay fit of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching following MCH exposure (blue line), MCH exposure simultaneously with dopamine (DA) injection (purple line), dopamine injection alone (red line); (e) Regression coefficient for the inverse exponential decay fit.

As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>, the largest recovery part takes place within the first 10 minutes and subsequently appears to approach a plateau. We expect most of the plasticity mechanisms therefore to take place within the first 10 to 20 min. However, we probe memory at the later 3 hr time point, to encapsulate the whole potential ‘memory-expression’ time line. Our model therefore suggests that α2 dynamics are induced downstream of α5 after training. The changed properties are manifest in later memory phases that can be probed at the 3 hr time point. Please also see our new Figure 9 and, as also pointed out above, our new paragraph to the discussion:</p><p>line 664ff: ‘In order to dissect distinct roles for receptor plasticity in memory induction and expression, we experimentally probed several time points during associative appetitive memory formation. First, we probed 30 minute memory following KC block, to invariantly interfere with the memory acquisition and not the retrieval stage (Figure 1). Second, we probed immediate and 3 hour memory performance following receptor knock-down, to distinguish between memory induction and memory expression requirements (Figure 2). Third, we investigate the time course of receptor dynamics during memory expression following memory induction with a resolution of 10 minute intervals after artificial training (Figure 6, 7). The overarching picture indicates that, indeed, directly following training, memory induction requires α5. Subsequently, at the resolution of minutes, regulation of α2 levels contributes to memory expression. While we cannot resolve the temporal time course at the level of T- maze behavior (Figure 2) or FRAP experiments (Figure 6) below several minutes, our in vivo training data (Figure 5) suggests that α2 requirement already becomes apparent within 1 minute after training.”</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>α2 recovery at 10, 20 and 30 min.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80445-sa2-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– L73 &quot;memory storage modes are functionally comparable or evolutionarily conserved.&quot;</p><p>I am not sure what the authors try to say.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clear and have rephrased this sentence that now reads:</p><p>line 77f: ‘Detailed knowledge of the anatomical wiring and functional signaling logic of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> learning and memory centers, the mushroom bodies5,<sup>7-21</sup> (MBs; third (‘higher’) order brain center; learning takes place three synapses downstream of sensory neurons), allows one to address to what extent synaptic mechanisms underlying memory storage are comparable across evolution, despite the use of different neurotransmitter systems.’</p></body></sub-article></article>
