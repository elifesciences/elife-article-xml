Some mechanisms of animal immunity have likely been present since the last common eukaryotic ancestor, including RNAi, production of antimicrobial peptides, and the production of nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shabalina and Koonin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richter and Levin, 2019</xref>).

Several innate immune pathway genes once considered to be animal-specific are present in choanoflagellates, including cGAS and STING, both of which are crucial for innate responses to cytosolic DNA in animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Richter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levin et al., 2014</xref>).

Although STING homologs are conserved in diverse invertebrate and vertebrate animals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Margolis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Margolis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kranzusch et al., 2015</xref>), mechanisms of STING activation are best understood in mammals. In mammals, STING is activated by binding 2’3’ cGAMP, an endogenous cyclic dinucleotide produced by the sensor cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) upon detecting cytosolic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishikawa and Barber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burdette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ablasser et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, cyclic dinucleotides produced by bacteria can also activate STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burdette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moretti et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, STING domain-containing systems are present in bacteria where they may contribute to anti-phage defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morehouse et al., 2020</xref>), raising the possibility that eukaryotic STING-like proteins were acquired from lateral gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burroughs et al., 2020</xref>). Comparative genomics suggests that STING domains arose at least three independent times in eukaryotes, including once in the stem lineage leading to Choanozoa, the clade containing animals and choanoflagellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burroughs et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Choanoflagellates have already served as powerful models for studying the origin of animal multicellularity and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alegado et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woznica et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laundon et al., 2019</xref>) and are ideally positioned to yield insights into the evolution of animal immune pathways.

Through our study of interactions between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, we determined that STING functions in the choanoflagellate antibacterial response. In addition, we demonstrate that STING is necessary for mediating responses to the STING agonist 2’3’ cGAMP in vivo, and that 2’3’ cGAMP induces STING-dependent autophagic signaling.

However, many bacterial pathogens, including <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, have evolved strategies to prevent or resist phagocytosis by eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Uribe-Querol and Rosales, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yoon et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether phagocytosis of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is required to induce cell death. To track phagocytosis, we added GFP-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) to <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and monitored the cultures by live imaging. After one hour, while 92 % of <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> cells incubated with <italic>E. coli</italic> −GFP had GFP+ food vacuoles, only 3 % of cells incubated with PAO1-GFP had GFP+ food vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> also robustly phagocytosed GFP-expressing <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>C. jejuni</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Next, to determine if <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> broadly disrupts <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> phagocytosis, which could induce cell death through starvation, we incubated <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> with GFP-expressing PAO1 or GFP-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> for one hour, and then added 0.2 mm fluorescent beads for an additional 30 min as an independent measure of phagocytic activity. The fraction of <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> cells with internalized 0.2 mm beads was similar in cultures incubated with <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5αand PAO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Moreover, exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> did not inhibit phagocytic uptake of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These results suggest that exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> does not broadly inhibit phagocytosis.</p><p>The above results suggested that the pathogenic effects of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are induced by factors secreted by extracellular bacteria. In addition, diverse secreted bacterial molecules have been previously shown to influence choanoflagellate cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alegado et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woznica et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Woznica et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we next investigated the effects of secreted <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> molecules on <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> viability. Exposure of <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> to conditioned medium from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 or diverse non-pathogenic gammaproteobacteria revealed that PAO1 conditioned medium is sufficient to restrict growth and induce cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Similar to live bacteria, exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> conditioned medium led to reduced motility and truncated flagella in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> after approximately 8–10 hr.</p><p>Because numerous <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> secreted virulence factors have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moradali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klockgether and Tümmler, 2017</xref>), we screened a battery of isogenic PAO1 strains with deletions in known virulence genes to determine if any of these factors contribute to the pathogenic effects on <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). All strains tested induced similar levels of <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> cell death as the parental PAO1 strain, suggesting that none of the deleted virulence genes alone are essential for inducing cytotoxicity in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>. The bioactivity in the conditioned media was also found to be heat, protease, and nuclease resistant, indicating that the virulence factors are unlikely to be proteins or nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). In addition, we found that subjecting the conditioned media to methanol extraction followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry resulted in specific fractions that recapitulated the bioactivity of the conditioned media. Although further detailed chemical analysis is required to determine the molecular nature of these factors, these data indicate that secreted <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> small molecules are

Although <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> lacks many effectors required for immune responses downstream of STING in animals (including TBK1 and NF-kB; Figure S1A), autophagy machinery is well conserved in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>. Therefore, we asked if one outcome of 2’3’ cGAMP exposure in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> is the induction of autophagy.</p><p>The evolutionarily conserved protein Atg8/LC3 is a ubiquitin-like protein that can be used to monitor autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klionsky, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanida et al., 2005</xref>). During autophagosome formation, unmodified Atg8, called Atg8-I, is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine. Lipidated Atg8, called Atg8-II, remains associated with growing autophagosomes. As such, two indicators of autophagy are elevated Atg8-II levels relative to Atg8-I and increased formation of Atg8+ autophagosome puncta. Because antibodies are not available to detect endogenous <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> autophagy markers or cargo receptors, we generated wild type and <italic>STING<sup>–</sup></italic> cell lines stably expressing mCherry-Atg8. Stable expression of mCherry-Atg8 under the control of the constitutive pEFL promoter did not alter the relative susceptibilities of these cell lines to 2’3’cGAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By immunoblot, mCherry-Atg8-II can be distinguished from mCherry-Atg8-I based on its enhanced gel mobility.

These results suggest that treatment with 2’3’ cGAMP induces autophagic signaling in a STING-dependent manner; however, making this conclusion requires evidence of autophagy induction through inhibitor studies.

Exposing wild-type cells pretreated with chloroquine to 2’3’ cGAMP for 3 hr resulted in increased levels of Atg8-II relative to Atg8-I, suggesting that 2’3’ cGAMP treatment indeed induces the autophagic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In this study, we screened diverse bacteria to identify a choanoflagellate pathogen, and determined that <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> is killed by sustained exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> bacteria. We found that STING, a crucial component of animal innate responses to cytosolic DNA, is upregulated in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> after exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or the STING ligand 2’3’ cGAMP. The application of newly developed transgenic and genetic tools for <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> revealed that, similar to mammalian STING, <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> STING localizes to perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum regions. In addition, STING mediates responses to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> bacteria, and is required for inducing transcriptional changes and autophagic signaling in response to 2’3’ cGAMP. These data reveal that STING plays conserved roles in choanoflagellate immune responses<italic>,</italic> and provide insight into the evolution of STING signaling on the animal stem lineage.</p><p>The discovery that <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> STING mediates immune responses raises a number of interesting questions about the full extent of its physiological roles in choanoflagellates. For example, while our results demonstrate that <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> STING responds to exogenous 2’3’ cGAMP, the endogenous triggers of STING activation in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> remain to be determined. <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> has a putative cGAS homolog, suggesting that STING may respond to an endogenously produced cyclic dinucleotide similar to 2’3’ cGAMP. Determining the enzymatic activities of <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> cGAS and identifying the endogenous trigger of <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> STING will be critical steps towards elucidating mechanisms of STING activation. Although cGAS and STING are rare among sequenced choanoflagellate species, both species with STING homologs, <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and <italic>S. macrocollata</italic>, also harbor a cGAS homolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting the presence of an intact choanoflagellate cGAS-STING pathway.</p><p>Our results suggest that <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> has distinct responses to 2’3’ cGAMP versus 3’3’-linked cyclic dinucleotides produced by bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast to 2’3’ cGAMP, the purified bacterial cyclic dinucleotides tested (3’3’ cGAMP, c-di-AMP, c-di-GMP) do not lead to STING upregulation or induce cell death in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>. However, 3’3’ cGAMP induces a robust transcriptional response in <italic>M. brevicollis,</italic> indicating that STING, or a different cyclic dinucleotide receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McFarland et al., 2017</xref>), responds to these bacterial molecules. One hypothesis is that <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> STING, similar to animal STING proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kranzusch et al., 2015</xref>), may have different binding affinities for 2’3’ and 3’3’-linked cyclic dinucleotides. It is also possible that bacterial cyclic dinucleotides activate additional pathways that influence survival in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>. As bacterivores, choanoflagellates likely benefit from a fine-tuned response to bacterial cyclic dinucleotides that enables them to interpret higher and lower concentrations in their environment. Elucidating mechanisms of STING activation in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> could help reveal how STING proteins in animals evolved to respond to both bacterially produced and endogenous cyclic dinucleotides.</p><p>While it is clear that 2’3’ cGAMP stimulates STING-dependent transcriptional responses and autophagic signaling in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), the signaling pathways downstream of STING in choanoflagellates are unknown. Much of what is known about STING signaling comes from mammals and involves the extended CTT domain of STING, which <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> lacks, and immune genes that are restricted to vertebrates. Two pathways downstream of STING activation that are conserved in invertebrates, and as such are proposed ancestral functions of STING, are autophagy and NF-kB signaling. Here, we observed that STING is required for induction of the autophagy pathway in response to 2’3’ cGAMP in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, indicating that the role of STING in regulating autophagy predates animal origins. While exposure to 2’3’ cGAMP leads to NF-kB activation in the sea anemone <italic>N. vectensis (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Margolis, 2021</xref>) and in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hua et al., 2018</xref>), neither <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> nor <italic>S. macrocollata</italic>, the two choanoflagellate species with STING, possess a NF-kB homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Richter et al., 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, 2’3’ cGAMP activates an extensive transcriptional response downstream of STING in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, although the specific signaling pathways remain to be identified. This does not negate the hypothesis that STING signaling led to NF-kB activation in the Urmetazoan, but strongly suggests that additional pathways exist downstream of STING activation in choanoflagellates, and potentially in animals.</p><p>Choanoflagellates forage on diverse environmental bacteria for sustenance, yet how they recognize and respond to pathogens is a mystery.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ralph Isberg (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers found the work to be of broad interest. The analysis of the response of the choanoflagellate <italic>Monosiga brevicollis</italic> to a variety of bacterial species revealed that exposure of <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> conditioned medium results in choanoflagellate death and the authors found that his is dependent on the newly discovered ortholog of STING. Characterization reveals that the STING response can be induced by 2'3' cGAMP, which parallels the activation of STING in diverse species. In addition, the finding that cyclic dinucleotide treatment induces autophagy also has parallels with the effector pathways observed in other organisms. There are a number of strengths as outlined by the Reviewers. First, the development of a Choanaoflagellate model system to study innate immunity, second with the development of genetics for M. brevicollis, third, the demonstration of a functional STING system in one of the closest relatives to animals and fourth, that cell death occurs in response to cyclic dinucleotides.</p><p>However, there were questions that were raised that if addressed would significantly strengthen the conclusions of the manuscript. One question revolves around cell death, and raises the question of how this cell death pathway is induced and how this controls infection. The second question involves the role of autophagy and whether autophagy is indeed required for STING-dependent antimicrobial defense.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A) The authors should address why only <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is causing the generation of 2'3' cGAMP. Are these CDNs found in the conditioned media (Figure 1H-I), or do the authors hypothesize that an unidentified <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> factor is responsible for the generation of 2'3' cGAMP when the media is exposed to <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>? On the other hand, if they hypothesize that the <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> cGAS ortholog is responsible for the generation of 2'3' cGAMP, they could test this hypothesis using a cGAS null mutant.</p><p>B) Figure 6 – Here, the authors should include data showing that Atg8 lipidation and the induction of autophagy leads to M<italic>. brevicollis</italic> death. They could use their chloroquine treatment method to test if this inhibits <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-induced, STING-mediated killing of <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I would recommend the authors drop the figures on phagocytosis resistance to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. The <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> type 3 secretion system has a number of effectors that antagonize phagocytosis, so it's unclear if this is a host or bacterial activity. In any event, unless it is directly linked to STING, it's probably not relevant to the manuscript.</p><p>2. I was a little confused about the cell supernatant strategy. Are the authors saying that contact with bacteria and phagocytosis are unable to induce the response, and you need a secreted molecule? It might have helped if they did some quick and dirty experiments, like heating the supernatant, or size fractionating to argue for a small molecule.</p><p>3. This may be major or minor for 1F: the MOIs are unclear and this wasn't done in a fashion in which it was easy to understand what was going on (see above critique). To be done carefully, different MOIs have to be used and determination if TTSS is involved, etc. I really think this doesn't contribute to the story and should be dropped.</p><p>4. Figure 4: Given that you raised antibody, why did you use transfected cells here to analyze STING localization?</p><p>5. Line 232 is a heading, not a sentence.</p><p>6. I am not convinced M. fluctuans is devoid of STING. It has a cGAS and interestingly has an NFkB. Have you tried seeing if it responds to 2'3'cGAMP?</p><p>7. The authors don't give a model for the death response. Are they proposing that there is an inflammasome-like function that STING is controlling? The fact that LPS also seems to induce a parallel pathway suggests that there is a pattern recognition-generated cellular suicide (which would primarily make sense for intracellular pathogens). They also might provide some rationale for why cell death protects against an extracellular pathogen (unless there is an intracellular lifestyle for <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Quantitation of flagella length (Figure 1B) is missing</p><p>2. Are any <italic>P. aeuginosa</italic> effects altered in the STING KO strain?</p><p>3. I think that more experimental inquiry is needed to determine the potentially distinct <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-induced signaling pathway and the environmentally relevant trigger 0f the cGAS/STING response.</p><p>4. I would like a stronger evolutionary argument as to the significance of the system. It appears to me that Choanaflagellates were data-mined to find innate immune homologs such as STING. While two (of &gt;20) species have conserved cGas/STING pairs, is there evidence that this is evolutionarily relevant to animals?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70436.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers found the work to be of broad interest.

We have done further experiments investigating autophagy with 2’3’ cGAMP since it allows us to examine STING-specific effects. We now show that autophagy is required for 2’3’ cGAMP-induced cell death. These new results are found in Figure 6H, and summarized in lines 414-422. Autophagy in the context of whole/complex bacterial cells will be an area of future investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A) The authors should address why only <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is causing the generation of 2'3' cGAMP.

Because secreted virulence factor(s) produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> induce a broad transcriptional host response in <italic>M. brevicollis,</italic> it difficult to narrow down why <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, but not other bacteria<italic>,</italic> induces STING upregulation. We do not think that CDNs produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are responsible for the cytotoxic effects induced by <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> or for the upregulation of STING, because known bacterially-produced CDNs (3’3’ cGAMP, c-di-GMP, c-di-AMP) do not induce cell death or STING upregulation in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> (Figure 3C, 3D). Although it is beyond the scope of this study, we hope that future characterization of the chemical structures of these <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence factors will help us to better understand why <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, but not other bacteria (for instance, those also harboring active T3SS), is pathogenic towards <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>.</p><p>We have clarified in the Discussion (lines 445-454) the possibility that <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> cGAS may be responsible for the production of an endogenous CDN, like 2’3’ cGAMP that activates STING.</p><p>“For example, while our results demonstrate that <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> STING responds to exogenous 2’3’ cGAMP, the endogenous triggers of STING activation in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> remain to be determined. […] Although cGAS and STING are rare among sequenced choanoflagellate species, both species with STING homologs, <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and <italic>S. macrocollata</italic>, also harbor a cGAS homolog (Figure 1- supplementary figure 1), suggesting the presence of an intact choanoflagellate cGAS-STING pathway.”</p><p>We agree that extensive in vitro biochemical characterization of <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> cGAS, and phenotypic characterization of a cGAS null mutant will help substantiate or refute this hypothesis. While <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> reverse genetics are now possible due to our efforts for this paper, the process remains slow and labor intensive. Thus, while characterizing a cGAS null mutant was not feasible for this paper, it will be a focus of future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Figure 6 – Here, the authors should include data showing that Atg8 lipidation and the induction of autophagy leads to M. brevicollis death. They could use their chloroquine treatment method to test if this inhibits Pseudomonas-induced, STING-mediated killing of M. brevicollis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this wonderful suggestion. We have added Figure 6H showing that pretreatment with lysosomotropic agents chloroquine or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl rescues cell death induced by 2’3’ cGAMP. This data has led to the hypothesis that a primary mechanism by which 2’3’ cGAMP induces STING-mediated cell death is via autophagic signaling, and is summarized in lines 414-422.</p><p>“Finally, we asked whether STING-mediated autophagic pathway induction affects survival after exposure to 2’3’ cGAMP (Figure 6H). […] Therefore, we hypothesize that 2’3’ cGAMP induces cell death in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> by overstimulating STING-mediated autophagic signaling.”</p><p>In addition, we agree that a more complete understanding of how <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> induces cell death would strengthen this manuscript, and have modified lines 504-507 the Discussion to iterate this:</p><p>“Thus, identifying specific <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence factors will be critical for understanding why <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> – but not other bacteria – have pathogenic effects on <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, and facilitate the characterization of mechanisms underlying choanoflagellate pathogen responses.”</p><p>Finally, because <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> leads to broad host responses, including the induction of many stress-related genes, we have not explored STING-mediated autophagy in response to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in this manuscript. We hope that building additional tools in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> to study autophagy, along with identifying specific <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence factors, will enable us to address the role of autophagy in choanoflagellate antibacterial immunity in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

We agree that we didn’t include sufficient data to support whether our observation that <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> does not internalize <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is due to host or bacterial factors. Nonetheless, we find this observation to be important because it suggests that internalization of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is not required for it to exert pathogenic effects.</p><p>We have edited the text to emphasize that phagocytosis of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is not required to exert pathogenic effects, and have removed wording suggesting that <italic>M. brevicollis actively</italic> avoids phagocytosis of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. These edits can be found in lines 158-181.</p><p>We have also performed additional experiments to examine <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> T3SS mutants induce cell death in <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> Experiments with both live bacteria and conditioned media found that deletion strains ∆popB and ∆exoSTY induce death similarly to wild type (strains listed in Table 2).

We agree that we could have more clearly stated our rationale for testing cell supernatant.

We have added details regarding MOI into the Figure legend to make this experiment more clear, and additional methods regarding exact choanoflagellate and bacterial cell densities can be found in the Methods.

However, without antibodies or live stains that reliably highlight organelles in <italic>M. brevicollis,</italic> we could not further address the localization of STING using IF.

As the closest living relatives of animals, comparing features shared by extant lineages of choanoflagellates and animals can provide unique insight into features that were likely present in the last common ancestor of animals, including features of innate immunity.</p><p>While choanoflagellates were not “data-mined” to find innate immune homologs, the most powerful approach we have for inferring genes that were present in the last common ancestor of animals is comparative genomics. Through comparative genomics, Richter et al. (2018) were able to identify nearly 400 gene families – including some innate immune genes, like cGAS and STING – that evolved prior to the divergence of animals and choanoflagellates.</p><p>We did not initially set out to study STING; however, when we found that STING was upregulated in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> in response to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (lines 193-196)<italic>,</italic> we were excited to further explore its evolutionary history. Choanoflagellate and animal STING proteins are similar both structurally and at the amino acid level, and STING homologs have not been detected in any other lineages closely related to choanoflagellates or animals. Thus, we believe that STING found in animals today arose in a clade containing choanoflagellates and animals (lines 73-74), and that studying STING in choanoflagellates can provide insight into the evolutionary history of this protein in animals.</p></body></sub-article></article>
