segment. The highly curved rims of these discs, formed in the process of disc enclosure, are fortified by large hetero-oligomeric complexes of two homologous tetraspanin proteins, PRPH2 (a.k.a. peripherin-2 or rds) and ROM1. While mutations in PRPH2 affect the formation of disc rims, the role of ROM1 remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that the knockout of ROM1 causes a compensatory increase in the disc content of PRPH2. Despite this increase, discs of ROM1 knockout mice displayed a delay in disc enclosure associated with a large diameter and lack of incisures in mature discs. Strikingly, further increasing the level of PRPH2 rescued these morphological defects. We next showed that disc rims are still formed in a knockin mouse in which the tetraspanin body of PRPH2 was replaced with that of ROM1. Together, these results demonstrate that, despite its contribution to the formation of disc rims, ROM1 can be replaced by an excess of PRPH2 for timely enclosure of newly forming discs and establishing normal outer segment structure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>photoreceptor</kwd><kwd>outer segment</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>tetraspanin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY030451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arshavsky</surname><given-names>Vadim Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY005722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arshavsky</surname><given-names>Vadim Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY010609</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Al-Ubaidi</surname><given-names>Muayyad R</given-names></name><name><surname>Naash</surname><given-names>Muna I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY034671</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Naash</surname><given-names>Muna I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY033763</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>Tylor R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG070915</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conley</surname><given-names>Shannon M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Unrestricted Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arshavsky</surname><given-names>Vadim Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>Tylor R</given-names></name><name><surname>Castillo</surname><given-names>Carson M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hao</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name><name><surname>Skiba</surname><given-names>Nikolai P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The photoreceptor tetraspanin protein ROM1 contributes to the formation of light-sensitive 'disc' membranes, but it can be functionally replaced by an excess of its homologous binding partner PRPH2.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The light-sensitive outer segment organelle of vertebrate photoreceptor cells is a modified cilium containing a stack of disc-shaped membranes, or ‘discs’. While initially formed as serial evaginations of the photoreceptor plasma membrane, mature discs are separated from this membrane and are fully enclosed inside the outer segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steinberg et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burgoyne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Volland et al., 2015</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spencer et al., 2020</xref>). Membrane enclosure involves the formation of highly curved, hairpin-shaped disc rims. Two homologous tetraspanin proteins, PRPH2 (also known as peripherin-2 or rds) and ROM1, localize specifically to disc rims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connell and Molday, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Travis et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bascom et al., 1992</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stuck et al., 2016</xref>). Within the disc rim, PRPH2 and ROM1 form homo- and heteromeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bascom et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldberg and Molday, 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldberg and Molday, 1996a</xref>) that are assembled into larger oligomers connected by disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loewen and Molday, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakraborty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zulliger et al., 2018</xref>). Three parallel interconnected chains of these oligomers are wrapped around the circumference of the mature disc and support its hairpin-shaped structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pöge et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Despite a high level of structural homology between PRPH2 and ROM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2003</xref>), the consequences of their mutations for photoreceptor health are quite different. Around 200 mutations of <italic>PRPH2</italic> are shown to cause a heterogeneous set of inherited retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy, and macular dystrophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Landrum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peeters et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, mutations in <italic>ROM1</italic> typically cause digenic retinitis pigmentosa in conjunction with mutations in <italic>PRPH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kajiwara et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dryja et al., 1997</xref>), except for a handful of reports of mutations in <italic>ROM1</italic> in patients without accompanying <italic>PRPH2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bascom et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sakuma et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reig et al., 2000</xref>). With regard to animal models, the <italic>Prph2</italic> knockout mouse, commonly known as the <italic>rds</italic> mouse, has a complete failure of outer segment formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jansen and Sanyal, 1984</xref>), while the <italic>Rom1</italic> knockout mouse forms outer segments with relatively minor structural abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>). This discrepancy could be explained, at least in part, by the importance of the cytoplasmic C-terminus of PRPH2, which has been shown to retain membranes at the photoreceptor cilium, thereby allowing their remodeling into outer segment discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salinas et al., 2017</xref>). However, most of the disease-associated PRPH2 mutations spare its C-terminus, so the complete explanation of this discrepancy awaits further investigation of the role of ROM1.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the role of ROM1 in the formation of photoreceptor disc rims and the process of disc enclosure. We first revisited the phenotype of the <italic>Rom1</italic> knockout (<italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mouse and made several novel observations. Using quantitative proteomics, we showed that the knockout of ROM1 causes a compensatory increase in the relative disc content of PRPH2. Despite the total tetraspanin content being essentially the same as in WT discs, <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs displayed a delay in their maturation and an increase in outer segment diameter. In addition, <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs lacked the indentations of their rims, known as incisures, present in WT discs. These changes could be explained, at least in part, by an alteration in tetraspanin oligomerization likely arising from a rearrangement of intramolecular disulfide bridge(s) in PRPH2. Strikingly, these morphological phenotypes can be rescued by transgenic overexpression of PRPH2, suggesting that ROM1 is not absolutely necessary for the formation of normal outer segments. In another set of experiments, we investigated whether disc rims could be formed in a knockin mouse in which PRPH2 was replaced by a chimeric protein consisting of ROM1 bearing the C-terminus of PRPH2. While the knockin photoreceptors failed to form orderly disc stacks, outer segment membranes preserved the ability to form hairpin-shaped rims. Together, these results demonstrate that, despite its contribution to disc formation and intrinsic ability to support disc rim structure, ROM1 can be replaced by an excess of PRPH2 for the formation of a normal outer segment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of ROM1 causes a compensatory increase in the relative outer segment content of PRPH2</title><p>Three proteins, rhodopsin, PRPH2 and ROM1, comprise ~98% of the total transmembrane protein material in normal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Skiba et al., 2023</xref>). Recently, it has been proposed that the overall dimensions of a disc are determined by the molar ratio between the total tetraspanin content (PRPH2 and ROM1) forming the disc rim and rhodopsin forming the disc surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, interpreting the phenotype of the <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse requires an understanding of how the loss of ROM1 affects the outer segment content of PRPH2. This is particularly important because discs deficient in PRPH2 display a compensatory increase in the relative amount of ROM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that the opposite (i.e. a compensatory increase in the amount of PRPH2 when there is a deficiency in ROM1) may also be true. The latter is consistent with the report that the combined amount of PRPH2 and a knockin chimera between the transmembrane portion of ROM1 and C-terminus of PRPH2 is increased in the absence of ROM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conley et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To address this possibility, we employed a quantitative mass spectrometry approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Skiba et al., 2023</xref>) recently used to determine the molar ratio among PRPH2, ROM1 and rhodopsin in other mutant photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>). In these experiments, the outer segment content of PRPH2 was determined as a molar fraction of rhodopsin. Because the packing density of rhodopsin in discs is unaffected by any changes in disc dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liang et al., 2004</xref>), this parameter reflects the relative content of PRPH2 in each disc, independent of any changes in outer segment length or volume. We found that the relative content of PRPH2 in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> outer segments increased to an ~1:12 molar ratio to rhodopsin from an ~1:18 ratio in WT outer segments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; see raw data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata1">Table 1—source data 1</xref>). Strikingly, this 1:12 ratio is equal to the ratio between total tetraspanin (PRPH2 +ROM1) and rhodopsin in WT outer segments. Therefore, the knockout of ROM1 leads to a compensatory increase in the relative disc content of PRPH2.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Quantification of molar ratios between PRPH2, ROM1 and rhodopsin in WT and <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> outer segments.</title><p><supplementary-material id="table1sdata1"><label>Table 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Quantification of molar ratios between tetraspanins and rhodopsin in WT and <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice – raw data.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="elife-89444-table1-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Protein molar ratios<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn1">*</xref></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">WT</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">PRPH2:rhodopsin</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:18.1±0.5</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:12.2±1.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">ROM1:rhodopsin</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:36.3±3.9</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">n/a</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">PRPH2:ROM1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.0:1±0.3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">n/a</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">(PRPH2 +ROM1):rhodopsin</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:12.1±0.2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:12.2±1.3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table1fn1"><label>*</label><p>Values are shown as mean ± s.d. n/a: not applicable.

Remarkably, these defects can be reversed by sufficient overexpression of PRPH2, indicating a redundancy between these two tetraspanin proteins in the process of disc rim formation.</p><p>The idea of redundancy between PRPH2 and ROM1 is supported by the finding that mutations in both genetically interact to modulate disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kajiwara et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dryja et al., 1997</xref>). While individual PRPH2 mutations have greater phenotypic consequences, this could relate to both the unique role of the C-terminal tail of PRPH2 in the initial stages of disc formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salinas et al., 2017</xref>) as well as the fact that there is twice as much PRPH2 as ROM1 in outer segments, at least in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kedzierski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loewen and Molday, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Skiba et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>While evidence that <italic>ROM1</italic> mutations alone may cause human visual pathology is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bascom et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sakuma et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reig et al., 2000</xref>), photoreceptors of <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice eventually degenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>). We propose that the delay in disc enclosure is the primary defect underlying this degeneration. Because discs remain open longer than normal, they may incorporate more than a normal amount of membranous material, which is continuously delivered to the outer segment. This can lead to disc membrane overgrowth and, eventually, the formation of highly dysmorphic membrane whorls. This progressive collapse of outer segment ultrastructure would eventually lead to cell death. Notably, this same progression of structural defects occurs in certain mice in which PRPH2 oligomerization is affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>But why is the phenotype of the heterozygous <italic>rds</italic> mouse containing ~50% of normal PRPH2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hawkins et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 1997</xref>) much more severe than the <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse lacking 100% of ROM1? This difference is not intuitive because the molar ratio between PRPH2 and ROM1 is ~2:1 and, therefore, each mouse is expected to have ~2/3 of the normal tetraspanin content. However, there is a compensatory increase in outer segment tetraspanin in each of these two mice. We now show that relative content of total tetraspanin in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs is essentially the same as in WT discs (~1:12 molar ratio to rhodopsin) due to a compensatory increase in PRPH2. On the other hand, there is only a partial compensatory increase of ROM1 in heterozygous <italic>rds</italic> mice (~1:15 molar ratio of PRPH2 +ROM1 to rhodopsin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>) The mechanism behind these increases remains to be elucidated, but regardless, the lesser severity of the <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> phenotype could be explained, at least in part, by a larger degree of this compensatory tetraspanin increase.</p><p>Yet, the complete restoration of the total tetraspanin content in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> outer segments does not fully rescue their morphological phenotype. This implies that, in normal photoreceptors, ROM1 contributes some unique features to the properties of tetraspanin oligomers. In fact, our data suggest that the loss of ROM1 alters both the intra- and intermolecular properties of the remaining PRPH2. We found that ROM1 likely facilitates an optimal internal disulfide bond arrangement of PRPH2 in addition to promoting the formation of larger oligomeric chains of PRPH2. Nonetheless, the outer segment deficiencies arising from loss of ROM1 were nearly completely overcome by a sufficient excess of PRPH2.</p><p>Of particular interest is our finding that discs of <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice lack incisures. A recent study put forth a model in which the total length of the disc rim, including the incisure, is determined by the molar ratio between the total tetraspanin protein and rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>). The lack of incisures in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs may not appear intuitive since the total tetraspanin content in these discs is essentially the same as in WT discs. However, <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs also have an increased diameter, which allows the total rim length of WT and <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs to be about the same. The reason why such a tradeoff between the disc diameter and the presence/absence of an incisure exists remains to be determined, although it is likely to relate to the kinetics of disc enclosure.</p><p>In conclusion, our study shows that ROM1 makes distinct contributions to the formation of disc rims and the process of disc enclosure. Nonetheless, a sufficient excess of PRPH2 is able to compensate for the loss of ROM1, indicating that ROM1 is redundant to PRPH2 as a molecular building block of photoreceptor disc rims. Given that excess PRPH2 can rescue defects associated with loss of ROM1, it is exciting to speculate that PRPH2 overexpression can prevent the long-term photoreceptor degeneration associated with either loss of ROM1 or deficiencies arising from mutations in PRPH2 itself. It also remains to be seen whether the opposite is also true, whereby an excess ROM1 may rescue certain defects associated with mutations in PRPH2.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6 J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Labs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jax#:000664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Prph2<sup>C150S</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stuck et al., 2014</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MGI:6367798</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRCT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conley et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PRPH2 OE</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nour et al., 2004</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke et al., 2000</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MGI:2181662</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">COS-7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-1651</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC provides authentication and confirmation that mycoplasma contamination was not detected</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRCT-FLAG</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conley et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">pcDNA3.1 plasmid</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ROM1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conley et al., 2010</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">pcDNA3.1 plasmid with murine <italic>Rom1</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-PRPH2 (polyclonal rabbit)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kedzierski et al., 1999</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB: (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-ROM1 (polyclonal sheep)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spencer et al., 2023</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB: (1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-RRCT (2B7;

This question is of significance as the lack of photoreceptor discs or defects in disc morphogenesis due to mutations in tetraspanin proteins is a known cause of vision loss in humans. The authors of this study combine TEM and mouse models to tease out the role of tetraspanin proteins, peripherin, and Rom1 in the genesis of the photoreceptor discs. They show that the absence of Rom1 leads to an increase in peripherin and changes in disc morphology. Further rise in peripherin alleviates some of the defects observed in Rom1 knockout animals leading to the conclusion that peripherin can substitute for the absence of Rom1.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A mouse model of Rom1 generated by the McInnes group in 2000 predicted a role for Rom1 in rim closure. They also showed enlarged discs in the absence of Rom1. This study confirmed this finding and showed the compensatory changes in peripherin, maintaining the total levels of tetraspanin proteins. Lack of Rom1 leads to excessive open disks demonstrated by darkly stained tannic acid-accessible areas in TEM. Interestingly, increased peripherin expression can rescue some morphological defects, including maintaining normal disc diameters and incisures. Overall, these observations lead authors to propose a model that ROM1 can be replaced by peripherin.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your kind summary of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The compensatory increase in peripherin and morphological rescue in the absence of ROM1 is expected, given the previous work from authors showing (i) absence of peripherin showing increased ROM1 and (ii) &quot;Eliminating Rom1 also increased levels of Prph2/RRCT: mean Prph2/RRCT levels in P30 Prph2+/R retinas were 34% of WT, while levels in Prph2+/R/Rom1−/− retinas were 59% of WT&quot; from Conley, 2019. The current study provides a comprehensive quantitative analysis. However, the mechanism behind the mechanism is unclear and warrants discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We referenced the result from the 2019 paper by Conley and colleagues in revision. As noted by the reviewer, new information in the current study consists of the precise quantification of the compensatory increase by a technique more accurate than semi-quantitative Western blotting. The nature of these compensatory increases is currently unknown and beyond the scope of experiments described in the current study. While this is an intriguing area for future investigation, we prefer not to speculate on the underlying mechanisms to avoid any appearance of data overinterpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Photoreceptor morphology appears better when peripherin is overexpressed. Is there a rescue of rod function (assessed by ERG or equivalent measures) in peripherin OE/Rom1-/- mice? Given the extensive work in this area and the implications the authors allude to at the end, it is important to investigate this aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed an interesting and potentially translationally relevant direction to address whether PRPH2 overexpression can rescue the long-term degeneration and functional defects of the loss of ROM1. Unfortunately, our work in this direction remains severely hindered by the fact that the current line of ROM1 knockout mice are notoriously poor breeders, allowing us to get only a handful of animals for each year of breeding. Therefore, we decided to limit our current study to addressing the structural roles of ROM1 and PRPH2 in supporting disc formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Line 210: &quot;ROM1 is able to form disc rims in the absence of PRPH2&quot; is not demonstrated. The data shows that the tetraspanin domains are interchangeable similar to Conley, 2019. Similar concern for lines 225-226.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the point regarding the interchangeable tetraspanin domains and clarified it in the text by referring to the tetraspanin body of PRPH2 where applicable. However, the 2019 paper by Conley and colleagues did not show any ultrastructural images of disc rims in a mouse without at least one copy of WT PRPH2 being expressed. The presence of normally looking disc rims in the complete absence of the tetraspanin body of PRPH2 is an original observation of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 234: it is unclear what is meant by ..&quot;they are normally processed in the biosynthetic membranes&quot; How does lack of ER localization lead to this conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified this point by replacing “normally processed” with “not trapped”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 306-308: it is difficult to follow the rationale. How will a shift in the trafficking pathway affect disulfide bonds since these are formed in ER?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a good point that at least the bulk of S-S bridge formation takes place during protein maturation in the ER and the ability of additional intramolecular S-S bond formation in the Golgi is questionable. We, therefore, removed this speculation from Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the poor development of OS, the authors could provide an estimate of how many OS-like structures were observed, with and without rims, in RRCT animals.</p></disp-quote><p>The gross development of outer segment structures in RRCT homozygous mice was part of the 2019 paper by Conley and colleagues. We prefer to limit repeating experiments from the previous study, but instead wanted to focus specifically on disc rim formation, which was not analyzed in RRCT homozygous mice in the previous study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The term &quot;function&quot; is loosely defined throughout this manuscript. Specifically, the excess peripherin can resolve some of the morphological defects observed in Rom1 -/-, and these functional changes in morphology are the focus of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the word “function” in three occasions where there may be an ambiguity in its meaning, as noted by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 115/116: Reference is missing for the statement that photoreceptor cell degeneration begins at P30.</p></disp-quote><p>These lines reference Figures 1A,B, which include quantification of the number of photoreceptor nuclei.

We believe that it helps the reader to follow the flow of the data, while being clearly presented as a potential explanation rather than a conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 245-246: Results explained in the following paragraph (247-254) do not answer the question &quot;whether disc rim formation in PRPH2 2C150S/C150S knockin mice was driven by disulfide-linked ROM1 molecules&quot;, which is a valid and intriguing question. However, the results explained in 247-254 answer the question &quot;if C150S PRPH2 can form discs in the absence of ROM1&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the text to replace “To address this question” with “To explore whether disc rims can be formed in the absence of any disulfide-linked tetraspanin molecules”, which precisely reflects what was addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, Lewis et al seek to further define the role of ROM1.

Regarding the stated weakness that we did not measure the molar ratios between PRPH2, ROM1 and rhodopsin in the ROM1 knockout line with PRPH2 overexpression: this is one experiment that we really hoped to do but were limited by the poor breeding of the ROM1 knockout line described above.
