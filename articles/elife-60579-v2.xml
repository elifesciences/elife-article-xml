prominent biomolecular condensates. Despite their prevalence, research on the function of NS is virtually restricted to colocalization analyses, since an organizing core, without which NS cannot form, remains unidentified. The monoclonal antibody SC35, raised against a spliceosomal extract, is frequently used to mark NS. Unexpectedly, we found that this antibody was mischaracterized and the main target of SC35 mAb is SRRM2, a spliceosome-associated protein that sharply localizes to NS. Here we show that, the core of NS is likely formed by SON and SRRM2, since depletion of SON leads only to a partial disassembly of NS, while co-depletion of SON and SRRM2 or depletion of SON in a cell-line where intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of SRRM2 are genetically deleted, leads to a near-complete dissolution of NS. This work, therefore, paves the way to study the role of NS under diverse physiological and stress conditions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cells store their genetic material inside a compartment called the nucleus, which helps to separate DNA from other molecules in the cell. Inside the nucleus, DNA is tightly packed together with proteins that can read the cell’s genetic code and convert into the RNA molecules needed to build proteins. However, the contents of the nucleus are not randomly arranged, and these proteins are often clustered into specialized areas where they perform their designated roles.</p><p>One of the first nuclear territories to be identified were granular looking structures named Nuclear Speckles (or NS for short), which are thought to help process RNA before it leaves the nucleus. Structures like NS often contain a number of different factors held together by a core group of proteins known as a scaffold. Although NS were discovered over a century ago, little is known about their scaffold proteins, making it difficult to understand the precise role of these speckles.</p><p>Typically, researchers visualize NS using a substance called SC35 which targets specific sites in these structures. However, it was unclear which parts of the NS this marker binds to. To answer this question, Ilik et al. studied NS in human cells grown in the lab. The analysis revealed that SC35 attaches to certain parts of a large, flexible protein called SRRM2. Ilik et al. discovered that although the structure and sequence of SRMM2 varies between different animal species, a small region of this protein remained unchanged throughout evolution.</p><p>Studying the evolutionary history of SRRM2 led to the identification of another protein with similar properties called SON. Ilik et al. found that depleting SON and SRRM2 from human cells caused other proteins associated with the NS to diffuse away from their territories and become dispersed within the nucleus. This suggests that SRMM2 and SON make up the scaffold that holds the proteins in NS together.</p><p>Nuclear speckles have been associated with certain viral infections, and seem to help prevent the onset of diseases such as Huntington’s and spinocerebellar ataxia. These newly discovered core proteins could therefore further our understanding of the role NS play in disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nuclear speckles</kwd><kwd>LLPS</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>SRRM2</kwd><kwd>SON</kwd><kwd>SRSF2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Max Planck Research Group Leader Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aktaş</surname><given-names>Tuğçe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Re-characterization of the targets of a commonly used nuclear speckle marker unexpectedly leads to the discovery of the elusive core of the nuclear speckles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nuclear speckles (NS) are membraneless nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>) in the interchromatin-space of the nucleus that contain high concentrations of RNA-processing and some transcription factors but are devoid of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spector and Lamond, 2011</xref>). Under normal conditions, they appear as irregularly shaped, dynamic structures that show hallmarks of phase-separated condensates, such as fusion and deformation under pressure in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Belmont, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Despite their prevalence, the function of NS remains largely unknown, although they have been proposed to act as reservoirs for splicing factors, and association with NS have been shown to correlate with enhanced transcription and RNA-processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Belmont, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galganski et al., 2017</xref>). NS have been shown to be involved in replication of herpes simplex virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2011</xref>), processing and trafficking of Influenza A virus mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mor et al., 2016</xref>), detaining repetitive RNA originating from the transcription of repeat expanded loci that trigger Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia and dentatorubral–pallidoluysian atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Urbanek et al., 2016</xref>), but also repetitive RNA from artificial constructs that produce RNA capable of phase-separation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jain and Vale, 2017</xref>). Studying the role of NS involves visualizing them with a fluorescently tagged factor that localizes to NS, or the use of antibodies that show specific staining of NS. Similar to nucleoli and other membraneless bodies of the nucleus, NS disassemble during early stages of mitosis, and assemble back following telophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galganski et al., 2017</xref>). Several protein kinases are thought to be involved in this process, such as DYRK3, chemical inhibition of which leads to aberrant phase-separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rai et al., 2018</xref>). Overexpression of DYRK3, or CLK1 on the other hand leads to dissolution of NS in interphase cells, underscoring the importance of phosphorylation in NS integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sacco-Bubulya and Spector, 2002</xref>). Unlike several other biomolecular condensates, a specific core necessary for NS formation has not yet been identified, and it has been hypothesized that stochastic self-assembly of NS-associated factors could lead to the formation of NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dundr and Misteli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spector and Lamond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tripathi et al., 2012</xref>). One of the most frequently used reagents to locate NS is the monoclonal antibody SC35, which was raised against biochemically purified spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu and Maniatis, 1990</xref>), and reported to be an antibody against SRSF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu and Maniatis, 1992</xref>). Testament to the importance of this antibody, NS are also referred to as ‘SC35 domains’. Although, the name SC35 and SRSF2 are used synonymously and to annotate orthologues of SRSF2 not only in mammalian species but also in species such as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, mAb SC35 is reported to cross-react with SRSF1, and potentially with other SR-proteins as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neugebauer and Roth, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, fluorescently tagged SRSF2 shows staining patterns incompatible with mAb SC35 stainings under identical experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Politz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sakashita and Endo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tripathi and Parnaik, 2008</xref>). Intrigued by these inconsistencies, we undertook a systemic re-characterization of the mAb SC35 and its cellular targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IP-MS reveals endogenous targets of mAb SC35</title><p>In order to characterize the cellular targets of the SC35 mAb, we carried out an Immunoprecipitation Mass-Spectrometry (IP-MS) experiment. Whole-cell extracts prepared from HAP1 cells were used to immunoprecipitate endogenous targets SC35 mAb, with a matched IgG mAb serving as a control. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by mass-spectrometry (see Methods for details). In total, we identified 432 proteins that were significantly enriched in the SC35 purifications compared to controls (p&lt;0.05, at least two peptides detected in each biological replicate). Surprisingly, the most enriched protein in the dataset, both in terms of unique peptides detected, total intensities and MS/MS spectra analyzed, is neither SRSF2 nor one of the canonical SR-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manley and Krainer, 2010</xref>), but a high-molecular weight RNA-binding protein called SRRM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), an NS-associated protein with multiple RS-repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blencowe et al., 2000</xref>). Analysis of the top 108 targets, corresponding to the third quartile, using the STRING database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szklarczyk et al., 2019</xref>) shows a clear enrichment for the spliceosome and NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), validating the experimental approach. We were also able to detect all SR-proteins in our dataset, however their scores are dwarfed by that of SRRM2’s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, contrary to initial expectations, the IP-MS results strongly suggest but do not prove that SC35 mAb primarily recognizes SRRM2, at least in the context of an immunoprecipitation experiment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SC35 mAb immunoprecipitation followed by MS identifies SRRM2 as the top hit.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Top50 hits identified by the MS are depicted on a heatmap showing the number of unique peptides detected for each protein.

To this end, we cloned all 12 canonical SR-proteins in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manley and Krainer, 2010</xref>) into an expression plasmid, and created stable-cell lines expressing these proteins under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We used a biotin-acceptor peptide as a tag, and carried out stringent purifications using streptavidin beads to exclude non-specific co-purification of unrelated SR-proteins, and examined the eluates using immunoblotting. Surprisingly, our results show that the main target of mAb SC35 on these immunoblots is SRSF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which, when untagged, runs at approximately ~35 kDa on polyacrylamide gels similar to SRSF2 (the tag combination that we use shifts both proteins by ~15 kDa). To exclude any artefacts that could originate from the use of tagged proteins, we used whole-cell extracts from HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated targets of mAb SC35 and analyzed the eluates via immunoblotting. Consistent with the results of the IP-MS experiment, and tagged-SRSF1-12 purifications, we observed a very clear enrichment for SRRM2 and SRSF7, but not for SRSF2, SRSF1 or other factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In order to determine whether the 35 kDa band recognized by mAb SC35 in immunoblots of cellular lysates is composed of multiple proteins, in addition to SRSF7, we created a cell line where we inserted the FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> degron tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nabet et al., 2018</xref>) homozygously into the C-terminus of SRSF7 in HEK293 cells. Even without any treatment, it is evident that the 35 kDa band robustly recognized by mAb SC35 in wild-type cells completely disappears in SRSF7<sup>FKBP12</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2 with 3 and 4), and a new band around ~50 kDa, where the FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-tagged SRSF7 runs, emerges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, arrowhead). Treatment of these cells with 1 µM of dTAG7 for 6 hr lead to the depletion FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-tagged SRSF7, and to the depletion of the newly-emerged ~50 kDa protein recognized by mAb SC35. The identity of a fainter band around 37 kDa, which is insensitive to tagging SRSF7 or dTAG treatment remains unknown. These results strongly suggest that the 35 kDa namesake protein revealed by SC35 mAb on immunoblots is SRSF7 and any contribution to this signal from other proteins is negligible to none.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SRRM2 is the primary target of mAb SC35 in immunoblots</title><p>Even though our results show that SC35 mAb specifically recognizes SRSF7 rather than SRSF2, both proteins have significant nucleoplasmic pools in addition to their localization to NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Politz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prasanth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sapra et al., 2009</xref>) which is not easily reconciled with the immunofluorescence stainings obtained with the SC35 mAb that are virtually restricted to NS. Intriguingly, SRRM2, which is by far the most enriched protein in our immunoprecipitations with mAb SC35, is a relatively large (~300 kDa) protein, that readily co-purifies with spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bessonov et al., 2010</xref>), shows liquid-like behaviour in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rai et al., 2018</xref>) and co-localizes near-perfectly with mAb SC35-stained NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miyagawa et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, SRRM2 and its yeast counterpart Cwc21/Cwf21 is located in the recent cryo-EM structures of the spliceosome, where it joins the spliceosome at the B<sup>act</sup> stage where it seems to support the activated conformation of PRP8’s switch-loop both in humans and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jia and Sun, 2018</xref>). Predating the recent cryo-EM structures by almost a decade, the yeast orthologue of SRRM2, Cwf21p, has been shown to directly interact with Prp8p (PRPF8) and Snu114p (EFTUD2) which are also among the most enriched proteins in our mAb SC35 immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grainger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, a more recent tandem-affinity purification of the protist <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> orthologue of SRRM2 revealed Prp8, U5-200K (SNRNP200, also known as Brr2), U5-116K (EFTUD2, also known as Snu114) and U5-40K (SNRNP40) as major interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Silva et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Taking into consideration the fact the mAb SC35 was raised against biochemically purified spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu and Maniatis, 1990</xref>), together with the aforementioned observations in the scientific literature and our IP-MS results which identified SRRM2 as the top target, we hypothesize that mAb SC35 was most likely raised against SRRM2, and it recognizes SRRM2 in most if not all immunological assays that utilizes mAb SC35 where SRRM2 is not depleted or unintentionally omitted due to technical reasons.</p><p>In order to test the veracity of this claim, we designed a series of experiments in human cells. Since, to our knowledge, SC35 mAb has not been shown to recognize SRRM2 on immunoblots, we first created tagged and truncated SRRM2 constructs in living cells. To this end, we generated 11 cell lines that remove between 4 and 2322 amino acids from the SRRM2 protein (full-length: 2752 a.a., numbering from Q9UQ35-1) by inserting a TagGFP2 (referred to as GFP for simplicity) sequence followed by an SV40 polyadenylation signal into 11 positions of the <italic>SRRM2</italic> gene in HAP1 cells using a CRISPR/Cas9-based technique called CRISPaint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmid-Burgk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The deepest truncation removes 84% of SRRM2, which includes almost all its IDRs, together with two regions enriched for serine and arginine residues, leaving behind 13 RS-dipeptides out of a total of 173 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

The immunoblot with mAb SC35 once again clearly shows that near-full-length SRRM2<sup>tr0</sup> is recognized by mAb SC35 to the same extent as the SRRM2 polyclonal antibody, while SRRM2<sup>tr10</sup> is not detected by mAb SC35 at all but strongly with SRRM2 polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These blots also show that full-length SRRM2 co-purifies SRRM1 and to a lesser extent RBM25, while both interactions are severely compromised in SRRM2<sup>tr10</sup>. Furthermore, the absence of any signal in SRRM2<sup>tr10</sup> input lane probed with mAb SC35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, top left lane 3), and the emergence of a shorter ~100 kDa protein in the complete absence of a ~300 kDa signal in the SRRM2 blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, bottom left, lane 3) shows that SRRM2<sup>tr10</sup> cells have a homozygous insertion of the GFP construct, which was also confirmed by genotyping PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This result further indicates that the large IDRs of SRRM2 are not essential for cell viability, at least in HAP1 cells.</p><p>These results can be puzzling, since we first show that mAb SC35 specifically recognizes a 35 kDa band which we reveal to be SRSF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), but later, in a separate set of experiments, we also show that mAb SC35 specifically recognizes a ~300 kDa band, which we reveal to be SRRM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), while the original study describing mAb SC35 reports a single 35 kDa band recognized by mAb SC35 on immunoblots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu and Maniatis, 1990</xref>). The solution to this conundrum presented itself in the form of altering the immunoblotting technique. Using whole-cell extracts prepared from wild-type cells, together with SRRM2<sup>tr0</sup> and SRRM2tr<sup>10</sup> cells, in a gel system where we can interrogate both small and large proteins simultaneously, we were able to detect both SRRM2 and SRSF7 on the same blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These blots prove that the ~300 kDa band is indeed SRRM2, since it completely disappears in SRRM2<sup>tr10</sup> lysates (which is accompanied by the appearance of a ~100 kDa band in SRRM2 blots) while the much fainter 35 kDa band corresponding to SRSF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) remains unaltered.</p><p>These experiments provide strong support for our hypothesis that the main target of SC35 mAb is SRRM2, a protein proven to be part of spliceosomes, against which this antibody was raised, and suggests that a cross-reactivity towards SRSF7, likely in combination with immunoblotting techniques not suitable to detect large proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass et al., 2017</xref>), obscured this fact for more than two decades.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SRRM2 is the primary target of mAb SC35 in immunofluorescence stainings</title><p>mAb SC35 is typically used as an antibody in immunofluorescence experiments that reveals the location of NS in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spector and Lamond, 2011</xref>). In light of the evidence presented here, it can be assumed that mAb SC35 primarily stains SRRM2 in immunofluorescence stainings, as in immunoblotting experiments. In order to test if this is indeed the case, we took advantage of the SRRM2<sup>tr10</sup> cells.

As an additional control, we also mixed SRRM2<sup>tr10</sup> cells with SRRM2<sup>tr0</sup> cells together before formaldehyde fixation, and repeated the antibody stainings, in order to be able to image these two cell populations side-by-side. SRRM2<sup>tr10</sup> and SRRM2<sup>tr0</sup> cells are easily distinguished from each other since the latter show a typical nuclear speckle staining whereas the former has a more diffuse, lower intensity GFP signal. These images clearly show that mAb SC35, obtained from two separate vendors, no longer stains NS or any other structure in SRRM2<sup>tr10</sup> cells, whereas other NS markers, including SRSF7, appear unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>SRRM2 truncation#10 leads to loss of SC35 domains but not NS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SON and RBM25 antibodies are used as NS markers for IF analysis of both SRRM2<sup>tr0</sup> and SRRM2<sup>tr10</sup> HAP1 cells.

Similar to the HAP1 model, depletion of SON alone leads to collapsed NS where SRRM2, RBM25, PNN, and SRRM1 localize to spherical NS to some extent but with a significant non-NS pool in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Depletion of SRRM2 alone also leads to delocalization of PNN, SRRM1, and RBM25 from NS, but not to the extent seen with SON depletion. Co-depletion of SON and SRRM2 leads to near-complete delocalization of all proteins investigated, mirroring the results obtained from the HAP1 model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A,B,C and D</xref>). These results cannot be explained by reduced protein stabilities, as none of the proteins except for SON and SRRM2 show significant changes in their amounts as judged by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4E</xref>). Finally, co-depletion of SON together with SRRM1 or RBM25 does not lead to diffusion of spherical NS marked by SRRM2, indicating that SRRM2 has a unique role in NS formation and cannot be substituted by other NS-associated factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results have broad implications with respect to the biology in and around NS. One of the primary culprits in the so-called ‘reproducibility crisis’ in natural sciences is considered to be mischaracterized antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker, 2015</xref>), which led to initiatives to validate them appropriately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uhlen et al., 2016</xref>), and large consortia such as ENCODE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis et al., 2018</xref>) publishes specific guidelines for the characterization antibodies that are used to generate data pertinent to the ENCODE project (‘<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">ENCODE, 2020</xref>,’ n.d.).</p><p>It is therefore reasonable to suspect that the dissonance between observations made with mAb SC35 and subsequent observations made with SRSF2 reagents could have led to misinterpretation of vast amounts of primary data. It is beyond the scope of this work to review each and every study that has used this antibody in the last 30 years, however, since both <italic>SRSF2</italic> and <italic>SRRM2</italic> are clinically important genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anczuków and Krainer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Inoue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meggendorfer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shehadeh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tomsic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoshimi et al., 2019</xref>), and SRRM2 gene is highly to intolerant to loss-of-function mutations in human populations (expected/observed ratio for <italic>SRRM2</italic> is 6%, median expected/observed ratio for all gene variants is 48%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karczewski et al., 2020</xref>), the opportunity cost incurred when results generated with mAb SC35 have been misinterpreted must be carefully considered.</p><p>For example, GSK-3, a protein kinase implicated in Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhat et al., 2018</xref>), has been shown to phosphorylate SRSF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hernández et al., 2004</xref>). This study reported that inhibition of GSK-3 leads to spherical NS in cortical neurons, which was interpreted as SRSF2 accumulating at NS upon GSK-3 inhibition. Based on this assumption, a cerebral cortex lysate was immunoprecipitated with mAb SC35, and a 35 kDa band was shown to be phosphorylated by recombinant GSK-3, whereas neither SRSF7 nor SRRM2 were pursued as potential candidates. Interestingly, a more recent study reported that SRRM2 is a target of GSK-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2017</xref>). In another study, mAb SC35 has been used as a reporter for phosphorylated SRSF2 in immunohistochemical analysis of tissue samples obtained from patients with Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gout et al., 2012</xref>), and was reported to be upregulated in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. SRRM2's potential role in these syndromes therefore remains unexplored.</p><p>In a more non-clinical setting, recent microscopy work suggests that RNA polymerase II, through its intrinsically disordered CTD, switches from transcriptional condensates to NS during progression from initiation to productive elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2019</xref>), which is in line with recent work that links NS to augmented gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Belmont, 2019</xref>). In this particular work, initial observations made with the SC35 mAb have been followed by fluorescently tagged SRSF2 protein for live-cell imaging analysis and condensates formed by SRSF2 are used as a surrogate for splicing condensates in vitro. Furthermore, ChIP-seq profiles generated with mAb SC35 were interpreted as SRSF2 occupancy in vivo, which was shown to be enriched at the 3’-ends of genes, together with serine-2 phosphorylated RNAPII. SRRM2’s potential role in these processes remains unknown. In another study, loss of mAb SC35 signal in cells treated with siRNAs against SRRM2 has been interpreted to be a sign of NS disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miyagawa et al., 2012</xref>), and based on this knowledge, a more recent study interrogated the 3D conformation of the mouse genome in SRRM2-depleted cells using Hi-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2019</xref>), results of which are interpreted to be a consequence of NS disruption. A recent super resolution microscopy study made use of the mAb SC35 to show that SRSF2 is at the core of NS together with SON, and remains at the core after depletion of SON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fei et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, a minimalist computational model was used to model the distribution of five NS-associated factors (SON, SRSF2 on account of SC35 mAb stainings, MALAT1, U1, and U2B'') which could have benefited from the knowledge that SC35 mAb stains SRRM2 rather than SRSF2, considering that pairwise interactions between SRRM2 and other components would be drastically different to SRSF2's potential interactions due to the extensive IDRs of SRRM2 compared to SRSF2. This study also highlights the fact that a crucial aspect of nuclear speckle biology, namely whether NS are nucleated by specific factors or not, remained an open question.</p><p>In contrast, many membraneless organelles have been shown to depend on a small number of factors which act as scaffolds or nucleation points for their formation. Paraspeckles for instance require lncRNA NEAT1, without which paraspeckles do not form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Carmichael, 2009</xref>), Cajal bodies are disrupted or disappear in the absence of COILIN, SMN, FAM118B or WRAP53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mahmoudi et al., 2010</xref>), and PML bodies are nucleated by PML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lallemand-Breitenbach and de Thé, 2010</xref>). In the same vein, SRRM2 has been suggested to be essential for the formation of NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miyagawa et al., 2012</xref>), however, this idea was based on the disappearance of mAb SC35 signal in cells transfected with siRNAs against SRRM2, which is the expected result taking the evidence presented here into account, but does not prove that SRRM2 is essential or important for NS formation. Other candidates that were put forward as essential or important for the formation of NS include lncRNA MALAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakagawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tripathi et al., 2010</xref>), SRSF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tripathi et al., 2012</xref>), PNN, and SON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>), all of which, with the exception of PNN, lead to the formation of ‘collapsed’ speckles rather than a bulk release of NS-associated factors and their diffusion into the nucleoplasm, which would indicate a true loss of NS. Depletion of PNN was shown to either lead to ‘collapsed’ speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Joo et al., 2005</xref>) or to loss of NS altogether, but under conditions that also lead to degradation of all SR-proteins tested in that particular study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiu and Ouyang, 2006</xref>). To our knowledge, NS could only be successfully dissolved by overexpression of CLK1/STY kinase, which phosphorylates SR-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sacco-Bubulya and Spector, 2002</xref>), DYRK3, another protein kinase that can dissolve multiple membraneless bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rai et al., 2018</xref>), overexpression of PPIG, a peptidyl-proline isomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2004</xref>) or more recently by overexpression of TNPO3, which is an import factor that binds to phosphorylated SR-residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hochberg-Laufer et al., 2019</xref>). Such observations and lack of evidence to the contrary, led to the idea that NS formation happens through stochastic self-assembly of NS-associated factors, without the need for an organizing core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dundr and Misteli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spector and Lamond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tripathi et al., 2012</xref>). In this work, we show that the spherical bodies left over after depletion of SON, which are strongly stained with mAb SC35, and also by other NS markers such as SRRM1, PNN, RBM25 can be dissolved by either co-depleting SRRM2 together with SON, or depleting SON in a cell-line where we deleted the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of SRRM2. Co-depletion of SON together with either SRRM1 or RBM25, two relatively large proteins that also possess prominent intrinsically disordered regions and localize to NS, does not lead to the dissolution of left-over NS, which remain as spherical bodies strongly stained with SRRM2. Since SON is essential for mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>), conditions reported here therefore open an approximately 24 hr window to study the transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects of lacking NS in human cells.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, our results show that a widely-used monoclonal antibody to mark NS, SC35 mAb, was most likely raised against SRRM2 and not against SRSF2 as it was initially reported. We speculate that this mischaracterization hindered the identification of the core of NS, without which NS do not form, which we show to consist most likely of SON and SRRM2. We found that these two factors, unlike other splicing related proteins analyzed, have gone through a remarkable length extension through evolution of metazoa over the last ~0.6–1.2 billion years, mostly within their IDRs which are typically involved in LLPS and formation of biomolecular condensates. The exact mechanism of NS formation by SON together with SRRM2, and the evolutionary forces that led to the dramatic changes in their lengths remain to be discovered.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

lines</title><p>Flp-In T-REx HEK293 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: R78007) cells were cultured according to manufacturer’s recommendations. The cells were cultured in DMEM with Glutamax supplemented with Na-Pyruvate and High Glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: 31966–021) in the presence of 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: 10270106) and Penicillin/Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: 15140–122). Before the introduction of the transgenes cells were cultured with a final concentration of 100 µg/mL zeocin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: R250-01) and 15 µg/mL blasticidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: A1113903). To generate the stable cell lines pOG44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: V600520) was co-transfected with pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: V652020) containing the gene of interest (GOI are SRSF1 to 12 in this case) in a 9:1 ratio. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: 11668019) on a 6-well plate format with total 1 µg DNA (i.e. 900 ng of pOG44 and 100 ng of pcDNA5/FRT/TO+GOI) according to the transfection protocol provided by the manufacturer. 24 hr after the transfection cells were split on 3 wells of a 6-well plate at 1:6, 2:6 and 3:6 dilution ratios to allow efficient selection of Hygromycin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: 10687010). The Hygromycin selection was started at the 48 hr after transfection time point with a final concentration of 150 µg/mL and refreshed every 3–4 days until the control non-transfected cells on a separate plate were completely dead (takes approximately 3 weeks from the start of transfection until the cells are expanded and frozen). Induction of the transgene was done over-night with a final concentration of 0.1 µg/mL doxycycline. The cells were validated by performing immunofluorescence by FLAG antibody and western blotting of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions.</p><p>Human HAP1 parental control cell line was purchased from Horizon (Catalog Number: C631) and cultured according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The cells were cultured in IMDM (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: 12440–053) in the presence of 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: 10270106) and Penicillin/Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: 15140–122). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for the list of sgRNAs used in generation of cell lines with CRISPaint. Cells were co-transfected with three plasmids according to the CRISPaint protocol. Cas9 and sgRNA are provided by same plasmid in 0.5 µg final amount, Frame selector plasmid (depending on the cut site selector 0, +1 or +2 had to be chosen) is also in 0.5 µg final amount, the TagGFP2_CRISPaint plasmid was provided at a 1 µg final amount. Therefore the total 2 µg DNA was transfected into cells on 6-well plate format using Lipofectamine 2000. 24 hr after the transfection the cells were expanded on 10 cm culture plates to allow efficient Puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: A1113803) selection. The Puromycin selection is provided in the tag construct and is driven by the expression from the gene locus (in this case the human <italic>SRRM2</italic> gene locus). Puromycin selection was started at 48 hr after transfection at 1 µg/mL final concentration and was refreshed every 2 days and in total was kept for 6 days. After the colonies grew to a visible size the colonies were picked by the aid of fluorescence microscope EVOS M5000. PCR screening of the colonies was performed using genotyping oligos listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> using Quick Extract DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen Catalog Number: QE09050) according to manufacturer’s protocol in a PCR machine and DreamTaq Green Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog Number: K1081) using 58°C annealing temperature and 1 min extension time.</p><p>SRSF7-FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> knock-in cells were generated in HEK293T cells (ordered from ATCC, CRL3216 and cultured according to the protocol provided) by co-transfecting the sgRNA, Frame selector and mini-circle constructs prepared according to the CRISPaint protocol using Lipofectamine 2000 on a 6-well plate format. This time we used two separate tag donor plasmids to increase the chances of obtaining homozygous clones. The constructs were identical except for the selection antibiotic. Cells are expanded on 10 cm culture plates 24 hr after transfection. At 48 hr after transfection the double selection was initiated. One allele was selected by Puromycin at 1 µg/mL final concentration, whereas the other allele was selected by blasticidin at 15 µg/mL final concentration for 6 days in total. After the removal of selection cells were kept on the same plate until there were big enough colonies. Colonies were picked under a sterile workbench and screened for homozygosity using western blotting with SRSF7 antibody. The degradation of tagged-SRSF7 was induced by adding dTAG7 reagent at a final 1 µM concentration and keeping for 6 hr.</p><p>SRRM2<sup>tr0</sup>-GFP Flp-In TREx HEK293 cells were generated using the same strategy as described above for HAP1 cells.

For alkylation, chloroacetamide was added with a final concentration of 24 mM at room temperature on a rocking platform (500 rpm) for 30 min. Then, proteins were digested with 200 ng trypsin (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) shaking at 600 rpm at 37°C for 17 hr. Samples were acidified by adding 2.2 µL 100% formic acid, centrifuged shortly, and placed on the magnetic rack. The supernatants, containing the digested peptides, were transferred to a new low protein binding tube. Peptide desalting was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce C18 Tips, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).

provides surprising and important insight into a commonly used mAb and valuable new perspectives on nuclear speckles, perspectives that have the potential to transform future studies. The study will be of broad interest to those interested in splicing, nuclear speckles, antibody specificity, and more generally, liquid-liquid phase separation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;SON and SRRM2 form nuclear speckles in human cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jonathan P Staley as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study has yielded two significant contributions. First, the study recharacterized a widely used antibody, mAb SC35, which was initially raised against the spliceosome and characterized both as targeting the 35 kDa protein, SRSF2, an intensely studied splicing regulatory factor, and as marking nuclear speckles, which in the last several years have attracted significant attention for their association with transcriptionally active chromosome regions (after largely being ignored by most for the previous 20 years). The authors present a series of rigorously designed and carefully carried out experiments demonstrating that the 35 kDa factor that mAb recognizes is instead SRSF7. Moreover, the authors present compelling evidence that the primary target of mAb SC35 is a ~300 kDa protein, SRRM2, a spliceosomal factor originally discovered as a nuclear matrix factor and later defined as a nuclear speckle component. In the most convincing experiments establishing these targets the authors show that mAb SC35 signals shift, when the molecular weight of SRSF7 or SRRM2 is varied, and that the signal disappears when SRSF7 is depleted. Given the use of mAb SC35 for nearly three decades, these results suggest that tens if not hundreds of papers require re-interpretation. This study reminds us again the necessity of rigorous validation of antibodies.</p><p>Second, the authors investigate the role of SRRM2 in the formation of nuclear speckles. Previous studies have shown that knock down of the nuclear speckle factor SON leads to a compaction of nuclear speckles but not their entire dissolution, implicating a role for at least one additional factor in nuclear speckle formation; other studies have implicated an array of factors as being required for nuclear speckle formation. Here, the authors show that truncation or knock down of SRRM2, in contrast to several other nuclear speckles factors, also reduce nuclear speckle number, although more modestly than SON, and the truncation or knockdown of SRRM2 in combination with the depletion of SON reduces nuclear speckles more than SON depletion alone. The authors interpret these findings to indicate that SON and SRRM2, both of which harbor intrinsically-disordered domains, form nuclear speckles in human cells, as the title indicates. Further, the authors suggest that the double knockdown provides a new tool to study nuclear speckle function. Overall, this study provides surprising and important insight into a commonly used mAb and valuable new perspectives on nuclear speckles, which have the potential to transform future studies. The study will be of broad interest to those interested in splicing, nuclear speckles, antibody specificity, and more generally, liquid-liquid phase separation. We recommend this paper for publication, once the comments are addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the significance of SON and SRRM2 to nuclear speckles, the authors need to address the following concerns:</p><p>a) The title and the conclusion that SON and SRRM2 form nuclear speckles are not supported by the data. The data show that SON and SRRM2 are necessary for nuclear speckle formation. They do not rule out that another factor is necessary, such as SRRM1, which interacts with SRRM2 and itself harbors an intrinsically-disordered domain; just one protein that is not bound by SON or SRRM2 but still stains nuclear speckles after the double KD would be inconsistent with their hypothesis. The authors have not shown that SON and SRRM2 are also sufficient for nuclear speckle formation. In the absence of new data, the authors need to moderate their conclusions (and title) accordingly.</p><p>b) The Abstract implies that the demonstration of SON as a central component of speckles is new (&quot;elusive core&quot;). As appropriately referenced in the text, this is not the case, rather SON is often used as a marker for nuclear speckles, and SON has long been considered to be part of the core of speckles, as knock-down has been documented by several groups to disrupt speckles. The wording in the Abstract should therefore be more parsimonious.</p><p>2) The kinase manipulations, discussed in this paper, to eliminate nuclear speckles for experimental purposes are concerning, because such cells appear very sick after these manipulations. Our own experience indicates that the cells after a double, SON/SRRM2 KD also are not very normal. If the authors suggest the SON and SRRM2 double KD as an experimental tool to disrupt nuclear speckles in order to access nuclear speckle function, then it is essential that they indicate cell toxicity, etc. Many SR-protein KDs for example do not allow selection of stable cells. What about this double KD?</p><p>3) In principle, in the immunofluorescence studies, the disappearance of mAb SC35 signal on depletion of SRRM2 does not alone prove that SRRM2 is what is visualized by the mAb SC35 in such assays. Given that this paper seeks to establish rigorously that mAb SC35 marks nuclear speckles by recognition of SRRM2, given that SRSF7 is recognized by the antibody on blots, and given that SRSF2 has been traditionally presumed the target of mAb SC35 in nuclear speckles, the rigor of this study demands that SRFS7 and SRSF2 be visualized in cells in the presence of an SRRM2 truncation to rule out that either SRSF7 or SRSF2 phenocopy SRRM2 in this assay. Alternatively, the authors need to recognize this possibility as a caveat to their conclusions.</p><p>4) Since the 1990s it has been widely known that the SC-35 mAb has very limited specificity for denatured proteins and was not suitable for immunoblots (see abcam page for ab11826). Indeed, the assumption has always been that it recognizes a folded epitope. Therefore, the use of western blots to conclude anything about the specificity of this antibody is questionable at best, inappropriate at worst. The authors need to address this concern and adjust the manuscript accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60579.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the significance of SON and SRRM2 to nuclear speckles, the authors need to address the following concerns:</p><p>a) The title and the conclusion that SON and SRRM2 form nuclear speckles are not supported by the data.

To this end, we performed a co-depletion of SON and SRRM1 (shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 5) in a cell line that has a TagGFP2 inserted into SRRM2 gene locus. As it can be seen from the imaging presented in this figure for 4 individual cells (but also more generally on 10 independent field imaged, (data not shown)) we did not score a reduction in the GFP intensity, or dissolution of the spherical bodies as is the case in SON-SRRM2 co-depleted cells. We observed the nuclear speckles have the round-up morphology, that is seen upon SON-KD, but are not dissolved shown with PNN staining and SRRM2-TagGFP signals. Moreover, we performed a co-depletion of RBM25 (another strongly NS-associated protein also used as a NS-marker) and SON which did not result in the dissolution of nuclear speckles (Figure 5—figure supplement 5). Therefore, we have reached to the conclusion that SON and SRRM2 form nuclear speckles with the contribution of SON being more important for the formation and titled our study accordingly.</p><p>However, as the reviewer has pointed out, we have not shown that speckles can be reformed by introducing ectopically expressed SON/SRRM2 into cells which now appear not to have nuclear speckles. This would indeed be the formal proof showing that SON/SRRM2 are not just necessary but also sufficient to form nuclear speckles. Such an experiment is quite challenging due to the length of these proteins and difficulty in establishing conditions where one can express these proteins, but not overexpress them which leads to round-up speckles (as shown and discussed by Belmont lab). Therefore, we will change the title to “SON and SRRM2 are essential for nuclear speckle formation” to better reflect our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The Abstract implies that the demonstration of SON as a central component of speckles is new (&quot;elusive core&quot;).

Indeed, it is clear that SON is a crucial part of NS, likely the most important component for the integrity of speckles. However, in all of these previous studies, RNAi-mediated depletion of SON, without exception, leaves behind spherical bodies that are strongly stained with mAb SC35, that also harbor other NS-markers (which we also show). This is of course not new, as we also appropriately cited previous work, however being able to dissolve these “left-over” speckles by co-depletion of SRRM2, and perhaps more importantly by deletion of the SRRM2’s C-terminal region is indeed novel.</p><p>In essence, our results show that in the absence of SON, as shown by previous work as well, NS-associated proteins are still able to organize themselves into nuclear bodies, indicating that either all other SR-proteins without the need of another organizer clump together, or another factor (or factors) is still acting as an organizer. When we remove the C-terminus of SRRM2, which we show is the primary target of SC-35, which strongly stains these left-over nuclear bodies in the absence of SON, then deplete SON, all NS markers that we could find become diffuse, indicating that nuclear speckles no longer exist, or become too small to be detected or classified as “nuclear bodies”. Co-depletion of SON and SRRM2 leads to the same phenotype, but co-depletion of SON and SRRM1 (or RBM25) doesn’t, leaving behind spherical nuclear speckles that harbor SRRM2 which are no different than SON KD cells.</p><p>We modified the Abstract and removed the word “elusive” in consideration of this comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The kinase manipulations, discussed in this paper, to eliminate nuclear speckles for experimental purposes are concerning, because such cells appear very sick after these manipulations.

Here, we have used the cells 24 hours after transfection (~18 hours of knock-down) as the primary reason being that SON-KD caused a mitotic arrest if the cells were kept longer in culture. This was reported earlier in Sharma et al., 2010. There was no additional severity in the phenotype when the SON-KD was combined with SRRM2-KD, therefore we believe the arrest phenotype we scored is mainly due to depletion SON. In this sense, double-depletion of SON and SRRM2 can be used to study the effects of not having NS (transcription, post-transcriptional, topological), but certainly within a time-frame of around 24 hours in cells that haven’t gone through mitosis. We added a clarifying statement at the end of the new “Discussion” section to avoid any misunderstanding as pointed by the reviewer. Faster depletion strategies, and/or a system where cells are mitotically arrested would be required to observe long term effects more reliably.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In principle, in the immunofluorescence studies, the disappearance of mAb SC35 signal on depletion of SRRM2 does not alone prove that SRRM2 is what is visualized by the mAb SC35 in such assays.

Alternatively, the authors need to recognize this possibility as a caveat to their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Traditionally, because of the Fu and Maniatis 1992 paper, as pointed out by the reviewer, it is assumed that SC-35 recognizes SRSF2 in immunofluorescence experiments and potentially multiple SR-proteins in immunoblots. The former point, to the best of our knowledge, has never really been proven in any type of rigorous experiment. Fu lab. has generated SRSF2 K/O mice, but never provided an immunofluorescence image that shows that SC-35 signal disappears in K/O cells.</p><p>Just to summarize our line of reasoning here:</p><p>1) We do an unbiased IP-MS experiment, which shows that SRRM2 is the top candidate protein, at least an order of magnitude away from any other protein in the dataset by any measure. This strongly suggest that SRRM2 is the primary target of this antibody, although doesn’t prove it due to technical reasons i.e. no input normalization, some proteins produce more ‘mass-specable’ peptides than others, and larger proteins tend to produce more peptides.</p><p>2) We carry out a biased screen of 12 SR-proteins and find that SRSF7 is strongly recognized by mAb SC-35</p><p>3) We do IP-western blotting experiments, which correct for input and are not affected by relative ‘mass-specable’ peptide issues or protein sizes, which reveal a strong enrichment of SRRM2 (&gt;10% of input), some enrichment for SRSF7 (~2% of input) and no enrichment for SRSF2, SRSF1 or other proteins that we have tested.</p><p>4) Since the “35kDa” protein is so engrained with the history of this antibody and our results were most consistent with the idea that this protein is SRSF7 rather than anything else, we insert a degron tag to SRSF7. If the hypothesis is true, then we expect a shift of the SC-35 band, concomitant to the shift in SRSF7, which is indeed the case. This is not proof that SC-35 doesn’t recognize any other protein but it does provide very strong evidence (combined with the other two experiments) that the 35kDa band detected by SC-35 in immunoblots is in fact SRSF7.</p><p>5) We then show, by TagGFP2 insertion into the SRRM2 locus, that SC-35 mAb can recognize SRRM2 specifically on immunoblots, and furthermore truncations beyond a certain point completely eliminates this signal. We also show later that siRNA mediated KD of SRRM2 also leads to the elimination of the signal from immunoblots (Figure 5—figure supplement 4).</p><p>6) Combining the results so far, we address the issue of immunofluorescence, i.e. which protein or proteins are responsible for this signal. We think there are two possible scenarios that could both be true based on the presented evidence so far:</p><p>a) This signal is mainly, if not entirely, originates from SRRM2.</p><p>b) The signal is a combination of SRRM2, SRSF7 and/or other SR-proteins that the SC-35 might be cross-reacting.</p><p>7) We then take advantage of our cell lines with SRRM2 truncations. These truncated SRRM2 version are not recognized by SC-35 mAb on immunoblots, therefore it is reasonable to suspect that they will not be recognized by SC-35 mAb in immunofluorescence as well.</p><p>8) If scenario (b) is correct and nuclear speckles are still intact in these cells (which we show that they are indeed intact, judged by SON, RBM25 and SRRM1 stainings Figure 3A-B), then we would expect either no change in SC-35 signal, or a somewhat reduced signal. We see a complete loss of signal.</p><p>9) Being extra careful with this result, we also mix the control cell line and SRRM2-truncated cells and image them side-by-side to address any issues related to imaging settings etc. There is no detectable SC-35 signal in truncated cells.</p><p>10) We also show that the 35kDa band is still unchanged in SRRM2 truncated cells (Figure 2E), showing that SRSF7 itself is not affected in these cells.</p><p>These results, combined together, show that SC-35 signal in immunofluorescence originates from SRRM2, and any other signal potentially contributed by other proteins are below the detection of immunofluorescence microscopy.</p><p>We now also additionally provide an IF image that shows SRSF7 staining in tr0 and tr10 cells, imaged side-by-side, showing no observable change in SRSF7 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Surprisingly in the historical context, not so surprisingly with the evidence we provide here, we couldn’t find an SRSF2 antibody that shows a significant enrichment of SRSF2 in nuclear speckles (we tried abcam ab204916 and Millipore # 04-1550). The transgene we created can be seen to weakly localized to nuclear speckles Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, we also created an endogenously TagGFP2-tagged SRSF2 that is also weakly localized to nuclear speckles (data not shown). We also haven’t come across a published work that uses a specific SRSF2 antibody (that is, any antibody but SC-35) and shows that SRSF2 co-localizes with another NS marker. Every study that we could find, including all work from the Fu lab., uses transgenic SRSF2 and show that this ectopically expressed form somewhat localizes to NS.</p><p>We do acknowledge two caveats though:</p><p>1) Our results are all obtained from human cells, which is a reasonable choice of model since the antibody was raised against a human spliceosomal preparation. However, SC-35 mAb has been used by in non-human cells as well. While our results will likely hold in other mammalian species, as we show in our evolutionary analysis, this may not be the case for other species since SRRM2’s C-terminus, part of which is recognized by SC-35, shows a remarkable variation in length and composition. Therefore, we cannot know what this antibody may or may not stain in these organisms.</p><p>2) Nuclear speckles completely break down and then re-assemble during mitosis. This event might transiently hide or reveal epitopes that might be recognized by SC-35. We haven’t addressed this issue in this manuscript.</p><p>We therefore added the following statement to clarify these points:</p><p>“It is important to note that these results were obtained from unsynchronised human cells, which are mostly at the interphase stage of the cell-cycle. mAb SC35 might recognise additional targets in mitotic cells or cells derived from non-mammalian species.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Since the 1990s it has been widely known that the SC-35 mAb has very limited specificity for denatured proteins and was not suitable for immunoblots (see abcam page for ab11826). Indeed, the assumption has always been that it recognizes a folded epitope. Therefore, the use of western blots to conclude anything about the specificity of this antibody is questionable at best, inappropriate at worst. The authors need to address this concern and adjust the manuscript accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>With all due respect to all previous researchers that have used mAb SC35 and published their results, we think that the specificity issue has probably become unnecessarily convoluted due to the initial inaccurate characterization. abcam’s recommendations highlight the issue in an interesting way. In the old marketing images, abcam shows a single band in a total lysate prepared from HEK293 cells:</p><p>https://www.abcam.com/ps/products/11/ab11826/reviews/images/ab11826_49518.jpg.</p><p>However, producing such an image, in our experience as we have also reported in the manuscript, is only possible under non-ideal western-blotting conditions i.e. when the transfer is not adequate to reveal proteins with large molecular weights. Intriguingly, a customer (not us) complains about an improper WB result obtained with this antibody (with a 2-star rating):</p><p>https://www.abcam.com/sc35-antibody-sc-35-nuclear-speckle-marker-ab11826/reviews/68414?productWallTab=ShowAll</p><p>It looks like an unexplainable high-molecular smear without the information that we provide in our manuscript, but in light of it, it’s clear that protein stained here is SRRM2.</p><p>In our experience the antibody works perfectly fine for western blotting, and very specifically and robustly reveals SRRM2 at ~300kDa, as long as the immunoblotting conditions are optimized for large proteins. We also show that bulk of the signal around 35kDa originates from SRSF7, however as indicated by the other reviewer’s comments, and also previous research, the antibody probably cross-reacts with other proteins as well with varying degree.</p><p>In this sense, the antibody can be used for immunoblotting, but pretty much any result obtained from such an experiment must be verified with an independent antibody or independent methods, which we did in this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
