trafficking. A prominent example is the microtubule-dependent transport of mRNAs and associated ribosomes on endosomes. This coordinated process is crucial for correct septin filamentation and efficient growth of polarised cells, such as fungal hyphae. Despite detailed knowledge on the key RNA-binding protein and the molecular motors involved, it is unclear how mRNAs are connected to membranes during transport. Here, we identify a novel factor containing a FYVE zinc finger domain for interaction with endosomal lipids and a new PAM2-like domain required for interaction with the MLLE domain of the key RNA-binding protein. Consistently, loss of this FYVE domain protein leads to specific defects in mRNA, ribosome, and septin transport without affecting general functions of endosomes or their movement. Hence, this is the first endosomal component specific for mRNP trafficking uncovering a new mechanism to couple mRNPs to endosomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06041.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06041.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06041.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA contains the instructions to build proteins. These instructions are first copied to make a molecule of messenger RNA (or mRNA for short). A large machine called the ribosome then reads the mRNA molecule and translates it to build a protein.</p><p>Many proteins must get to particular locations in a cell to carry out their roles. For some proteins, this is achieved by transporting the mRNAs to the right location before they get translated, via a process called ‘mRNA trafficking’. However, mRNAs do not move by themselves; instead they bind to a host of mRNA-binding proteins, and the ribosomes that are required for translation to take place. Cells also move proteins between different locations using small bubble-like structures called vesicles. These vesicles are surrounded by a membrane, and so this process is known as ‘membrane trafficking’. Previous work has shown that these two processes are often linked, as vesicles can also carry mRNA molecules. But it is not fully understood how mRNA molecules are connected to vesicles.</p><p>Now, Pohlmann et al. have used a fungus called <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> as a model system to investigate how mRNAs and vesicles can move together in cells that grow to form filament-like structures called hyphae. This fungus uses these filaments to penetrate into plant tissues and causes a disease called corn smut. The experiments revealed a vesicle protein called Upa1 that contains a new type of binding site that allows Upa1 to bring an important RNA-binding protein to the surface of vesicles. Since the RNA-binding protein binds mRNA and the translating ribosomes, this can explain how mRNAs can associate with membranes to move together along hyphae.</p><p>When Pohlmann et al. engineered fungi that lacked the gene for Upa1, these mutants had problems transporting their mRNAs and associated ribosomes. These findings reveal a direct connection between mRNA trafficking and membrane trafficking. Future studies could now investigate whether similar processes take place in other cells that grow as long filaments, such as plant pollen tubes or nerve cells. These studies might provide new insights into plant reproduction or brain activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06041.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06041.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>endosome</kwd><kwd>FYVE</kwd><kwd>mRNA transport</kwd><kwd>PAM2</kwd><kwd>RRM</kwd><kwd><italic>Ustilago maydis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG FOR1334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pohlmann</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003484</institution-id><institution>Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>iGRAD MOI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haag</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 1028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feldbrügge</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albrecht</surname><given-names>Mario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An endosomal component employs a novel PAM2-like motif to recruit a key RNA-binding protein, which explains how mRNAs and associated ribosomes are attached to endosomes during coupled transport.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Trafficking of membranes is essential for intracellular logistics. Important membranous carriers are endosomes that transport lipids, proteins, and mRNAs. These large vesicular structures are well-known for their function in endocytosis, transporting plasma membrane proteins to their site of degradation in the lysosome/vacuole system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rusten et al., 2012</xref>). However, they also carry out other functions, such as receptor recycling or cytoplasmic signalling, and are therefore considered to be multipurpose platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gould and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2009</xref>). Early endosomes are characterised by the presence of Rab5-like small G proteins and their special lipid composition consisting of PI<sub>3</sub>P lipids (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stenmark et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kutateladze, 2006</xref>). These lipids are recognised by distinct protein domains, such as the FYVE zinc finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stenmark et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Endosomes are actively transported along the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is particularly critical in highly polarised cells, such as neurons and fungal hyphae. In the latter, microtubule-dependent transport supports apical tip growth and secretion of hydrolytic enzymes. This process is streamlined for efficiency and defects in transport result in impaired polar growth and reduced fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peñalva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riquelme and Sánchez-León, 2014</xref>).</p><p>An emerging theme is the intimate linkage of membrane and mRNA trafficking during spatio-temporal control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kraut-Cohen and Gerst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jansen et al., 2014</xref>). Important examples are the actin-dependent co-transport of mRNAs and ER (endoplasmic reticulum) during budding in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>) or the microtubule-dependent co-transport of mRNAs and endosomes during hyphal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Göhre et al., 2013</xref>). Key factors are RNA-binding proteins that recognise specific localisation sequences within target mRNAs. Together with accessory factors, such as the poly(A)-binding protein, they form large macromolecular complexes called mRNPs (messenger ribonucleoprotein particles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bullock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eliscovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buxbaum et al., 2015</xref>). At present, however, detailed mechanistic insights on the connection of mRNPs to membranes are scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jansen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The best fungal model system to study co-trafficking of endosomes and mRNAs is the corn pathogen <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jansen et al., 2014</xref>). Here, the switch from yeast-like to hyphal growth is essential for the infection of its host, and defects in this polar growth correlate with reduced fungal virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vollmeister et al., 2012a</xref>). In hyphae, endosomes shuttle extensively along the microtubule cytoskeleton throughout the entire length of the hyphae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinberg, 2014</xref>). Transport is mediated by a cytoplasmic dynein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Straube et al., 2001</xref>) transporting Rab5a-positive endosomes towards the microtubule minus-ends and the kinesin-3 type motor Kin3 transports in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schuster et al., 2011</xref>). Since endosomes carry the SNARE Yup1 (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment receptor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wedlich-Söldner et al., 2000</xref>) and are positive for Rab5a, they were classified as early endosomes, which have initially been proposed to mainly function in endocytosis and signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steinberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bielska et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we discovered a novel function for these endosomes, namely mRNA transport throughout the hyphae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 2012</xref>), a process that is critical for polar growth and unconventional secretion of the endochitinase Cts1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becht et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koepke et al., 2011</xref>). The key factor is the RNA-binding protein Rrm4 containing three N-terminal RRMs (RNA recognition motifs) for RNA-binding and two C-terminal PABC/MLLE domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becht et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zarnack and Feldbrügge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vollmeister et al., 2012b</xref>). The latter is known from the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein and functions as a binding pocket for peptides containing a PAM2 motif (PABP-interacting motif 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht and Lengauer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kozlov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jinek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xie et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06041.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of Upa1 causes defects in hyphal growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of proteins drawn to scale (bar, 200 amino acids) using the following colouring: green, RNA recognition motif (RRM); dark blue, MLLE domain (SMART E-values 6.7 and 0.35 for Rrm4, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Letunic et al., 2009</xref>); red, PAM2 motif; dark grey, Ankyrin repeats; purple, FYVE domain; light blue, RING domain.

Studying Cdc3 in more detail revealed that not only its mRNA but also the protein is transported on endosomes in an Rrm4-dependent manner suggesting that endosome-coupled translation is crucial for septin localisation on these membranous carriers and needed for septin filamentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumann et al., 2014</xref>). This was verified by demonstrating that translationally active ribosomes are transported on endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Higuchi et al., 2014</xref>).

Despite the detailed knowledge on microtubule-dependent transport of endosome-coupled mRNA trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jansen et al., 2014</xref>), it is still unknown how mRNAs and associated proteins are connected to endosomes.

First, two MLLE domain proteins, namely Rrm4 and Pab1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), shuttle with Rab5a-positive endosomes along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 2012</xref>), and second, mutations in the C-terminal MLLE domain of Rrm4 interfered with its movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becht et al., 2006</xref>). Closer inspection of Rrm4 revealed that it carries a second region with low similarity to the MLLE domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see below).</p><p>To find potentially interacting PAM2-containing proteins, we performed a HMM motif search for PAM2 screening the genome of <italic>U. maydis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht and Lengauer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kozlov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kämper et al., 2006</xref>). Among the 14 obtained candidates, <italic>UMAG_12183</italic> was particularly interesting because the encoded protein contained a lipid-binding FYVE domain, and its C-terminal domain architecture resembled the endosomal protein Pib1p from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> or mammalian Rififylin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shin et al., 2001</xref>). In addition to the PAM2 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and the FYVE domain, it contained five ankyrin repeats known to be protein–protein interaction interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Khodor et al., 2010</xref>), and a RING domain involved in ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

AB33 expresses an active heterodimeric transcription factor under control of the nitrate regulated <italic>nar1</italic> promoter. Since the active heterodimer is sufficient to elicit the morphological transition, hyphae can be induced synchronously and reproducibly by switching the nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brachmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Studying growth of <italic>upa1Δ</italic> cells revealed no mutant phenotype in the yeast form suggesting that cytokinesis including septa formation was not disturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, see below). However, loss of Upa1 caused defects in hyphal growth. At the colony level, shorter hyphae were observed, which were comparable to those of <italic>rrm4Δ</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At the cellular level, a significant proportion of <italic>upa1Δ</italic> cells grew bipolar in contrast to unipolar wild-type hyphae and those hyphae that grew unipolar inserted retraction septa with reduced frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). This again is reminiscent of the mutant phenotype of <italic>rrm4Δ</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumann et al., 2014</xref>).

However, assaying a version of Upa1 without the FYVE domain (Upa1<sup>ΔF</sup>) did show binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that the FYVE domain might have interfered with the nuclear localisation of the protein.

Analysing only the first 194 amino acids (Upa1<sup>ΔC1</sup>) showed that this PAM2-containing region of Upa1 is sufficient for interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Using a similar strategy for the interaction partner showed that the MLLE domain of Pab1 is necessary (Pab1<sup>mM</sup>) and sufficient (MLLE<sup>Pab1</sup>) for interaction with Upa1<sup>ΔC1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To verify these results in independent experiments, we demonstrated that an N-terminal part of Upa1 containing the PAM2 motif interacts with MLLE<sup>Pab1</sup> in GST pull down assays with the components expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (see below).

Instead, the Rrm4-interacting region was mapped to the centre of Upa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Moreover and also unexpectedly, an Upa1 variant without the central Rrm4-interacting region was still able to interact with Rrm4 (Upa1<sup>ΔF</sup>-Gfp, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting the presence of two yet unknown interacting regions. Therefore, we performed a more detailed analysis of the central interaction region of Upa1 (position 886 to 1030), applying linker scanning mutagenesis with 10 amino acid block mutations. Only a mutation in region 948 to 958 caused loss of binding (mutation 7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, this region exhibited sequence similarity to the PAM2 motif (designated PAM2L, PAM2-like; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and furthermore, a second PAM2L sequence was found in the N-terminus of Upa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) supporting the initial two-hybrid data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Mutating the conserved five amino acid core EFxxP or the highly conserved phenylalanine residue alone confirmed that these amino acids in both PAM2L motifs are crucial for the interaction with Rrm4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). A phylogenetic analysis of Upa1 revealed that both PAM2L sequences are conserved in related fungal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, Upa1 interacts with Pab1 and Rrm4 via similar but not identical motifs, and a single PAM2L motif is sufficient for interaction.</p><p>To compare the binding specificities, we analysed the interaction of the Upa1 N-terminus containing PAM2 and the N-terminal PAM2L against full length Pab1 and Rrm4 as well as minimal regions of both proteins. Furthermore, we verified the observations performing GST co-purification experiments using protein variants expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). The results were consistent with the mapping analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) showing that the MLLE-containing regions of Rrm4 and Pab1 exclusively recognise the corresponding PAM2L and PAM2 motifs, respectively. Importantly, we addressed whether the PAM2L motifs are also needed for Upa1 function during hyphal growth. To this end, we generated strains expressing Upa1-Gfp versions carrying mutations in the PAM2L motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Scoring unipolar growth and secretion of Cts1 revealed consistent results leading to the conclusion that one PAM2L motif is sufficient for function, but if both are mutated functionality of Upa1 is lost. Additional mutations in the PAM2 motif made no difference indicating that it is the PAM2L motifs that are indeed crucial for activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>).

Previously, it was shown that these endosomes function in cytokinesis and cell separation. For example, loss of the FYVE domain-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Don1 or the plus-end directed Kinesin-3 type motor Kin3 resulted in the formation of cell aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schink and Bölker, 2009</xref>).

This is mainly based on the observation that the styryl dye FM4-64 follows the endocytotic pathway by initially staining the plasma membrane followed by staining Rab5a-positive shuttling endosomes and lastly vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Higuchi et al., 2014</xref>).

Next, we tested the shuttling of Rab5a-Gfp in hyphae comparing wild-type and <italic>upa1Δ</italic> strains. This showed neither a difference in the velocity of Rab5a-Gfp-positive endosomes nor in the bidirectional movement of Rab5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video14">Videos 14</xref>,<xref ref-type="other" rid="video15">15</xref>).

Although the velocity of processive Rrm4-Gfp signals is the same as in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>), in the absence of Upa1, we observed fewer processive signals and a significant increase in signals exhibiting corralled movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video16">Videos 16</xref>,<xref ref-type="other" rid="video17">17</xref>). This altered movement was particularly eminent when quantifying processive signals reaching the apical region of hyphal tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). This suggests that endosome association of Rrm4 was impaired. Analysing the altered movement of Rrm4 revealed that it was still microtubule-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The decline in processive Rrm4-Gfp signals was not due to a reduced protein amount, since expression is comparable in wild-type and <italic>upa1Δ</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Importantly, the processive Rrm4-Gfp signals co-localised with Rab5a and the endosomal marker protein Yup1, as well as with the lipophilic dye FM4-64. These co-localisation studies confirm that Rrm4 movement was specifically altered in the absence of Upa1 and that residual processive movement took place on endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Rrm4-Gfp signals exhibiting corralled movement did not co-localise with the membrane markers used, suggesting that these large accumulations constitute aberrant forms that fail to associate with the machinery for long-distance transport. Furthermore, addressing the endosomal shuttling of Upa1-Gfp in the absence of Rrm4 revealed that Upa1-Gfp movement is indistinguishable from wild type, suggesting that Upa1 attaches to endosomes independently of Rrm4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). In summary, Upa1 is dispensable for general endosomal functions but is crucial for endosomal recruitment of Rrm4.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video16" mime-subtype="MOV" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-06041-media16-v2.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06041.031</object-id><label>Video 16.</label><caption><title>Rrm4-Gfp moving bidirectionally in a hypha of AB33rrm4-Gfp.</title><p>Video corresponds to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> (size bar = 10 μm, timescale in seconds, 150 ms exposure time, 150 frames, 6 frames/s display rate; QuickTime format, 2324 kB).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06041.031">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06041.031</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video17" mime-subtype="MOV" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-06041-media17-v2.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06041.032</object-id><label>Video 17.</label><caption><title>Rrm4-Gfp moving bidirectionally in a hypha of AB33rrm4-Gfp/upa1Δ.</title><p>Loss of Upa1 disturbs shuttling of Rrm4-Gfp, as seen by increased corraled movement.

The latter is a wide-spread protein–protein interaction motif of about 30 amino acids in length found in the human cytoskeletal protein Ankyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mosavi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, the ankyrin repeats in Upa1 escaped our analysis because of the instability of protein variants lacking the repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). PAM2 motifs are found in a number of interaction partners of the mammalian protein PABPC1, such as translational initiation factor eRF3, nuclease subunit Pan3 and miRNA regulator GW182 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoshino et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Uchida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tritschler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zekri et al., 2013</xref>). Structural and functional analysis revealed a conserved core motif (consensus xxLNxxAxEFxP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kozlov et al., 2010</xref>), which is inserted in the peptide-binding pocket of the MLLE domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht and Lengauer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kozlov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jinek et al., 2010</xref>). In Upa1, this motif is necessary and sufficient for interaction with the MLLE domain of Pab1, confirming its bioinformatic identification. However, to our surprise the PAM2 motif is dispensable for Upa1 function, which could be explained with a redundant Pab1 interaction domain. Such a scenario was already described during miRNA regulation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. The key factor GW182 interacts with PABPC1 via two regions, the PAM2 sequence and a second region that provides indirect interaction with PABPC1. Due to these redundant binding modes, the PAM2 motif of GW182 is functionally dispensable for PABP binding and silencing in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eulalio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huntzinger et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Relatedly, we found that Upa1 interacts with MLLE domains of Rrm4 via two PAM2-like sequences. This motif contains a conserved core <sup>D</sup>/<sub>E</sub> <sup>D</sup>/<sub>E</sub> <sup>D</sup>/<sub>E</sub>FVYP showing a similarity to the core of the PAM2 sequence (EFxP) including the essential phenylalanine that is inserted into a hydrophobic binding pocket of the MLLE domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kozlov et al., 2004</xref>). Note, that mutations in the phenylalanine of both PAM2-like sequences in Upa1 resulted in loss of Rrm4 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). A phylogenetic sequence comparison revealed that closely related basidiomycetes, which contain an Rrm4 homologue with MLLE domain, also possess Upa1 homologues with at least one of the two PAM2L motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Experimentally, we found that although both RNA-binding proteins, Pab1 and Rrm4, contain similar MLLE domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becht et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>), they apparently differ in their sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that in principle both PAM2 and PAM2L sequences are able to interact with MLLE domains but based on their specific interaction with Rrm4, the novel PAM2L motifs are crucial for endosomal mRNP recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In accordance, mutations in the PAM2L motifs lead to loss of Upa1 functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The endosomal protein Upa1 fulfils specific functions during mRNA and ribosome transport</title><p>Based on the fact that Upa1 needs to be present on endosomes and interacts with the RNA-binding proteins Pab1 and Rrm4, we hypothesize that Upa1 specifically functions during endosomal mRNP targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Importantly, we can exclude that Upa1 is necessary for other known biological functions of this Rab5a-positive endosomal compartment, since septum formation, cytokinesis, FM4-64 uptake, or Rab5a shuttling are not altered in the absence of Upa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wedlich-Söldner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schink and Bölker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently, also Rrm4 is dispensable for basic functions of endosomes, such as their movement or the association of Rab5a to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we observed specific defects in Rrm4-dependent endosomal mRNA transport in the absence of Upa1: (i) the amount of aberrant bipolar growing hyphae is increased; (ii) <italic>cts1</italic> secretion is specifically disturbed in the hyphal form; (iii) processive movement of Rrm4 is disturbed; (iv) endosomal transport of the mRNA indicator Pab1, as well as of mRNA-associated ribosomes is strongly reduced; (v) septin mRNA and protein are strongly affected in endosomal transport; (vi) efficient delivery of septin protein to the hyphal tip is disturbed. These observations all point toward the conclusion that Upa1 has a specific function in endosomal targeting of Rrm4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In the absence of Upa1, endosomal Rrm4 functions are disturbed, and consequently, mRNA and associated ribosomes are transported less efficiently. In line with this, specific functions of Rrm4 in septin mRNA and protein transport are also affected, overall leading to characteristic defects of hyphal functions, such as unipolar growth and Cts1 secretion. Thus, Upa1 is a key factor in endosomal recruitment of Rrm4. However, since endosomal movement of Rrm4 was not completely abolished in the absence of Upa1, we envision the presence of additional factors involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Noteworthy, the observed defects in Rrm4 function are fully consistent with our earlier model that Rrm4 mediates local translation of transported mRNAs for the endosomal transport of the translation products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jansen et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Linking mRNPs to trafficking membranes</title><p>Recent data suggest that there is a close connection between mRNA and membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kraut-Cohen and Gerst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jansen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berkovits and Mayr 2015</xref>).

In this respect, one of the key questions is how mRNPs are connected to membranes. Mammalian p180, for example, contains a lysine-rich RNA-binding domain in concert with a membrane spanning domain and thereby attaches mRNAs to the surface of ER membranes to support their local translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui et al., 2012</xref>). She2p from yeast harbours a lipid-binding domain and is able to recognise membrane curvature supporting specific ER association of mRNAs during their transport to daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Genz et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, neuronal PICK1 contains a banana-shaped BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs) domain for interaction with curved membranes. Recently, it was shown that this endosome-associated factor specifically interacts with Argonaute 2, a core component of the miRNA machinery. This provides a mechanism of how miRNAs can be attached to endosomes to carry out specific functions, such as miRNA assembly or translational regulation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antoniou et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that a FYVE domain protein directly couples the key RNA-binding protein of mRNA transport to endosomes by novel PAM2L motifs.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation (2000×<italic>g</italic>, 5 min) and resuspended in 100 μl yeast cracking buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl [pH 6.8], 8 M Urea, 5% [wt/vol] SDS, 0.1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>-EDTA, 0.4 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.1% [vol/vol] β-mercaptoethanol, 7% [vol/vol] benzamidine, and 5% [vol/vol] PMSF) per 7.5 OD units (e.g., 37.5 OD-units/7.5 = 500 μl YCB). The suspension was transferred to 2 ml reagent tubes, 100 μL of glass beads added, and the sample boiled at 99°C, while shaking (1000 rpm). Immediately, the cells were cooled on ice and subsequently analysed by Western Blot or stored at −70°C. For Western blotting protein samples were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare) by semi-dry blotting. Western blot analysis was conferred with anti-GFP (clones 7.1 and 13.1), anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10; Roche), anti-alpha-Tubulin (clone DM1A), anti-HA (clone 12CA5) and anti-GST (Sigma) antibodies. A mouse IgG HRP conjugate (H+L; Promega, Madison, WI) was used as a secondary antibody. Activity was detected using the AceGlow blotting detection system (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Linker scanning mutagenesis</title><p>In order to identify crucial amino acids for the interaction of Upa1 with Rrm4, we performed a linker scanning mutagenesis of plasmid pGBKT7-Upa1<sup>ΔN7/ΔFR</sup>-Gfp (aa 883 to 1947) resulting in 10 amino acid substitutions of the sequence AASAAATAAS. Serines and threonine were introduced by the Golden Gate cloning system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Terfrüchte et al., 2014</xref>) to prevent potential translational problems resulting from 10 consecutive alanines. pGBKT7-Upa1<sup>ΔN7/ΔFR</sup>-Gfp was used as a template for two PCR reactions amplifying two products, which lie directly upstream and downstream of the targeted sequence of 30 nucleotides. Oligonucleotide combinations u2 and p2 were used for the upstream situated sequence and combinations d2 and p1 for the downstream sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 7</xref>). The resulting products were subcloned in pDest (pUMa1467, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Terfrüchte et al., 2014</xref>) using BsaI.

Overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 in a final volume of 100 ml. Protein expression was induced with IPTG for 4 hr. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 10 ml lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5; 200 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 1 tablet protease inhibitor per 50 ml; Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and lysed by sonication. 50 μl glutathione beads (GE Healthcare) were washed 3 times with lysis buffer. For each pulldown, 500 μl cell lysate with GST-tagged protein was added to the washed beads, incubated for 2 hr at 4°C and subsequently washed 5× with lysis buffer. 1 ml cell lysate containing different Upa1 variants was added directly to loaded GST columns, incubated for 1 hr at 4°C and subsequently washed 5 times with lysis buffer. Beads were boiled 6 min at 99°C. 10 μl of each fraction was loaded on SDS-PAGE for analysis and stained with Coomassie blue.</p><p>For protein purification, GST-purification was performed as described above. For GST-tagged proteins, 1.5 ml glutathione beads (GE Healthcare) were equilibrated with lysis buffer. Cell lysate was loaded onto the columns, incubated, and washed. The GST-tagged proteins were eluted in elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; pH 7.5; 200 mM NaCl; 20 mM Glutathione) and glutathione was removed via PD-10 Desalting columns (GE Healthcare). For the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Upa1 variants, cells were pelleted, resuspended in His-lysis buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; 300 mM NaCl; 10 mM imidazole; pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were loaded onto 1.5 ml Ni-NTA agarose columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and incubated for 1 hr at 4°C. The Ni-NTA agarose was washed 3× with His-lysis buffer (increasing Imidazole concentration from 10 to 20 mM). His-tagged proteins were eluted in His-lysis buffer (containing 250 mM imidazole).</p><p>The pulldown experiments with purified proteins were performed similar as described above. Glutathione beads were loaded with100 μl purified GST-tagged proteins and 400 μl lysis buffer. Loaded GST-columns were incubated with 200 μl purified His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Upa1 variants and 300 μl lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling, and 10 μl of each fraction was analysed after SDS-PAGE by colloidal Coomassie staining and Western blotting.

For quantification of bipolarity, hyphae were observed with a 63× Plan-Apochromat objective in combination with a Spot Pursuit CCD camera. Pictures of more than 100 cells were taken and scored for unipolar or bipolar growth, as well as for septum formation. At least three independent experiments were performed.</p><p>Staining of hyphae with FM4-64 was done as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 2012</xref>).

After 30–60 s of incubation at room temperature, samples were subjected to microscopic analysis.</p><p>For analysis of signal number, velocity and passages through a defined zone of Gfp fusion protein hyphae were observed with a 63× Plan-Apochromat (NA 1.4) in combination with a Spot Pursuit CCD camera. Videos were recorded with an exposure time of 200 ms and 150 frames taken. Kymographs were generated from these videos and analysed using Metamorph (Version 7.7.0.0; Molecular Devices, Seattle, IL, USA). Signals were counted manually discriminating between processive movement, corralled movement (covered distance of hypha per 22.5 s &lt; 5 μm; rapid changes of direction), or static signals (no movement, straight line). Velocity was determined by quantifying processive signals (movement &gt;5 μm). Note that one signal could exhibit different speeds (i.e., upon reversal of direction). Those velocities were handled as individual data points and not averaged. Passing events were quantified at two defined regions: 10 μm from the apical tip or in the middle of the filament. The number of passing events reflects the overall crossing of signals through this zone. All parts of the microscope systems were controlled by the software package MetaMorph (version 7; Molecular Devices), which was also used for image processing including the adjustment of brightness and contrast, as well as measurements, quantifications, kymographs, and maximum projections of z-stacks. Fluorescence micrographs are displayed inverted unless otherwise stated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNA live imaging</title><p>For RNA live imaging, we improved our λN-based system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">König et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumann et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2015</xref>) and fused protein λN<sup>*</sup>Gfp<sup>3</sup> to a NLS resulting in λN<sup>NLS</sup>Gfp<sup>3</sup>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a thoroughly executed study, which provides an interesting example of a molecular mechanism for linking RNA transport to endosomes. However, a number of points require additional experimental support and/or clarifications.</p><p>1) The model in Figure 9 suggests that in the absence of Upa1, Rrm4 and Pab1 will not be connected to endosomes. However, residual movements of Rrm4 and Pab1, albeit altered ones, are still observed. There does not seem to be any information on the colocalisation of Rrm4 and Pab1 with Rab5a in the absence of Upa1. Is the colocalisation lost? Do the residual movements of these proteins still occur on endosomes or on some other organelles? It would be nice if the authors provided some explanation of the corralled movement phenotype. Especially in the case of Rrm4, the brightness of the signals undergoing corralled back-and-forth movements remains constant. Since these are presumably not single Rrm4 molecules, this type of movement can probably not be explained by enhanced release and occasional re-binding of Rrm4 to endosomes.</p><p>2) The observation that deletion of Upa1 has a more dramatic effect on Pab1 and ribosomal proteins than on Rrm4 localization is a bit puzzling. This observation does not directly fit with the proposed model and might require at least additional discussion. Is it possible that Pab1, and not Rrm4, is the major functional interactor of Upa1 in vivo? This could in principle be addressed by mutating the PAM2L sequences in Upa1 and assessing the mutant phenotype. Although not essential, an additional Upa1 mutagenesis experiment to make a protein with all PAM2 and PAM2L sequences mutated could test whether there is some redundancy between the Upa1(PAM2L)-Rrm4 and Upa1(PAM2)-Pab1 interactions in vivo (e.g. in mRNA transport) and strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, only 4 particles are analyzed for <italic>upa1∆.</italic> This is insufficient, since in the <italic>wt</italic> about 50% of the 36 particles analyzed move the same distance (panel E). It would be nice to analyze more particles (more hyphae) to be able to conclude with more confidence that there is a strong difference in the behaviour of the motile mRNAs between the genotypes.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> in the revised version): How does Cdc3G get to the hyphal tip in <italic>upa1∆</italic>? In what percentage of cells/hyphae did the Cdc3G localize to the tip? Again since this analysis was performed in a deletion strain, it would indicate that there are either alternative pathways for mRNA transport and/or other proteins besides Upa1 are required for the process. These data suggest that the model might need adjustment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06041.055</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The model in Figure 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in the revised version)suggests that in the absence of Upa1, Rrm4 and Pab1 will not be connected to endosomes.

Do the residual movements of these proteins still occur on endosomes or on some other organelles? It would be nice if the authors provided some explanation of the corralled movement phenotype. Especially in the case of Rrm4, the brightness of the signals undergoing corralled back-and-forth movements remains constant. Since these are presumably not single Rrm4 molecules, this type of movement can probably not be explained by enhanced release and occasional re-binding of Rrm4 to endosomes</italic>.</p><p>These are very valuable questions that needed to be addressed. To achieve this we focused our analysis on Rrm4 primarily for two reasons. Firstly, the interaction of Rrm4 with Upa1 is functionally significant and therefore more relevant than the interaction of Pab1 with Upa1 (see below). Secondly, in comparison to Rrm4, Pab1 is more difficult to detect mainly because of the extensive cytoplasmic localisation resulting in higher background signals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). Hence, we generated strains expressing Rrm4-Gfp with either of the two endosomal markers Rab5a-Cherry or Yup1-Cherry. In both genetic backgrounds we furthermore deleted <italic>upa1</italic> in order to analyse the consequences caused by a loss of Upa1 function. These strains allowed simultaneous detection of both proteins as well as addressing their dynamic movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I-J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4A</xref>). Moreover, we stained wild-type and <italic>upa1Δ</italic> strains with the lipophilic dye FM4-64 to analyse membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4B</xref>). We confirm by these co-localisation studies that Rrm4 movement is indeed specifically disturbed in <italic>upa1Δ</italic> strains, while Rab5a and Yup1 movement remains unaffected. With regard to the questions raised we can now conclude the following:</p><p>(i) Is the colocalisation lost? The co-localisation is lost for static signals and corralled movement of Rrm4. Also, these signals cannot be stained with FM4-64 suggesting that these are most likely not associated with membrane compartments. We can only speculate that these are either aberrant accumulations of Rrm4-containing mRNPs or that these are Rrm4-containing mRNPs in the process of assembly that cannot be loaded on endosomes, because Upa1 is not supporting their loading. Since at present we cannot differentiate between these possibilities we provided a simple explanation in the text (see below).</p><p>(ii) Do the residual movements of these proteins still occur on endosomes or on some other organelles? The residual processive movement of Rrm4 does take place on Rab5a- and Yup1-positive endosomes. To account for the observation that Rrm4 exhibits some residual binding to endosomes in the absence of Upa1 we modified the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We now include an additional, currently unknown adaptor that interacts with Rrm4 and endosomes.</p><p>We incorporated the new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4</xref>. The text now reads “Importantly, the processive Rrm4-Gfp signals co-localised with Rab5a and the endosomal marker protein Yup1 as well as with the lipophilic dye FM4-64. These co-localisation studies confirm that Rrm4 movement was specifically altered in the absence of Upa1 and that residual processive movement took place on endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I-J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4</xref>). Rrm4-Gfp signals exhibiting corralled movement did not co-localise with the applied membrane markers suggesting that these large accumulations constitute aberrant forms that fail to associate with the machinery for long-distance transport.”</p><p><italic>2) The observation that deletion of Upa1 has a more dramatic effect on Pab1 and ribosomal proteins than on Rrm4 localization is a bit puzzling. This observation does not directly fit with the proposed model and might require at least additional discussion. Is it possible that Pab1, and not Rrm4, is the major functional interactor of Upa1 in vivo? This could in principle be addressed by mutating the PAM2L sequences in Upa1 and assessing the mutant phenotype. Although not essential, an additional Upa1 mutagenesis experiment to make a protein with all PAM2 and PAM2L sequences mutated could test whether there is some redundancy between the Upa1(PAM2L)-Rrm4 and Upa1(PAM2)-Pab1 interactions in vivo (e.g. in mRNA transport) and strengthen the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>There are two possible explanations for the observation that Upa1 has a more dramatic effect on Pab1 and ribosomal proteins than on Rrm4 localisation. Firstly, in principle it is possible that the disturbed interaction of Rrm4 with Upa1 alters the RNA-binding capacity of Rrm4. Therefore, although Rrm4 is still shuttling it may bind less mRNA and hence we observe less Pab1 and less ribosomal proteins. Secondly, the difference might be due to the different detection levels. Rrm4 is very specific for endosomes, in fact in wild-type cells we hardly observed any Rrm4 signal that is not co-localising with endosomes. However, Pab1 and ribosomal proteins are bound to almost all mRNAs in the whole cytoplasm. Therefore, as mentioned above the cytoplasmic signal is higher and endosomal movement more difficult to detect. This is particularly true for ribosomal proteins. Here, we need to bleach an area in the cytoplasm in order to detect ribosomes on shuttling endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, it is more difficult to detect the residual movement of ribosomal proteins and Pab1 in the absence of Upa1.</p><p>However, we fully agree that it was a weakness of the initial manuscript that a functional analysis of the PAM2L motifs of Upa1 was not carried out. To overcome this, we generated strains expressing Upa1-Gfp versions with mutations in the PAM2L motifs (Upa1<sup>mPL1</sup>-Gfp and Upa1<sup>mPL2</sup>-Gfp) as well as a strains with mutations in both PAM2L motifs (Upa1<sup>mPL1+2</sup>-Gfp), and with mutations in PAM2 and PAM2L motifs (Upa1<sup>mP/mPL1+2</sup>-Gfp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). All Upa1 versions localised to shuttling endosomes with comparable signal intensity indicating their expression at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3–figure supplement 7C-D</xref>). Testing unipolar growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and Cts1 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3–figure supplement 7B</xref>) gave consistent results. One PAM2L motif is sufficient for function, but if both PAM2L motifs were mutated Upa1 functionality was lost. The PAM2 motif did not contribute to these defects. Showing that the PAM2L motifs are functionally important and that therefore the interaction of Rrm4 with Upa1 is more relevant than the interaction of Upa1 with Pab1, considerably improved the statement.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>, only 4 particles are analyzed for</italic> upa1∆. <italic>This is insufficient, since in the</italic> wt <italic>about 50% of the 36 particles analyzed move the same distance (panel E). It would be nice to analyze more particles (more hyphae) to be able to conclude with more confidence that there is a strong difference in the behaviour of the motile mRNAs between the genotypes</italic>.</p><p>We analysed additional hyphae and quantified more particles. Instead of 13 hyphae for wild-type and the <italic>upa1Δ</italic> strain we now analysed 54 and 96, respectively. The number of particles was increased from 36 to 151 for wild type and from 4 to 33 in <italic>upa1Δ</italic> strains. After improving the analysis we are now more confident in concluding that there is a strong difference in mRNA motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8B</italic></xref><italic>: How does Cdc3G get to the hyphal tip in</italic> upa1∆<italic>? In what percentage of cells/hyphae did the Cdc3G localize to the tip? Again since this analysis was performed in a deletion strain, it would indicate that there are either alternative pathways for mRNA transport and/or other proteins besides Upa1 are required for the process. These data suggest that the model might need adjustment</italic>.</p><p>In order to answer these questions we have to recapitulate earlier results that were published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumann et al. 2014</xref> (EMBO Reports). Septin <italic>cdc3</italic> mRNA and encoded protein localise to shuttling Rrm4 and Rab5a-positive endosomes. In addition, the septin Cdc3-Gfp forms filaments with a gradient emanating from the hyphal tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In the absence of Rrm4, endosomal localisation of septin mRNA and septin protein is severely disturbed. Without Rrm4 and thus without mRNA transport Cdc3-Gfp stills forms filaments that localise to the hyphal tip while the gradient is no longer formed. Thus, without mRNA transport the efficient assembly of Cdc3G in filaments is affected. This is supported by FRAP experiments showing that in the absence of mRNA transport the recovery of Cdc3-Gfp is significantly delayed.</p><p>Based on these earlier results and the results presented here we can hypothesize that diffusion is the most likely way in <italic>upa1Δ</italic> strains that Cdc3-Gfp gets to the hyphal tip. We have shown earlier that for free Gfp this process takes place in seconds. Cdc3-Gfp localises to the tip in all hyphae, but the gradient is disturbed in the absence of Upa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), reminiscent of the altered gradient in <italic>rrm4</italic> deletion strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumann et al. 2014</xref>). In essence, regarding the Cdc3 septin biology loss of Upa1 phenocopies loss of Rrm4. Therefore, we believe that Upa1 is a key factor for the recruitment of Rrm4 to endosomes. However, as out-lined above there is still residual shuttling of Rrm4 on endosomes and therefore we improved the model including the presence of an as yet unknown adaptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
