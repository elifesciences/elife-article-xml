Secreted Wnt ligands are involved in many PCP-dependent processes, yet whether they act as polarity cues has been controversial. We show that in <italic>Xenopus</italic> early ectoderm, the Prickle3/Vangl2 complex was polarized to anterior cell edges and this polarity was disrupted by several Wnt antagonists. In midgastrula embryos, Wnt5a, Wnt11, and Wnt11b, but not Wnt3a, acted across many cell diameters to orient Prickle3/Vangl2 complexes away from their sources regardless of their positions relative to the body axis. The planar polarity of endogenous Vangl2 in the neuroectoderm was similarly redirected by an ectopic Wnt source and disrupted after depletion of Wnt11b in the presumptive posterior region of the embryo. These observations provide evidence for the instructive role of Wnt ligands in vertebrate PCP.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16463.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16463.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>PCP</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>Prickle</kwd><kwd>Vangl2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD078874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sokol</surname><given-names>Sergei Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Vertebrate early ectoderm displays planar polarity manifested by a fluorescent sensor and this polarity can be instructed by Wnt ligands.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> revealed the segregation of core PCP proteins to opposite sides of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peng and Axelrod, 2012</xref>).

However, whether vertebrate Wnt ligands play a permissive or instructive role in PCP remains controversial. While Wnt proteins can instruct PCP in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing and orient myocytes in chick somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gros et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), Wnt11 has been argued to act permissively in convergent extension during zebrafish gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heisenberg et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Xenopus</italic> larval epidermis contains multiciliated cells (MCCs) that are coordinately aligned to generate a unidirectional fluid flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Konig and Hausen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Werner and Mitchell, 2012</xref>). This alignment is controlled by PCP proteins during gastrulation and neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yasunaga et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, it has been challenging to document core PCP protein polarization in the ectoderm before late neurula stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chien et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciruna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ossipova et al., 2015b</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that ectodermal PCP visualized by exogenous Prickle3 (Pk3)/Vangl2 complex in the epidermis and endogenous Vangl2 in the neuroectoderm can be instructed by Wnt ligands during gastrulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To establish early PCP markers, we examined the subcellular localization of GFP-tagged Pk3, one of the core PCP proteins predominantly expressed in the epidermal ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ossipova et al., 2015a</xref>). When supplied to the ectodermal tissue by RNA microinjection, GFP-Pk3 was homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm and at the cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We hypothesized that Pk3 is not polarized because another PCP component is limiting. Given that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Prickle physically associates with Van Gogh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jenny et al., 2003</xref>), we suspected that the limiting factor is a Van Gogh homologue. Indeed, when GFP-Pk3 was coexpressed with Vangl2, its binding partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2016</xref>), epidermal PCP became evident by the beginning of neurulation with GFP fluorescence enriched at the anterior cell boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In early gastrula ectoderm, GFP-Pk3 was visible as multiple membrane patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D&quot;</xref>) but, at later stages, formed a single Vangl2-positive crescent- or chevron-shaped domain near the anterior cell vertex, i. e. the junction of more than two cells, with a ventral bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). The anterior localization of GFP-Pk3 was confirmed by the analysis of mosaically-expressing cell clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). This distribution might reflect biased stabilization of PCP proteins noted in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chien et al., 2015</xref>). At the doses used, the exogenous PCP complexes did not cause any visible morphological defects. These findings establish the Pk3/Vangl2 complex as a sensor that allows direct visualization of PCP in <italic>Xenopus</italic> epidermal ectoderm by the end of gastrulation. This anteroposterior PCP is similar to the one observed in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> neural plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ossipova et al., 2015b</xref>) and other vertebrate embryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borovina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciruna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hashimoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roszko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yin et al., 2008</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16463.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polarization of Pk3/Vangl2 complexes at the anterior cell cortex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme.

We generated a series of Pk3 deletion mutants and examined their subcellular localization in the presence of Vangl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to full-length Pk3, the mutated proteins did not polarize in the absence of Vangl2 (data not shown). While the N terminus of Pk3 was dispensable for its polarization, the C-terminal domain was required for Pk3 membrane recruitment, in agreement with its ability to bind Vangl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast, Pk3 C-terminus (Pk3-C) was recruited to the plasma membrane but failed to polarize, consistent with the previous study of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Prickle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jenny et al., 2003</xref>). A Pk3 mutant lacking the LIM domains (Pk3ΔLIM) was also unable to polarize despite being associated with the cell membrane. Of note, deletion of the CAAX motif, previously implicated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Prickle polarization and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin and Gubb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strutt et al., 2013</xref>), did not interfere with Pk3 polarization. Removal of the PET domain had a partial effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), contrary to the data obtained for Prickle2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2015</xref>). These data show that the C-terminus is both necessary and sufficient for Vangl2-dependent membrane recruitment of Pk3, which is a prerequisite for its polarization. Notably, Pk3-C overexpression inhibited the incorporation of MCCs into the superficial epidermal cell layer at tailbud stages (data not shown), confirming the involvement of Pk3 in radial cell intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ossipova et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>Having established the utility of Pk3/Vangl2 complex as a polarity sensor, we next wanted to determine a role of Wnt signaling in ectodermal PCP. Since several Wnt ligands, including Wnt3a, Wnt5a and Wnt11b, are expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hikasa and Sokol, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kiecker and Niehrs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ku and Melton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moon et al., 1993</xref>), we monitored GFP-Pk3/Vangl2 complex polarization in embryos, in which Wnt signaling was downregulated. Expression of the extracellular domain of Fz8 (ECD8), a potent Wnt inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itoh and Sokol, 1999</xref>), disrupted Pk3/Vangl2 complex polarization in 85% of injected embryos (n = 41), whereas only 40% of control embryos lacked Pk3/Vangl2 polarity (n = 29) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since ECD8 inhibits the majority of Wnt proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itoh and Sokol, 1999</xref>), we utilized more selective Wnt antagonists, DN-Wnt11 and the dominant negative ROR2 receptor Ror2-TM, both of which specifically interfere with Wnt5- and Wnt11-like signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hikasa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tada and Smith, 2000</xref>). The majority of cells expressing DN-Wnt11 and Ror2-TM lacked GFP-Pk3 polarity in 89% (n= 28) and 88% (n= 25) of injected embryos, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). This loss of polarity was unlikely caused by Pk3 and Vangl2 degradation, judged by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Together, these experiments suggest that Wnt5- and/or Wnt11-like proteins function to establish PCP in early ectoderm.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16463.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effects of Wnt antagonists on Pk3 polarization in the epidermal ectoderm.</title><p>Embryos were injected with RNAs encoding GFP-Pk3 (150 pg), <italic>Xenopus</italic> HA-Vangl2 (120 pg), and LacZ (1 ng, <bold>A</bold>) or DN-Wnt11 (2 ng, <bold>B</bold>) or Ror2-TM (1 ng, C).

A slight reorientation of CLIP170-GFP traces was detected towards the border of the Wnt5a clone, yet the difference was insignificant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, neither live imaging of EB1-GFP nor analysis of stable microtubules visualized by the microtubule-binding protein Ensconsin-GFP revealed a significant effect of Wnt5a on microtubule alignment (data not shown). Thus, Wnt signaling might regulate core PCP proteins without reorganizing microtubules in this system, as opposed to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matis et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, there was no detectable bias in the position of centrosomes marked by γ-tubulin staining (data not shown).

Compared to its anterior polarization in control neuroectodermal cells, Vangl2 was reoriented away from a source of Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Such effect was observed in 90% of injected embryos (n = 46), but it was only visible in cells located one to four cell diameters away from the border of the Wnt5a clone. This finding supports our conclusions obtained for ectopic Pk3/Vangl2 complexes and suggests that the anterior polarization of Vangl2 results from endogenous Wnt proteins secreted from the posterior end of the embryo. To elucidate which Wnt ligands might be responsible, we knocked down Wnt5a and Wnt11b, two non-canonical Wnt ligands expressed at the posterior region of gastrula embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ku and Melton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moon et al., 1993</xref>), using previously characterized morpholino oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pandur et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schambony and Wedlich, 2007</xref>). Whereas Vangl2 was accumulated at the anterior borders of cells in control embryos (87%, n = 24) and Wnt5a-depleted embryos (90%, n = 28), this polarity was retained only in 59% of embryos depleted of Wnt11b (n = 32) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref> and data not shown). These observations suggest the involvement of Wnt11b in anteroposterior PCP, consistent with its proposed activity in the gastrocoel roof plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walentek et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, our gain- and loss-of-function assays support the idea that Wnt11b acts from the posterior region to establish an anteroposterior PCP across many cell diameters. Nevertheless, since the morpholino injection into vegetal blastomeres might partially interfere with the local production of Wnt11b in the neural plate, currently we cannot discriminate between long-range diffusion and local effects of Wnt proteins propagated by a signal relay system or cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexandre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zecca et al., 1996</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16463.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Wnt signaling instructs Vangl2 polarization in the neural plate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme.

Wnt signaling may directly affect core PCP proteins by regulating PCP protein post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2011</xref>) or stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chien et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strutt et al., 2011</xref>). Wnt ligands were also proposed to function in PCP by blocking the Frizzled-Van Gogh interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu and Mlodzik, 2008</xref>). The latter explanation is less likely, because ECD8, expected to compete with Frizzled for Vangl2 binding, interfered with Pk3 polarization, instead of instructing it similar to Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Alternatively, given the role of Wnt signaling in gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Habas et al., 2001</xref>), Wnt proteins might generate mechanical strains to modulate PCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chien et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heisenberg and Bellaiche, 2013</xref>). While the effect of mechanical forces on PCP is thought to require microtubule reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chien et al., 2015</xref>), we did not detect a significant change of microtubule orientation in response to Wnt5a.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor. One of the three reviewers has agreed to reveal her identity: Cecilia Moens (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As stated above, the manuscript has been reviewed by three expert reviewers, and their assessments, together with my own (Jeremy Nathans, Reviewing Editor), forms the basis of this letter.

Core components of the pathway include Fzd and Dsh family members, however the requirement for a Wnt ligand in planar polarization is variable: essential for some PCP processes and apparently dispensable for others. Even in contexts where a Wnt is essential, the loss of function experiments that demonstrate this do not distinguish between a permissive versus an instructive role in specifying the direction of polarization. This brief manuscript demonstrates that the polarization of PCP components occurs in response to a Wnt ligand. Using the robust Vangl2-dependent localization of Pk3 to anterior cell boundaries in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> non-neural ectoderm as a direct readout of PCP signaling in dominant-negative and gain-of-function experiments, they show a) that planar polarization depends on Wnt signaling and b) that localized expression of a Wnt ligand can repolarize epithelial cells several cell diameters away from the source. This is not the only mechanism by which PCP can be established; in other contexts, PCP can arise in response to tension, flow, or by unknown but Wnt-independent means. Nevertheless, the paper shows clearly that a directional Wnt signal can establish PCP and as such is an important addition to the literature. With the relatively minor revisions suggested below I feel that the paper is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Criticisms:</p><p>1) The quantification and statistics were done on a per-cell basis, with each N being the orientation of Pk3 in a single cell. However, it is not reasonable to expect that the behavior of one cell in an embryo is independent of the behavior of a neighboring cell in the same embryo. This is particularly true when we are dealing with planar polarity. Therefore, the data should be re-analyzed on a per-embryo basis, with each N being the average Pk3 polarization angle in a single embryo.</p><p>2) In the Results and Discussion the paper says: &quot;Moreover, this effect of Wnt5a persisted to the neurula stage, resulting in PCP reversal in 77% of embryos”. How was this eventual polarity reversal demonstrated? Was it based on something other than the orientation of Pk crescents? This claim of tissue polarity reversal should be substantiated using a separate readout such as primary cilium orientation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> </p><p>No additional data required. Statistics should be re-done on a per-embryo (rather than per-cell) basis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The central contention of this manuscript is that Wnt's provide a long range directional signal for PCP in the gastrula stage <italic>Xenopus</italic> ectoderm. The authors use coexpression of Pk3-GFP and Vangl2 as markers of GFP, and dominant negative Wnt and FzECD constructs to indicate a requirement for Wnt's, and Wnt ectopic expression to demonstrate the ability to determine directionality. The notion that Wnt's act as long range directional signals for PCP has been unsettled in all systems in which it has been addressed for as long as the idea has been floated. The evidence presented here that this is the case in the gastrula stage ectoderm is as good as any in any system so far, which is to say intriguing, but not entirely compelling. It has been clear for some time that Wnts <italic>can</italic> direct polarity. The key question is whether they <italic>do</italic> direct polarity, and it is here that this study, like several previous ones, falls just short of being entirely convincing. I'm on the fence about whether the arguments presented here warrant publication in a leading journal, but at a minimum there are several things that should be done to shore up the argument.</p><p>The interaction between Pk3 and Vangl2 is consistent with our understanding of PCP signaling and is not particularly novel, and the deletion analysis to identify required Pk3 domains is a bit of a distraction. Why Vangl2 should be limiting for Pk3 localization at these stages is an interesting and more puzzling question in light of recently published results. The failure to observe asymmetry of exogenous Pk3-GFP if endogenous Pk3 is asymmetrically localized is best explained if the Pk3-GFP is present in large excess, so that asymmetry that would otherwise be evident is swamped out by randomly localized and unassociated Pk3. The less interesting possibility is that endogenous Pk3 is not localized asymmetrically, but can be induced to do so in the presence of the necessary other players.</p><p>This contrasts with results from Butler and Wallingford, who showed that Pk2, Vangl1 and Dvl1 all localize asymmetrically when independently expressed at later stages. The puzzle here is the contrasting dynamics. Butler's results suggest a much later acquisition of polarity, as their probes were symmetric as late as stage 19, and only subsequently showed increasing asymmetry by the time of MCC differentiation. From these results, we would infer that there is little or no activity of the PCP components at the gastrula stage.</p><p>If that is the case, this raises the question of whether the authors are examining what is essentially the potential to polarize, or in other words, a synthetic polarization that can be created by expressing needed components (and that can then perhaps respond to endogenous or exogenous Wnt's), but that doesn't reflect an endogenous polarization that normally occurs. For example, we have no evidence that Pk3 is needed for this polarity, and there is no independent readout of polarization. In the GRP, Pk3 is normally at the basal bodies, though it can be induced to apicolateral asymmetry, and its role and localization in radial intercalation of MCCs (Sokol lab) are both potentially consistent with different mechanisms. Given these observations, it is plausible that the authors have created a synthetic PCP system that can respond to Wnt's, but that doesn't normally exist. The authors offer no other readout for PCP at this time.</p><p>On the other hand, asymmetry, or at least asymmetric activity, of Vangl2, Celsr1, Fzd3 was inferred by FRAP at this time by Chien et al. (although these assays also required the co-expression of exogenous components), and this was associated with polarized apical microtubules. However, these authors concluded that tissue strain provided the directionality to polarization, in contrast to the current contention that Wnt signaling directs polarization. If Chien et al. are correct, it may be that microtubules determine the direction of the PCP orientation, as opposed to being responsive to PCP protein polarization. Furthermore, these authors showed that microtubule orientation is responsive to strain, which might be providing the directional signal. If the authors suggest that microtubules are reading Wnt dependent polarity, it would stretch the imagination to conceive that strain reorganizes the pattern of Wnt expression. A more harmonious conclusion would be that if Wnt's are involved, they are involved in local cell to cell signaling rather than long range signaling.</p><p>Therefore, whether PCP signaling normally occurs, what if anything it is doing, and the upstream directional signal are not entirely established. Furthermore, Pk3 may or may not be involved, though even if not, it could be a legitimate marker of PCP.</p><p>The relevance of the Pk3/Vangl2 complex as a PCP marker in reading a Wnt signal would be bolstered if the authors could show that the polarized microtubules observed at this time depend on Pk3 or Vangl2. Even better, the authors should look at microtubules in their loss and gain of function experiments to determine their potential responsiveness to these inputs. If microtubules reorganize in response to Wnt's, they should then demonstrate that the requirement for normal microtubule orientation, proposed to be Wnt dependent, is lost upon knockdown of PCP components. If microtubules do not depend on Wnt endogenous or exogenous Wnt signals, then I would not feel confident that endogenous PCP signaling is occurring at gastrula stages.</p><p>Based on the currently provided results, the authors' statement &quot;In this study, we use the complex of Pk3 and Vangl2 as a sensor of epidermal PCP to demonstrate that the polarity of this complex is directly defined by Wnt ligands during gastrulation&quot; should instead say: &quot;the polarity of this complex CAN BE directly defined by…&quot;.</p><p>Another important concern is the conclusion that can or cannot be drawn from the methods used to interfere with endogenous Wnt signaling. As discussed above, these are critical to the distinction between CAN and DO. The mechanisms by which the Fz8ECD and the dominant negative Wnt's act is not certain. While they may bind and block Wnt activity, it is also hypothesized that PCP involves direct interaction between Fz and Vangl proteins, and these reagents could potentially interfere with such an interaction to disrupt PCP. The authors could potentially address this concern if they could show that RNAi of the suspect Wnt's, either alone or simultaneously, would disrupt asymmetry of their PCP markers.</p><p>Last, the authors acknowledge that they don't truly distinguish between a long range Wnt signal providing a directional signal, and a paracrine signal involved in cell to cell signaling, as proposed by Adler many years ago, that would not provide a directional signal. The localized Wnt expression patterns (particularly since they are very low resolution old in situ studies) are not enough to force the former conclusion. Does this not undermine their thesis?</p><p>As is, I'm left to conclude that PCP signaling might be occurring at gastrula stage, this polarization might do something that matters, and Wnt's might provide a long range signal for this polarization. It would be good to feel a little more confident.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> </p><p>No additional data files needed, and assuming representative images are shown, the results as shown are compelling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The results presented support a role for Wnts in early PCP establishment in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> epidermis. The authors contend that this is an instructive role, and such a finding would stand in contrast to the recent report by Chien et al. (2015 Curr Biol 25, 2774-2784) that suggests mechanical cues are responsible for early PCP orientation in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> epidermis (although the authors don't make this point). However, as it stands, I think that while the authors make a case that Wnts <italic>can</italic> re-orient polarity, they do not provide good evidence that this normally happens and/or whether it happens when Wnts are expressed at physiological levels. It is equally likely that the observed results could be a dominant negative effect caused by Wnt binding to a Fzd CRD domain and blocking interactions with Vangl, similar to what Wu et al. 2013 see in <italic>Drosophila</italic> upon Wnt over expression.</p><p>The authors need better evidence to convince me that they have made any advance upon the previous view that Wnts might only play a permissive role in this context.</p><p>Other major comments:</p><p>1) This is not the first evidence for instructive role of Wnts in vertebrates, as Wnt5a has previously been shown to have an instructive role in the mouse limb bud, in a study that also impressively showed direct evidence of a Wnt-induced activity gradient (Gao et al. (2011) Dev Cell 20, 163-176).</p><p>2) Although the &quot;fluorescent sensor for planar polarity in <italic>Xenopus</italic>&quot; may be new (as indicated in the &quot;Impact statement&quot;), it is not really novel for a GFP fusion to be used to reveal polarity, as even in <italic>Xenopus</italic> this has been previously demonstrated (Butler and Wallingford (2015) Development 142, 3429-3439).</p><p>3) A structure-function dissection of Pk3 domains required for polarization is described, without any reference to the similar results for Pk2 described in Butler et al. 2015. I'm also concerned about how much can be concluded if endogenous protein is not first removed in a structure-function experiment like this.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised manuscript &quot;Wnt proteins can direct planar cell polarity in vertebrate ectoderm&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic>. The revised manuscript has been reviewed by two expert reviewers, and their assessments, together with my own (Jeremy Nathans, Reviewing Editor), forms the basis of this letter. I am including the two reviews at the end of this letter, as the specific suggestions in them will not be repeated in the summary here.</p><p>We would like to encourage you to make some additional text modifications to the manuscript that addresses the specific issues raised in the two reviews below – especially the issues raised by reviewer #2. With respect to the writing, we appreciate that in the current publishing environment there is an almost irresistible temptation to over-state one's conclusions. <italic>eLife</italic> is trying to restore some balance to the world of scientific writing. We welcome self-critical comments and we believe that such comments actually enhance the reader's ability to judge the science fairly.</p><p>I will offer two examples of scientific writing that I think illustrates the preceding point. They are from two papers on ubiquitin that form the core of the discoveries for which the authors shared the Nobel Prize.</p><p>Proposed role of ATP in protein breakdown: conjugation of protein with multiple chains of the polypeptide of ATP-dependent proteolysis.</p><p>Hershko A, Ciechanover A, Heller H, Haas AL, Rose IA.</p><p>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Apr;77(4):1783-6.</p><p>In the second paragraph of the Discussion section, after summarizing the evidence that leads the authors to propose the conjugation of APF-1 (=ubiquitin) to proteins as a way of marking them for degradation, the authors write: &quot;Evidence that APF-1-proteins are intermediates in the breakdown of denatured protein as proposed in Figure 6 is indirect and inconclusive at this time.&quot;</p><p>Activation of the heat-stable polypeptide of the ATP-dependent proteolytic system.</p><p>Ciechanover A, Heller H, Katz-Etzion R, Hershko A.</p><p>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Feb;78(2):761-5.</p><p>In the last paragraph of the Discussion section, after describing their discovery and characterization of ubiquitin (=APF-1) ligase, the authors write &quot;Evidence suggesting the role of the APF-1-activating enzyme in conjugation and in ATP-dependent protein breakdown is not conclusive at present.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have added new experiments that address some of the criticisms but they have not been able to address others. In response to the criticism that their gain-of-function experiments show that Wnt signaling CAN direct planar polarity but not that it DOES direct endogenous polarity, they include new data showing that the polarization of endogenous Vangl2 is altered by localized WNT overexpression, and that morpholino knockdown of Wnt11b eliminates endogenous Vangl2 polarization. This, combined with the gain-of-function data showing that Wnt expressing cells can repolarize Vangl2 and Pk3 over several cell diameters, is compelling evidence for a role for Wnts in orienting PCP in the frog gastrula non-neural ectoderm. On the other hand, the authors tried but failed to detect polarization of any sub-cellular structure apart from PCP core components themselves. They argue that microtubule or centrosomal asymmetry may be a much later consequence of PCP, not detectable at these early stages. They have also addressed some relatively minor comments I had about quantification of the data. In sum, the paper is improved by demonstrating a requirement for Wnts in endogenous Vangl2 localization, but remains focused on the polarity proteins themselves and not their morphological or cellular consequences. As I was already quite positive about the paper, which I found to be the clearest demonstration to date of a role for Wnts in directing epithelial PCP, I feel that it is now appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This resubmission contains all of the same data regarding the epidermal ectoderm from the first submission, unchanged except for the additional statistical analysis, plus one new figure about polarity in the neuroectoderm. As such, my opinion about the interpretive difficulties concerning the epidermal ectoderm remains unchanged. The main response of the authors was to change what they choose to say about the epidermal ectoderm data. For this part of the manuscript, the message has been changed (mostly) from the claim that a Wnt signal is instructive for planar polarization, to the well justified statement that a Wnt signal can be instructive for planar polarization.</p><p>The new data concern a separate and possibly distinct planar polarization event, so it is not clear how this is supposed to support the findings in the first four figures as opposed to representing a different example. This new data, which was presumably added to address concerns about a true loss of function phenotype, demonstrates that Wnt11b is required for planar polarity of Vangl2 in the neuroectoderm. On the other hand, it does not show that this signal works at a distance, since descendants of the 8 ventral blastomeres into which the MO was injected contribute to the neural plate, and expression of Wnt11b, perhaps at a low level, throughout the neural plate is not ruled out. On the other hand, they do show that ectopic Wnt5a can non-autonomously repolarize neural plate over several cell diameters. They acknowledge that this might occur by either paracrine signaling and propagation, or by graded signaling of the ligand. Concerning this new data, the authors are a bit more circumspect, but shockingly, the final conclusion of the paper again incorrectly claims that Wnt's <italic>are</italic> instructive for PCP: &quot;Whereas our results demonstrate the instructive role of Wnt proteins in PCP…&quot;</p><p>If we conflate the three different paradigms (ectodermal ectoderm, Wnt11b in neural ectoderm and Wnt5a in neural ectoderm), the data would probably make the best argument yet that a Wnt signal acts instructively to determine PCP, the main weaknesses being that the localized expression of Wnt needs to be more carefully examined, and one would like to see gain and loss of function for the same Wnt (or combination of Wnts) in the same tissue. However, I don't feel it's sufficiently rigorous to combine these systems to come to a conclusion as important as the claim that a Wnt IS instructive for PCP.</p><p>If the authors wish to try to produce a more definitive conclusion, I'd advise them to build a careful analysis of Wnt11b in the neural plate, and not just add the minimal data presented here as an addendum. If they wish to moderate their overall conclusion to Wnts <italic>can</italic> instruct planar polarity (two misleading statements would need to be changed, see below), that would be well supported by the data provided. This course would require a somewhat detailed discussion of the distinction between these conclusions. On the other hand, that would be a far less novel result, and one could debate whether it would be of sufficient impact for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The two unjustified statements:</p><p>&quot;Based on these experiments, Wnt5a appears to act as an instructive cue for Pk3 polarization.&quot;</p><p>This implies that this is what it normally does.</p><p>&quot;Whereas our results demonstrate the instructive role of Wnt proteins in PCP, whether such function involves mechanical or chemical signaling remains to be clarified in future studies.&quot;</p><p>This is clearly not supported by the present data.</p><p>It's also relevant to comment on one of the responses that the authors provided in the rebuttal.</p><p>&quot;Several lines of evidence argue for Wnt proteins acting on ectodermal PCP over a long distance during vertebrate gastrulation. First, the effect of ectopic Wnt proteins on the GFP-Pk3/Vangl2 complex is detectable across many cell diameters.&quot;</p><p>So too is clonal knockdown of fz in a fly wing detected several cell diameters away. But this would still clearly be a paracrine signal that is then propagated via other means beyond the clone border. This is therefore not strong evidence for a direct long range action of a ligand.</p><p>&quot;Second, Wnt5a can reorient endogenous Vangl2, which is normally polarized throughout the neuroectoderm along the anteroposterior axis (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>).&quot;</p><p>Doesn't address the paracrine vs. long range issue.</p><p>&quot;Third, Wnt11b depletion in the posterior region of the embryo disrupts Vangl2 polarity in the neural plate (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>), supporting its role in long-range anteroposterior PCP.&quot;</p><p>This may be the strongest argument, but still the experimental design is flawed (as noted above), as the vegetal blastomeres of eight cell embryos contribute to neural plate, so the knockdown is presumably distributed throughout the region, and local expression is not ruled out. The authors therefore correctly state &quot;Nevertheless, currently we cannot discriminate between long-range diffusion and local effects of Wnt proteins propagated by a signal relay system or cell division (Alexandre et al., 2014; Farin et al., 2016; Zecca et al., 1996).&quot;</p><p>Finally, if the authors wish to build a case around Wnt11b. How do they reconcile their story with &quot;Wnt11 has been argued to act permissively in convergent extension during zebrafish gastrulation (Heisenberg et al., 2000)&quot;? Of course, then one is comparing fish and frogs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16463.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All of the reviewers were impressed with the importance of your work.

The evidence presented here that this is the case in the gastrula stage ectoderm is as good as any in any system so far, which is to say intriguing, but not entirely compelling. It has been clear for some time that Wnts can direct polarity. The key question is whether they do direct polarity, and it is here that this study, like several previous ones, falls just short of being entirely convincing. I'm on the fence about whether the arguments presented here warrant publication in a leading journal, but at a minimum there are several things that should be done to shore up the argument.</italic> </p><p><italic>The interaction between Pk3 and Vangl2 is consistent with our understanding of PCP signaling and is not particularly novel, and the deletion analysis to identify required Pk3 domains is a bit of a distraction. Why Vangl2 should be limiting for Pk3 localization at these stages is an interesting and more puzzling question in light of recently published results. The failure to observe asymmetry of exogenous Pk3-GFP if endogenous Pk3 is asymmetrically localized is best explained if the Pk3-GFP is present in large excess, so that asymmetry that would otherwise be evident is swamped out by randomly localized and unassociated Pk3. The less interesting possibility is that endogenous Pk3 is not localized asymmetrically, but can be induced to do so in the presence of the necessary other players.</italic> </p><p><italic>This contrasts with results from Butler and Wallingford, who showed that Pk2, Vangl1 and Dvl1 all localize asymmetrically when independently expressed at later stages. The puzzle here is the contrasting dynamics. Butler's results suggest a much later acquisition of polarity, as their probes were symmetric as late as stage 19, and only subsequently showed increasing asymmetry by the time of MCC differentiation. From these results, we would infer that there is little or no activity of the PCP components at the gastrula stage.</italic> </p><p><italic>If that is the case, this raises the question of whether the authors are examining what is essentially the potential to polarize, or in other words, a synthetic polarization that can be created by expressing needed components (and that can then perhaps respond to endogenous or exogenous Wnt's), but that doesn't reflect an endogenous polarization that normally occurs. For example, we have no evidence that Pk3 is needed for this polarity, and there is no independent readout of polarization. In the GRP, Pk3 is normally at the basal bodies, though it can be induced to apicolateral asymmetry, and its role and localization in radial intercalation of MCCs (Sokol lab) are both potentially consistent with different mechanisms. Given these observations, it is plausible that the authors have created a synthetic PCP system that can respond to Wnt's, but that doesn't normally exist. The authors offer no other readout for PCP at this time.</italic> </p><p>As the referee acknowledges in the next paragraph, our data are consistent with the observations of Chien et al., 2015, arguing for the existence of PCP at late gastrula stages. At present, we have no explanation for the discrepancy between our findings and those of Butler and Wallingford (2015). This could be due to the functional difference between PCP proteins or the difference in developmental stages. We argue that Pk3 is a relevant PCP protein, based on its expression analysis and its requirement for Vangl2 polarity and ciliogenesis (Chu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). Moreover, our new experiments that assess endogenous Vangl2 in the neuroectoderm provide further support to our claim that the distribution of GFP-Pk3 reflects endogenous PCP (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>).</p><p><italic>On the other hand, asymmetry, or at least asymmetric activity, of Vangl2, Celsr1, Fzd3 was inferred by FRAP at this time by Chien et al. (although these assays also required the co-expression of exogenous components), and this was associated with polarized apical microtubules. However, these authors concluded that tissue strain provided the directionality to polarization, in contrast to the current contention that Wnt signaling directs polarization. If Chien et al. are correct, it may be that microtubules determine the direction of the PCP orientation, as opposed to being responsive to PCP protein polarization. Furthermore, these authors showed that microtubule orientation is responsive to strain, which might be providing the directional signal. If the authors suggest that microtubules are reading Wnt dependent polarity, it would stretch the imagination to conceive that strain reorganizes the pattern of Wnt expression. A more harmonious conclusion would be that if Wnt's are involved, they are involved in local cell to cell signaling rather than long range signaling.</italic> </p><p><italic>Therefore, whether PCP signaling normally occurs, what if anything it is doing, and the upstream directional signal are not entirely established. Furthermore, Pk3 may or may not be involved, though even if not, it could be a legitimate marker of PCP.</italic> </p><p><italic>The relevance of the Pk3/Vangl2 complex as a PCP marker in reading a Wnt signal would be bolstered if the authors could show that the polarized microtubules observed at this time depend on Pk3 or Vangl2. Even better, the authors should look at microtubules in their loss and gain of function experiments to determine their potential responsiveness to these inputs. If microtubules reorganize in response to Wnt's, they should then demonstrate that the requirement for normal microtubule orientation, proposed to be Wnt dependent, is lost upon knockdown of PCP components. If microtubules do not depend on Wnt endogenous or exogenous Wnt signals, then I would not feel confident that endogenous PCP signaling is occurring at gastrula stages.</italic> </p><p>The results of Chien et al. do not exclude a role for Wnt signaling in the establishment of PCP. Consistent with their report, either Wnt11b or other Wnts that are present at the vegetal/posterior pole may be responsible for the tension produced by the blastopore ring during gastrulation. Alternatively, one can envisage that both mechanical forces and Wnt signaling provide input to PCP.Our additional analysis of microtubule orientation in gastrula ectoderm cells does not support the idea that Wnt5a orients Pk3/Vangl2 complexes by regulating microtubule alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). More detailed studies are required to elucidate the relationship between Wnt signaling and mechanical strains during gastrulation, which is beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p><italic>Based on the currently provided results, the authors' statement &quot;In this study, we use the complex of Pk3 and Vangl2 as a sensor of epidermal PCP to demonstrate that the polarity of this complex is directly defined by Wnt ligands during gastrulation&quot; should instead say: &quot;the polarity of this complex CAN BE directly defined by…&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We amended our statement as suggested by the referee.</p><p><italic>Another important concern is the conclusion that can or cannot be drawn from the methods used to interfere with endogenous Wnt signaling. As discussed above, these are critical to the distinction between CAN and DO. The mechanisms by which the Fz8ECD and the dominant negative Wnt's act is not certain. While they may bind and block Wnt activity, it is also hypothesized that PCP involves direct interaction between Fz and Vangl proteins, and these reagents could potentially interfere with such an interaction to disrupt PCP. The authors could potentially address this concern if they could show that RNAi of the suspect Wnt's, either alone or simultaneously, would disrupt asymmetry of their PCP markers.</italic> </p><p>We used multiple Wnt antagonists including Ror2-TM, a construct interfering with Ror2 function, and tried to avoid overstating our conclusions. Prompted by the referee, we knocked down candidate <italic>wnt5a</italic> and <italic>wnt11b</italic> gene functions with previously characterized morpholino oligonucleotides. Depletion of Wnt11b disrupted Vangl2 polarity, supporting its role in PCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Despite this promising observation, we feel that further analysis of the requirement of Wnt ligands in PCP is beyond the scope of our manuscript.</p><p><italic>Last, the authors acknowledge that they don't truly distinguish between a long range Wnt signal providing a directional signal, and a paracrine signal involved in cell to cell signaling, as proposed by Adler many years ago, that would not provide a directional signal. The localized Wnt expression patterns (particularly since they are very low resolution old in situ studies) are not enough to force the former conclusion. Does this not undermine their thesis?</italic> </p><p><italic>As is, I'm left to conclude that PCP signaling might be occurring at gastrula stage, this polarization might do something that matters, and Wnt's might provide a long range signal for this polarization. It would be good to feel a little more confident.</italic> </p><p>Several lines of evidence argue for Wnt proteins acting on ectodermal PCP over a long distance during vertebrate gastrulation. First, the effect of ectopic Wnt proteins on the GFP-Pk3/Vangl2 complex is detectable across many cell diameters. Second, Wnt5a can reorient endogenous Vangl2, which is normally polarized throughout the neuroectoderm along the anteroposterior axis (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Third, Wnt11b depletion in the posterior region of the embryo disrupts Vangl2 polarity in the neural plate (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>), supporting its role in long-range anteroposterior PCP. However, given the history of the attempts to resolve this issue in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model in the past 20 years, we admit that further studies are required to determine whether Wnt proteins act locally or by diffusing over long distance in our system.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>The results presented support a role for Wnts in early PCP establishment in the Xenopus epidermis. The authors contend that this is an instructive role, and such a finding would stand in contrast to the recent report by Chien et al. (2015 Curr Biol 25, 2774-2784) that suggests mechanical cues are responsible for early PCP orientation in the Xenopus epidermis (although the authors don't make this point).</italic> </p><p>The results of Chien et al. do not exclude a role for Wnt signaling in the establishment of PCP as we also stated in our response to referee 2. Either Wnt11b or other Wnts that are present at the vegetal/posterior pole may be required for mechanical strains produced during gastrulation. Alternatively, both mechanical forces and Wnt signaling may regulate PCP by different mechanisms.</p><p><italic>However, as it stands, I think that while the authors make a case that Wnts can re-orient polarity, they do not provide good evidence that this normally happens and/or whether it happens when Wnts are expressed at physiological levels. It is equally likely that the observed results could be a dominant negative effect caused by Wnt binding to a Fzd CRD domain and blocking interactions with Vangl, similar to what Wu et al. 2013 see in Drosophila upon Wnt over expression.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors need better evidence to convince me that they have made any advance upon the previous view that Wnts might only play a permissive role in this context.</italic> </p><p>Our new loss-of-function experiments demonstrate the involvement of Wnt11b in establishing anteroposterior PCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>), supporting the idea that Wnt-dependent PCP happens normally in vivo. Moreover, the activity of ectopic Wnt5a in our experiments is comparable to that of the endogenous cue that leads to Vangl2 polarity in the neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>), but the physiological levels of active Wnt proteins are hard to assess. Although the referee suggested that Wnt5a acts in our experiments by blocking Frizzled-Vangl2 interaction, we consider it unlikely, because the extracellular domain of Frizzled 8 (ECD8), which is expected to compete with Frizzled for Vangl2 binding, did not orient the Pk3/Vangl2 complexes like Wnt5a did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This point has been added to the amended discussion. Overall, we argue for the instructive role of Wnts in PCP based on the ability of Wnt5a-expressing clones to orient the Pk3/Vangl2 complex regardless of their position relative to the body axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This model is further supported by the effect of ectopic Wnt5a on endogenous Vangl2 in the neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>).</p><p><italic>Other major comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) This is not the first evidence for instructive role of Wnts in vertebrates, as Wnt5a has previously been shown to have an instructive role in the mouse limb bud, in a study that also impressively showed direct evidence of a Wnt-induced activity gradient (Gao et al. (2011) Dev Cell 20, 163-176).</italic> </p><p>Gao et al. (2011) visualized graded polarization of Vangl2 in the mouse limb and have demonstrated its disruption in Wnt5a -/- embryos. Although the authors propose an instructive role for Wnt5a, this hypothesis has not been supported by an in vivo gain-of-function assay, such as the one provided by our study.</p><p><italic>2) Although the &quot;fluorescent sensor for planar polarity in Xenopus&quot; may be new (as indicated in the &quot;Impact statement&quot;), it is not really novel for a GFP fusion to be used to reveal polarity, as even in Xenopus this has been previously demonstrated (Butler and Wallingford (2015) Development 142, 3429-3439).</italic> </p><p>We agree that fluorescent GFP fusions are common tools for cell polarity studies. Nevertheless, we wish to emphasize that our constructs are the first to reveal PCP in early non-neural ectoderm. The sentence noted by the referee has been rephrased to clarify the meaning.</p><p><italic>3) A structure-function dissection of Pk3 domains required for polarization is described, without any reference to the similar results for Pk2 described in Butler et al. 2015.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for inadvertently omitting this reference. This point has now been corrected.</p><p><italic>I'm also concerned about how much can be concluded if endogenous protein is not first removed in a structure-function experiment like this.</italic></p><p>Since we know little about how Pk3 is polarized, our initial observations may be useful even in the presence of endogenous Pk3. Future studies are needed to study the role of endogenous Pk3 and other Prickle family members in PCP.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>We would like to encourage you to make some additional text modifications to the manuscript that addresses the specific issues raised in the two reviews below – especially the issues raised by reviewer #2.

In response to the criticism that their gain-of-function experiments show that Wnt signaling CAN direct planar polarity but not that it DOES direct endogenous polarity, they include new data showing that the polarization of endogenous Vangl2 is altered by localized WNT overexpression, and that morpholino knockdown of Wnt11b eliminates endogenous Vangl2 polarization. This, combined with the gain-of-function data showing that Wnt expressing cells can repolarize Vangl2 and Pk3 over several cell diameters, is compelling evidence for a role for Wnts in orienting PCP in the frog gastrula non-neural ectoderm. On the other hand, the authors tried but failed to detect polarization of any sub-cellular structure apart from PCP core components themselves. They argue that microtubule or centrosomal asymmetry may be a much later consequence of PCP, not detectable at these early stages. They have also addressed some relatively minor comments I had about quantification of the data. In sum, the paper is improved by demonstrating a requirement for Wnts in endogenous Vangl2 localization, but remains focused on the polarity proteins themselves and not their morphological or cellular consequences. As I was already quite positive about the paper, which I found to be the clearest demonstration to date of a role for Wnts in directing epithelial PCP, I feel that it is now appropriate for publication in eLife.</italic> </p><p>The seventh paragraph of the Results and Discussion described our experiments that attempted to document morphological consequences of Wnt-dependent PCP. So far, these experiments remain inconclusive. To acknowledge this deficiency, we introduced the following sentence in the last but one paragraph of the discussion. “Although our results demonstrate that Wnt proteins can instruct Pk3 polarization in our specific experimental conditions, the immediate morphological manifestations of this activity remain obscure”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This resubmission contains all of the same data regarding the epidermal ectoderm from the first submission, unchanged except for the additional statistical analysis, plus one new figure about polarity in the neuroectoderm. As such, my opinion about the interpretive difficulties concerning the epidermal ectoderm remains unchanged. The main response of the authors was to change what they choose to say about the epidermal ectoderm data. For this part of the manuscript, the message has been changed (mostly) from the claim that a Wnt signal is instructive for planar polarization, to the well justified statement that a Wnt signal can be instructive for planar polarization.</italic> </p><p><italic>The new data concern a separate and possibly distinct planar polarization event, so it is not clear how this is supposed to support the findings in the first four figures as opposed to representing a different example. This new data, which was presumably added to address concerns about a true loss of function phenotype, demonstrates that Wnt11b is required for planar polarity of Vangl2 in the neuroectoderm. On the other hand, it does not show that this signal works at a distance, since descendants of the 8 ventral blastomeres into which the MO was injected contribute to the neural plate, and expression of Wnt11b, perhaps at a low level, throughout the neural plate is not ruled out. On the other hand, they do show that ectopic Wnt5a can non-autonomously repolarize neural plate over several cell diameters. They acknowledge that this might occur by either paracrine signaling and propagation, or by graded signaling of the ligand. Concerning this new data, the authors are a bit more circumspect, but shockingly, the final conclusion of the paper again incorrectly claims that Wnt's are instructive for PCP: &quot;Whereas our results demonstrate the instructive role of Wnt proteins in PCP…&quot;</italic></p><p><italic>If we conflate the three different paradigms (ectodermal ectoderm, Wnt11b in neural ectoderm and Wnt5a in neural ectoderm), the data would probably make the best argument yet that a Wnt signal acts instructively to determine PCP, the main weaknesses being that the localized expression of Wnt needs to be more carefully examined, and one would like to see gain and loss of function for the same Wnt (or combination of Wnts) in the same tissue. However, I don't feel it's sufficiently rigorous to combine these systems to come to a conclusion as important as the claim that a Wnt IS instructive for PCP.</italic> </p><p><italic>If the authors wish to try to produce a more definitive conclusion, I'd advise them to build a careful analysis of Wnt11b in the neural plate, and not just add the minimal data presented here as an addendum. If they wish to moderate their overall conclusion to Wnts can instruct planar polarity (two misleading statements would need to be changed, see below), that would be well supported by the data provided. This course would require a somewhat detailed discussion of the distinction between these conclusions. On the other hand, that would be a far less novel result, and one could debate whether it would be of sufficient impact for eLife.</italic> </p><p><italic>The two unjustified statements:</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;Based on these experiments, Wnt5a appears to act as an instructive cue for Pk3 polarization.&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>This implies that this is what it normally does.</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;Whereas our results demonstrate the instructive role of Wnt proteins in PCP, whether such function involves mechanical or chemical signaling remains to be clarified in future studies.&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>This is clearly not supported by the present data.</italic> </p><p>In the Discussion, we did not mean to imply that Wnt signals are proven to act instructively.

This alternative interpretation is fully compatible with our observations. This explanation was introduced into revised Discussion (last paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
